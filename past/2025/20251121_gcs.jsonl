It was the busiest ...", "text": "AI-assisted summary President Trump deployed the National Guard to Washington, D.C., to combat crime in the city.\n\nTrump also deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in June in response to immigration protests.\n\nJune 2025 saw the highest number of protests in a single month since June 2020.\n\nPresident Donald Trump received widespread backlash for his decision to deploy the National Guard in Washington, D.C., but it isn't the first time the move has stoked controversy in this term.\n\nFollowing a high profile assault on a 19-year-old former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee known as \"BigBalls,\" Trump announced his administration would take control of the Metropolitan Police Department and ordered 800 members of the guard to the nation's capital. In June, protests against widespread immigration arrests and raids prompted Trump to send the National Guard to Los Angeles, California.\n\nTrump said the guardsmen were sent to quell mostly peaceful protests, but he did so without the governor's consent or invitation. That was shortlybefore the \"No Kings\" protests that popped up on Trump's birthday all over the country, and organizers predicted Trump's militarized response in LA, which also included deploying marines in the city, would inspire more protesters.\n\nIt ended up being the busiest protest month since 2020. Here is what to know:\n\nAre people protesting more than usual? 'Jaw-dropping' number planned on Trump’s birthday\n\nWhy did Trump deploy the National Guard in DC?\n\nTrump said he was taking over Washington, D.C., to address crime and homelessness, despite the fact that violent crime is down 26% in 2025 compared with last year. He deployed hundreds of National Guard troops and also moved to put the Metropolitan Police Department under control of the Department of Justice.\n\nTrump does have special authority to deploy the National Guard in D.C., and he did so in 2020 as well.\n\n\"We're not going to lose our cities over this. This will go further. We're starting very strongly with D.C.,\" Trump said, adding that he may set his sights on other cities like Chicago in the future.\n\nThe move drew harsh criticism from Democrats across the country.\n\n\"Violent crime in D.C. is at its lowest level in 30 years. We had an unacceptable spike in 2023, so we changed our laws and strategies,\" Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a televised community meeting on Aug. 12. \"Now, crime levels are not only down from 2023, but from before the pandemic. Our tactics are working, and we aren’t taking our foot off the gas.\"\n\nOn Aug. 15, the District of Columbia sued the administration in an attempt to halt Trump's police takeover. The DOJ previously declined to comment.\n\nJune was the busiest month of protesting since 2020\n\nProtests in the first half of the year were already trending higher than the first months of previous administrations before Trump sent the military in to largely peaceful protests in Los Angeles in early June. Dave Clark, a professor of political science at Binghamton University who collected global mass mobilization data, previously said the militarized response to protests could make a difference.\n\n\"I would say that using the military for civil control is the wild card here,\" he said in June, explaining there is little relevant precedent for it in the U.S. \"In many cases, the move to authoritarian kinds of tactics will actually bring out more protesters.\"\n\nDays later, people across the country participated in the \"No Kings\" protests that happened on Trump's 79th birthday and the day of the Army's 250th anniversary parade in D.C.\n\nData from the Crowd Counting Consortium, a joint project between the Harvard Kennedy School and the University of Connecticut, show the first five months of this year have seen more protests than the first years of former President Joe Biden's term and Trump's first term. The consortium project collects publicly available information from political crowds in the U.S. at marches, protests, riots and more.\n\nThe data also shows June 2025 saw more than 4,600 protests, the most in a calendar month since June 2020 when nearly 7,500 protests happened around the country following the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nClark noted the data from protests after June 1 show a trend of objecting to \"heavy handed\" tactics, with the titles, notes and claims included in the data showing words like \"militarized,\" \"police state\" and \"sweep.\"\n\nTrump warned people who planned to protest against the district takeover that they, too, would be met with heavy force.\n\n\"You spit and we hit,\" he said at his Aug. 11 press briefing.\n\nAre National Guard still in Los Angeles?\n\nTrump has pulled back all but a few hundred National Guard members it sent to Los Angeles.\n\nCalifornia sued the Trump administration after Trump deployed 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles amid the immigration arrest protests. Gov. Gavin Newsom has argued the deployment was an unlawful use of the military, according to Reuters.\n\nA multi-day trial took place ending Aug. 13, Reuters reported, and a ruling is expected in the coming weeks.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen, Joey Garrison, Trevor Hughes, Michael Loria, Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

In Portland, Oregon, masked officers clashed with protesters wearing inflatable animal costumes. In the nation's capital, police set up checkpoints and troops patrolled the streets.\n\nSince early June, President Donald Trump has surged federal resources into a growing number of Democratic-led cities as part of a widening crackdown on illegal immigration and violent crime.\n\nThe deployments have sparked intense backlash, a dizzying number of legal battles and upended daily life in communities flooded with federal agents and National Guard troops.\n\nThe Trump administration says the added resources are needed to service the president’s mass deportation campaign and clamp down on violence in liberal cities. Critics, including state and local officials, say the deployments are an illegal show of force and a power grab.\n\nAcross the country, federal operations have taken different forms, shaped by levels of cooperation between federal and local officials, protests over heightened immigration enforcement and the scale of the operations themselves.\n\nIn several cities, immigration raids touched off a wave of demonstrations, prompting Trump to call up National Guard troops. In others, federal agents worked closely with local police to target crime more broadly, setting up roving patrols and checkpoints. One major commonality: The cities all experienced a surge in immigration enforcement.\n\nReporters across the USA TODAY Network spoke with experts, residents, officials and local advocates to capture the impact of federal intervention in U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis, Portland and Chicago – a short list that seems likely to grow as the president eyes deployments to other cities.\n\nMany residents and local officials said the cities didn't need intervention, especially a deployment of troops. Some living in crime-stricken areas said while they generally support the idea of more law enforcement in their communities, they want the operations to target violent crimes – not immigration violations.\n\nExperts, meanwhile, said targeted police work is the most effective way to lower crime and worry that the federal government's flood-the-zone tactics, both in immigration enforcement and general crimefighting, could erode public trust in police.\n\n“Aggressive enforcement needs to be reserved for the most aggressive criminals,” said Thomas Abt, director of the Center for the Study and Practice of Violence Reduction. He added that broad, heavy-handed policing has “limited benefits and a lot of collateral consequences.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson hailed the president's efforts and said local leaders across the country should take inspiration and \"clean up their city.\"\n\n\"Making America Safe Again – especially crime-ridden cities – was a key campaign promise from the President that the American people elected him to fulfill,\" Jackson said in a statement.\n\nChicago: Intensifying ICE raids and widespread protests\n\nThe nation’s third-largest city has become the latest flashpoint in the battle between local officials and the Trump administration over the president's deportation campaign and federal deployments.\n\nIn September, Trump launched Operation Midway Blitz, an initiative he said was needed to catch \"the worst of the worst\" criminal immigrants. Research has shown that, on average, immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Further, immigration violations, such as living in the country without proper documentation, are civil, not criminal, under U.S. law.\n\nExpanding Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids triggered protests in downtown Chicago and the city's surrounding suburbs. As tensions boiled, clashes broke out and federal agents used pepper balls and tear gas, hitting journalists, a pastor and officers with the Chicago Police Department, according to reports and a lawsuit.\n\nThe president called for the arrests of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for “failing to protect” ICE agents.\n\nResidents and local advocates have accused ICE of employing reckless and brutal tactics during the blitz. Some incidents that have raised alarm: Immigration agents fatally shot a Mexican immigrant accused of resisting arrest; a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a U.S. citizen on the city’s South Side; and, reportedly, a school had to hold recess indoors after federal authorities deployed a chemical agent nearby.\n\nThe most controversial raid came on Sept. 30, when federal agents descended from Black Hawk helicopters and ransacked a South Side apartment building in an aggressive search of apartments inhabited by Venezuelan migrants.\n\nTwo of 37 people arrested were “confirmed” gang members, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Dozens of U.S. citizens were pulled from their beds and temporarily zip-tied during the operation, which Pritzker wants investigated by state agencies.\n\nDHS officials say aggressive tactics are necessary to catch criminals, and accused protesters of attacking agents and \"rioting.\" Over 1,500 immigrants have been arrested in connection with the blitz, the agency said. USA TODAY has not been able to verify the number of detentions or the criminal background of those in custody.\n\nChicagoans said the federal intervention has made their neighborhoods virtually unrecognizable.\n\n\"We went from being this community that walks our kids to school or goes out to parks. Now the streets are empty,\" said Corina Pedraza, a longtime South Sider.\n\nLocal alderwoman Julia Ramirez told USA TODAY that people \"can't live their lives the way they did before.\"\n\n\"Agents have created a war zone in our community,\" she said.\n\nPortland, Oregon: Tensions flare at ICE facility\n\n“War ravaged,” “burning to the ground” and “hell” are words Trump has used to describe the liberal stronghold of Portland in recent weeks – characterizations vehemently disputed by local residents and officials.\n\nThe back-and-forth comes as the president seeks to deploy troops to the city over the objections of local and state officials. A federal judge in Oregon initially blocked the deployments, but an appeals court on Oct. 20 ruled in Trump’s favor, lifting one of the orders preventing the president from calling up 200 Oregon guardsmen to Portland.\n\nTrump officials say soldiers are necessary to protect federal personnel and an ICE facility in South Portland, where demonstrators have protested on a nightly basis.\n\nOutside the facility earlier this month, USA TODAY reporters saw demonstrators peacefully protesting. There were people in puffy animal costumes dancing on the sidewalk and waving signs as motorists drove by, honking in support. Other forms of resistance have had a distinctly Portland vibe, such as an “emergency” naked bike ride in mid-October.\n\nCity residents said Trump’s characterization of Portland as a city “under siege” is false and misleading.\n\n“It offends me so deeply that we have a president that is willing and able to spread such misinformation without hitting the streets and coming out here,” said Tiana Stewart, 37, a bartender. “But he knows that the people who are watching are going to buy into it. It’s ludicrous to me.”\n\nPortland is not without its problems. Homeless camps are visible in parts of the city and drug use, especially the surge of fentanyl, is a serious concern that prompted officials to declare a 90-day state of emergency last year. But residents said they don’t think the president’s crackdown is meant to address those issues.\n\n“Obviously, this is all a scam,” said Curtis Best, 70, a retired molecular biologist. “I really believe it’s a way to militarize police and make problems in these cities … I think he just wants revenge on us. I think he just doesn't like Democrat cities, Democrat states, or its people.”\n\nMemphis: A crime-stricken city flooded with feds. Is it helping?\n\nUnlike other cities where Trump deployed National Guard troops, Memphis sits in a state led by a Republican governor who has welcomed the president’s wishes to mobilize military forces.\n\nIn September, Trump created a crime-fighting task force involving over a dozen federal agencies and the state's National Guard – a move he said was requested by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee.\n\nA week after troops were seen patrolling downtown Memphis on Oct. 10, a group of Democratic officials filed a lawsuit against Lee, claiming the deployment violated the state constitution. A judge has since denied the plaintiffs’ request to pause the deployment.\n\nIn 2024, Memphis had the highest rate of murder and other violent crimes of any large American city, according to a USA TODAY analysis of FBI data from 30 cities with more than 500,000 residents.\n\nMemphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, said he's working to steer the task force to focus on violent offenders, rather than immigration enforcement.\n\n\"The busier we can keep them with (the Memphis Police Department), the less time they will have to focus on immigration,\" he said at a town hall on Oct. 20.\n\nOfficials have given conflicting portrayals of the task force's work so far.\n\nThe White House says the task force has yielded 1,300 arrests related to outstanding warrants, drugs and firearms. But a county mayor and local advocates say a large portion of the arrests were for immigration offenses, not violent crime.\n\nMauricio Calvo, president and CEO of advocacy organization Latino Memphis, said some people have shut themselves in their homes because of the heightened immigration enforcement and concerns over racial profiling.\n\n“People don’t want to send the kids to school, people don’t want to work,” he said. “We’re in crisis mode.\"\n\nWashington, DC: Mixed feelings on Trump's crime crackdown\n\nTrump declared a “crime emergency” in the nation’s capital on Aug. 11, using its status as a federal district to take control of the city’s police department and send in thousands of federal agents and National Guard troops.\n\nFor weeks, federal agents and local police set up checkpoints across the city, spurring protests. Immigration raids expanded, instilling fear as officers arrested workers and delivery drivers. Several of the city’s small homeless campsites were broken down, leading some of the homeless to enter shelters temporarily.\n\nMeanwhile, National Guard troops patrolled monuments and Metro stations, some with assault rifles. They removed graffiti, picked up trash and shoveled mulch. An internal budget viewed by USA TODAY estimated the guard deployment could cost taxpayers more than $200 million.\n\nAfter 30 days, the federal takeover of the police department ended and Trump declared the operation a success, touting a drop in reported crimes and anecdotes of people “going out to dinner where they didn’t go out for years.”\n\nThe data, though, was murky. While local police data shows a short-term dip in some reported crimes after the crackdown began – especially incidents involving firearms – crime had already been trending downward in recent years. Experts who viewed the data said it’s too soon to know if the crackdown had any significant or long-term impact on violent crime.\n\nAcross the city, residents were conflicted about the federal operation.\n\nFor 20 years, Charles Wilson has lived in Anacostia, a neighborhood with one of the highest rates of murder and violent crime in Washington. He said while he has not seen a surge of federal agents in his neighborhood, he’s noticed fewer people loitering and he doesn’t hear as many “random gunshots.”\n\n“There’s definitely been a shift, and things feel a little calmer and a little safer,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nBut Wilson also said the assertive immigration enforcement in Washington, some of which has gone viral online, \"doesn't sit well\" with him or his neighbors.\n\n\"It seems un-American and mean-spirited,\" he said.\n\nLos Angeles: Raids, protests, state of emergency\n\nLos Angeles has remained one of the central targets of Trump’s sweeping illegal immigration campaign and was the first American city where he deployed National Guard troops in his second term in office.\n\nFollowing ICE raids at a Home Depot and a clothing manufacturer in June, thousands of people took to the streets to protest. While demonstrations were contained to a few downtown blocks, they erupted into violence, with clashes breaking out between protesters and police, and reports of looting and property damage.\n\nTrump ordered 4,000 California National Guard troops and at least 500 Marines to protect federal personnel and property in the city. The move was challenged in court, and a California judge said the deployment was illegal but did not order the remaining soldiers to leave. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in September that the deployment had already cost taxpayers nearly $120 million.\n\nICE agents kept up their high pace of arrests, and in October, the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency. Local officials said the federal agency \"created a climate of fear, leading to widespread disruption in daily life and adverse impacts to our regional economy.\"\n\nOngoing immigration raids and operations across Los Angeles County – which is home to over 3 million people born outside the United States – have led to a decline in workplace attendance and strained critical services such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship, according to the board of supervisors.\n\nLupe Lopez, 69, whose family owns nine Arteagas Food Center supermarkets, told USA TODAY she’s seen a big drop in foot traffic at her family’s shop in the Hispanic neighborhood of East San Jose. The reason: Young people are buying in bulk because their parents are afraid of being outside, where they might be picked up by immigration agents.\n\n\"A lot more people are either staying closer to home or not coming out at all,” she said.\n\nChristopher Cann, Michael Loria, Suzette Hackney and Terry Collins report for USA TODAY.

Gen. Scott Sherman, the commander overseeing thousands of troops deployed by President Donald Trump to Los Angeles, said 200 Marines were tasked with protecting the Wilshire Federal Building west of downtown, freeing up National Guard troops that were assigned there ahead of weekend protests.\n\nThe Marines arrived after an appeals court allowed Trump to maintain control of California National Guard troops, temporarily blocking a federal judge's earlier ruling that found the deployment unlawful and ordered Trump to return control of the troops to Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency is carrying out a directive from Trump to find immigrants living in the United States without legal status. The aggressive crackdown has fueled anger and protests in Los Angeles and across the country, which have led to hundreds of arrests amid occasional violent clashes, vandalism and looting.\n\nAs the military presence ramped up in Los Angeles, communities large and small were preparing for what's expected to be the largest protests against Trump since he took office. The \"No Kings\" rallies planned for June 14 will take place in nearly 2,000 communities across the nation to oppose what organizers describe as \"corrupt, authoritarian politics.\"\n\nAhead of the demonstrations, the governors of Texas and Missouri signed executive orders deploying National Guard troops across their respective states. In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams on Friday said thousands of officers will be out in full force to ensure protests are kept safe and nonviolent. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said authorities are anticipating “unprecedented” crowd sizes.\n\nPhotos show first-known detention of civilian by Marines in Los Angeles\n\nMarines deployed to Los Angeles temporarily detained a civilian on Friday, the U.S. military confirmed after being presented with Reuters images, in the first known detention by active-duty troops deployed to the city.\n\nThe incident took place at the Wilshire Federal Building where Marines took charge of the mission to protect the building earlier on Friday.\n\nReuters images showed Marines apprehending a civilian, restraining his hands with zip ties and then handing him over to civilians from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAsked about the incident, the U.S. military's Northern Command spokesperson said active duty forces \"may temporarily detain an individual in specific circumstances.\"\n\n\"Any temporary detention ends immediately when the individual(s) can be safely transferred to the custody of appropriate civilian law enforcement personnel,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThe detained man Marcos Leao told reporters after he was released that he was an Army veteran on his way to an office of the Department of Veterans Affairs when he crossed a yellow tape boundary and was asked to stop.\n\nThe 27-year-old of Angolan and Portugese descent gained his U.S. citizenship through military service.\n\nMarines treated him \"very fairly,\" Leao said: \"They're just doing their job.\"\n\n– Reuters\n\nWhat are Marines doing in LA?\n\nSherman told reporters that troops in Los Angeles will \"not participate in law enforcement activities\" and will be focused on \"protecting federal law enforcement personnel.\"\n\nHe said that neither the National Guards troops nor the Marines have detained anyone, and have only \"watched federal law enforcement\" make arrests.\n\nThis week, California National Guard troops have been seen providing security during immigration raids in Southern California. It's unclear if the Marines will eventually be used to accompany U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nUnion reports raids in rural SoCal after Trump vows to protect farmers\n\nBorder Patrol agents have been seen conducting raids on farms in Ventura County, including the communities of Moorpark and Oxnard, the labor union United Farm Workers of America said in a statement on X.\n\nThe reported activity comes one day after Trump said he plans to make changes to his administration's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration to protect migrant farmers, hotel workers and others who have recently faced raids, detentions and deportations.\n\n\"Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\" Trump wrote on social media, adding: \"This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\"\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency has not confirmed whether raids were conducted in Ventura County.\n\nMexico's president urges US to avoid immigration action at LA soccer game\n\nMEXICO CITY — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Friday urged U.S. authorities not to conduct immigration enforcement targeting attendees of a soccer match in Los Angeles on Saturday between Mexico and the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe match marks the start of the Gold Cup, a tournament of North American national teams including the United States and Central American countries with sizable migrant populations in the U.S. The American squad plays Trinidad and Tobago in San Jose, California, on Sunday.\n\nSheinbaum’s comments follow a now-deleted post to social media from U.S. Customs and Border Protection where the agency promised to be \"suited and booted\" at the first round of the Club World Cup, a tournament that includes Real Madrid of Spain and Inter Miami of the United States. The first game is in Miami on Saturday.\n\n\"We don't believe that at any soccer match there will be any (immigration) action... we call for none to be taken by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\" Sheinbaum said in her morning press conference.\n\nThe CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead more about ICE and the upcoming soccer matches here.\n\n– Reuters\n\nLAPD arrest nearly 50 people during protests Thursday night\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department arrested 49 people during demonstrations on Thursday, June 12, that saw officers fire non-lethal munitions and enforce a curfew in a section of downtown.\n\nMost of the arrests were for failure to disperse or curfew violations, the department said in a post on X. Three people faced more serious charges, including robbery, resisting a police officer and pointing a laser at an airship.\n\nHundreds of people have been arrested at protests across California since unrest over immigration raids broke out on Friday, June 6.\n\n4 detainees escape New Jersey migrant facility Delaney Hall\n\nAuthorities are searching for at least four people who escaped the Delaney Hall migrant facility in New Jersey where complaints over conditions fueled several days of unrest that erupted on Thursday, June 12.\n\n\"DHS has become aware of 4 detainees at the privately held Delaney Hall Detention Facility escaping,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY. \"Additional law enforcement partners have been brought in to find these escapees and a BOLO (be on the lookout bulletin) has been disseminated.\"\n\nSeveral immigration rights groups said detainees protested over insufficient food and other poor conditions at the facility. Unrest fueled a large law enforcement response on Thursday, and groups said there were reports of agents deploying tear gas and pepper spray.\n\nMissouri joins Texas, deploys National Guard ahead of 'No Kings' protests\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed an executive order activating the National Guard \"as a precautionary measure in reaction to recent instances of civil unrest across the country.\"\n\nThe move makes Kehoe the second governor to take such a step after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott earlier this week deployed National Guard troops across the state ahead of planned protests against immigration enforcement and what organizers see as Trump's power grab.\n\nBoth Republican-led states have already seen protests this week. A demonstration in Austin, Texas, began peacefully before devolving into violent clashes between police and demonstrators, ending with 13 arrests and multiple injuries to law enforcement. In St. Louis, dozens of protesters rallied peacefully on an overpass, calling for a stop to immigration raids.\n\nAmericans split over Trump's military deployment in LA protests: poll\n\nAmericans are divided on Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles in reaction to protests over his administration's immigration enforcement, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll has found.\n\nSome 48% of respondents agreed with a statement that the president should \"deploy the military to bring order to the streets\" when protests turn violent, while 41% disagreed. Republicans overwhelmingly backed the idea of calling in troops while Democrats were firmly opposed.\n\nMeanwhile, just 35% of respondents said they approved of Trump's response to the protests in Los Angeles. Some 50% of people in the poll said they disapproved of Trump's response.\n\n– Reuters\n\nLatino groups blast forced removal of US senator from Noem event\n\nThe League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and other national Latino organizations condemned the forceful removal of Democratic U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s news conference in Los Angeles on Thursday. LULAC, which is the oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization in the United States, has demanded an immediate investigation into the incident.\n\nVideos showed Padilla being forced to the ground and handcuffed after trying to ask a question during the news conference, where Noem was discussing the protests over federal immigration raids. In a video statement released Thursday night, Padilla said he had been escorted to the news conference by a National Guardsman and an FBI agent after waiting for another scheduled briefing.\n\n\"Now, I'm OK for people who are wondering how I'm doing,\" Padilla, who is from California, added. \"But the big lesson here is if they can do that to me ... what are they doing to a lot of the folks that are out there when the cameras are not on?\"\n\nIn a statement on X, Noem said she met with Padilla for 15 minutes after his removal from the news conference and added that the pair exchanged phone numbers and intend to speak further. \"I wish he would’ve acted that way in the beginning rather than creating a scene,\" she said.\n\nWalmart heiress promotes anti-Trump 'No Kings' protests in ad\n\nBillionaire Walmart heiress Christy Walton took out a full-page advertisement in the New York Times urging people to join nationwide protests against the Trump administration on Saturday, June 14, drawing swift condemnation from Trump supporters.\n\nThe advertisement, which ran on Sunday, encourages readers to take to the streets as part of the some 2,000 demonstrations planned across the country. The “No Kings Day” protests are expected to be the largest demonstrations against Trump since he took office, and also coincide with Trump’s military parade in Washington.\n\nWalmart sought to distance itself from the advertisement placed by one of the richest women in America. “The advertisements from Christy Walton are in no way connected to or endorsed by Walmart,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nUnrest at Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey, draws law enforcement response\n\nAn immigration detention facility in New Jersey, where at least two officials were arrested last month, became the site of unrest on Thursday, June 12, triggering a large law enforcement response.\n\nSeveral immigration rights groups said detainees protested over insufficient food and other poor conditions at Delaney Hall, the first immigrant detention center to open during President Donald Trump's second term. Regarding the law enforcement response, groups said there were reports of agents deploying tear gas and pepper spray.\n\nOfficials have not provided details about the incident. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a critic of the facility who was arrested in front of it on May 9, said in a statement that he is concerned about reports of what has happened at the Delaney Hall “from withholding food and poor treatment, to uprising and escaped detainees.”\n\n“This entire situation lacks sufficient oversight of every basic detail — including local zoning laws and fundamental constitutional rights,” he said on X. “We must put an end to this chaos and not allow this operation to continue unchecked.\"\n\n10 arrested in Portland as protests spread nationwide\n\nA week after protests began in Los Angeles, more anti-ICE demonstrations have sprung up in cities nationwide in solidarity with LA protesters. Protests have been reported in San Francisco, New York, Washington, Boston, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta and many more.\n\nIn Portland, authorities said overnight that 10 people were arrested for their alleged behavior during a protest outside an ICE facility the evening of June 12. The 10 arrested ranged in ages from 19 to 33 and were booked on charges that included arson, disorderly conduct and assault on an officer.\n\nTwo officers had minor injuries, the Portland Police Bureau said.\n\nWhat have courts said about federalization of the National Guard?\n\nIn its order temporarily allowing Trump to maintain his control over the National Guard, the appeals court did not issue a final ruling but delivered what's called an \"administrative stay.\" It gave the appeals judges time to consider Trump's request to block Breyer's order. The appeals court was made up of a panel of three judges, two of which were appointed by Trump and one by former President Joe Biden.\n\nA hearing was scheduled for the appeals court on Tuesday, June 17 at noon.\n\nBreyer, the federal judge who ruled Trump's deployment of the Guard was unlawful, issued just hours before the appeals court ruling a 36-page decision in which he said the president's actions were illegal and a violation of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution. Breyer was appointed in 1997 by former Democratic President Bill Clinton and is the brother of retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.\n\nBreyer wrote he was \"troubled by the implication inherent in Defendants’ argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion,\" responding to the Trump administration's justification for sending in the National Guard.\n\n\"(T)here can be no debate that most protesters demonstrated peacefully,\" the judge said.\n\nCurfew for parts of downtown Los Angeles\n\nFollowing days of protests in Los Angeles, which were mostly confined to parts of the city's downtown area, a partial curfew remained in effect for the third consecutive night. The curfew, lasting from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. PT for pockets of downtown Los Angeles, was implemented on Tuesday.\n\n“My hope is after continuing it a few more days, that people will get the message that we are serious,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said at a Thursday news conference.\n\nShortly before the curfew went into effect on Thursday night, the Los Angeles Police Department’s Central Division reported people in a crowd throwing bricks, concrete, and commercial-grade fireworks.\n\n\"Less lethal munitions have been authorized,\" LAPD said in a post on X at about 7:55 p.m. local time.\n\nPlanned 'No Kings' protests for June 14 grow\n\n\"No Kings\" Day organizers say it is more important than ever to have a \"national day of peaceful protest\" on June 14, following the decision by Trump to send 700 Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles.\n\n\"I think we will see the largest peaceful single day protests that this country has seen certainly since the first Trump term,\" said Indivisible cofounder Ezra Levin, one of the organizers.\n\nNow, about 2,000 protests and rallies named \"No Kings\" Day are planned to oppose what they see as Trump's power grab, nearly double that of the April 5 \"Hands Off\" protest that saw millions of Americans turn out in big and small cities nationwide. Organizers expect millions of Americans to turn out across the country on June 14.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/07/14/trump-ice-raids-juul-and-hurricane-barry-weekends-biggest-news/1728773001/", "title": "Trump, ICE raids, Juul and Hurricane Barry: The weekend's biggest ...", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nImmigrants brace for ICE raids in cities across the nation\n\nAnxious immigrants waited in fear Sunday as federal raids promised by President Donald Trump failed to materialize, with advocates staffing hotlines and visiting churches to reassure worried families.

For the latest news on the LA protests, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Wednesday, June 11.\n\nLOS ANGELES − Mayor Karen Bass issued a curfew for parts of downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday following intense days of protests over immigration enforcement raids that have left crews to clean up the wreckage and seen thousands of National Guard troops sent to the city.\n\nIn a news conference, Bass said the curfew will run from 8 p.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. Wednesday, in an effort to curb ongoing vandalism and looting in downtown Los Angeles. Bass announced the curfew while many people in the city were out marching through the streets and protesting against the ICE raids.\n\nThe curfew was announced to \"stop bad actors who are taking advantage of the President's chaotic escalation,\" Bass asserted in a social media post. \"Law enforcement will arrest individuals who break the curfew, and you will be prosecuted.\"Nights of volatile protests have prompted a legal and social media standoff between California leaders and the Trump administration. The conflict centers on Trump's move to deploy Marines and the National Guard in California in response to protests that have sprung up against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit against Trump for deploying federal troops in the city. Newsom has also accused Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth of trying to use the assets to help ICE conduct raids. A judge set a hearing for the matter for Thursday.\n\nNewsom’s efforts to block federal incursion in California come after Trump doubled the National Guard presence in Los Angeles to 4,000 and deployed 700 Marines, an escalation estimated to cost about $134 million, according to a Pentagon official. Trump remained all-in on his decisions, posting on Truth Social that \"if we didn't send out the National Guard—Los Angeles would be burning right now!\"\n\nSince Friday, officers have had confrontations with protesters, leading to the use of pepper spray and flash bangs as officials announced more than 150 arrests amid flare-ups of vandalism and violence. Bass on Tuesday said damage was limited to a small area downtown, but noted that the graffiti was \"extensive\" and required a large response as the city prepares to host the 2026 World Cup.\n\nWhat to know about the curfew?\n\nThe curfew issued by Bass covers a one-square-mile area of downtown Los Angeles and will last from 8 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday local time. The mayor said she expected the curfew to last for several days.\n\nBass announced the curfew while people were marching through the streets, where protests had turned into vandalism and looting earlier in the week. Police have made over 150 arrests in response to the protests, including over 100 the night before the curfew was announced.\n\nIn a statement about the protests Monday night, Los Angeles police said that \"as demonstrators were being disbursed, agitators and miscreants within the crowd looted businesses and vandalized property.\"\n\nCalifornia officials have said that Trump’s move to send federal troops to the city has only exacerbated tensions and prompted more unrest.\n\nNewsom on Trump: 'Rule of law has increasingly given way to rule of Don'\n\nNewsom delivered a fiery speech Tuesday night, sharing details about what sparked the protests in California's biggest city and what the president’s reaction says about the state of the nation.\n\n\"This situation was winding down and concentrated in just a few square blocks downtown, but that's not what Donald Trump wanted,\" Newsom said. \"He chose escalation, he chose more force, he chose theatrics over public safety.\"\n\nNewsom said Trump did not consult with California law enforcement leaders and commandeered National Guard troops to Los Angeles streets \"illegally and for no reason.\"\n\n\"This brazen abuse of power by a sitting president inflamed a combustible situation,\" Newsom explained.\n\nNewsom said the protests were sparked by unprecedented immigration enforcement raids that saw federal agents \"jumping out of unmarked vans\" outside Home Depot to detain people. The governor added that a \"U.S. citizen nine months pregnant was arrested, a four-year-old girl taken, families separated, friends quite literally disappearing.\"\n\nTrump has said his immigration policy is meant to root out criminals and people illegally in the country, adding that deploying federal troops to Los Angeles was necessary to protect federal buildings from vandalism and keep the peace.\n\n\"California may be first, but it clearly will not end here, other states are next, democracy is next,\" Newsom said. \"This moment we have feared has arrived. The rule of law has increasingly given way to the rule of Don.\"\n\nProtesters take to the streets of Chicago, other US cities\n\nCHICAGO — Hundreds of people gathered in the city’s iconic Loop neighborhood on Tuesday to protest ICE and the immigration enforcement raids that sparked widespread demonstrations in Los Angeles.\n\nMarchers gathered at Daley Plaza near the federal courthouse, marched under the tracks of the El train and down Michigan Avenue.\n\nDemonstrators carried Mexican flags, signs reading “none of us are free unless all of us are free” and chanted a slogan in Spanish insulting immigration authorities.\n\nProtesters marched through Chicago at the same time that people took to the streets in Los Angeles.\n\nWatch the protests here.\n\n--Contributing: Reuters\n\nJudge balks at Newsom request to limit Trump use of National Guard\n\nJudge Charles Breyer balked at Newsom's request to block the Trump administration's use of the National Guard and Marines on Tuesday. Instead, Breyer ordered a briefing on Wednesday and a hearing on Thursday.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Trump administration called Newsom's motion for an emergency temporary restraining order \"legally meritless,\" in pursuit of \"an extraordinary, unprecedented, and dangerous court order,\" and claimed the court has no authority to weigh in.\n\n- Sarah Wire\n\nTrump says troops sent to LA are 'defending the republic'\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in remarks from Fort Bragg in North Carolina that service members deployed to California are \"defending the republic itself\" and helping the administration \"liberate\" the city of Los Angeles.\n\n\"They're stopping an invasion,\" Trump said, in late afternoon remarks.\n\nThe Republican president said California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats, are \"incompetent\" and suggested without evidence that \"troublemakers, agitators and insurrectionists\" were being paid to undermine federal immigration law.\n\nAsked by a reporter if he was accusing Newsom and Bass of paying demonstrators, Trump said \"somebody\" was but not necessarily the Democratic politicians. \"He was just asked by reporters about this remark and he said \"somebody\" is paying for it, without specifiying who.\n\n\"And if they're not, they're just troublemakers,\" he said. \"I believe someboyd is paying them.\"\n\nTrump said: \"As the entire world can now see, uncontrolled migration leads to chaos, dysfunction and disorder.\"\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nHas Trump overblown the threat of protests? Residents, officials say yes.\n\nTrump's deployment of thousands of troops to the nation's second-largest city has unleashed indignation and anger among residents and local officials who say the threat of immigration protests has been dramatically overblown by the White House.\n\n\"The implication is that Donald Trump is waging a war on us personally,\" said protester Charlie Knowlton, 30.\n\nImmigration agents carrying out Trump's goal of deporting 1 million undocumented immigrants annually sparked a series of sometimes-violent protests in the greater Los Angeles area.\n\nTrump has dispatched 4,000 members of the National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, arguing that local law enforcement is overwhelmed. Few of those troops are actually on the streets, however.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department alone has about 9,000 officers to serve the city of nearly 4 million people sprawling across a land area that's one-third the size of Rhode Island. The larger Los Angeles metro area has more than 18 million residents and covers an area nearly the size of Maine.\n\nLocal authorities say they have detained about 150 people in connection to the unrest that left small areas of the 5.8-square-mile downtown marred with pervasive graffiti and a few broken windows. No serious injuries have been reported.\n\n\"We all know this is a power grab,\" Knowlton said before taking a selfie in front of a line of LAPD officers in riot gear. \"What I want right now is for the city police to grow a spine and stand up to the feds.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nState asks judge to stop troops in LA from helping ICE\n\nThe motion says the state on June 9 became aware that the National Guard units in California \"would be providing support for counter-immigration operations and not only at federal buildings.\"\n\n\"Specifically, these activities—scheduled to begin today, June 10, 2025—will include 'holding a secure perimeter in communities around areas where immigration enforcement activities would take place, and securing routes over public streets where immigration enforcement officers would travel,'” the motion said.\n\nThe filing did not say how the state received word about the alleged change in operations.\n\nThe 4,000 California National Guard members called in by the president were originally tasked with protecting federal buildings and other property of the federal government. The Trump administration has not responded to the motion or Newsom's allegation's that the troops were going to used for immigration enforcement.\n\nLA Mayor: ‘We’re an experiment’\n\nMayor Karen Bass, asked why Los Angeles would be targeted, said she believes her city is “an experiment.”\n\n“If you can do this to the nation’s second largest city, maybe the administration is hoping this will be a signal to everybody everywhere to fear them—that you federal government that historically has protected you can come in and take over,” she told reporters in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nBass said she would be reaching out to President Trump. Asked what she would tell him, she said, “I want to tell him to stop the raids. I want to tell him that this is a city of immigrants. I want to tell him that if you want to devastate the economy of the City of Los Angeles, attack immigrants.”\n\n− Phaedra Trethan\n\nOver 100 arrests, 2 officers injured: LAPD\n\nThe number of arrests in connection with the demonstrations in downtown Los Angeles shot up Monday evening, according to the city’s police department.\n\nPolice reported on Tuesday that officers made at least 113 arrests. 96 were for failure to follow orders to leave the area. 14 people were arrested for looting. One person each was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon, resisting arrest and vandalism.\n\nTwo officers were brought to a hospital for their injuries and released. Several businesses were looted, police said.\n\nThe crowds of people left around 3 a.m., officials said.\n\nLAPD acknowledged the hectic night in a statement: “Unfortunately, as demonstrators were being disbursed, agitators and miscreants within the crowd looted businesses and vandalized property,” police said. “We are asking that all residents and businesses continue to report any crimes… Please document with photographs or video before clean up.”\n\nThe number of arrests was more than double what LAPD reported for Saturday and Sunday when 50 people were arrested. Most were also for failure to follow dispersal orders although among the charges was attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail and assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, according to police.\n\nLA mayor considers curfew to curb nightly violence\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she is considering a curfew to restore calm to the city.\n\n“We’re looking at things like a curfew,” she said June 10, and she planned to meet with Police Chief Jim McDonnell later in the day to discuss it.\n\nShe said a curfew wouldn’t need to be citywide, but likely focused on the downtown area.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nTeams cleaning up protesters' graffiti\n\nAuthorities have dispatched painters, cleaners, and other workers to scrub away, cover up or fade out widespread spraypaint graffiti around downtown. While the vast majority of protesters have been peaceful, a small number have defaced buildings, sidewalks and streets with anti-Trump slogans, criticism of ICE and police, and exhortations to resist fascism.\n\nFederal buildings are among the hardest hit, and there was no sign of the National Guard or Marines protecting those facilities Tuesday. On North Los Angeles Street, contractors were paying particular attention to the asphalt where five Waymo self-driving electric vehicles were burned by protesters, releasing rare Earth materials that can be hazardous.\n\nAround the corner, painter’s apprentice Tim Brevard, 53, covered up graffiti on a wall with grey paint shot from a sprayer. Under normal circumstances, Brevard’s team removes gang graffiti from the same area daily. Now it is political graffiti. City policy calls for removing it within 72 hours of being reported, and the city spends about $14 million annually on graffiti removal, according to its annual budget.\n\n“Down here it’s tough because there’s fresh graffiti every day,” Brevard said as he paused to wipe sweat from his face with a gloved hand. “There’s always gang graffiti. Every day we do this.”\n\nHow did the LA protests begin? Immigration raids spark outrage\n\nThe protests in Los Angeles County began as a reaction to a handful of immigration raids, including one outside a Home Depot and another at a clothing manufacturer in the city's garment district.\n\nThe raids and subsequent outrage came as the Trump administration stepped up its detention and deportation of immigrants including at workplaces, traffic stops and routine legal check-ins.\n\nProtests against these moves have increased, too. While most have remained peaceful, the Department of Homeland Security reported a more than 400% surge in assaults on agents.\n\nAfter small protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles on June 6, Trump took several swift actions, calling in the 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines, drawing ire – and at least one lawsuit – from California officials who accuse the president of stoking tension and escalating unrest.\n\nTrump has stood by his actions, saying the deployments were necessary to contain what he described as \"violent, instigated riots.\" About 150 people have been arrested at the protests, which have included flare-ups of unruly clashes, vandalism and looting, but have remained limited to a few blocks in the city's downtown area.\n\nAs authorities brace for another day of protests and Los Angelenos ready themselves for the increased military presence, read more about how the protests began.\n\nTrump says he’d invoke Insurrection Act 'if there’s an insurrection'\n\nTrump said he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act, which would give him more leeway to use the military for domestic purposes as he deploys troops to Los Angeles in response to violent protests.\n\n\"If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it,” Trump said Tuesday during an event in the White House. “We'll see. But I can tell you, last night was terrible. The night before that was terrible.\"\n\nTrump deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles over the objections of Newsom, sparking the lawsuit from the state. Marines also were sent to help the guard after protests erupted over federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nThe troops currently are limited to protecting federal property and law enforcement officers. The Insurrection Act would give Trump authority to use them more broadly. Trump said some areas of Los Angeles, during the protests, where \"you could have called it an insurrection. It was terrible.\"\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nHouse Speaker says Newsom should be 'tarred and feathered'\n\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, asked Tuesday whether Newsom should be arrested, said the governor should be “tarred and feathered.”\n\n“That's not my lane. I'm not gonna give you legal analysis on whether Gavin Newsom should be arrested. But he ought to be tarred and feathered,” Johnson, R-LA., said in a weekly press conference.\n\nJohnson said Newsom is keeping the administration from implementing federal law.\n\nNewsom quickly responded on social media. “Good to know we’re skipping the arrest and going straight for the 1700s style forms of punishment. A fitting threat given the (Republicans) want to bring our country back to the 18th Century.”\n\n− Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhere are LA protests happening?\n\nMost of the unrest is taking place across a few square miles in a mostly commercial area downtown. The city is sprawled across hundreds of square miles and the county covers thousands of square miles. The vast majority of the metropolitan area has been quiet, with people able to continue their daily routines.\n\nTrump has insisted that he had no choice but to increase the level of force in response to growing unrest over his immigration crackdown.\n\n700 Marines heading to LA for riot assistance; Newsom calls move 'deranged fantasy' of Trump\n\nHegseth says National Guard is 'huge component' going forward\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth told a House committee Tuesday the United States was entering a new phase in which the National Guard would \"become a critical component of how we secure that homeland.\"\n\n\"The National Guard is a huge component of how we see the future,\" he told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.\n\nBryn MacDonnell, a special assistant to the secretary of defense, said the Pentagon is spending $134 million of deploying 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines. Funding is coming from operations and maintenance accounts, he said.\n\n− Mayes-Osterman, Cybele\n\nNewsom, Trump aide spar on social media\n\nNewsom criticized Trump on X Tuesday after Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, blasted the governor on the same social media site hours earlier. Miller wrote that \"when the rioters swarmed, you handed over your streets, willingly. You still refuse to arrest and prosecute the arsonists, seditionists and insurrectionists.\"\n\nNewsom made reference to Trump's decision to pardon or commute the sentences of hundreds of people in connection with the assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"The only people defending insurrectionists are you and @realDonaldTrump,\" Newsom wrote. \"Or, are we pretending like you didn’t pardon 1500 of them?\"\n\nCivil rights groups rip Trump's show of force\n\nSeveral national civil rights groups described the Trump administration's National Guard deployment as an overreach of power that was “deeply disturbing\" and “reckless.\"\n\n\"It is not lost on us that no such show of force was deployed in advance of the January 6 insurrection at our nation’s capital despite the clear threat to democracy. The contrast is alarming,\" leaders wrote in a statement released Monday night. “Peaceful protesters in Los Angeles are met with military presence, while violent actors in Washington, D.C. were allowed to breach the heart of our government with little resistance. This inconsistency amplifies questions about how power is used and against whom.\"\n\nThe right to protest the Trump administration’s \"unjust policies targeting Black and Brown communities must be protected,\" they wrote.\n\nThe groups include the NAACP, the National Urban League, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, the National Action Network, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Leadership Conference, the National Council of Negro Women and the Legal Defense Fund.\n\nSeparately, Judith LeBlanc, executive director of Native Organizers Alliance Action Fund, called the administration’s decision to call in the National Guard and the Marines “an act of violence meant to silence organizers who are taking a righteous stand against the illegal and brutal ICE raids happening everyday.”\n\n− Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nMultiple journalists injured by nonlethal rounds\n\nMultiple members of the media have reported being caught in the crossfire or targeted by authorities using tear gas or rubber bullets.\n\nThe incidents included Australian journalist Lauren Tomasi, who was hit in the leg by a rubber bullet on camera in a video that shows an officer appearing to aim at her. A New York Post photographer, Toby Canham, also said he was shot in the forehead with a nonlethal round. British freelance photographer Nick Stern told the BBC he underwent emergency surgery after he was hit in the leg by a plastic bullet.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists has sounded the alarm over the incidents, warning against the intimidation of journalists.\n\n“Any attempt to discourage or silence media coverage by intimidating or injuring journalists should not be tolerated,” Katherine Jacobsen, program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, said in a statement. “It is incumbent upon authorities to respect the media’s role of documenting issues of public interest.”\n\nNational Press Club President Mike Balsamo warned that law enforcement \"cannot pick and choose when the First Amendment applies. Journalists in Los Angeles were not caught in the crossfire — they were targeted. \"\n\n-Jeanine Santucci\n\nMultiple journalists injured by police nonlethal rounds while covering LA protests\n\nCNN correspondent briefly detained, warned by LAPD\n\nPolice briefly detained CNN correspondent Jason Carroll while on air Monday night during the network's coverage of the protests. CNN was covering the protests live when in-studio anchors briefly lost contact with Carroll, who could be seen being led away from the protests by LAPD officers with his hands behind his back. Carroll returned to the mic, informing the anchors: \"I am being detained.\"\n\nAn officer then can be heard telling Carroll: \"We're letting you go. You can't come back. If you come back, you will be arrested.\"\n\nCNN issued a statement saying \"we are pleased the situation resolved quickly once the reporting team presented law enforcement with their CNN credentials. CNN will continue to report out the news unfolding in Los Angeles.\" Read more here.\n\n− Taijuan Moorman\n\nNational Guard lawsuit a 'test case'\n\nOn Monday, California sued the Trump administration, alleging that the president's deployment of Guard troops was unnecessary and unlawful. Newsom later indicated that he will take similar action to prevent the Marines from being deployed, describing the order as a \"blatant abuse of power.\"\n\n\"It makes me feel like our city is actually a test case,\" Bass said at a news conference. \"A test case for what happens when the federal government moves in and takes the authority away from the state or away from local government.\"\n\n'I hate it': LA residents who surveyed vandalism fear more violence in future protests\n\nDay laborers 'looking for work to survive'\n\nSome day laborers and other community members in Los Angeles County are warily watching federal troops, bracing for more raids and trying to look to the future while looking out for each other. Some are still searching for detained family members. Some say they've seen worse.\n\nJose Luis Valencia, 54, is an undocumented immigrant who was born in the Tepito neighborhood of Mexico City. This week he was looking for work outside a Home Depot in Los Angeles County.\n\n\"We're a little nervous, but we're here looking for work to survive,\" Valencia told USA TODAY. \"We need money to put food on the table and support our family.\" Read more here.\n\n− Pamela Avila and Trevor Hughes\n\nNewsom: 'Checks and balances are crumbling'\n\nThe California governor, in a post to social media blasting Trump’s decision to send the military members to California, said Marines are “not political pawns.\" Newsom said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was “illegally” deploying the Marines and argued it was a stunt so Trump could have a “talking point” at a planned parade in Washington on Saturday to celebrate the 250th birthday of the Army, also the day of Trump’s 79th birthday.\n\n\"The Courts and Congress must act. Checks and balances are crumbling,\" Newsom added.\n\n-Jeanine Santucci\n\nFederal forces present 'challenge' for police\n\nOfficials at the Los Angeles Police Department said Monday that despite violent demonstrations, local police can handle whatever protesters throw at them and that federal help is unnecessary and could become a hindrance.\n\n“The possible arrival of federal military forces in Los Angeles - absent clear coordination - presents a significant logistical and operational challenge for those of us charged with safeguarding this city,” Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement. “The Los Angeles Police Department, alongside our mutual aid partners, have decades of experience managing large-scale public demonstrations, and we remain confident in our ability to do so professionally and effectively.”\n\nLAPD said officers have fired over 600 non-lethal bullets and used tear gas on the \"hostile crowd.\" Among those hit was an Australian journalist covering the protests.\n\nAt least five officers received minor injuries, according to police. Five police horses also “were targeted and sustained minor injuries,\" police said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nDays of protests sparked by ICE raids in LA\n\nThe protests began Friday after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps near Los Angeles resulted in more than 40 arrests. The protests had largely been peaceful but flared up when heavily armed, masked agents raided Los Angeles businesses.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, defended the raids and said those arrested by ICE included a Vietnamese man convicted of second-degree murder, an Ecuadoran man convicted of possession of five kilograms of cocaine, and a Filipino man convicted of sexual offenses.\n\nOn Monday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said local immigrant rights groups had confirmed at least five ICE raids in the Los Angeles region. The mayor said officials were still working to compile more information on the raids but noted that in some cases, ICE targeted day laborers and detained people who appeared for scheduled immigration appointments.\n\n\"As you know, ICE does not tell anybody where they're going to go or when they're going to be there,\" Bass said at the Monday news conference.\n\nProtests also sprang up in at least nine other cities across the U.S. on Monday, including New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, according to Reuters.\n\nWhen does a protest become a riot?\n\nProtests in Los Angeles were relatively peaceful when they began on Friday, but escalated into scenes of chaos, with electric vehicles lit aflame, large clouds of tear gas and clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators. Trump has backed his move to send in troops, calling the protests “violent, insurrectionist mobs” and “lawless riots.” But Newsom said it was Trump who “instigated violence.”\n\nExperts say while there are legal definitions for a riot, the term has become increasingly politicized and encapsulates a wide variety of incidents. In most states including California, the key determinator lies in whether multiple people are involved and whether they are committing acts of violence, Brian Higgins, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said.\n\n\"One person is not a riot and neither is a group that is nonviolent,\" he said. \"They can even be breaking the law, like refusing to disperse.

Experts also said that while violence is a defining factor in a riot, such violence could be incited by law enforcement.

Trump cited hearing from people in the farm and leisure industries concerned about worker shortages because of mass deportations.\n\n\"Our farmers are being hurt badly,\" Trump said June 12. \"You know, they have very good workers. They've worked for them for 20 years. They're not citizens, but they've turned out to be, you know, great.\"\n\nEven before Trump's latest charge to ICE, the agency had dramatically expanded its deportation operations after the White House demanded the agency increase its arrests of migrants in the country illegally, Reuters reported. Daily quotas increased from 1,000 arrests a day to 3,000.\n\nTrump's border czar, Tom Homan, said in late May that the administration had deported about 200,000 people over four months ‒ a total that lags behind the deportations during a similar period under former President Joe Biden. The White House has said the discrepancy is the result of fewer migrants coming to the border.\n\nMigrants seeking to cross the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped significantly during Trump's first five months of his second term. Border Patrol agents have seen their monthly encounters of migrants and asylum seekers drop to fewer than 10,000, down from more than 100,000 one year ago.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for your identity: Sign up for USA TODAY's This is America newsletter.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/11/marcelo-gomes-da-silva-milford-ma-immigration/84083774007/", "title": "11th grader's ICE arrest spotlights a town reshaped by immigration", "text": "MILFORD, MA − Immigrants in this blue-collar town say they are living in constant fear of ICE raids that have rounded up 1,500 undocumented people throughout Massachusetts.\n\nAmong those arrested was Marcelo Gomes da Silva, an 11th grader at Milford High School, whose story has drawn widespread attention for throwing into stark relief immigration enforcement tensions around the country.\n\n\"There's been very high levels of anxiety in the community about immigration enforcement for many months,\" says Milford High School Principal Joshua Otlin.\n\nGomes da Silva's family, who brought him to the United States from Brazil when he was 7, are just some of the thousands of immigrants from Latin America whose arrival has reshaped Milford in the past two decades. And now their community is in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's aggressive deportation campaign.\n\nThe fear is pervasive throughout the community, says Reggie Lima, a Brazilian American who on a recent day wore a Trump hat in Milford's Padaria Brasil Bakery.\n\n\"Every day, it's on the back of everybody's mind. Nobody leaves home today without checking around, checking the windows, to see if ICE is outside,\" Lima says.\n\nGomes Da Silva, 18, was arrested by ICE agents on May 31 when he was stopped on his way to volleyball practice. Federal officials said they targeted his father, Joao Paulo Gomes-Pereira, who they say is undocumented and has a history of reckless driving.\n\nThe next day, Gomes da Silva's girlfriend and the other seniors at Milford High School graduated under a cloud of angst. Not only was Gomes da Silva − the drummer in the school band performing that day − absent, but so were two of the graduating students and the families of many others.\n\n\"A lot of people’s parents were very scared to go to graduation, because there were a lot of false rumors saying that immigration could be around school property,\" said an 18-year-old Brazilian American who just graduated. USA TODAY is withholding the names of high school students interviewed for this story because many members of the community expressed fear that they or their family would be subject to arrest or deportation.\n\n\"It was a very difficult day, but it’s definitely going to be memorable, because right after graduation, the first thing that all my friends did, we walked with our teachers, our friends, in our in caps and gowns − I was in my heels − all the way down to town hall protesting for Marcelo,\" she said.\n\n\"I heard many stories of people who didn't cheer for their children\" for fear of being exposed to immigration authorities, said Coleen Greco, mother of a volleyball teammate of Gomes da Silva's.\n\nGomes da Silva was released June 5 after posting a $2,000 bond set by an immigration judge that afternoon. His arrest drew backlash and condemnation from members of Congress.\n\nAn immigrant influx\n\nIf Milford isn't Anytown USA, it is at least Anytown New England. The brutalist concrete high school is surrounded by ballfields and a sea of parking. The strip malls are filled with chain restaurants, including three Dunkin' Donuts.\n\nThe historic downtown is centered in a wood-frame town hall with a cupola-crowned clock tower. Its environs are filled with wood-siding-clad houses behind small lawns, some protected by white picket fences.\n\nThough the mainline Protestant churches − Episcopal, Methodist, Congregationalist and Unitarian − reflect the British roots of the town's original settlers, a nearby Catholic church demonstrates its more recent immigrant history: Once catering to the Irish and Italians who dominated the population in the 20th Century, it now offers services in Spanish and Portuguese as well as English.\n\n\"When I grew up in Milford, Milford was pretty indistinguishable from other suburbs in this part of Massachusetts,\" said Otlin, who graduated in 1996 from the high school where he's now principal.\n\nBack then, he said, it was \"almost exclusively White.\"\n\n\"Today Milford is very, very different than it was. Most of our students identify as something other than white, native-born, English-speaking Americans. Here at the high school, 45% of our families need a translator to communicate with the school.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, 30% of Milford's 30,000 residents are foreign-born. The census undercounts immigrants, who may be afraid to respond to the survey, according to experts and the Census Bureau itself. A 2023 Census Bureau report found 19.8% of noncitizens located in administrative records could not be matched to an address in the 2020 census, compared with 5.4% of among citizens.\n\nStill, census data shows a massive surge in immigration: Since 2000, the Hispanic population and the foreign-born population have tripled in Milford.\n\nMassachusetts might evoke liberal coastal elites, like the ones at Harvard that Trump is attacking with every weapon he can find. But Milford is 30 miles and a world away from the Ivy League campus. Just one-third of adults in Milford have a bachelor's degree, compared with 80% in Cambridge. And while it's easier to find a New York Yankees fan than a Republican in Harvard Yard, 42% of Milford voters went for Trump last year.\n\n\"Massachusetts has the 6th highest foreign-born proportion in the country at 18%,\" wrote Mark Melnik, a researcher at the UMass Donahue Institute, part of the University of Massachusetts, in an email to USA TODAY. \"Milford at 30% is higher than Boston (27%)!\"\n\nIn the late 19th century, the local economy revolved around extracting the town's trademark pink granite, which is found in buildings as far away as Paris. In the mid-20th century, Archer Rubber was a major employer. Now, it’s the health care and biotechnology industry around greater Boston. But even the white-collar economy needs manual laborers to build and maintain the houses and office parks.\n\n\"For most of our immigrant families, they're working in the skilled trades, mostly in the construction trades,\" Otlin said.\n\nAnd on Main Street, many of the stores feature signage in Spanish and Portuguese and sell products from Latin America such as soccer jerseys and plantain leaves.\n\nSome longtime residents enthusiastically embrace the new diversity.\n\n\"They have the best meat markets,\" Greco said.\n\nAnd others express their region's trademark tolerance.\n\n\"I think he's a folk hero, and I'm behind him,\" said Tom, a middle-aged White neighbor in a baseball hat, who was passing Gomes da Silva's house on June 6. Gomes da Silva's friends streamed in and out, but no one answered the door for a reporter.\n\n\"I think it's no different than when Irish moved in, in the late 1800s, and Italians moved in in the early 1900s,\" said Tom, a lifelong Milford resident of Irish ancestry who declined to give his last name. \"Only the laws have changed, but we're all human.\"\n\nImmigrants living in fear and hiding\n\nEven before Gomes da Silva was picked up, the already-pervasive fear of immigration authorities led one of Marcelo’s volleyball teammates to be in his car that day.\n\n\"The night before, I had asked Marcelo for a ride to practice because, ironically enough, my mother wasn’t going to work that Saturday and she asked me if I could get a ride with a friend because she’s too scared of going outside and driving me to practice,\" the friend said.\n\nTwo days after Trump's inauguration, a rumor circulated in the Milford High School community that ICE would be arresting undocumented immigrants at school the next day. Students say most of the school population was absent that day, including native-born citizens who feared their parents could be arrested while dropping them off or picking them up.\n\n\"There was no one in the school, no one,\" said a 17-year-old female classmate of Gomes da Silva's.\n\n\"My parents are the ones who drive me to school, going back and forth, if they were to get stopped on the way there,\" said the 18-year-old recent graduate, who stayed home from school that day. \"Also I was just concerned if (ICE) were to ever follow me back home and see where I live, and just camp out there one day. I was just concerned for the safety of my parents.\"\n\n\"Everywhere is kind of crazy: Chelsea, Framingham,\" said Lima, the Brazilian American Trump supporter, referring to two other Massachusetts towns with large Latino immigrant populations. \"You see (ICE) every day. I saw them this morning.\n\n\"Now people are afraid of driving vans with letters on the top, because they are targeting vans and commercial vehicles,\" said Lima, a construction worker. Because so many of the manual laborers are immigrants, ICE will \"see a van with the letters on the top, like roofers,\" and target it for immigration enforcement, he said.\n\n\"People, including me, are very scared to leave their homes and are afraid of getting stopped doing nothing,\" said Andres, an Ecuadoran immigrant who works in roofing and lives in Milford, in Spanish.\n\n\"You don't see people in the streets in the mornings,\" said Ingrid Fernandes, a Brazilian immigrant who owns Padaria Brasil Bakery. \"It's hurt a lot. Almost 80% of my customers aren't coming for two weeks.\"\n\n\"My parents have been afraid to leave the house,\" said the female classmate of Gomes da Silva's, who is also Brazilian American. \"Me and my sister have been doing the shopping because we're citizens.\"\n\nOthers say their families are having groceries delivered. They liken their life to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEmployees at Oliveira's Market, a grocery store selling Brazilian foods in downtown Milford, say business has been unusually slow in recent weeks, since the raids began, because their customers are afraid to go out.\n\n\"ICE was looking initially for immigrant criminals; now they are targeting everyone,\" said an Oliveira's employee who declined to give his name. Speaking in Portuguese via a translator, he added that he knows people who have been detained and deported.\n\nWhen a White reporter and photographer arrived at Oliveira's Market, a man on his way in from the parking lot turned around and left. At a variety store on Main Street, the elderly Hispanic woman behind the counter was so terrified by journalists asking questions that she began to cry.\n\nNearly everyone in town had heard about Marcelo's case, and the overwhelming sentiment was sympathetic to him.\n\n\"It's a very sad story for everybody,\" Fernandes said.\n\nHis six-day detention featured what his lawyer called \"horrendous\" conditions, including sleeping on a cement floor with no pillow and only a thin metallic blanket. Meals, he said at a news conference, often consisted of nothing but crackers.\n\n\"He seemed thin,\" said Andrew Mainini, Gomes da Silva's volleyball coach, who saw him the night he was released. \"As someone who works out with him and sees him daily, he looked thinner than just six days earlier. And it was pretty noticeable, in his face, specifically.\"\n\nICE's media affairs office told USA TODAY Gomes da Silva was provided meals, including sandwiches. “He was provided bedding, given access to hygiene, including showers, and had access to his lawyer,\" Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement.\n\nICE defends Gomes da Silva's arrest, noting that he wasn't the target of the operation but that anyone in the country illegally is subject to deportation. According to ICE, just over half of the immigrants recently arrested in Massachusetts have criminal convictions in the United States or abroad.\n\n“ICE officers engaged in a targeted immigration enforcement operation of a known public safety threat and illegal alien, Joao Paulo Gomes-Pereira,\" McLaughlin said. \"Local authorities notified ICE that this illegal alien has a habit of reckless driving at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour through residential areas endangering Massachusetts residents.\n\n\"Officers identified the target’s vehicle, and initiated a vehicle stop with the intention of apprehending Joao Paulo Gomes-Pereira. Upon conducting the vehicle stop, officers arrested Marcelo Gomes-Da Silva, an illegally present, 18-year-old Brazilian alien and the son of the intended target. While ICE officers never intended to apprehend Gomes-DaSilva, he was found to be in the United States illegally and subject to removal proceedings, so officers made the arrest.\"\n\nSupport for deporting criminals\n\nIn 2011, Milford resident Maureen Maloney suffered a horrific tragedy when her 23-year-old son was killed by a drunken driver who was in the country illegally. The driver also had a criminal record for assaulting a police officer in 2008.\n\nMaloney became an advocate for removing undocumented immigrants who commit crimes. She went on to campaign for Trump in 2016 and to serve for four years on the Republican state committee.\n\nIn Maloney's view, while what happened to Marcelo is unfortunate \"collateral damage,\" the ICE raids are beneficial because of the criminals they have caught.\n\n\"If these raids save only one life or prevent only one more child from being sexually assaulted, it was worth it,\" Maloney said. \"No matter how bad it was for Marcelo, and I'm sure it was traumatic for him, he'd probably rather that than having lost a sibling or been sexually abused as a young child.\"\n\nEven some Brazilian Americans agree.\n\n\"It's needed because we've been having a lot of criminals all over the place,\" Lima said.\n\n\"They (racially) profile. They look at you, you look Spanish, you speak with an accent, yeah: ‘Where’s your papers?’\" Lima said. \"But it’s complicated. By doing that, they’ve caught like murderers, people who committed crimes in Brazil.\"\n\nMaloney argues that responsibility for the large number of noncriminals picked up in the ICE raids lies with Healey, the state Legislature and a 2017 state court decision limiting immigration enforcement cooperation with ICE.\n\n\"As far as what occurred with Marcelo, this is a direct result of Massachusetts' sanctuary policies and Gov. Healey refusing to cooperate with ICE, because if ICE could apprehend these criminal aliens in a more controlled environment, we wouldn't be having nonviolent, noncriminal aliens being picked up as collateral damage,\" she said.\n\nHealey disputed those claims in a statement sent to USA TODAY by her office.\n\n“Massachusetts law enforcement regularly partners with federal authorities to keep our communities safe,\" she said. \"Our Department of Correction already has an agreement to notify ICE when someone in their custody is scheduled to be released. But instead of focusing on removing criminals, the Trump Administration and ICE are arresting people with no criminal records who live here, work here, and have families here. ICE’s actions are creating considerable fear in our communities and making us all less safe.”\n\nStudent-led protests\n\nThe high school community responded to its shock and upset over Gomes da Silva's arrest by quickly organizing in opposition to his detention and possible deportation.\n\nOn June 2, the first day of classes after Gomes da Silva's arrest, hundreds of students staged a walkout and a rally.\n\n\"The students were exemplary,\" Otlin said. \"It was a very emotionally intense experience for the students and everyone who was there to bear witness to it. I've worked in public schools for 25 years; this is my 15th year as an administrator. I've never seen anything like it. Students sobbing and chanting and praying together. Students coming up to the microphone and speaking from their heart to the press and doing so in incredibly powerful ways.\"\n\nThe next day, the boys' volleyball team's playoff volleyball game brought hundreds of students, teachers, and community members in white T-shirts with \"Free Marcelo\" written on them.\n\n\"People came to support the volleyball team and people came to be together,\" Otlin said. \"This was and remains a traumatic event for hundreds of young people and parents and families in our community, and I think people desperately wanted to come together and be together.\"\n\nThe team lost, however.\n\nCoach Mainini said the volleyball team's goal is to support by Gomes da Silva by \"maintaining the community.\"\n\n\"Anytime he's with the team, anytime he's active, he's not going to be thinking of the challenges ahead of him,\" Mainini said. \"And that's one of the best things we can offer him.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other Milford High School students and recent alumni still have to contend with the omnipresent threat of immigration enforcement descending upon their family.\n\n\"My parents have had the conversation with me about moving to Brazil, like what would happen in case something were to ever happen,\" said Gomes da Silva's female classmate. \"Me personally, I don't want to go to Brazil, because I've never been there. I don't know what it’s like. This is what I know. This is the only thing I know. I've never really traveled outside the country.\"\n\n\"And like, I don't want to leave my parents, I wouldn’t want to leave my parents, but I'd stay for my last year of high school, to finish high school with my sister. I wouldn't want to leave my mom and dad, but I wouldn't want to leave my home, to leave the United States. And it’s a very scary and weird conversation to have with them.\n\n\"Sadly, that's the reality we have to live: I have to think about whether I'm going to come home and my parents won't be there.\"\n\nContributing: John Walker and Kevin Theodoro, USA TODAY Network", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/08/13/ventura-county-supervisors-asked-to-fund-immigration-legal-defense-team/85587695007/", "title": "Supervisors asked to fund immigration legal defense team", "text": "A proposal to invest in immigration legal defense for Ventura County residents drew a packed crowd and emotional pleas at the Board of Supervisors this week.\n\nSupervisor Vianey Lopez proposed a series of actions in response to recent widespread immigration raids, asking the board to embed a unit at the county's Public Defender's Office and approve $250,000 for an immigration legal defense fund.

The board of supervisors said the proclamation will remain in effect until it's terminated by the board.\n\nThe proclamation, introduced by county supervisors Lindsey P. Horvath and Janice Hahn, said the tactics used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities and other federal agents have \"created a climate of fear, leading to widespread disruption in daily life and adverse impacts to our regional economy.\"\n\nOngoing immigration raids and operations across Los Angeles County — which is home to over three million immigrants — have led to a decrease in workplace attendance and strained critical services such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship, according to the board of supervisors.\n\n\"What’s happening in our communities is an emergency — and Los Angeles County is treating it like one,\" Horvath said in a statement on Oct. 14. \"Declaring a Local Emergency ensures that the full weight of County government is aligned to support our immigrant communities who are being targeted by federal actions.\"\n\n\"For months, families have lived under threat, and workers have been taken from job sites. This proclamation is about action and speed — it allows us to move faster, coordinate better, and use every tool available to protect and stabilize our communities,\" the statement continued. \"We will continue to stand with our immigrant neighbors — today, and for as long as it takes.\"\n\nLA County supervisor warns of potential legal challenges\n\nCounty Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who opposed the emergency declaration, has argued that the motion was \"not the right or responsible way\" to respond to federal immigration actions and warned that potential legal challenges could further strain the county's \"already stretched thin\" budget.\n\n\"Emergency powers exist for crises that pose life and death consequences like wildfires — not as a shortcut for complex policy issues,\" Barger said in a statement on Oct. 15. \"Stretching emergency powers for federal immigration actions undermines their purpose, invites legal challenges, and circumvents the public process.\"\n\nBut other county officials say the move will provide assistance and resources for those who have been affected by immigration raids. Citing a study by the Bay Area Council Economic Institute in partnership with the University of California, Merced, officials contended the raids would contribute to the loss of $275 million in gross domestic product in the state.\n\nRaids earlier this year had a dramatic and immediate impact on the workforce. Almost 465,000 California workers fled from the labor ranks during the week of June 8, as immigration authorities raided worksites across the Los Angeles area, according to the study released in July.\n\nAs a result, people working in private-sector jobs in California dropped by 3.1%, a decline not seen since the COVID-19 pandemic, the study noted, though it's unclear whether they left permanently or just for a short time.\n\n'Wave of panic': Businesses are in crosshairs of Trump immigration crackdown\n\nEmergency declaration could be a step closer to eviction moratorium\n\nThe emergency declaration could also be the first step in enacting an eviction moratorium, which would help tenants who have been financially hurt by President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Such a moratorium would still need to be voted on by the board of supervisors.\n\nThe vote allows Los Angeles County to impose an eviction moratorium that would protect renters from eviction for failing to pay rent if they can prove they have been financially impacted by the immigration raids. Renters would still owe that money to their landlord and would need to pay it once the moratorium expired.\n\nDuring a county supervisors meeting last week, a slide presentation noted that an eviction moratorium would inflict hardships on landlords. The presentation also stated that the county increasing rent relief assistance to tenants could be an alternative.\n\nImmigration operations in Los Angeles have sparked widespread protests\n\nLos Angeles County has been at the epicenter of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. In June, Trump sent the National Guard and U.S. Marines into the city to protect federal buildings and protect ICE agents as they carried out raids, prompting widespread protests and outrage.\n\nThe protests in Los Angeles County began as a reaction to a handful of immigration raids, including one outside a Home Depot and another at a clothing manufacturer in the city's garment district. The raids and subsequent outrage came as the Trump administration stepped up its detention and deportation of immigrants, including at workplaces, traffic stops, and routine legal check-ins.\n\nThe Trump administration has said the raids are lawful and meant to remove immigrants in the U.S. illegally from the country. The president has since attempted to deploy the National Guard into other Democratic cities, including Washington, D.C., Memphis, Tennessee, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon.\n\nContributing: Terry Collins and Christopher Cann, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/11/19/north-carolina-immigration-enforcement-trump-administration/87334104007/", "title": "Feds swarm North Carolina in 'Operation Charlotte's Web.' Why?", "text": "In Charlotte, North Carolina, federal agents smashed the window of a U.S. citizen's truck before pulling him to the ground. Tens of thousands of public school students have been reported absent. And businesses in immigrant communities shuttered as border agents patrolled the streets.\n\nNorth Carolina has become the latest focus of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, as federal agents surge into Charlotte and spread out across other Democratic-led cities in the notorious swing state, including Durham and Raleigh.\n\nLocated hundreds of miles from the southern and northern borders, North Carolina doesn't often generate national attention for immigration related issues, leading residents and local officials to question why the state that voted for Donald Trump in the last three presidential elections is being targeted.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said it launched “Operation Charlotte’s Web” to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”\n\nBut Charlotte is not considered a sanctuary city, and the state has some of the strictest immigration provisions in the country, experts said, including a mandate passed last year requiring local jails to hold arrested immigrants for a limited time so they can be picked up by federal authorities.\n\n“No cities in the state have sanctuary policies, if they did they would be violating state law,” said Rick Su, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina who specializes in immigration and local government.\n\nSu also noted that no city in North Carolina was included on the Justice Department’s list of \"sanctuary jurisdictions,\" which the agency defines as areas with “policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”\n\nOver the weekend, federal agents arrested over 130 undocumented immigrants in Charlotte, including several dozen with previous charges ranging from driving under the influence to aggravated assault, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). USA TODAY is unable to independently verify those figures as the agency has not released the names of those arrested, or their exact charges.\n\nAfter the weekend raids, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein criticized the operation as inducing “widespread fear” and said it is “not about public safety.”\n\n“They’re driving around Charlotte in unmarked cars wearing paramilitary garb, masks, stopping people on the street randomly based on the color of their skin,” Stein said. “This is not promoting safety in our communities. The people of North Carolina deserve to be safe.”\n\nCharlotte reeling from immigration sweeps as enforcement expands\n\nFederal agents began surging into Charlotte neighborhoods on Saturday, Nov. 15, spurring business closures across immigrant communities as protesters took to the streets to decry the operations.\n\nHomeland Security officials have not said how many agents have been sent to the state or how long the heightened enforcement will last.\n\nThe operations are being led by Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol official who coordinated immigration raids in Chicago that triggered lawsuits and fierce backlash over what many described as agents' aggressive enforcement tactics.\n\nBovino, who, according to a federal judge, admitted to lying about a rock-throwing incident used to justify the deployment tear gas on protesters, is from western North Carolina.\n\nSince the enforcement began in Charlotte, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District said over 30,000 students – about 20% of the student population – were absent on Monday, Nov. 17, according to preliminary data. Officials have not tied the low attendance numbers directly to the immigration enforcement. According to data from the school district, 31% of the student population identifies as Hispanic.\n\nVideos of border agents conducting arrests have drawn scrutiny, including one of masked agents smashing the window of a U.S. citizen and pulling him to the ground. The man, Willy Aceituno, was brought into a Border Patrol vehicle and released after he showed agents documentation proving his citizenship, he told the Associated Press.\n\n“I am deeply concerned with many of the videos I’ve seen,” said Mayor Vi Lyles in a statement on X. She added that her office is working to determine “what more we can do to support our community while working within complicated legal boundaries.”\n\nAt a city council meeting on Tuesday, Nov. 18, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said immigration authorities were spotted in Wake and Durham counties. She urged people to call the Raleigh Police Department if they feel unsafe or see something illegal.\n\nIn Durham, local officials held a news conference and spoke out against the federal intervention. Nida Allam, the chair of the Durham Board of County Commissioners, said border agents were in the city to stoke fear, not fight crime.\n\n“Durham is over 1,300 miles from the border,” Allam said. “None of this was about securing our borders, none of it was about enforcing the law. It was a show of force meant to scare people.”\n\nCharlotte, a recent flashpoint in the debate around crime in US cities\n\nThis is not the first time Charlotte has found itself at the center of national debates around public safety.\n\nIn August, the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, on a public train in Charlotte drew national headlines and the attention of the White House. Trump seized on the incident as an example of rampant violent crime in Democratic-led cities, pointing to the suspect’s lengthy criminal history.\n\nIn Charlotte, rates of violent crime have fallen sharply this year, according to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. The agency said through the first nine months of 2025, Charlotte saw a 20% reduction in violent crimes including as homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.\n\nSo far this year, Durham and Raleigh have seen rates of violent crime either stay level or dip when compared with 2024, according to their respective police departments.\n\nIn its recent statements, the Department of Homeland Security has sought to tie its immigration enforcement in North Carolina to public safety and policies that they say allow criminals to roam the streets.\n\nResearch has shown that, on average, immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Further, immigration violations, such as living in the country without proper documentation, are civil, not criminal, under U.S. law.\n\n\"Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”\n\nIn a statement posted to its website, DHS also accused local law enforcement in North Carolina of refusing to comply with almost 1,400 detainer requests by immigration officials to hold arrested suspects for 48 hours.\n\nIt is true that for years, Mecklenburg County, which encompasses Charlotte, did not honor such detainers. But that changed last year when the majority-Republican legislature overcame a veto and passed a measure forcing sheriff's offices to hold arrested immigrants temporarily for federal authorities.\n\nMecklenburg County Sheriff Garry L. McFadden, a Democrat, has publicly feuded with immigration authorities over enforcement but he has maintained that his office is complying with detainer requirements.\n\nIn recent months, he said he has sought to improve communication with federal immigration officials. In late October, McFadden called a meeting with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement's regional leaders.\n\n\"I made it clear that I do not want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,\" McFadden said after the meeting, according to local media reports.\n\nLast week, McFadden announced publicly that two federal officials told him Border Patrol agents would soon be arriving in Charlotte. He added, “specific details regarding the federal operation have not been disclosed.”\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/19"}]}

Here's what would need to happen.\n\nUnder the Epstein files bill, the Justice Department would be able to withhold documents that \"would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary.\"\n\nTy Cobb, a White House lawyer in the first Trump term, said he believes Trump's turnabout in favor of releasing the files is a \"canard.\" Cobb said he believes Attorney General Pam Bondi will cite the ongoing investigations as a reason not to release them.\n\n\"I think he and Bondi have determined that they'll try to use Trump-ordered 'investigations' of Democrats ‒ but not Republicans, as he stated ‒ as a bar to producing anything,\" Cobb said in an interview on CNN. \"I think it'll be a long time before we see anything, although there are certain documents that could be easily produced.\"\n\nIt's unclear when the bill, which the Senate passed by unanimous consent, will reach Trump's desk for his signature.\n\nTrump changed his position on the bill after it became clear that enough Republicans backed the measure for its passage.\n\nIf Trump wanted to release the Epstein files immediately, he could order the Justice Department to do so. Asked by an ABC News reporter Nov. 18 why he hasn't, the president snapped at the reporter and suggested ABC's broadcasting license should be revoked.\n\nTrump and Epstein were friends during the 1990s and early 2000s before the two had a falling out. Emails from Epstein released last week by the Republican-led House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and separately by House Democrats, mention Trump by name.\n\nIn one of them, Epstein wrote of Trump, \"I am the one able to take him down.\" Epstein, in other emails released by House Democrats, said Trump \"spent hours at my house\" with one of Epstein's victims and \"knew about the girls.\"\n\nAsked by reporters Nov. 14 aboard Air Force One what Epstein meant by the comment, Trump said, “I know nothing about that.”\n\nProtecting Epstein victims\n\nThe legislation also contains language permitting Bondi to withhold records that could violate the rights of Epstein victims.\n\nThis includes personally identifiable information that reveals the names of accusers or materials that depict or contain child abuse.\n\nThe Justice Department has said Epstein had more than 1,000 victims. Some have led the public push for the government to release all the documents.\n\nThe Trump administration has cited the sensitive nature of the materials when the Justice Department and FBI announced in July that it would not be releasing the full Epstein files. The agencies said the records included large volumes of images of Epstein and victims who were minors or appeared to be minors and more than 10,000 videos and images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography.\n\nBefore the House vote, Johnson said he spoke with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, about adding an amendment to the Senate version of the bill to address concerns about revealing victims' identities.\n\nUltimately, no amendments were made to the bill.\n\nTrump's history of ignoring Congress\n\nIn his second term in the White House, Trump has routinely ignored laws passed by Congress when it comes to funding federal programs and agencies.\n\nAlthough Trump vowed he would sign the bill into law if Congress passes it, his track record of asserting executive power raises questions how closely his administration would follow the directive.\n\nTrump has clashed with Democrats in Congress over how federal money is spent. The president has sought to eliminate the Department of Education, even though Congress established the department by law. He did the same to the U.S. Agency for International Development and worked to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nNevertheless, outright ignoring a bill passed by Congress – and one he signs – would be his most blatant defiance yet and a complete flip from his new position.\n\nGrand jury records are blocked\n\nEven if certain Epstein documents are released by the Justice Department, records from the grand jury that indicted Epstein on sex trafficking charges would not be included in any handover of documents.\n\nA New York federal judge in August became the third judge to deny the Justice Department's bid to unseal these records, whose secrecy is protected by law.\n\nEvidence heard by grand juries, which operate behind closed doors to consider indictments, cannot be released without the approval of judges. The Justice Department's evidence presented to the grand jury in the Epstein case was never made public because Epstein died in 2019 as he awaited trial.\n\nStill, U.S. District Judge Richard Berman said the grand jury records aren't close to the volume of records the government has. \"The Government's 100,000 pages of Epstein files and materials dwarf the 70 odd pages of Epstein grand jury materials,\" Berman wrote in his decision. \"The grand jury testimony is merely a hearsay snippet of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged conduct.\"\n\n(This story has been updated with more information.)\n\nContributing: Zac Anderson, USA TODAY; Reuters\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/19/congress-epstein-files-trump-live-updates/87335192007/", "title": "Donald Trump signs bill ordering release of all Jeffrey Epstein files", "text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed legislation Wednesday night directing the Justice Department to release all files from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, completing a dramatic reversal after fighting the proposal just last week.\n\nTrump announced on Truth Social that he signed the Jeffrey Epstein Transparency Act, which cleared both chambers of Congress on Tuesday with only one Republican lawmaker voting against it.\n\n\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES,\" the president said in the announcement on his social media platform. Trump has pointed to Epstein’s ties to prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, proclaiming: \"This latest Hoax will backfire on the Democrats just as all of the rest have!\"\n\nWith the legislation signed, the Justice Department has 30 days to publicize \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" from the investigation into the disgraced financier and indicted sex trafficker who died by suicide in 2019.\n\n“We'll continue to follow the law with maximum transparency while protecting victims,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said earlier in the day.\n\nWhether the Justice Department will release all the documents remains to be seen.

Files related to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. that Trump ordered to be released were made available on the National Archives website.\n\nAccording to the Epstein files bill, certain information can be withheld, including the identity of victims, \"child sexual materials,\" and anything that might jeopardize an ongoing investigation. The attorney general will be required to provide to Congress a summary of redactions made and legal justifications for withholding information.\n\nA former Trump White House lawyer has said he believes the president will use the provision limiting information related to ongoing investigations to keep Epstein files from being released.\n\n— Michael Loria\n\nHow did the bill pass?\n\nTrump’s signing of the bill comes after months of controversy over what more information the federal government might have about Epstein.\n\nAmericans, and the politicians who represent them, have clamored to know more about the disgraced financier and accused sex trafficker's relationships with the rich and powerful, including the president.\n\nAll that scrutiny came to a head on Tuesday when both chambers of Congress overwhelmingly agreed to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The legislation was sent immediately to the president's desk after an abrupt about-face to support the measure despite initially opposing it.\n\nThe success of the measure was a remarkable show of bipartisan force. It was also the culmination of a rare rebuke from congressional Republicans of Trump, whose decades-old ties to Epstein have recently come back to haunt him.\n\nIt's unclear how the Justice Department will immediately respond to the new bill. In the short term, the bill represents a win for Epstein's many victims, and potentially, a growing willingness among congressional Republicans to buck the president — at least on some issues.\n\n— Michael Loria\n\nLarry Summers will leave his role at Harvard amid Epstein probe\n\nFormer Harvard President Larry Summers will immediately step down from his role as an instructor at Harvard as the Ivy League school investigates his ties to Epstein, according to the Harvard Crimson, the university's student newspaper.\n\n\"His co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester,\" a spokesperson for Summers told The Crimson on Nov. 19.\n\nEarlier in the day, Summers announced that he would be stepping back from his public duties at the university amid new revelations about his relationship with Epstein. He also resigned from the board of tech company OpenAI days after announcing he was stepping away from public commitments due to his connection to Epstein.\n\n\"In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI. I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress,\" Summers said in a statement to USA TODAY on Wednesday.\n\nOpenAI's board said in a statement, \"Larry has decided to resign from the OpenAI Board of Directors, and we respect his decision. We appreciate his many contributions and the perspective he brought to the Board.\"\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswam and Melina Khan\n\nEpstein vote showed a rare bipartisan Trump rebuke\n\nTuesday's bipartisan support in Congress for passing the bill to release the full Epstein files came at a particularly polarized time in Washington.\n\nThe government had just reopened after closing for a record 43 days. GOP lawmakers have been increasingly enraging Democrats by ceding congressional spending powers to the White House. And Democrats have felt all the more emboldened to stand up to Trump on the heels of big off-year election wins.\n\nDespite all that, Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, told USA TODAY he was surprised at how quickly the Epstein vote came together. Asked why Republicans felt comfortable voting with their political enemies, he said, \"I don't know. But I'm glad we did.\"\n\nBut some Democrats are skeptical that the vote was a green light for Republicans to buck Trump more often, even in his second term.\n\nThey only signed on because \"they got permission to support it, which is sad in and of itself,\" Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Georgia, told USA TODAY. \"Protecting children from pedophiles should not be hard,\" he said.\n\n— Zachary Schermele\n\nThune says Congress wants DOJ to 'get the information out there' on Epstein\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, said the “clear intent” from the House and Senate is to “get the information out there” after both chambers voted overwhelmingly for the Justice Department to release the Epstein files.\n\nThune made the comments on Wednesday as Democrats have called for scrutiny of Bondi to ensure she follows the directive in the bill to release all the documents from the Epstein investigation within 30 days.\n\n\"I trust the judgment of the Justice Department to ensure that whatever files they release protect the victims, clearly,\" Thune said in response to a question from a reporter, adding the DOJ will have to \"make some decisions\" about releasing documents that were presented to the grand jury to convict Epstein. “But I think they’ll make the right decisions.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBondi says 'new information' led to new Epstein investigations targeting Democrats\n\nAfter closing the Epstein case in July, Bondi on Wednesday said “new information” obtained by federal authorities prompted the Justice Department to launch the new investigation targeting prominent Democrats’ ties with Epstein.\n\n“There’s information, new information, additional information,” Bondi said, without expounding. “Again, we’ll follow to follow the law to investigate any leads. If there are any victims, we encourage any victims to come forward.”\n\nBondi announced the new investigation in the Southern District of New York at the direction of Trump, who singled out Trump, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman as subjects of the probe.\n\nWhen Bondi announced the administration’s decision not to release the Epstein files in July, the Justice Department and FBI said investigators found no evidence to prompt an investigation into uncharged third parties in the Epstein case.\n\nUnder the new Epstein files bill that passed Congress, the Justice Department can withhold documents if they jeopardize ongoing investigations.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nAG Bondi pledges to 'follow the law' after passage of Epstein files bill\n\nBondi said the Justice Department will “follow the law” after both chambers of Congress approved legislation compelling the full release of the files in the Epstein investigation.\n\n“We'll continue to follow the law with maximum transparency while protecting victims,” Bondi said Wednesday. “The law passed both chambers last evening. It has not yet been signed, but we will continue to follow the law.”\n\nUnder the bill, the Justice Department has 30 days to publicize “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” from the investigation.\n\nBut the Justice Department is permitted to withhold documents that could jeopardize ongoing investigations or violate the privacy rights of Epstein victims.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nEpstein survivor hopes Trump invites them to bill signing\n\nHaving some Epstein survivors present when Trump signs the Epstein files bill would honor their experience and their push for justice, Teresa J. Helm told USA TODAY on Tuesday. Helm was sexually assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein in the early 2000s.\n\n\"Every family knows a survivor of sexual violence,\" she said. \"I truly hope that we are further seen and honored, not for anything political, but for our experience and our pursuit of justice, because it's hugely important. We are directly contributing to our democracy because anything built on corruption always crumbles eventually.\"\n\nThe signing has not yet been scheduled. Many bills are signed into law without a public ceremony.\n\n– Sarah D. Wire\n\nLawmaker who texted with Epstein avoids censure\n\nThe House on Tuesday evening narrowly voted against formally reprimanding Del. Stacey Plaskett, a Democrat who represents the United States Virgin Islands in the House of Representatives, for communicating with Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing.\n\nIn a 209-214 vote, all House Democrats, along with three Republicans — Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska, Lance Gooden of Texas, and Dave Joyce of Ohio — voted against the measure. Three other Republicans — Reps. Andrew Garbarino of New York, Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania, and Jay Obernolte of California — voted present.\n\nThousands of documents released last week included copies of text messages that Plaskett exchanged with Epstein during an Oversight Committee hearing. Plaskett was going to question Michael Cohen, a former friend of Epstein’s, during the hearing.\n\nDuring a floor speech on Tuesday, Plaskett denied wrongdoing and said that Epstein was a constituent at the time, as he was a resident of the Virgin Islands. She said it was “not public knowledge at that time that he was under federal investigation” and that she was just seeking information.\n\n“I know how to question individuals,” she said. “I know how to seek information. I have sought information from confidential informants, from murderers, from other individuals because I want the truth.\"\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nWho is Clay Higgins? Meet the only House member to vote against releasing the Epstein files\n\nRep. Clay Higgins, a former police officer, was the lone vote against the legislation on Tuesday. For the Louisiana Republican, who typically votes with other conservatives, it was a politically unusual choice. But he said it came down to privacy concerns.\n\nSafeguarding the personal information of Epstein's many victims was his primary issue with the deal, even though most GOP lawmakers, following President Donald Trump's lead, joined with Democrats to support the measure in recent days.\n\nThe bill's bipartisan authors – Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, and Ro Khanna, D-California – have stressed that the legislation will not expose victims. It stipulates that the Justice Department is permitted to withhold certain information, such as personal details about victims and materials that would jeopardize any active federal investigations.\n\nEpstein accusers present for House vote\n\nA group of the estimated 1,000 women and children who have made accusations against Epstein were in the House gallery during the chamber's vote on Tuesday.\n\nThey cheered and hugged as the vote ended. Some representatives applauded.\n\n“My sister, Maria Farmer, first reported Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to federal authorities nearly three decades ago. Since then, survivors – myself included – have been left in the dark about how our reports were investigated, who was involved in our abuse and trafficking, and why Epstein and Maxwell were able to get away with inflicting pain on so many women and girls for years,\" said Annie Farmer, who met Epstein at age 16, in a statement after the vote.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/11/18/epstein-files-vote-house-senate-results-tracker/87337832007/", "title": "See how the House and Senate voted on releasing Epstein files", "text": "Both houses of Congress agreed overwhelmingly Nov. 18 to release all unclassified records related to the federal government's investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the late disgraced financier and accused sex trafficker linked to high-profile individuals, including President Donald Trump.\n\nBy a vote of 427-1, the House of Representatives passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a bill that requires the federal government to release Epstein documents.\n\nThe Senate followed suit about three hours later when Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., introduced a motion for unanimous consent. That allowed the Senate to pass the bill without a formal roll-call vote after it was received from the House. That was approved without objection.\n\nThe bill was sent to Trump, who signed it on Nov. 19. The Justice Department now has 30 days to publicize the files.\n\nWho voted against releasing the Epstein files?\n\nOne Republican, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, voted against the House measure. Three Democrats and two Republicans did not vote.\n\nHiggins posted on X why he was against the bill: \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt.\"\n\nWhy did Trump initially oppose the bill?\n\nTrump, who earlier resisted releasing the files, indicated on Nov. 17 that he'd sign the legislation if it passed both chambers of Congress. The president has denied he knew of Epstein's alleged abuses.\n\nThe House vote came after months of pressure from many Americans, including supporters of Donald Trump, Democrats, and even some Republicans to release the Epstein files.\n\nThe bill is one of the first major defections from Trump's wishes by congressional Republicans since the president began his second term in office. After initially opposing the Epstein Files Transparency Act, introduced by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky and Ro Khanna, D-California, Trump urged House GOP lawmakers over the weekend to support the bill.\n\nThe bill passed overwhelmingly despite GOP concerns over protecting the privacy of victims, USA TODAY reported.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson was among the Republicans to vote for the bill. He said his support would hinge on whether or not the Senate amends it to better protect victims' information being made public.\n\nCONTRIBUTING Zachary Schermele, Sarah D.

DOJ said a systematic review of the files didn't turn up any list of clients involved in Epstein's crimes.\n\nEven some congressional Republicans have clamored for the files' release or introduced legislation to try to force the Trump administration's hand. Republican leadership has so far blocked the legislation and White House officials continue to resist those calls.\n\nStill, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has suggested that Maxwell could reveal new details about Epstein's circle and crimes.\n\nHere is all the latest on the fallout:\n\nJuly 25: Maxwell lawyer signals desire for pardon\n\nMaxwell was convicted in 2021 of trafficking a minor to Epstein for sexual abuse, and for conspiring to entice and transport minors for illegal sex acts. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence, and has an appeal pending at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nMarkus indicated July 25 that his client could ask for a pardon soon, following the two days she spent talking to Justice Department officials July 24-25.\n\n\"We haven't spoken to the president or anybody about a pardon just yet,\" he said. \"The president this morning said he had the power to do so. We hope he exercises that power in the right and just way.\"\n\nTrump has the power to pardon Maxwell fully as well as to commute her prison sentence. But to many, that might look more like reducing than enhancing accountability – especially if Maxwell offers little in return.\n\nIn the morning on July 25, Trump said he hasn't thought about pardoning Maxwell, but also didn't rule it out.\n\n\"I'm allowed to do it, but it's something I have not thought about,\" Trump said. \"I certainly can't talk about pardons now.\"\n\nJuly 25: 16% of voters in poll approve of Trump administration on Epstein\n\nOnly 16% of of voters who responded to a poll released July 25 by Emerson College Polling approved of the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein files. Fifty-one percent disapproved, while 33% were neutral.\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,400 U.S. voters from July 21-22. Its margin of error is ±2.5 points, according to the polling organization.\n\nJuly 23: Florida judge shields Epstein grand jury testimony\n\nIn addition to approaching Maxwell, the Justice Department asked federal judges in Florida and New York to unseal transcripts of testimony before grand juries investigating Epstein and Maxwell. If judges allow for the transcripts' release, the department said it will first redact both victim-related information and personal identifying information from the transcripts.\n\nOn July 23, federal Judge Judge Robin L. Rosenberg rejected the request in Florida, writing that she doesn't have the power to order the records' release because of a past ruling from an appeals court that presides over her trial court.\n\nJudges in New York haven't yet ruled on the administration's requests there.\n\nJuly 23: Reports emerge that AG Bondi told Trump in May he is named in Epstein files\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi told Trump in May that he was named multiple times in the government's files on Jeffrey Epstein, according to reports from the Wall Street Journal and CNN.\n\nA White House official did not dispute that Trump's name is mentioned in the Epstein files, telling USA TODAY that briefing binders Bondi prepared for MAGA influencers in February included the president's name. But the official rejected any suggestion that Trump engaged in wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.\n\nBeing named doesn't mean the person did anything criminal.\n\nJuly 22: House Speaker Mike Johnson starts summer recess early to avoid Epstein\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, announced on July 22 he is shutting down the House for its summer recess early to avoid a vote on releasing the Epstein files. Johnson said there was \"no daylight\" between the Trump administration and the House, and the White House needed \"space\" to address the issue.\n\nMembers of Congress were scheduled to leave Washington for several weeks starting July 24, but Johnson said he would cut the schedule short and end with votes on July 23.\n\nJohnson took that step after Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, and Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colorado, co-sponsored legislation calling for the release of the government's Epstein records.\n\nJuly 22: New footage shows Epstein at Trump wedding\n\nArchived video footage and photos revealed by CNN July 22 showed Jeffrey Epstein attended Trump's wedding to Marla Maples at the Plaza Hotel in 1993.\n\nMaples is the second of Trump's three wives. The couple divorced in 1999.\n\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" Trump told CNN when asked about the wedding photos on a phone call. He called the outlet \"fake news\" and hung up.\n\nWhite House Communications Director Steven Cheung said the images were \"out-of-context frame grabs of innocuous videos and pictures of widely attended events to disgustingly infer something nefarious.\"\n\nJuly 22: House committee agrees to seek Maxwell testimony\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee agreed on July 22 to subpoena Ghislaine Maxwell to testify.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tennessee, said he pressed for the subpoena in order to learn more about Epstein's criminal conduct.\n\n“This deposition will help the American people understand how Jeffrey Epstein was able to carry out his evil actions for so long without being brought to justice,” Burchett said.\n\nJuly 18: Trump sues Wall Street Journal over lewd Epstein birthday letter\n\nOn July 17, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump sent Epstein a lewd birthday letter for his 50th birthday, which took place in early 2003. Trump called the letter a \"FAKE\" on social media July 17 and sued the newspaper's publisher for libel on July 18.\n\nThe letter contains typewritten dialogue between \"Donald\" and \"Jeffrey,\" and at a later point \"Trump.\" In the dialogue, \"Donald\" says, \"We have certain things in common, Jeffrey\" and that, \"Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?\" The dialogue ends with \"Trump\" saying, \"A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.\"\n\nThe dialogue is encased within a seemingly hand-drawn outline of a naked woman, the Journal reported. The letter includes a pair of arcs denoting the woman's breasts, and a \"Donald\" squiggly signature mimicking pubic hair.\n\nUSA TODAY could not verify the details or origin of the letter.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, Bart Jansen, Melina Khan, Savannah Kuchar, Christopher Cann - USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/19/jeffrey-epstein-files-bill-donald-trump-justice-department/87363245007/", "title": "When will the Epstein files be released?

Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer during Trump's first term, said in an interview with CNN that he believes Bondi will cite the ongoing investigations as a reason not to release the files.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune said Nov. 19 that the \"clear intent\" from the House and Senate is to \"get the information out there\" after both chambers voted overwhelmingly for the bill.\n\nContributing: Melina Khan and Joey Garrison, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2025/11/06/delta-air-lines-flights-shutdown-disruption/87132104007/", "title": "Delta cut 170 Friday flights as government shutdown disrupts travel", "text": "Delta Air Lines has canceled roughly 170 flights for Friday, Nov. 7, and already notified travelers whose flights are impacted for Nov. 8. The airline said it will have fewer cuts on the 8th because demand and daily departures are typically lower on weekends. It operates about 5,000 flights a day system-wide.\n\n“We’re operating the vast majority of our schedule and intend to keep access to all of the markets we serve, though frequency may be affected,” the airline said in a statement. Delta told USA TODAY it plans to keep all international flights moving.\n\nThe move follows the Department of Transportation's 10% reduction in flights across 40 major U.S. airports to provide relief to the air traffic controllers who have been working without pay during the government shutdown, as announced by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy at a news conference on Nov. 5.\n\nThe directive sent airlines scrambling to rework their schedules right before the busy holiday travel season, with many travelers concerned about delays or cancellations for their upcoming flights. Cuts began at 4% on Nov. 7 and will climb to 6% by Nov. 11, 8% by Nov. 13, and 10% by Nov. 14.\n\nUnited Airlines has cut 4% of its flights through Nov. 9 and notified impacted customers.

That approach is meant to reduce crowding and prevent day-of-travel surprises.\n\nA travel waiver is now in place to offer customers additional flexibility to rebook without change fees. The Atlanta-based carrier also recommends using its Fly Delta app and signing up for alerts.\n\nWhat will airlines do if my flight is cancelled?\n\nIf your flight has been canceled, airlines will try to rebook you automatically.

See timeline, Oklahoma vote ...", "text": "After both chambers of Congress almost unanimously agreed to pass a bill compelling the Justice Department to release as many of the Jeffrey Epstein files as possible, the measure has landed in President Donald Trump's hands.\n\nThe bipartisan effort resulted in all lawmakers except one voting in favor of the release. It was the culmination of a rare rebuke from congressional Republicans of Trump, whose decades-old ties to Epstein have recently come back to haunt him.\n\nThe bill's swift movement through Capitol Hill garnered only one vote of opposition in the House of Representatives, as legislators continued to expedite it through the halls. Meanwhile, the president continues to refer to the controversy as the \"Epstein hoax.\"\n\nYet, he will be one of the final hurdles before the files are released to the public. Here's what we know on who voted and when the files should be released, pending the president's approval.\n\nWho voted against the Epstein files? Who is Clay Higgins?\n\nRep. Clay Higgins, a former police officer, was the lone vote against the legislation on Tuesday. For the Louisiana Republican, who typically votes with other conservatives, it was a politically unusual choice. But he said it came down to privacy concerns.\n\nSafeguarding the personal information of Epstein's many victims was his primary issue with the deal, even though most GOP lawmakers, following Trump's lead, joined with Democrats to support the measure in recent days.\n\nAll seven of Oklahoma's U.S. legislators voted to release the files.\n\nThe bill's bipartisan authors – Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, and Ro Khanna, D-California – have stressed that the legislation will not expose victims. It stipulates that the Justice Department is permitted to withhold certain information, such as personal details on victims and materials that would jeopardize any active federal investigations.\n\nWhat happens after Congress approves the bill?\n\nThe bill to release the Epstein files will now be passed to President Donald Trump to allow him the power to approve or veto the bill. If Trump vetoes the bill, a supermajority is needed to override his veto, meaning 2/3 minimum of all of Congress.\n\nHowever, Trump has not commented on how his vote will go since Congress has passed the bill; instead, he continues to state that he has \"nothing to do\" with Epstein.\n\n“I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein,” Trump said. “I threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert.”\n\nWhen will Trump sign the bill?\n\nIt is unknown when Trump will sign the bill releasing the Epstein files. Yet, he has said he will sign it into law in the days prior to the vote.\n\n\"House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party,\" he wrote on Truth Social on Nov. 16.\n\nAs stated in the Constitution, the president has 10 days to sign a bill or veto a bill. With Trump having received the files on Nov. 19, his deadline to sign the bill is Nov. 29.\n\nWhen will the Epstein files be released?\n\nIf the Epstein bill is signed into law, it will compel the Justice Department to release any relevant files on the sex offender. When that would happen, however, is uncertain.\n\nUnder the Epstein files bill, the Justice Department would be able to withhold documents that \"would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary.\"\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison and Melina Khan, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/18/doj-to-turn-over-jeffrey-epstein-probe-files-gop-chairman/85715411007/", "title": "DOJ to begin turning over Jeffrey Epstein probe files: GOP chairman", "text": "WASHINGTON – The Justice Department in four days will begin sending some of the “Epstein files” from its sex-trafficking investigation into the disgraced late financier to the House Oversight Committee, committee Chairman James Comer said Aug. 18.\n\n“There are many records in DOJ’s custody, and it will take the Department time to produce all the records and ensure the identification of victims and any child sexual abuse material are redacted,” Comer said in a statement posted on X, adding that the first files are expected to arrive Aug. 22. “I appreciate the Trump Administration’s commitment to transparency and efforts to provide the American people with information about this matter.”\n\nThe Justice Department was not immediately available for comment on what records it might turn over.\n\nOn Aug. 5, Comer issued a subpoena to the Justice Department for records related to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 as he was awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.\n\nRepublicans on the House Committee have also issued deposition subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as former top federal law enforcement officials including James Comey, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, Merrick Garland, Robert Mueller, William Barr, Jeff Sessions and Alberto Gonzales. Those are scheduled to get underway this month.\n\nThose subpoenas seek testimony “related to horrific crimes perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein,” Comer, R-Kentucky, said when they were issued.\n\nThe Oversight Committee voted July 23 to issue the subpoenas and to also seek the DOJ files, answering calls from lawmakers and voters alike for more information on Epstein and who else might have been involved in his underage sex-trafficking ring.\n\nWhile Trump supporters and MAGA influencers have said they want to see the names of prominent Democrats rumored to be in the files, Trump himself is likely in them, at least on flight logs from Epstein's private jet, according to already disclosed court records and other documents.\n\nThe DOJ promise to hand over files follows weeks of intensifying drama and rare dispute between Trump, whose long friendship with Epstein ended in the mid-2000s, and his MAGA base.\n\nLast month, the DOJ and FBI issued a joint statement saying they would not release Epstein investigative documents in their possession after months of promises by Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel to make that information public.\n\nThe subpoenas appear to cover when Epstein allegedly sexually assaulted young women with the help of associate Ghislaine Maxwell, which dates back more than two decades.\n\nMaxwell was interviewed over two days in July about what she knows about the case by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, a former Trump personal defense lawyer.\n\nThe interviews were held in Tallahassee, Florida, where the former British socialite had been serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls. She has since been moved to a minimum-security federal prison “camp” in Texas, prompting criticism from Democrats who charge that the Trump administration is giving her preferential treatment.\n\nIt's unclear what exactly Maxwell told Blanche during the closed-door interviews, but her defense attorney, David Markus, said his client answered all of the government's questions, including those of about 100 different people.\n\nOn July 23, a federal judge in Florida rejected a bid from the Justice Department to unseal grand jury testimony from 2005 and 2007 tied to a federal investigation into Epstein, who hanged himself in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, an autopsy concluded.\n\nMaxwell is seeking to overturn her conviction and has filed a petition with the Supreme Court, which the Justice Department has opposed. Markus said he believes Maxwell deserves relief and has appealed online to Trump for consideration, but said no such offer has been made.\n\nWhen asked if he would consider pardoning Maxwell, Trump told reporters, “It’s something I haven’t thought about.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/09/24/trump-epstein-files-release-congress/86312132007/", "title": "Arizona special election win may force Epstein files release | Opinion", "text": "The U.S. House's 7th District in Arizona is held by one of the 435 elected representatives in this country.\n\nBut a special election there on Sept. 23 tilted that chamber toward yet another showdown in President Donald Trump's desperate bid to keep America from seeing the Epstein files.\n\nU.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, and U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, have 217 signatures from House members backing their bipartisan legislation that calls for U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to release the Department of Justice's files on Jeffrey Epstein. The billionaire was once a bon vivant buddy for Trump before he pleaded guilty in 2008 on Florida charges of soliciting and procuring a person under 18 for prostitution.\n\nMassie and Khanna need just one more signature on their discharge petition to force a vote in the House.\n\nThe Democratic nominee in Arizona's special election, Adelita Grijalva, prevailed as expected in her bid to win the seat held by her father, the late U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, until his death in March.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nShe's eager to sign, telling me this in an email on Election Day: \"If elected, on my very first day in Congress, I’ll sign the bipartisan discharge petition to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files. This is as much about fulfilling Congress’ duty as a constitutional check on this administration as it is about demanding justice for survivors. The days of turning a blind eye to Trump must end.\"\n\nArizona may give Congress the vote it needs to force the release of Epstein files\n\nDaniel Butierez, the Republican nominee in Arizona's special election, also had pledged to sign the petition if he were elected.\n\nSo Massie and Khanna would have gotten to 218 signatures either way. And that's a new headache for House Speaker Mike Johnson, the Louisiana Republican who has done everything in his power – following every order Trump gives him – to shut down real congressional scrutiny for the Epstein files.\n\nRemember when Johnson shut down the House early on July 22 for a six-week summer recess to get his story straight on why he and Trump were attempting to stifle calls to release the Epstein files?\n\nIt came about the time news broke that the attorney general had told Trump in May his name was mentioned multiple times in the Department of Justice's files about Epstein.\n\nSummer break is long over. And the Epstein scandal has not gone away. It even followed Trump across the Atlantic Ocean during his recent state visit to the United Kingdom.\n\nSo what does the House speaker do now to shield the president from scrutiny and whatever terrifies him in the Epstein files?\n\nTrump can't run from his Epstein problem. But a shutdown wouldn't hurt.\n\nEpstein, who died by suicide in federal prison in 2019 during Trump's first term while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, has haunted Trump's second term. And Trump deserves it.\n\nTrump promised while running for reelection in 2024 to release the Epstein files. And then, after winning, he put a pair of Epstein files conspiracy theorists in charge at the FBI, where they have floundered and embarrassed themselves.\n\nThe Massie-Khanna petition has been sitting in the House Rules Committee for three weeks. Johnson could try to bring pressure on that committee to kill it.\n\nBut U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx, the North Carolina Republican who chairs that committee, told Politico in a brief Sept. 2 interview that she would not squelch the petition. A week later, though, Foxx helped vote down an amendment that would have forced the House to release the Epstein files before the discharge petition had 218 signatures.\n\nSo the Epstein scandal spotlight will now shine on Foxx as we wait to see what she does.\n\nBut first, Arizona's new representative for the 7th District House seat must be sworn into office. The state will need to certify the results of the special election and send them to the Clerk of the House to set in motion the oath of office.\n\nThat could take days or weeks. In three previous special elections in 2025 for House seats – two in Florida, one in Virginia – the winners were sworn in one day after their victories.\n\nAnd the winner faces an uncertain future in the House, which may be closed in a government shutdown in a week, when funding for the government expires at midnight Sept. 30.\n\nDemocratic leaders in Congress on Sept. 20 demanded a meeting with Trump to negotiate a continuing resolution to keep funding the government, after he ordered Republican leaders in Congress to box them out of that process. Trump responded that same day that he'd \"love to meet with them\" but didn't expect \"any impact.\"\n\nOn Election Day in Arizona, however, Trump changed his tune completely in a 423-word meandering social media post where he laid out a lengthy and predictable list of grievances while declaring that he would not meet with Democrats.\n\nHmm. A government shutdown could delay the swearing in of a newly elected representative who promises to provide the final signature needed for a petition to force the House to vote on releasing the Epstein files.\n\nIs it any wonder Trump doesn't want to negotiate with Democrats about keeping our government up and running?\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Chris Brennan on X, formerly known as Twitter: @ByChrisBrennan.

They said they were scared of saying anything for years.\n\nPhillips looked down at her phone, then across the way at her friends, then back to her phone. She took deep breaths. She adjusted her shirt, moved her shoulders back, and stood up tall. Finally, she stepped to the podium.\n\n“I stand here today for every woman who has been silenced, exploited and dismissed,” Phillips said. “We are not asking for pity. We are here demanding accountability, and I’m demanding justice.”\n\nPhillips set aside the speech she'd prepared. Instead, she would take back power for herself, the women who spoke before her, and the women who would come after her. They had spent years finding their voices, and this was the first time so many had come together in person as a united force against the late financier and convicted sex offender.\n\n“I would like to announce here today us Epstein survivors have been discussing creating our own list,” she said. “We know the names. Many of us were abused by them. Now, together as survivors, we will confidentially compile the names we all know.”\n\nSix years after Epstein's death, there are hundreds of these women. They call themselves Survivor Sisters, and they're the driving force behind the renewed public pressure to identify Epstein associates they say assaulted them or participated in his trafficking ring. Epstein's estate did not respond to requests for comment. Before he died in 2019, he pleaded not guilty to related charges.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who was friends with Epstein in the 1990s, has reneged on previous promises to release the Epstein files, and top officials in the Department of Justice have denied that certain records exist and said they are unable to obtain others. A bill to force the Department of Justice to release the documents is stalled in Congress. But the issue is unlikely to go away given the unabating public interest.\n\nThe Survivor Sisters credit their success to Virginia Roberts Giuffre, the woman who took on not just Epstein but his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and Britain's Prince Andrew. Roberts Giuffre died by suicide in April, months before the publication of her book describing years of abuse. The Sisters say she showed them how to stand up for themselves.\n\n“Virginia Roberts Giuffre is an American hero,” her lawyer, Brad Edwards, said at the event on Capitol Hill as dozens of Epstein accusers behind him nodded. “She is somebody without whom we would not be able to have this voice.”\n\nIn the weeks since that gathering on Capitol Hill, USA TODAY spoke with three women who recounted being abused when they were younger across multiple states and territories over a period of many years at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThis is their story.\n\nIn her own words: Lisa Phillips tells her complex story of abuse and mentorship\n\nA sisterhood is born\n\nPhillips, who is based in the Los Angeles area, is now a full-time advocate for women's rights in the entertainment industry. She says she knew dozens of other Survivor Sisters from her time as a model in New York City in the early 2000s, the period when she says Epstein was simultaneously abusing her and championing her career. But she said the women didn’t talk about the abuse allegations then.\n\n“We were in denial, and we didn’t really talk about it so much 20 years ago,” Phillips told USA TODAY. “We didn’t really know how to define it or talk about it or what to do about it.”\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Phillips was in her living room watching the news when she saw Roberts Giuffre making allegations that Epstein trafficked her to former Prince Andrew. Phillips, who had never publicly discussed her experiences with Epstein, picked up the phone and called Edwards.\n\n“I said, ‘I know she’s telling the truth,’” Phillips said. “Because I had a girlfriend that was really similar to her – a young blonde girl who was friends with Jeffrey – and she had told me one night that she was (also) abused by Prince Andrew.”\n\nAt first, Buckingham Palace denied such allegations. However, the 65-year-old brother of King Charles, who will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, was stripped of the title \"prince\" on Oct. 31 out of deference to victims of abuse. He previously denied similar accounts.\n\nOther women began to speak out six years ago as a rapid-fire series of events made the news in the federal case against Epstein. In July 2019, federal prosecutors in New York charged Epstein with sex trafficking. About a month later, he was found dead of apparent suicide in his jail cell. In Phillips' view, Epstein's death opened the floodgates.\n\n“There’s something that happens when your abuser dies,” Phillips said. “You’re free.”\n\nFour days after Epstein's death, New York State opened a temporary window for sexual abuse survivors to bring claims against their abusers that otherwise would have been barred by the statute of limitations. Roberts Giuffre wrote in her book that many of her Survivor Sisters filed claims during this period.\n\nAnd when prosecutors requested to dismiss the charges after Epstein’s death, U.S. District Judge Richard Berman said the victims needed a chance to tell their stories in court. So the government flew survivors who wanted to provide victim impact statements to New York for a hearing on Aug. 27, 2019, Roberts Giuffre wrote in her book published on Oct. 21.\n\nThat courthouse is where Marijke Chartouni, who now lives in Seattle and works in a law office, said Roberts Giuffre sat down next to her. They got to know each other after the hearing, when the two of them and a handful of other women went with their shared lawyer to the U.S. Open in Queens and then had dinner together.\n\n“She had this amazing authenticity about her,” Chartouni told USA TODAY. “She was just so herself and just so approachable.”\n\nChampagne, WhatsApp and a trip to Aspen\n\nSurvivor Sisters remember Roberts Giuffre as nurturing, kind and very funny. They say she had an outgoing energy and always offered to pay for the champagne at dinner. She was also a leader and a teacher to them.\n\n“She wanted to have a good time, but she brought a lot of humor to the table,” Rachel Benavidez, a survivor from Albuquerque, New Mexico, told USA TODAY. “And I don’t know if maybe that was a coping mechanism.”\n\nBenavidez, a trained massage therapist who now works as a hospice nurse, couldn’t make the August hearing. She said she met Roberts Giuffre in New York later in 2019 when they appeared on Dateline NBC and were interviewed for an article in Glamour. “(It was) a whole two days I spent with her,” Benavidez said.\n\nThey talked with each other about their time at Zorro Ranch, Epstein’s property in New Mexico, where both women say they were abused, and wondered why they never ran into each other. They talked about Maxwell’s participation in their abuse, her personality, and her dog, Max.\n\nMaxwell's lawyer did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nKnowing each other helped them piece together their stories, but also helped them feel less alone.\n\n“To be an Epstein survivor is very isolating,” Benavidez said, her voice cracking. “Nobody can really understand except all of my other Survivor Sisters.”\n\nPhillips said survivors often lose support from their family members after they speak publicly about being abused. Sometimes their partners don't want them to speak, either.\n\nRoberts Giuffre started a WhatsApp chat for her Survivor Sisters, she wrote in her book. “I felt as if, despite our differences, I could tell these women anything,” Roberts Giuffre wrote in her book.\n\nChartouni said Roberts Giuffre, who spoke openly about her mental health and addiction issues in media interviews, had told her about two times she tried to end her own life, but not about the extent of the alleged domestic violence she was experiencing, which her family members spoke about after her death. A lawyer for Roberts Giuffre’s husband called the allegations “unsubstantiated.”\n\nChartouni recalled that she and Roberts Giuffre, who lived in Australia, discussed motherhood because their kids were around the same age. They bonded about having kids on the autism spectrum. They shared photos of their pets – Roberts Giuffre had a French bulldog and a bird – and would “just both complain about trying to get our sons off the Xbox.”\n\n“I know she had asked me to come to Australia a few times,” Chartouni said. “And she always wanted us all to get together, because I think that’s where she felt most comfortable is having us all talk.”\n\nRoberts Giuffre wrote in her book that she tried to arrange a trip to Aspen, Colorado, and offered to buy plane tickets for her friends. But she said the coronavirus pandemic forced her to cancel.\n\n'I'm taking my power back'\n\nMonths after her death, on Sept. 3, Roberts Giuffre's wish that the women would get together came to fruition. Dozens of Epstein accusers went to Capitol Hill for a rally and a news conference, backed by members of Congress, to advocate for the release of the FBI’s documents on Epstein.\n\nNine women told their stories and urged members of Congress to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which would require the Justice Department to publish all documents and materials related to the investigation and prosecution of Epstein.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, a Republican and close ally to Trump, hasn’t agreed to hold a vote on the bill; however, a coalition of mostly Democratic and a handful of Republican lawmakers is seeking to force one. They need one more signature, and the lawmaker they know will grant it is waiting to be sworn in.\n\nChartouni said the Capitol Hill event came together somewhat chaotically. It was \"a little hush-hush,\" and at times she wondered if it would even happen. But she said survivors who had never come forward before showed up of their own accord, and they got to meet each other.\n\nMarina Lacerda told her story publicly for the first time. She said she was an unnamed victim in Epstein’s 2019 federal indictment and credited the women standing behind her at the podium for helping her find the strength to come forward. She said all of them would continue to strengthen Roberts Giuffre’s voice.\n\nPhillips stood in the background as Jena-Lisa Jones detailed how Epstein pressured her to bring high school girls to his house.\n\n“It was really hard for me to find my voice and to become strong enough to speak about my abuse,” Jones said. “I didn’t come forward until 2019, and even then, it was like I was afraid of a ghost.”\n\nPhillips spoke next. She said in an interview that she imagined Epstein’s unnamed alleged accomplices – many of whose names she says she knows – sitting at home watching the news conference. She said she wanted to send a message to them.\n\n“I really had another speech prepared like the other survivors,” she said. “In the five minutes (before I spoke), I changed my mind, and I was like, ‘You know what, I’m taking my power back. This is bulls---.’”\n\nKeeping in touch\n\nThese days, Phillips said she spends four hours a week doing trauma-focused therapy, covered under a settlement that JP Morgan Chase reached after survivors sued the bank in federal court in New York for its role in handling Epstein’s finances.\n\nShe also hosts a podcast interviewing women who report being abused by serial predators. She says these offenders often know each other and will groom women to pass them around to their friends.\n\n“When it comes to serial predators and why women go back – or why they’re stuck being abused by these powerful men – it’s just a totally different power dynamic,” she says.\n\nBenavidez, from New Mexico, said she and Chartouni, from Seattle, call each other at least once a month. They talk about their kids, their jobs, their relationships. Benavidez talks with the women who have more recently shared their stories. In chats, she makes a point to use a blue butterfly emoji, the symbol of the nonprofit Roberts Giuffre founded.\n\n“I know that when I’m having a tough day and dealing with this and feel like nobody can understand it, I can actually reach out to them, and they will be there for me,” Benavidez said.\n\nOne of those bad days for survivors came Oct. 21, the day Roberts Giuffre's book, “Nobody’s Girl,” hit bookstores. The book immediately made Amazon’s bestseller list. It also dredged up the past.\n\nRoberts Giuffre left a note in the front of the book: “Dedicated to my Survivor Sisters and to anyone who has suffered sexual abuse.”\n\nHer Sisters aren't letting up in their quest for justice against sexual abuse. It's what Roberts Giuffre would've wanted.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/02"}]}

A result of a cooperative partnership by the city of Great Falls, Cascade County, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Department of Transportation, PPL Montana and the volunteer trail advocacy group, Recreational Trails Inc., it is one of the urban delights of Great Falls that blends the city with its rural surroundings. Some of its \"splashy features include Black Eagle Falls, Rainbow Falls, Crooked Falls, Ryan Falls (the \"great falls of the Missouri\") and Morony Falls, outdoor art and memorial benches and tables and picnic shelters.\n\nIn 1990, Recreational Trails Inc. formed to help forge the riverside route, which grows each year with new places and trails to explore. The paved, wheelchair-accessible trail runs along the south shore of the river, from Oddfellows Park, which is near the Warden Bridge on 10th Avenue South, past Broadwater Bay, Mitchell Pool, Gibson and Elks Riverside Parks, Black Eagle Falls, the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center, Giant Springs Heritage State Park and Rainbow Falls to the Crooked Falls Overlook. The asphalt ends there, but the trail doesn't. A dirt trail stretches along the cliffs another three miles to Cochrane Dam.\n\nEast of Great Falls, the North Shore Trail follows along Cochrane, Ryan and Morony reservoirs. The trail begins at the end of Rainbow Dam Road and includes gravel and single track segments totaling more than 13 miles. A single-track trail now runs between Rainbow and Morony dams, and a trailhead has been established at Rainbow Dam. An expert single-track trail between Ryan and Cochrane dams provides an exceptional way to explore the river canyon east of town. Interpretive signs describing the ecology of the area have been provided by the Cascade Conservation District and the Missouri River Council, and QR Code signs along the trail make information about the trail and dams available to smartphone users.\n\nThe Montana Department of Transportation has completed the design of the Sun River Connector Trail to extend a separated bike and pedestrian connection along Country Club Blvd., between the west approach of the Warden Bridge and 6th Street Southwest, and construction will begin in 2016. This summer's improvements will include a paved loop from Heritage Park down to Giant Springs, a new trail between the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center and Giant Springs and the opening of a 2.1-mile loop linking the Heritage Center, Giant Springs and Heritage Park.

Russell Museum\n\nVisitors from all over the world enjoy the Great Falls museum named after the famous cowboy artist who adopted Great Falls as his home more than a century ago. They also can enjoy the Russell Rider Sculpture Garden, a place \"families can come, free of charge, all four seasons\" to picnic, roam the garden and appreciate wonderful art including five major bronze pieces. Five galleries have been installed to showcase the \"astonishing depth and range\" of Russell's art, which ranged from paintings and sculpture to illustrated letters and pen-and-ink drawings during his lifetime (1864-1926). The museum has some 2,000 Russell artworks, personal objects and a \"permanent collection of more than 12,000 objects\" including works of such well-known artists as O.C. Seltzer, Winold Reiss, J.H. Sharp and Frank Tenney Johnson.\n\nDon't miss \"The Bison: American Icon, Heart of the Plains Indian Culture,\" the most ambitious permanent exhibition ever displayed at the C.M. Russell Museum. With about 500 artifacts and a thundering buffalo diorama that shakes as you walk over it, the $1.5 million exhibition is a fitting subject because three-quarters of the Russell Museum's entire collection of paintings and sculpture involve Indians and bison. The \"Browning Firearms Collection\" of rifles, shotguns and handguns surveys the significant developments made by the Browning, Winchester and Colt companies. New this season is \"Harmless Hunter: The Wildlife Work of Charles M. Russell,\" runs through Sept. 13, and \"focuses for the first time on Russell's painting of wildlife.\"\n\nRight beside the museum is Russell's Log Studio, built in 1903. The artifacts in it belonged to Russell and were used for reference in his artwork. The Russell home next door was built in 1900 under the supervision of his wife, Nancy.

Black Eagle Falls, the uppermost of the five falls, is visible from the big windows of the interpretive center. Outside, four pedestrian trails connect the interpretive center with Giant Springs Heritage State Park, and a bicycle-pedestrian trail connects the interpretive center with the River's Edge Trail via a tunnel beneath Giant Springs Road.\n\nInside the center, the exhibits are educational and interactive. The ground floor includes the ornate Compass Rose, with a list of private contributors who helped finance the original construction. Only half of the construction cost was funded with federal money. Pictographs tell the explorers' story in Indian drawings. Grabbing the most attention as visitors enter the center is a striking life-size diorama of buckskin-clad explorers hefting a 30-foot canoe up a ravine in their portage around the falls. The exhibit stretches two stories and is framed by vast windows overlooking the Missouri.\n\nThe center \"imparts to the public a personal sense of President Thomas Jefferson's vision of expanding America to the west; it inspires awe and awakens curiosity toward the challenges faced by the expedition as they portaged the great falls of the Missouri river and explored the 'unknown'; brings to life the daily experiences of the expedition and the environment and native peoples of the 'uncharted West'; and celebrated the indomitable spirit of human discovery we all share,\" according to the center's mission statement.\n\nThe 26th Annual Lewis and Clark Festival is taking place June 19-21 and promises to deliver participants \"back to ways of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and life out on the open frontier of the West.\" This special event includes historical programs, children's activities, Native American cultural programs, artisans and local craftspeople and a variety of local food vendors.\n\nOn Fridays beginning June 26, \"Riverside Voices,\" staff of the center and guest presenters, offer evening programs in the amphitheater on the bluffs overlooking the Missouri River or in the indoor theater. Topics include medicine on the expedition, the boats used in the journey, changes in the river since the exploration and more Lewis and Clark history and related subjects.

This is also the site of the Roe River, once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's shortest river. Giant Springs flows at a measured 7.9 million gallons per hour or 156 million gallons of water per day. The water stays at a temperature of 54 degrees and has been carbon dated to be about 3,000 years old. More than a quarter of a million lovers of nature visit Giant Springs Heritage Park each year. Many come to marvel at this remarkable feature, or to view the 80-plus species of birds, mammals and reptiles. On any day you may find bicyclists, fishing enthusiasts, photographers and many others; some come to visit the nearby Rainbow Falls Overlook, the visitor center and the fish hatchery.\n\nThe fish hatchery program raises from 700,000 to 800,000 fish annually. They are then distributed to areas in central Montana from the Canadian border to the Wyoming border. A group picnic site is also available. The Fish, Wildlife and Parks visitor center (right across from the roadway from the springs) features taxidermy mounts of grizzly and black bears, educational features on fish and bird recognition, wildlife photographs, and a mini-theater that shows wildlife videos. Pets on leash are welcome.\n\nEvents at the park include ranger talks dealing with the wildlife of the area, bird strolls and kids activities.

Built of native gray sandstone, the structure was completed in 1896 and served for 34 years as a high school and for 45 years as a junior high. \"Art is for everyone\" is the premise of the Square; since 1977, it has provided a \"dynamic program of exhibitions, classes, lectures, tours and performances designed to nurture the region's creative spirit.\"\n\nThe \"Val Knight Retrospective,\" a new permanent exhibition has been added to the Square and includes 25 remarkable works done from the 1960s to the 1990s by the late Great Falls artist in a variety of media that includes encaustic paintings, ceramic figurines and graphic drawings.

Located at Park Drive and 1st Avenue North, Gibson Park features a duck pond, flower gardens, a walking path, basketball courts, restrooms and a playground. Summertime concerts take place at an outdoor band shell. A pedestrian underpass from Gibson Park takes you to Elks Riverside Park, a lesser-known but huge park along the river that features tennis courts, horseshoe pits, a skate park, playground equipment and large expanses of grass where you can fly a kite, play catch or simply relax.\n\nAny sunny day, you'll also find people picnicking, playing games or simply lounging in the rest of the city's 400 acres developed into 57 parks. Two dozen usable public tennis courts also are scattered around the city. A complex of eight courts is available for public use at C.M. Russell High School.

Call Parks and Recreation Administration at 771-1265 for more information.\n\n14 Pacific Steel and Recycling Trailside Dog Park\n\nAn attractively fenced and landscaped area where dogs can \"run free and play 'off leash' with their canine and human friends,\" the dog park, located at 800 River Drive North alongside River's Edge Trail, was opened July 15, 2009. The park was built for less than $100,000 and was financed by gifts to the Animal Foundation of Great Falls, which donated the park to the city of Great Falls. The park features a small pavilion in the middle and separate fenced and landscaped areas equipped for small and large dogs. The dividing line for dog size is 25 pounds. A paved path in the large-dog park was recently installed to protect the turf, and agility equipment on both sides of the park allows for better exercise.\n\nDog owners will find there is no charge to use the park, but they are still responsible for proper pet etiquette and obeying the rules of the Dog Park. Disposal bags and garbage cans are readily available, but drinking fountains for both humans and dogs are rather temperamental, so it's wise to bring your own water. The park is open from dawn to dusk, but it may be closed on occasion for maintenance or improvements. Watch the Tribune for announcements or call the Park and Recreation office at 771-1265. For more information, visit the foundation's website at www.theanimalfoundation.com.\n\n15 First Peoples Buffalo Jump State Park\n\nFormerly called \"Ulm Pishkun,\" it is believed to be the largest prehistoric bison kill site in North America and has now been nominated to be designated a National Historic Landmark.

Eagle Falls, adjacent to Legion Park at 25th Street and River Drive North, and Anaconda Hills, a short, hilly course in Black Eagle on the north side of the Missouri River, 2400 Smelter Ave. Both courses offer driving ranges as well as full pro shops and concessions. Other courses include Hickory Swing, a public course at 1100 American Ave., and Meadow Lark Country Club at the confluence of the Sun and Missouri rivers at 300 Country Club Blvd.\n\nEagle Falls Golf Club is an 18-hole course open to the public. Opened in 1953, it underwent a major re-design in 1999 and now plays from 5,234 to 6,571 yards as a par 71. Four sets of tees make it inviting for the casual player and extremely challenging for the avid golfer. There is also a newly designed chipping green, a putting green, practice bunker and a limited driving range. Reserve tee times two days in advance by calling 761-1078.\n\nAnaconda Hills Golf Course is also a city-run course opened originally in the 1920s as a nine-hole course for the employees of the Anaconda Copper Co. The city acquired the course in the 1970s, and nine new holes and grass greens were added in 1992. Hilly and tree-lined with natural rough and water, the par 69 course is slightly less than 5,700 yards. Call 761-8459.\n\nFounded in 1919, the private Meadow Lark Country Club is recognized as having one of the great classic designs with a reputation for sleek, undulating greens. The 18-hole championship course is considered one of the top 10 places to play in Montana. The club also includes a clubhouse, \"award-winning pro shop, formal dining room and more casual grill room, three indoor and four outdoor tennis courts and a swimming pool open Memorial Day to Labor Day. Call 453-6531.\n\nHickory Swing is an 18-hole par 60 executive golf course in west Great Falls. It plays 3,731 yards over 86 acres. It was built in 1992 as a course for all skill levels.

Open from February (weather permitting) through October, the course now opens at 6 a.m. for early-bird golfers. $20 for 18 holes, $12 for nine; call 452-9400 for available tee times.\n\n19 The Great Falls Dams\n\nThe beautiful waterfalls east of Great Falls now are mostly covered by a series of hydroelectric dams. But glimpses of the falls so famously journaled by Lewis and Clark remain, especially when water is running high on the Missouri. Visitors have several opportunities to view these dams. Perhaps the easiest is Black Eagle Dam, which can be seen close up on the River's Edge Trail or from an overlook on River Road. Just downstream, Rainbow Dam has also been offering beautiful views since 1910 and has undergone a construction project increasing its generating capacity by 70 percent. Between these two is Cochrane Dam, part of the Great Falls Portage National Landmark, which produces 64 megawatts of electricity. Ryan Dam, the original \"great falls of the Missouri,\" is an especially fun destination. A suspension foot bridge leads to an island from which visitors can climb to an observation point and get a full-on view of the dam. The island has a picnic and cooking area very popular with families. Morony Dam is 15 miles northeast of Great Falls. It's classified as a \"run-of-river\" project because it can generate electricity using the water that flows down the river without need to store additional supplies. Boaters, hikers and fishermen should call 454-5840 for current trailhead, boat launch and parking closures.\n\n20 Black Eagle Memorial Island\n\nBlack Eagle Memorial Island opened to the public for the first time in 2005. Located just below Black Eagle Falls, the man-made island was created from material dredged out of the tailrace below the Black Eagle Dam's generation station. In the past, it was used as a parking lot for smelter workers at the former Anaconda Mining Co. complex. Today the area features a restored truss bridge, exceptional stone walls, a launch for non-motorized boats and an interpretive viewing plaza below the falls. The area is open for hiking, biking, kayaking, canoeing and fishing and is part of the new River's Edge Trail section that links West Bank Park to the island.\n\n21 Missouri River Breaks National Monument\n\nOn a topographical map of Montana, the Missouri River Breaks look like a crumpled brown grocery bag extending west to east along the Missouri River from Fort Benton to Fort Peck. The Arrow Creek Breaks and the Musselshell Breaks contribute to the larger geographic area from the south. The Breaks, located in northcentral Montana, offer some of the finest recreational opportunities in the entire state, from river floating to hiking to hunting to horseback riding.\n\nOn the ground, the Breaks consist of rough ridges separated by steep — sometimes almost vertical — coulees. The vegetation consists of scattered Ponderosa pine, juniper, Douglas fir and mixed grasses growing in a shale/gumbo soil type. While not the most hospitable region for humans, the Breaks provide suitable habitat for an impressive list of wildlife species.\n\nThe Breaks mean different things to different people. It is defined, in part, by the history of Lewis and Clark, as a sanctuary for desperados staying a step ahead of the law and as a source of hope and inspiration for several generations of homesteaders. Some enjoy the remote area mostly for the solitude and recreational opportunities provided by the Upper Missouri River, Fort Peck Reservoir and a mixture of public and private lands. Others see the Breaks as a source of grass for livestock, natural gas, timber products and other vital pieces of our economic puzzle.\n\nIn 2001, a portion of the public land in the Breaks managed by the Bureau of Land Management, roughly 375,000 acres, was designated as the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument.\n\nU.S. Highway 87 accesses the western portion of the monument at Fort Benton. On the eastern edge, U.S. Highway 101 crosses the monument and the Missouri at the James Kipp Recreation Area, and Montana Highway 236 also provides access through Lewistown, Winifred and Big Sandy.\n\nThere are no motels, service stations or restaurants in the interior of the Monument. The Missouri Breaks Interpretive Center in Fort Benton is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday Call 622-4000.\n\n22 Monarch and Neihart\n\nAn hour's drive from Great Falls, these neighboring mountain towns are located in a historic mining district. The mines are closed, but the surrounding mountains are open to fun. Local creeks offer excellent fishing. There are scores of trails and backcountry roads to explore on foot, mountain bike or all-terrain vehicle. Check at trailheads for info on motorized access. Check out the easy, half-mile hike to popular Memorial Falls. Camping is available in some areas. The wildlife viewing is terrific. And winter offers a wide range of activities, including snowmobiling, downhill skiing, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.\n\n23 Sluice Boxes State Park\n\nJust south of Belt, where Belt Creek slices out of the Little Belt Mountains is an area of soaring limestone cliffs and precipitous ledges, the Belt Creek Canyon and Sluice Boxes State Park. Rich in history and geologic features, the park provides excellent hiking and viewing of abundant wildlife in a wide range of habitats from shaded rock walls and miniature waterfalls to open, sun-baked slopes covered in prairie grasses. Enjoying the park, however, is not for the faint of heart. Because the train bridges were removed, hikers must ford the creek. That's nearly impossible during high water, so hiking in the Sluice Boxes is limited to the low-water season — usually mid-July through September. The creek is spring-fed and cold. Backcountry camping is allowed with permit year-round. The only facilities are the parking lot, vault toilet and the trail which follows an abandoned rail grade. Call 454-5840 or visit stateparksmt.gov/sluice-boxes.\n\n24 Fort Benton's Riverfront\n\nThe historic community of Fort Benton, 42 miles north of Great Falls, boasts a stunning setting on the banks of the Missouri River. The site of a pre-Civil War trading post and key economic point during the \"steamboat era,\" the town is the water gateway to the Missouri Breaks National Monument and a popular launch site for rafts and canoes. Reconstruction of three buildings of the fort is taking place; the Northeast Bastion and Blockhouse are now historically accurate. A heroic-sized statue of explorers Lewis and Clark overlooks the river along a scenic walking path. Another statue immortalizes Shep, a legendarily faithful dog. A walking bridge spans the river and offers benches for rest and reflection. There's lots to do elsewhere in town, which has two museums and a historic restored hotel, the Grand Union, which boasts a fine restaurant. From June 26 to 28, visitors may experience Montana's premier small town festival. In celebration of Chouteau County's 150th birth, the theme this year is \"Footsteps Through Time.\" Call 750-2918.\n\n25 Havre Beneath the Streets\n\nThe Historical Underground Tour is a recreation of Havre's history. When fire destroyed most of Havre, business owners moved underground to carry on their business until the town could be rebuilt. Step back in time as much as 100 years, into the Sporting Eagle Saloon, a turn-of-the-century honky-tonk where cowboys gambled, kicked up their heels and drank good old-fashioned frontier rot-gut. Saunter along the streets beneath Havre and see an opium den (one of three known to have existed in the early days), a Chinese laundry, an ethnic restaurant, and, of course, a bordello.\n\nTours are available during summer months Monday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with the last tour beginning at 3:30 p.m. Reservations are recommended; the ticket office is at 120 3rd Ave., south of Norman's Ranch Wear.

Take a one-hour walking tour for a close-up look at the best-preserved bison kill and campsite in this area of the plains. The Brick Mural is now complete in the shadow of the Bear Paw Mountains. The site is non-sterile, so visitors may handle certain artifacts. Open June 1 to Labor Day from 9 a.m. to 4.p.m. Tours are usually available \"on demand.\" Call 265-6417 or visit www.buffalojump.org for more information.\n\n27 Fort Assiniboine Historic Site\n\nFort Assiniboine Historic Site, located 6 miles southwest of Havre on Highway 87, was constructed in 1879, and became the largest military fort west of the Mississippi River. The post had 104 buildings and was contained within a 40-mile-long by 15-mile-wide military reservation. Several of the original buildings still stand. It became a state agricultural experiment station in 1911 and is now the home of Montana State University's Northern Agricultural Research Center. The primary mission of the fort's garrison was to prevent attacks from the some 5,000 Lakota Sioux Indians led by Sitting Bull, and other chiefs who had fled to the safety of Canada after the Battle of the Little Big Horn.\n\nThe fort served as a base for patrols along the Canadian border and the Milk River Valley. Fort Assiniboine became the state's military headquarters, with the responsibility of maintaining control over the Blackfoot Confederacy and other northern Montana Indian reservations. The most famous soldier to serve at the fort was John J. Pershing, who was assigned to the post in 1896. He commanded H Troop, the black \"Buffalo Soldiers\" of the 10th Cavalry. The Fort Assiniboine Preservation Society offers summer tours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Mon.-Fri., and by appointment for the weekends. For additional information, call 262-7656.\n\nThe Northern Agricultural Research Center will celebrate its 100th anniversary with several events including the annual field day and tours July 1 with the first tour beginning at 1 p.m. The new office building will be dedicated, and agri-business awards presented. Call 265-6115.\n\n28 Charlie Russell Chew Choo\n\nExperience the beauty of rolling hills, vast ranch lands and breathtaking sunsets from the comfort of a vintage train; possibly masked bandits may even stage a hold-up when least expected. Now beginning at Kingston Junction, near Lewistown, and crossing three trestle bridges on its route to Denton and back, the 3.5 hour trip offers includes a full course prime rib dinner, dessert, no-host cash bar and musical entertainment. Built on the spur track connecting Lewistown and Great Falls 100 years ago, the five 1950-vintage stainless steel cars make 12 trips between May 10 and Oct. 3. Reservations are encouraged and can be made at montana-dinertrain.com or by calling 535-5436.\n\n29 Freezout Lake\n\nFreezout Lake and its surrounding 11,466 acres, is a prime hot spot for bird lovers in Montana. In spring, hundreds of thousands of migrating snow geese stop at Freezout for a rest before flying north to Canada's Alberta and Saskatchewan, and then to nesting grounds at the Arctic coast. Park officials recommend viewing from sunrise to 10 a.m. and from 4:30 p.m. to dusk in early March, but wildlife viewing is available year round. For a more enjoyable experience, stay for a maximum of 14 days. Bring binoculars or telescope, a light lunch and warm clothing.

The chokecherry, a small, maroon-colored, tart fruit that grows wild in Montana, will reign supreme on the first Saturday after Labor Day. The festival traditionally is attended by close to 4,000 people. The day starts with the Kiwanis Club serving an outdoor breakfast at Main Street and Second Avenue.

The flight of the Nez Perce, led by Chief Joseph from Army soldiers, took them from Oregon, through Idaho, into Montana and almost to the Canadian border before they were defeated. Here the tribe split up, with some heading to Canada and others to Nebraska. The Nez Perce ceased fighting at Bear Paw on Oct. 5, 1877, and Chief Joseph gave his immortal speech, \"From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.\" The battlefield is open daily year-round during daylight hours but closed for lunch from noon to 1 p.m. Visitors may walk a self-guided 1.25-mile interpretive trail of moderate difficulty and are encouraged to visit the Blaine County Museum at 501 Indiana St. in Chinook and see the audio/visual presentation \"40 Miles to Freedom\" before touring the battlefield. There are no fees. Call 406-357-2590.\n\n34 Benton Lake National Wildlife Refuge\n\nLocated at 922 Bootlegger Trail and administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Benton Lake National Wildlife Refuge is a 13-square-mile oasis of grasslands and wetlands lying within a sea of agriculture. Mountain ranges surround three sides, forming a backdrop to a scene that reminds visitors of the days when the entire prairie-wetland ecosystem was alive with thousands of different birds. Benton Lake was created thousands of years ago by the continental glacier, and the area was excluded from homesteading in 1885 in order to provide an irrigation district. Animals abound in the refuge and include water birds such as ducks, Canada geese, snow geese and tundra swans. Also common are sightings of dozens of species of mammals, including mountain cottontail, American badger, striped skunk and long-tailed weasel. Ten numbered signs along the Wildlife Auto Tour correspond to a map provided at the information kiosk at the beginning of the drive, helping visitors reflect on species, habitat, history and management of Benton Lake NWR. Follow Highway 87 north out of Great Falls about 1 mile and turn left onto Bootlegger Trail. Then go about 9 miles to the refuge entrance. The visitor center is open 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday to Friday Call 406-727-7400.\n\n35 The Annual Montana Atlatl Mammoth Hunt\n\nExperts and novices from around the country, and even the world, come to try their hand at throwing the atlatl, an 8,000-year-old hunting weapon, and occasionally the primitive bow, tomahawk and knife. Regional members of the World Atlatl Association in conjunction with First Peoples Buffalo State Park set targets along one section of the trail. Participants are required to walk the trail, so bring hiking boots or comfortable shoes. Hunts are set for Sept. 5-6. Call 866-2217 for further information.\n\nMISSOURI COUNTRY\n\n36 Fort Peck Lake Reservoir and Recreation Area\n\nBehind the 3.8 mile long Fort Peck Dam — the world's largest hydroelectric earthen dam — is the state's largest body of water, Fort Peck Lake Reservoir. It is surrounded by 1,520 miles of shoreline — that's more than California has with the Pacific Ocean. The fishing is great with more than 50 kinds of fish, including walleye, bass, ling and salmon, northern pike, perch and sauger. Open Memorial Day to Labor Day, the shore also offers camping, boating and swimming. A paved road for larger vehicles provides access to the reservoir at Fort Peck Marina; all other access roads are gravel or dirt. The C.M. Russell Wildlife Refuge surrounds the body of water and consists of more than 1 million acres available for hiking, camping, fishing and other recreation.

The 18,000-square-foot building's most impressive feature is in the cathedral-like lobby — it's a 40-foot-long replica of Tyrannosaurus Rex, affectionately known as \"Peck's Rex.\" The museum also features 10 fleshed-out head mounts of other prehistoric beasts, as well as a wildlife display with full-body mounts of elk, badgers, deer and other native species. Two of Montana's largest aquariums showcase the many species of fish in the Fort Peck Reservoir and the Missouri River.

In 2006, they received state funding for the creation of the museum. Opened in 2008, the 3,000-square-foot Great Plains Dinosaur Museum showcases a \"stunning variety\" of real fossils of fish, squids, lobsters and rare crabs, plants and some of Montana's best-preserved dinosaurs, including Triceratops, Stegasaurus, Sauropod, raptor Dromesaurus and Handrosaurus.

Visitors interested in their turn-of-the-century exploits can still check out several sites along the so-called Outlaw Trail. Start in Scobey, near the beginning of the trail, where Dutch Henry and his gang frequently hung out at the Dug Out Saloon. Much of the history is captured at the Daniels County Museum and Pioneer Town, where 35 historic buildings were restored to depict a town in the early part of the century. If you're in Scobey the last weekend in June, stop by for Pioneer Days, featuring the (family-friendly) Dirty Shame Show. Call 406-487-5965 to confirm dates.

Call Complex headquarters at 538-7521.\n\nGLACIER COUNTRY\n\n42 Blackfeet Indian Reservation\n\nWhile most of the members of Montana's largest Indian tribe, the Blackfeet, live much like mainstream Western society, they also have maintained traditions such as the use of painted tepees, colorful headdresses and deerskin costumes on special occasions. The Museum of the Plains Indian, near the intersection of U.S. Highways 2 and 89 in Browning, has a comprehensive collection of cultural artifacts and exhibits as well as a gift shop featuring a wide variety of Native American art and jewelry. Interpreter-guided tours, offering a deeper look at the history of the Blackfeet people, begin at the Museum of the Plains Indian and cover sites such as Sun Dance, Buffalo Jumps, Tepee Rings, Holy Family Mission and Fort McLeod Road. The museum is open Tuesday-Saturday, 9 a.m.-4:45 p.m., through Labor Day. Call 338-2230.

The Heart Butte Society Celebration will be held Aug. 6-9 at Heart Butte, a town 26 miles south of Browning.\n\n43 Glacier National Park\n\nThe breathtaking vistas of Glacier National Park draw visitors from all over the world. This 1-million-acre national park preserves some of America's most gorgeous country — including 106 miles of the Continental Divide — and the abundant wildlife that inhabits its wilderness.\n\nGlacier National Park has been revered by the Plains Indians for many generations. Archeologists have found evidence of human activity in the Glacier Park area that dates back 10,000 years. These early people may have been the ancestors of the Blackfeet, Salish and Kootenai Indians. Meriwether Lewis came close to the southern tip of Glacier in 1806, checking how far north the Missouri River watershed extended. White explorers kept searching for the perfect mountain pass through which to run a railroad line over the Rockies. Although many of the region's Native Americans knew the location of Marias Pass, the Blackfeet guarded it closely. In 1889, an explorer for the Great Northern Railway, John F. Stevens, finally figured out where Marias Pass lay. Marias was the lowest mountain pass between Canada and Mexico. Its low altitude and easy grade made it perfect for trains to cross the Continental Divide. The mountains east of the Continental Divide were acquired from the Blackfeet in 1895 and designated a national wilderness forest preserve in 1900, opening it to mining. President William Howard Taft signed the bill to establish Glacier as a national park in 1910.\n\nPortions of the Going-to-the-Sun Road remain open all year, but unpredictable spring snow storms can slow plowing progress. For current road status, visit home.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/hours.htm. Other roads open in May, weather permitting. The summer rate for a 7-day vehicle (non-commercial car, truck or van) permit is $25 with the 7-day single-entry price for visitors traveling by foot, bicycle, motorcycle or in a non-commercial organized group is set at $12. There is no entrance fee on Aug. 25 and Sept. 26.\n\nThere are 700 miles of hiking trails, and many visitors wouldn't miss a chance to hike along the Garden Wall. Campers have a choice of about 1,200 first-come, first-serve campsites accessible by vehicle, and permits are available for 13 country front campgrounds. The historic Many Glacier Hotel has recently undergone a $10 million renovation, but historic hotels book up fast; call Glacier Park Inc. at 892-2525 or Apgar Village Lodge at 888-5484.Tour buses and boats are available seasonally, and guided hiking trips and American Indian interpretive tours are also available. Many visitors also make arrangements to cross the border into Waterton Lakes National Park on the Canadian side of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.\n\n44 Izaak Walton Inn\n\nLocated just off Highway 2 at Essex, on the southern tip of Glacier National Park, is the picturesque Izaak Walton Inn. It was built in 1939 for train crews on the Great Northern Railway. Today it's a popular inn, restaurant and mini railroad museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The dining room walls are covered with old photographs and prints of trains. \"Relaxation is key,\" and \"room telephones are absent\" in the inn. For a different experience, rent one of the four old cabooses that have been converted into overnight lodging or stay in one of six new family cabins. Additional lodging is now available in the GN 441 Luxury Locomotive which features 44-year-old reclaimed oak floors and a full kitchen, and the JJ Caboose, named for James Jerome Hill, the Empire Builder of the Great Northern Railway, for an unsurpassed cozy western retreat. The trains still run past the inn, with passenger service available. And Essex is a great place from which to find a trailhead into the surrounding mountains. You may also book Glacier interpretive Red Bus tours or whitewater raft trips from the inn. For information or reservations, call 406-888-5700 or visit www.izaakwaltoninn.com.\n\n45 Flathead Valley\n\nIn the northwest corner of Montana lies the picturesque Flathead Valley.

Located on the edge of Whitefish and just west of Glacier Park, Whitefish Mountain Resort is a world-class downhill ski destination. It offers lodging, restaurants, lots of activities and some of the best views in the area. That goes for summer, too. Take the 15-minute gondola ride to the top of the mountain and witness stunning vistas of Glacier Park and the surrounding area. Have lunch, and then hop the gondola for the trip down.

People of all ability levels may enjoy the Aerial Adventure Park where they can learn to navigate treetop courses. In July and August wildflower walks are offered. Other guided tours are also available. Visit skiwhitefish.com.\n\n49 Flathead Lake\n\nFlathead Lake is the most popular — and most used — water playground in the state. It's the largest natural freshwater lake in the Western states. The lake is 28 miles long and, at its widest, 15 miles across. Maximum depth is 386 feet. Anglers delight in the fishing. The lake is known for its lake trout, cutthroat trout, perch, bass and whitefish. State parks along the lake offer great access for boating, swimming and camping. The lake is popular for speed boating, sailing, jet skiing, canoeing, kayaking and parasailing. Small islands offer great opportunities to observe birds and wildlife. There's lots of lodging and restaurants available along different stretches of the shore.\n\n50 Yaak Falls\n\nThis waterfall is the highlight for many visitors as they tour through the Yaak area in extreme northwest Montana. During spring and early summer tremendous viewing opportunities abound in the Yaak River area as snowmelt follows its way down and over the falls. For any photographer, this is one sight that shouldn't be missed. This site can be found on a Kootenai National Forest Visitors Map at Township 33N, Range 33W, Section 9. The Yaak Falls, named after the Yaak Indians who once populated this remote area of Montana, has always been a favorite stop on the scenic tour of northwest Montana. This beautifully cascading waterfall was created by the eastward shift of the Pacific plate. As a result of this shifting, some of the oldest rock in the world is exposed. The rock is dated between 800 million and 11/2 billion years old. This area is rich in local history, dating back to the 1880s. Part of an old bridge can be seen just below the falls. This bridge was the first structure to span the Yaak River. This allowed unrestricted passage from Troy to another important mining town called Sylvanite. Many placer mining camps, including one called \"Snipe Town,\" operated near the falls in the 1890s. In 1910, a devastating fire destroyed mining operations around the falls area. The Yaak Falls Campground is a little pack-in, pack-out campground with a maximum stay of 14 days and no fees. No toilets or drinking water are available. Call 295-4693.\n\n51 Hot Springs\n\nHot Springs, founded in 1910, is named for the local hot mineral springs that still bubble today. Thousands of people seeking rest and relief from pressure travel to the town of Hot Springs to bathe in the fine mineral water and mud baths. Many revisit on a regular basis, enjoying the benefits and relief that the natural hot mineral waters bring in the treatment of arthritis, skin diseases, rheumatism, stomach ulcers, high blood pressure and many other ailments. Opportunities for privacy, quietness, and relaxation abound in this area. Many lakes, streams and rivers provide excellent fishing for the avid fisherman. Nearby sight-seeing attractions include a tour of the National Bison Range at Moiese, a visit to the historical St. Ignatius Mission Church and Flathead Lake with its many opportunities for boating, jet skiing, water skiing and fishing.\n\n52 Seeley Lake\n\nNamed for the lake it abuts, Seeley Lake is a small town quickly growing in popularity with tourists. In winter, it's known for great snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, dog sledding and ice fishing. Summer recreation is even more plentiful. The lake itself offers camping, boating, swimming and fishing. Nearby trails head off into both the Bob Marshall and Mission Mountain wilderness areas. Folks on mountain bikes and all-terrain vehicles love all the old logging roads. The Clearwater River, which runs south through the valley, and the Swan River which flows north, offer fishing and canoeing. Golfers enjoy the nine-hole mountain course and more at Double Arrow Resort on the south edge of town. Call the Seeley Lake Area Chamber of Commerce at 677-2880.\n\nSeveral guest ranches offer horseback riding. There's camping and boating also available at nearby Swan Lake and Placid Lake. Just a short drive from Seeley Lake is the trailhead to Morrell Falls. A fairly flat, 2.5-mile hike leads to a stunning drop of falls — and a great place for a picnic. The hike is popular with families because children often enjoy splashing in Morrell Creek below the falls. Bring drinking water.\n\n53 The Sweet Palace\n\nIndulge your sweet tooth at the Sweet Palace at 109 E. Broadway in Philipsburg, and view what nostalgic, sumptuous sweets are cooking. Choose from 50 kinds of fudge, more than 72 flavors of saltwater taffy, 20 varieties of caramels or luxurious hand-dipped chocolates.

In 1991, cabinet builder Chuck Kaparich told city residents that if they'd provide a home for it, he'd build the carousel. When it opened four years later, more than 100,000 volunteer hours were logged on the project. Locals volunteered time and materials. The result: 38 hand-carved ponies, two chariots, 14 gargoyles and the largest band organ in continuous use in the country. A carving organization in Calgary, Alberta, even carved a friendship horse for the project. It's all contained within a building that looks like a jewel box. Dragons Hollow, the play area for children was added next to the carousel in 1995. Hours are 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. June-August. Call 549-8382.\n\n55 Historical Museum at Fort Missoula\n\nCommunity members joined together in 1974 to save what was left of the historic 1877 Fort Missoula which had housed the black 25th Infantry in 1888 and served as a military training center during World War I, regional headquarters of the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 and as an alien detention center in 1941. The post was decommissioned in 1947. Today the museum is the collection point for history and memorabilia of the Missoula area. Located on 32 acres, it houses 13 structures and more than 25,000 artifacts.

The M-hike is an ideal family activity, but the more ambitious hiker may consider tackling Sentinel itself. Reaching the summit is a bit more strenuous than the M, with an elevation gain of almost 2,000 feet in about one mile. From the summit, hikers have several options to extend their hike or descend the same way they came up. Mt. Jumbo, Mt. Sentinel's sister peak, branded with an L for Loyola High School, offers a climb of barely a mile, but there are fewer switchbacks to help with the climb.\n\n57 Alberton Gorge\n\nSome 30 miles west of Missoula on the Clark Fork River is the Alberton Gorge, the area's premier whitewater run for rafting and kayaking. It features Class III water, as well as quiet pools for swimming and fishing. Floaters are treated to many varieties of birds and wildlife, dramatic cliffs and roller-coaster rapids.

In recent years archaeologists found evidence of the expedition's main cook fire and latrine, which confirmed the explorers had been there. Activities for visitors include bird watching, children's activities, educational programs and fly fishing. Open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. throughout the summer, the visitors' center opens at 9 a.m. The entrance is located ½ mile west of Lolo. Call 273-4253 or visit www.travelersrest.org.\n\n59 Garnet Ghost Town\n\n\"To walk the streets of this ghost town is to step back in time, free from intrusion of modern society!\"A former gold-mining camp east of Missoula, Garnet once boasted some 1,000 residents, a school, many businesses and 13 bars. But by 1912 the gold had played out and a raging fire sent most of the remaining residents packing. Today, Garnet is now considered the state's best-preserved ghost town. Garnet is open to tourists. Open year-round, but access is limited to snowmobile or cross-country skis in winter. For access instructions and restrictions, visit garnetghosttown.net or call 329-3914.\n\nGOLD WEST COUNTRY\n\n60 Virginia City\n\nVirginia City — and the nearby Nevada City — had their glory days during the 1860s gold rush. Seemingly frozen in time, much of their splendor is well preserved, and Virginia City now is a hot destination for history buffs and others seeking a window on the state's past. Virginia City is a National Historic Landmark, a very much alive ghost town that boasts a tremendous collection of old-west memorabilia. Many of the buildings are restored and now give visitors a real-life feel of the past. The Nevada City Living History Museum is open every summer.

It showcases the development of the cattle industry over the last 150 years with 80 historical structures including a ranch house, bunkhouse and outbuildings which operate much today as they did in the late 1800s and commemorate the role of cattlemen in American history. Visitors may reflect on Montana's early ranch days by beginning guided tours at the main ranch house. The visitors' center is open daily from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and until 5:30 from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Call 846-2070.\n\n62 Bannack State Park\n\nThe first major gold strike in Montana was in Bannack. The mining camp quickly swelled to a bustling town of 3,000. It was the first territorial capital of Montana and became home to the infamous Sheriff Henry Plummer and the Vigilantes. Located about 25 miles south of Dillon on Grasshopper Creek, Bannack became a state park in 1954. Visitors can walk the boardwalk and enjoy the many buildings that have been preserved as part of this National Historic Landmark.

Guided and self-guided tours take visitors through the massive cell block that once housed the state's worst prisoners. Sandstone walls are 24 feet high and buried 4 feet deep to prevent escape by tunneling. A museum now adjoins the prison.

It was recently listed as one of the top 10 car museums in the country by USA Today.\n\n65 Old Works Golf Course\n\nAnaconda's history is built on copper smelting, but that history left a dirty legacy — a Superfund clean-up site. In the 1980s, the idea arose to transform the Old Works smelting site into something more useful. Today, the Old Works Golf Course is the state's only Jack Nicklaus signature golf course, and is quickly building a reputation as one of the premier daily-fee golf experiences in the Northwest region. It features multiple tees, allowing players of all levels to enjoy the challenging 18 holes. The course design includes some of the byproducts of the mining days. Huge piles of black slag are incorporated into the design. It's also used in the bunkers. Measuring up to 7,700 yards, the course runs along Warm Springs Creek. Fairways are bordered by native grasses planted as part of the restoration process. Nicklaus also designed the practice facility — putting area, chipping/bunker area, two bent-grass practice tees and three practice holes. Also available are a clubhouse, dining room and bar and pro shop. Call 563-5989 for prices and tee times.\n\n66 Big Hole National Battlefield\n\nThe site of a battle between the Nez Perce Indians and the 7th U.S. Infantry forces and civilian volunteers in 1877 as five bands of Nez Perce were fleeing the government's attempt to confine them on a small reservation in Idaho.

In 1955, copper mining in the area greatly expanded with the opening of the Berkeley Pit. By 1980, with more than 1.5 billion tons of material removed from the town's main mine, all that was left was the pit. The large, truck-operated, open-pit copper mine was world famous while in operation. Two small communities and much of Butte's former east side were swallowed up by the mine following land purchases for expansion. Now a superfund site, the pit is 7,000 feet long, 5,600 feet wide and 1,600 feet deep. It is slowly filling with water. Visitors can look at the colors of the pit from the viewing stand. Call 497-6250.\n\n68 Our Lady of the Rockies\n\nTowering 90 feet tall on the mountains overlooking Butte is Our Lady of the Rockies, a statue dedicated to all women, regardless of religion. Built entirely by volunteers, the statue was begun in 1979 and completed in 1985. That year, in a breath-taking operation, an Air National Guard team raised the 51-ton statue by Sky Crane helicopter onto its mountainside base.

A guided boat tour from the marina provides visitors with an in-depth look at the area's geography, wildlife and history. The canyon is home to scores of creatures, including mountain sheep, deer, otters, turkey vultures and even the occasional black bear. Although the 2007 Meriwether fire scorched a large part of the area, vegetation is abundant. The canyon like waterway is actually home to some plants that can't be found anywhere else. Tour guides aboard the boats say the area is a \"geologist's playground.\" Passengers have the option to stop off at the Meriwether Picnic Area, stay awhile and catch a later boat back.

That simple act became a tremendous resource to ceramic artists, who now flock to the center from around the world. A prominent patron of the arts, Bray died in 1953, only two years after establishing the nonprofit Archie Bray Foundation. Since then, more than 400 artists have come to work and hone their talents at the Bray. It also sells pottery and sculpture. Tours are available.

Based on the second floor of an office building, it became Second Story Cinema and enjoyed a reputation for bringing in independent films.

Visitors may take a walking tour of the Drumlummon Hill which includes 14 sites, several of which are listed on the National Historic Register. The Catholic church and general store still serve the community and its visitors. The town now is a popular destination for sightseers and those just wanting a pleasant place for a picnic or a quiet day away from the bustle of town.\n\n77 Sun River Canyon\n\nFlowing from Gibson Reservoir, adjacent to the Bob Marshall Wilderness, is the Sun River.

The complex, designated as wilderness in 1964, is now considered one of the most completely preserved mountain ecosystems in the world. It includes rugged mountains ranges, alpine peaks, grassy meadows, fish-heavy streams, large valleys and huge forests. Because of its wilderness designation, the area is not open to motorized traffic. But hikers, backpackers and horse riders all enjoy their trips to the interior. The complex is home to grizzly bears, gray wolves, elk, deer, Canada lynx, bobcats, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, black bears, wolverines and other animals.

Under the spiritual leadership of Sitting Bull, the Indians prepared for battle against the much stronger army. During the preparations, he was said to have conducted a Sun Dance and had a vision of a great victory of the white soldiers. The defeat of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer and his 647 soldiers in the 7th Cavalry is now well known. Custer and his men attacked an Indian village in the valley of the Little Bighorn River. When the bloodshed ended, 263 cavalrymen — including Custer — lay dead.

The Cullman Times reports many trees weren’t cut down as workers created Smith Lake near Birmingham more than 50 years ago. Phil Hutchens, a member of the Cullman County Sheriff’s Office dive team, says standing timber is now complicating the search for 26-year-old Kelsey Nicole Starling of Birmingham, who’s been missing since two boats collided on the night of July 4. Starling was thrown from one of them. One of the drivers is charged with boating under the influence. Teams haven’t been able to find any trace of Starling.\n\nAlaska\n\nIgiugig: This tiny Alaska Native village is adopting an emerging technology to transform the power of a local river into a renewable energy source. The village council in Igiugig is the first tribal entity in the nation licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to harness river water that’s not connected to a dam. An underwater generator will be installed in coming days in the Kvichak River, part of a salmon-rich system that also provides subsistence food for the community of 70. Officials with Portland, Maine-based Ocean Renewable Power Co. say a trial river run of the RivGen Power System gives them confidence the system will not harm adult fish. Igiugig Village Council President AlexAnna Salmon says the generator is expected to greatly reduce reliance on costly diesel fuel.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Barbie – the iconic Mattel doll, arguably one of the world’s original influencers – is Instagramming her way across Arizona this week. The @BarbieStyle account has partnered with Visit Arizona to showcase travel in the Grand Canyon State. Her post Wednesday shows her and a pal visiting Antelope Canyon, on the Navajo Reservation just east of Page. Before that, she posed at the internationally famous Horseshoe Bend, a dramatic curve in the Colorado River that can be seen from an overlook a few miles south of Page. Barbie’s first stop in the state was the Phoenix area, where she lounged by the pool at Mountain Shadows Resort in Paradise Valley. Skyler Scott, spokeswoman for Mountain Shadows, says the Barbie photo taken there was not Photoshopped. A crew came to the resort, and Scott says it was fun to watch the detail and planning that went into the post.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A nonprofit plans to develop an online database of opioid-related overdoses in the state. Arkansas Drug Director Kirk Lane said Wednesday that the Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care is spearheading the project. He noted the database will give policymakers accurate information they can use for grants and prevention efforts. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the Justice Department awarded the state a nearly $1 million grant to fund the project. It’s expected the public database will be ready for use within six months. Gina Redford, the foundation’s analytics manager, said the database will only include information on overdoses involving opioids, which include prescription painkillers such as oxycodone and fentanyl along with heroin. Data out Wednesday from the Centers for Disease Control shows Arkansas had at least 433 fatal drug overdoses in 2018.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: An animal rescue group is asking for help caring for 89 baby snowy egrets and black-crowned night herons left homeless last week after a tree fell downtown. International Bird Rescue said Wednesday that it needs donations and volunteers to help feed and care for the baby birds rescued after an old ficus tree serving as a rookery split in half and partially fell last week, said JD Bergeron, the group’s executive director. The group is caring for 89 young birds and eggs rescued from the tree, including 50 snowy egrets and 22 black-crowned night herons. It also rescued 17 eggs that need intensive care and round-the-clock support. Another 20 birds died when the tree fell. The rescue group was already taking care of more than 200 Bay Area water birds at its busy hospital in the city of Fairfield, Bergeron said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Officials say greenhouse gas emissions in the state peaked in 2010 and have been in decline since. Colorado Air Pollution Control Division Director Gary Kaufman says the rate of decline has been small, but it’s expected to increase by 2030. The data is included in the Department of Public Health and Environment’s draft inventory of the state’s greenhouse gases. The report projects 125.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other gases will be emitted in the state in 2020. That’s down from nearly 127 million metric tons in 2015 and 133 million metric tons in 2010. A new state law aims to cut emissions to at least 90% of 2005 levels, or about 113 million metric tons, by 2050. Officials project the state will still be well above that goal in 2030.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Prisons officials say errors by nurses at the state women’s prison have caused five inmate methadone overdoses in recent months. The Department of Correction tells the Hartford Courant none of the overdoses at the York Correctional Institution in East Lyme was fatal. Two inmates had to be revived with an opioid overdose reversal drug. One York nurse was fired in connection with two of the errors, and three overdoses remain under investigation. Agency spokeswoman Karen Martucci says 300 inmates at York were on methadone treatment last year. She says while the percentage of dosing errors “is extremely low,” the department is reviewing the methadone distribution program and adding safeguards to prevent similar incidents. Prison workers union officials have warned of dangerous understaffing at state prisons.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Ladybug Music Festival, believed to be the country’s largest annual celebration of women in music, has kicked off, bringing with it a new local beer, along with almost 60 acts performing at 15 locations around town. The event Thursday and Friday includes a headlining set paying tribute to the “Ladybugs of Soul,” including Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Whitney Houston and Chaka Khan. To celebration the occasion, Stitch House Brewery has released its first canned beer, made in collaboration with Milford’s Mispillion River Brewing. Ladybug Rose Lager is an easy-drinking raspberry- and rose hip-infused lager with a light 4% ABV. The cans, which boast Ladybug’s eye-popping colors of pink and yellow, are also sold by the case or in four-packs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Protesters angered by the federal detainment of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border blocked access to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters in the city this week and staged a sit-in. News outlets reports at least 10 sit-in demonstrators were arrested and charged with unlawful entry. Dozens marched from the National Mall to the agency’s site around lunchtime Tuesday, stopping federal workers from returning to their desks. The demonstration went on for hours as attendees sang and carried signs saying “Never again is now” and “Never again means close the concentration camps.” The protest was one in a string of similar demonstrations outside ICE facilities nationwide during which protesters called for the dissolution of ICE and an end to crowded detainment centers at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Officials are hoping a continuous loop of children’s songs played throughout the night will keep homeless people from sleeping on the patio of a city-owned rental banquet facility. West Palm Beach parks and recreation director Leah Rockwell tells the Palm Beach Post they’re trying to discourage people from sleeping outside the glass-walled Waterfront Lake Pavilion, which she says rakes in some $240,000 annually from events. The loop of “Baby Shark” and “Raining Tacos” is a temporary fix to keep homeless people off the patio. Rockwell says the city wants to formalize hours for the facility, which should make trespassing laws easier to enforce. Illaya Champion tells the Post “it’s wrong” to chase people away with music. He says he’ll still sleep there, but “it’s on and on, the same songs.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Coastal Georgia’s largest county wants to help residents prepare for an emergency during hurricane season. The Chatham County Emergency Management Agency in Savannah plans to hold a free “Citizen Hurricane Academy” this weekend. The program includes presentations by meteorologists, local emergency planners and other experts on how evacuation decisions are made, how to prepare financially for a disaster and some basic first aid tips for use in emergencies. The Atlantic hurricane season began June 1 and runs until Dec. 1. Coastal Georgia evacuated for Hurricane Matthew in 2017 and Hurricane Irma in 2018. Both storms brought damaging wind and flooding to Georgia’s 100-mile coast. Hurricane Michael caused extensive damage farther inland last year.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A developer has agreed to cancel a planned condominium project to preserve a surfing area. West Hawaii Today reports the landowner has agreed to work toward building a public space rather than the proposed five-story residence near the Banyans, a popular surfing spot on the north side of Holualoa Bay. Property owner Kilohana Makai LLC met in a second mediation session last week with people involved in a case challenging plans for the condominium. A spokesman says Kilohana Makai will work over the next year to 15 months to convert the 14,450-square-foot lot on the Big Island into a community space. Officials say Hawaii County could buy the property via a commission that maintains a list of properties considered “worthy of preservation.”\n\nIdaho\n\nPocatello: Beekeepers and maintenance workers have removed roughly 30,000 bees that built a massive hive inside an Idaho State University campus landmark. The Idaho State Journal reports the bees were safely transported from the stone-and-wood Swanson Arch to a hive box at a nearby farm last Friday. Beekeeper Sarah Hofeldt says the bees were surprisingly docile, and no one was stung during the extraction. Hofeldt was safely able to remove the queen bee from the hive by hand without the use of smoke. She says the smokers can calm the bees but also can make it more difficult to move the bees into a transport container, which can increase bee fatalities. ISU students traditionally walk through the arch upon entering and graduating from the university.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A woman who recently got a 1993 postcard in her mailbox has tracked down the man who sent it to his children more than two decades ago. Kim Draper’s story about the mysterious Hong Kong postcard was first published in The State Journal-Register in Springfield. Masrour Kizilbash sent the postcard to his family while working overseas in 1993. He told the newspaper that he was “fascinated with the area” and wanted to share his experiences. Kizilbash’s family was living in Springfield at the time. He always figured they had received the postcard. With the help of social media, Draper learned that a son now lives in suburban Chicago. A reunion with the postcard is planned. Officials say it likely got tied up in Hong Kong or might have been stuck in old equipment.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s attorney general has reversed himself and decided against appealing a federal judge’s decision to block a state law that would ban a second-trimester abortion procedure. A judge granted a preliminary injunction last month sought by doctors who perform dilation-and-evacuation abortions. Republican Attorney General Curtis Hill said after that ruling that he would try to have the injunction lifted, but he announced Wednesday that his office would concentrate on arguing that the law is constitutional. That decision means the law can’t be enforced while court proceedings continue. The law passed this spring by the Republican-dominated Legislature calls the abortion procedure “dismemberment abortion.”\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The director of the state’s social services agency was a huge fan of the late rapper Tupac Shakur, and he frequently let his subordinates know it. Emails obtained by the Associated Press show that Iowa Department of Human Services Director Jerry Foxhoven routinely sent messages to employees lauding Shakur’s music and lyrics even after at least one complained to lawmakers. Then last month, he sent another such email to all 4,300 agency employees. He was abruptly ousted from his job the next work day. Foxhoven, 66, told employees he had been a huge fan of the hip-hop artist for years. He hosted weekly “Tupac Fridays” to play his music in the office. He traded lyrics with employees and marked his own 65th birthday with Shakur-themed cookies, including ones decorated with the words “Thug life.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Authorities say a lab technician “fudged” the test results of sewage treatment plant wastewater that is dumped into the Arkansas River. The Wichita Eagle reports Director of Public Works Alan King said Tuesday that the city caught the error during a spot check and immediately reported it to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. The employee has since resigned. The problematic test results falsely reported how much organic and inorganic substance is floating in the water. It’s generally used as an indicator of sediment or silt in the water. King says Wichita’s permits shouldn’t be affected, and there was no danger to the public. Results from around the same time as the false one show that the city likely stayed within an acceptable range.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A new list of rankings from a high-profile polling organization is giving a big red thumbs-down to Gov. Matt Bevin. Kentucky’s chief executive is the least popular in the nation among voters in their own state, according to Morning Consult’s Q2 rankings, with a 56% disapproval rating vs. just 32% who approve. Bevin notably has ground to make up among voters in his own party, with an election looming in November. The governor faces a 40% disapproval rating among fellow Republicans in Kentucky, after a May primary election in which GOP challenger Robert Goforth, a state representative, scored 39% of the in-party vote to Bevin’s 52%. His net approval among Kentucky voters, according to the Morning Consult poll, sits at -24 overall, which breaks down to +11 among Republicans, -63 among Democrats and -26 among independents.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A favorite local confection is making a comeback seven years after a devastating fire. Louisiana’s economic development office announced Thursday that Hubig’s Pies will be produced again next year in suburban Jefferson Parish. Hubig’s made hand-sized turnovers with a glazed crust and fillings of chocolate, coconut or any of a variety of fruits. Wrapped in white paper labeled with a caricature of a chef known as Savory Simon, the pies were prominent for decades at retail checkout counters, including grocery and hardware stores. A 2012 fire gutted Hubig’s longtime bakery in New Orleans’ Marigny neighborhood. Production will resume in Jefferson Parish after a $1.37 million investment in a manufacturing facility. The state says Hubig’s will distribute pies from the Louisiana-Texas line to the Mobile, Alabama, area.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: A curious visitor to a train museum that resembled a white throw pillow or perhaps a lost toupee turned out to be a rare albino porcupine. The young rodent turned up Tuesday at Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, perplexing the staff, who sought help identifying it via social media. The consensus was that it’s an albino porcupine. The Portland Press Herald reports the animal appeared to be a baby because its quills had not yet hardened. A spokeswoman for the museum said midday Wednesday that it hadn’t yet been seen again, but it was assumed to be lurking in the area. Porcupines are common in Maine, though albino ones certainly aren’t. About 1 in every 10,000 of the species is an albino porcupine.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: An audit says a possible infusion of $3.2 million in state funds and savings from a shortened season may not be enough to save the cash-strapped Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. The Baltimore Sun reports the SC&H Group audit released Tuesday says both methods would only temporarily help BSO unless additional revenue streams are established. It says it’s unclear if the orchestra will survive the year. The audit considered the possible state emergency funding, which Gov. Larry Hogan refused to partially release this year, citing concerns that the state could soon face a $961 million deficit. Hogan signaled in May that he might not release the first installment of the funds, leading the orchestra to abruptly cancel its summer series and lock out musicians amid ongoing contract negotiations.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCape Cod: A citizens group is calling for eliminating federal protections for seals as officials seek ways to protect beachgoers from great white sharks. Peter Howell, a founder of the Seal Action Committee, says the Nantucket-based group wants Congress to amend the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act so that species can be removed from the law’s list of protected animals if their populations have sufficiently rebounded. “We’re not anti-seal. We’re not trying to eliminate them. We’re just trying to manage them in the interest of the larger ecosystem,” he said Wednesday as the group spoke before the Barnstable County Commissioners, which oversees Cape Cod’s regional government. The region’s seal population – estimated in the hundreds of thousands – has been blamed for drawing droves of great white sharks in recent years. Seals are the favored meal for the powerful predators.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: Three historic Great Lakes lighthouses owned by the federal government are going on the auction block. They include Lake Huron’s Poe Reef Lighthouse, 6 miles east of Cheboygan, Michigan, which guides ships through a hazardous channel. The Ontonagon Breakwater Lighthouse is the westernmost lighthouse in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, perched at the entrance of the channel leading to the Ontonagon River from Lake Superior. The Superior Entry Lighthouse sits on a sandbar between Superior, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota. The U.S. General Services Administration is offering the lighthouses through an online auction. Their lighting mechanisms will continue aiding navigation and will remain the U.S. Coast Guard’s property. Proceeds from public lighthouse sales help pay to preserve and maintain those that remain active.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The developers of a proposed copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters plan to use a potentially safer dry method of storing mine waste instead of the kind of wet tailings pond more common in the industry. Twin Metals Minnesota said Thursday that its underground mine near Ely would use “dry stack” storage for waste rock, calling it the most environmentally friendly approach for the site. The method contrasts with the conventional tailings basin at the planned PolyMet mine, which will be contained by an earthen dam. While environmentalists pushed for dry stack storage at PolyMet, they’re criticizing Twin Metals because the waste would sit just a couple of miles upstream from the Boundary Waters. Twin Metals plans to release its formal mine plan in the coming months, triggering a lengthy environmental review.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi is asking 16 cities to eliminate local laws that penalize panhandling. The organization says in a news release that the request is part of a national effort that includes work by the National Law Center of Homelessness & Poverty. A federal appeals court in 2015 ruled that an ordinance in Springfield, Illinois, that penalized people for begging for money in public places is unconstitutional. ACLU of Mississippi says that since last year, four cities in the state have repealed panhandling ordinances – Ridgeland, Meridian, Starkville and Southaven. It’s asking other cities to do the same – Brandon, Clarksdale, Cleveland, Clinton, Corinth, Greenville, Greenwood, Grenada, Gulfport, Horn Lake, Jackson, Long Beach, Natchez, Olive Branch, Pascagoula and Vicksburg.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The U.S. Department of Agriculture now says less than 40% of the researchers whose jobs are being transferred from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City will make the move to the Midwest. The Kansas City Star reports U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced in June that the USDA would move more than 550 jobs to Kansas City. A USDA spokesperson told The Star on Tuesday that 145 workers will follow their jobs to Kansas City, while 250 will leave the agency. Members of the Kansas and Missouri congressional delegations and the states’ governors praised the USDA’s move, saying the research agencies are a good fit for their region. But critics argued that moving them will make it harder for federal policymakers to get objective research.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Wildlife officials say evidence of an invasive clam that can out-compete native species has been found for the first time in a state water body. Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials say Asian clam shells were recently found near the boat ramp at Lake Elmo State Park in Billings. The discovery was made by participants in a training session on the detection of aquatic invasive species. No live clams were found. The quarter-sized mollusks are smaller than native clams that live in Montana. In large enough numbers, officials say they can clog screens on irrigation pumps or other water intakes. Since being discovered in Washington state’s Columbia River in 1938, Asian clams have spread to almost every state.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Plant science students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln are still taught to phenotype by hand, wading into muddy fields to record the differences in physical characteristics between varying corn hybrids with a small set of tools and a pen and notebook. But technology is on track to render that human work obsolete. A team of UNL plant scientists and biological systems engineers have built an automated system capable of detecting an individual corn leaf and grasping it with robotic precision to screen its temperature, chlorophyll and water content in less than a minute, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. Building a robot to automate the processes took years, as the team had to build a system that could identify the leaf from a corn or soybean plant, then direct a robotic arm where to reach and how to grab it for a battery of measurements, says Abbas Atefi, a Ph.D. candidate in biological systems engineering.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Lake Tahoe is almost entirely full. For weeks, the roughly 1,644-foot-deep alpine lake – the second deepest in the U.S. – has been within an inch of its maximum allowed surface elevation of 6,229.1 feet above sea level. As of late last week, its surface elevation was 6,229.03 feet above sea level. For Chad Blanchard, the federal water master in Reno responsible for managing Tahoe’s waters, it’s the longest he’s ever seen the lake stay this high. “This is a rare year,” he says. “I’ve been doing this for 26 years, and we’ve had big (snow) years, but this one is unique as far as being up within an inch of being full, and it’s just hanging there ... it’s a product of still having so much snow up there.” Despite a good amount of snow still coating the peaks around Tahoe, Blanchard doesn’t expect the lake level to rise much more, with summertime surface evaporation starting to pick up.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMilan: The Nansen Ski Jump has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1938, the 65-meter ski jump was the largest in the U.S. at the time, and it retains most of its original design. Officials said Wednesday that it was placed on the register because of its architecture and its place in U.S. sports history. Over the decades, Nansen was site of National Ski Jumping Championships, Olympic Ski Jumping qualifying events and U.S. Nordic combined championships. The ski jump was part of a planned bid by New Hampshire to host the 1944 Winter Olympics with cross-country skiing in Berlin, alpine events at Cannon, figure skating in Conway and bobsledding on Mount Madison. The games were canceled due to World War II.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEast Newark: Famed restaurant Tops Diner will soon be demolished and rebuilt in the same spot, with new space three times the current size. Tops, which opened in 1942, has been approved for expansion by the Hudson County Planning Board. Owners Jimmy and John Golemis, whose father, George, bought the diner in 1972, could not be reached for comment on the expansion. Tops Diner has been named the “most iconic” restaurant in New Jersey by Thrillist; was ranked the best diner in the country by Time Out magazine; and was listed as the most famous restaurant in the state by Insider. According to reports from NJ.com and The Jersey Journal, the new space will feature 296 seats (up from 180), 160 parking spaces and outdoor seating. Tops Diner says construction will take at minimum four to six weeks, during which Tops will be closed.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Thousands of small campaign contributions have helped propel former CIA operative and author Valerie Plame to the financial lead in a crowded primary for an open congressional seat in 2020. The Democrat raised $236,000 in May and June, according to disclosure forms and a statement from the campaign. Among notable donors were actor Bryan Cranston of “Breaking Bad” and Naomi Watts, who portrayed Plame in the 2010 film about her involvement in political jousting at the start of the Iraq War under President George W. Bush. In a field of eight primary contenders, Plame is the only national figure. Her identity as a CIA operative was leaked by an official in President George W. Bush’s administration in an effort to discredit her then-husband, diplomat Joe Wilson, a critic of the war in Iraq.\n\nNew York\n\nVernon: Woodstock 50 organizers have applied again for a permit to hold their festival at an upstate horse track, a day after losing an appeal for a previous denial. Town of Vernon officials say the application was submitted Wednesday. Woodstock 50 was previously denied a permit twice last week by the town. An appeal of the denial was upheld Tuesday night by the central New York town’s planning board. The Vernon Downs racetrack and casino became a possible alternative site for Woodstock 50 after the original venue, Watkins Glen International, pulled out. Woodstock 50 did not respond to a request for comment. Oneida County Sheriff Robert Maciol warned Thursday that “there is no practical or logistical possibility that this event could occur without significant risk to public safety.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHatteras: Sea turtles have again set a record for nesting at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. A news release from the National Park Service says that with more than a month to go before the nesting season typically winds down, rangers discovered the 326th nest Monday. The previous record of 325 was set in 2016. As of Tuesday, there are 317 loggerhead nests, 11 green sea turtle nests and one Kemp’s Ridley nest. Tracy Ziegler, chief of resource management and science for National Parks of Eastern North Carolina, says it’s estimated that almost 11,000 sea turtle eggs have been deposited in beaches on Bodie, Hatteras and Ocracoke islands.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state has sued the federal government to recover the $38 million the state spent policing protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem says he filed the lawsuit Thursday against the Army Corps of Engineers. He says the agency didn’t respond to an administrative claim he filed one year ago. The agency did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Stenehjem says the Corps allowed protesters to illegally camp without a permit on federal land along the Missouri River in southern North Dakota and failed to maintain law and order. The Corps has said protesters weren’t evicted due to free speech reasons. The pipeline carries oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Republican-led Legislature has passed a measure that would allow farmers and university researchers to grow industrial hemp and would legalize sales of hemp-derived cannabidiol oil, or CBD. Federal legislation last year removed hemp from the list of federally controlled substances and now treats the low-THC version of the cannabis plant like other agricultural crops. But existing Ohio law doesn’t differentiate between marijuana and hemp. The newly passed Ohio legislation would allow for cultivation of hemp as long as it contains less than 0.3% THC, the cannabis compound that gives marijuana its high. It would be regulated by the state. The measure was sent to GOP Gov. Mike DeWine for consideration. It would take effect immediately if he signs it.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma County has joined over 50 other cities and counties in the state to prosecute drug companies for damages caused by the opioid epidemic. The Oklahoman reports that all three county commissioners voted Wednesday to approve a contract with the Fulmer Sill law firm to sue opioid manufacturers. The decision comes at the end of the state’s trial against consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson, which alleges the company and its subsidiaries created a public nuisance by aggressively promoting the highly addictive drugs. Oklahoma could receive up to $17.5 billion in abatement costs. Commissioner Kevin Calvey says the opioid crisis has increased the county’s costs in policing, jailing and providing treatment services to residents. Fulmer Sill lawyers say they expect to pursue “tens of millions of dollars” for the county.\n\nOregon\n\nKeizer: Four scorpions were brought to the Keizer Fire District after a woman found the abandoned arachnids inside a Red Vines licorice container near a playground at an area park Wednesday. A mother picked them up around noon and brought them to the fire district. Keizer Fire District Chief Jeff Cowan says the arachnids were confirmed to be Pacific Northwest forest scorpions, a species native to the Willamette Valley. The species is not aggressive. Though they can sting, they prefer to play dead when disturbed. The scorpions were then given to the Oregon Department of Agriculture, which maintains a staff of professional entomologists. Cowan says under the entomologists’ care, the scorpions will travel for outreach events such as the Oregon State Fair.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWilkes-Barre: City officials have removed a public monument that included a recently added brick sponsored by a Ku Klux Klan affiliate. The Citizens’ Voice reports the column monument in Public Square was taken down three weeks after a brick was placed on it bearing the name of the East Coast Knights, a KKK chapter that has recruited in Wilkes-Barre. Harrisburg citizen activist Gene Stilp tried to chisel it off last week, resulting in a disorderly conduct charge, which he says he plans to fight. The monument was installed in 2008. Supporters could purchase engraved bricks for $35. Wilkes-Barre Mayor Tony George tells the paper it was time to tear down the monument, which he says wouldn’t have survived ongoing renovations to Public Square.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The state’s prison population is continuing to shrink as the percentage of older inmates rises. WPRI reports a 2018 Department of Corrections Population Report indicates 1 in 4 adults in the state’s correctional institutions in 2018 was over the age of 50, with more than 7% over 60. The 2009 population report disclosed that 17% of inmates were over 50, and 5% were over 60. The department says it categorizes inmates 50 and older as geriatric. The American Civil Liberties Union is also watching the aging prison population closely. Steve Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, says everyone “should be concerned as taxpayers.” Data compiled by the nonprofit projects the number of elderly inmates to triple in the next 15 years.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: The Greenville County Council has moved forward on a roughly $40million plan to relocate state offices from some expensive real estate downtown to a pair of office buildings near Haywood Mall. The decision at Tuesday night’s council meeting means the county is moving forward with the $1 billion commercial and residential redevelopment of County Square that council members first approved more than a year ago. The purchase price for the buildings, formerly part of the Fluor Corp. campus, will be $33.1 million, according to council members. The county will spend an additional $5 million to $8 million up-fitting the buildings for county and state services, according to a memo circulated to council members last March.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Dozens of children up to age 5 in the Sioux Falls School District and five rural districts now have access to mental health support in a way they never did before thanks to a $2 million grant given to Southeastern Behavioral Healthcare. The five-year grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration establishes the South Dakota Early Childhood Mental Health Collaborative to help Southeast Behavioral Health therapists reach an under-served population, what some call a “mental health desert,” through a partnership with South Dakota State University and federal school readiness programs like Head Start. And it will also develop some of the state’s first fully certified specialists in play therapy to help children discover healthy social and emotional coping skills, Southeastern officials said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: If famed local dive bar Earnestine & Hazel’s didn’t have enough haunted lore swirling around it already, bones of an unknown origin tumbling out of the walls and landing at the feet of construction crews serve as one more paranormal episode the historic bar can now tout. Diversified Builders crews have resumed restoration work after a Wednesday night scare when bones fell out of a wall they were repairing. The contracting company’s vice president, Chris Tigner, says word got out quickly, and someone alerted police and inaccurately told them a body was in the bar. Police and fire crews swarmed the site about 11 p.m., Tigner says. There was no body, and no one can say with certainty what organism the bones originated from. Caitlin Chittom, owner of Earnestine & Hazel’s, says they’ve been sent away for identification.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A former judge who served on the state’s highest criminal court has denounced President Donald Trump in announcing her decision to leave the Republican Party. The Austin American-Statesman reports retired Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Elsa Alcala announced her decision on Facebook. Alcala said in the Facebook post that even accepting that Trump has had some successes, “at his core, his ideology is racism.” Alcala said she can no longer support the GOP and will be voting in the 2020 Democratic primary. She was appointed to the court by Gov. Rick Perry in 2011 and spent 20 years as a GOP judge. Alcala’s announcement follows Trump’s tweets that four Democratic freshmen should “go back” to their home countries – though all are citizens, and three were born in the United States.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Wildlife officials say reports of bears coming down from the mountains and rummaging through backyards and campgrounds throughout the state have more than doubled this year. Faith Jolley with the Division of Wildlife Resources said Wednesday that her agency has already received more than 25 reports of black bears getting into trash cans and campsites, mostly in central Utah. In 2018 the DWR recorded 27 total bear encounters. None resulted in serious injury. The sharp increase can be attributed to a larger bear population and a wet spring that kept the bears hibernating longer than usual. State biologists say these factors have made bears bolder in searching for food. Jolley says residents can “bearproof” their surroundings by regularly cleaning their trash cans and storing food in locked cars while camping.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Vermont Mozart Festival will not have a summer concert series this year. WCAX-TV reports that the organization said in a Facebook post this week that it is “currently reviewing opportunities and evaluating all options for the future, but will not have a summer season this year.” It didn’t say why. The festival, which celebrates the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, has struggled in recent years. It shut down in 2010 due to financial troubles. Then it was revived under new leadership, with partnership with communities and including food offerings and youth sports.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A limited-edition license plate is being offered to celebrate the University of Virginia men’s basketball team’s 2019 national championship. The state Department of Motor Vehicles worked with UVA to offer a license plate featuring the national champion’s logo. The plate is now available for purchase at any DMV customer service center, mobile office or online. It costs $25 annually, plus the cost of the registration, and can be personalized for $10. UVA license plates are part of the DMV’s revenue-sharing program, with $15 of the $25 fee returned to the university to support student scholarships. UVA has received more than $1.9 million from the program since it was established in 1992. The DMV also offers license plates as ornamental souvenirs. The $10 plates cannot be used on motor vehicles.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Transportation Commission is expected to vote this year on a proposal to replace the gas tax with a pay-per-mile system. The vote will take place Dec. 17, after the commission is expected to receive a report in October from a panel that has studied the new type of tax, The Olympian reports. Any recommendation voted on by the commission will then be passed on to the Legislature to consider during its next session, which starts in January. Commission chairman Jerry Litt says he expects many state residents would pay more under a pay-per-mile tax, which the state calls a “road usage charge.” Sen. Rebecca Saldana, vice chairwoman of the Senate Transportation Committee, says the state is considering such a charge because she says more fuel-efficient vehicles have eroded the state’s ability to rely long term on the gas tax for transportation needs.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A permanent prescription drug disposal site is being placed at the Capitol so people wanting to dispose of medication can do so all year. There has already been a collection site at the Capitol for National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, but the new location is permanent. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced the plan Wednesday and said it is in collaboration with the Capitol Police. Morrisey says the use of disposal sites can affect substance abuse rates by reducing the number of available pills. This disposal site is at the Division of Protective Services Office in Building 1, Room 152-A.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers has signed a bill that creates new tiers of sign language interpreters. The bill he signed Wednesday establishes criteria for new advanced and intermediate licenses for both deaf and hearing interpreters and requires the state Department of Public Safety to determine the scope of practice for each level. One of the bill’s chief Assembly sponsors, Democrat Jonathan Brostoff, refused to cut his hair for a year and a half as a stunt to pressure Republican legislative leaders to consider the proposal. His hair had ballooned into a thick, curly mop by the time the Assembly and Senate passed the proposal in June. He cut his hair days later.\n\nWyoming\n\nThermopolis: The skeleton of a nearly 3-foot-tall cousin of the velociraptor is now on display at the Wyoming Dinosaur Center. The Rock Springs Rocket-Miner reports the museum in Thermopolis opened a new permanent exhibit featuring the fossils and full-size reproduction of the dinosaur informally known as Lori. Paleontologists discovered Lori, whose scientific name is Hesperornithoides miessleri, in a formation dating to the late Jurassic period near Douglas in 2001. Center paleontologist Bill Wahl says Lori is the earliest troodontid that has been found in North America. It’s also the smallest dinosaur that has been found in Wyoming. Troodontids are bird-like predators that have sickle-like claws.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/19"}]}

She expects it to soon overtake the alpha variant, which was first discovered in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn Iowa, the delta variant has accounted for more than half of the positive coronavirus tests that included variants of the virus over the past two weeks, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health.\n\n\"Iowans should assume it is circulating in their community,” state health department spokesperson Sarah Ekstrand said in an email to the Des Moines Register.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nThe delta variant is 'hyper-transmissible'\n\nScientists expect viruses to mutate in the course of a pandemic, especially one that's engulfed the globe over the past year and infected millions in the United States alone. It's the nature of the mutations that can raise worries.\n\nIn the case of the delta variant, the chief concern is that it is \"hyper-transmissible,\" Walensky said.\n\n\"There are communities that are vulnerable and where we are now seeing surges in cases, and indeed also hospitalizations, due to what could be the spread of the Delta variant and low vaccination rates in these communities,\" she said.\n\nLow vaccination rates stoke concerns\n\nWalensky singled out the Midwest, though she didn't name any specific states, as particularly at risk to the variant due to low vaccination rates.\n\nStatewide, 51.5% of all Iowans have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 48.1% are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. The figures include people younger than 12, the cutoff age for vaccine eligibility.\n\nIn Iowa two counties, Davis in the southeast and Lyon in the northwest, have vaccination rates below 30% of the population, according to Iowa Department of Public Health. Another 28 counties in Iowa have sub-40% vaccination rates.\n\nPfizer, Modern and Johnson & Johnson vaccines protect against the delta variant of COVID-19\n\nThe two-dose Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine all appear to protect against COVID caused by all of the coronavirus strains, including the delta variant.\n\n\"Our authorized vaccines provide protection against the circulating variants in this country, including Delta,\" Walensky said. \"Vaccination is how we protect these individuals, families, and communities, and prevent severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths from COVID-19.\"\n\nShe added that preliminary data shows 99.5% of U.S. residents who died from COVID-19 over the past six months have been unvaccinated.\n\nThe variants “are able to find any gaps in our protection,” Dr. Hilary Babcock of Washington University at St. Louis said, pointing to how hospital beds and intensive care units in Missouri’s least-vaccinated southwestern counties suddenly are filling — mostly with adults under 40 who never got the shots.\n\nThe delta variant may cause more severe COVID-19 symptoms\n\nDr. Bhakti Hansoti, an associate professor of emergency medicine and international health at Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg School of Public Health, told USA TODAY that many people infected with the delta variant experience the same symptoms of the original strain, only more severely.\n\nThat includes an increased likelihood of hearing loss, severe stomach pains and nausea, Hansoti told USA TODAY. People infected with the variant are also more likely to be hospitalized, require oxygen treatments and face other complications.\n\nDoctors have seen an increased likelihood of hearing loss, severe stomach pains and nausea in patients infected with the new variant.\n\nIt is unclear, however, if the delta variant is deadlier than other strains of the virus, according to Scientific American.\n\nThis report contains information from the Associated Press.\n\nNick Coltrain is a politics and data reporter for the Register.

In some states it accounts for over 18% of sampled coronavirus cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“It’s clear that the Indian variant is more transmissible, and it’s also true that the cases are going up, and that the levels of hospitalization are going up,\" Johnson said on Sky News. \"Now, we don’t know exactly to what extent that is going to feed through into extra mortality, but clearly it’s a matter of serious, serious concern.”\n\nJohnson is set to make an announcement Monday about the June 21 timetable, the final stage in his government's four-step unlocking plan for England.\n\nA Saturday New York Times report says data from China suggests the variant can cause more severe illness.\n\nRegions of the U.S. with lower vaccination rates may be especially vulnerable to the virus, but fully vaccinated people have little to worry about, according to a study from Public Health England. It showed two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were 88% effective against symptomatic disease from the Delta variant, and even more successful at preventing hospitalization and death.\n\nSouthern states with lagging vaccinations may be particularly vulnerable to the variant, some experts say.\n\n“Here in the South, particularly in Louisiana, Mississippi, we’re seeing really low vaccination rates,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, told CNBC. \"And less than 10% of adolescents are vaccinated in many of these southern states, so we have a real vulnerability here.”\n\nAlso in the news:\n\n► Saudi Arabia announced Saturday that this year's hajj pilgrimage, a physically arduous trek performed by Muslims, will be limited to no more than 60,000 people, all of them from within the kingdom, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Before the pandemic, the TSA screened 2 to 2.5 million people per day on average.\n\nThe number is a strong signal for the return of travel this summer, which has been one of the industries hit hardest by the pandemic. Experts expect a healthy amount of leisure travel this summer as vaccination rates continue to climb in the U.S. and pent-up demand pushes Americans to book trips.\n\n“The growing number of travelers demonstrates this country’s resilience and the high level of confidence in COVID-19 counter measures, to include ready access to vaccines,” TSA acting administrator Darby LaJoye said in a Saturday news release. “TSA stands ready to provide a safe and secure screening process as part of the overall travel experience.”\n\nThe lowest pandemic-era screening volume at the TSA was on April 13, 2020, when 87,534 people were screened. As travel picks up over the summer, the TSA advises passengers arrive at the airport \"with sufficient time\" to accommodate increased screening times, according to the release.\n\nWorld’s richest democracies vow to donate a billion vaccine doses\n\nFacing criticism that they are hogging vaccines, the leaders of seven wealthy industrialized nations are competing to be the global champion of so many wounded by the virus.\n\nWith 3.7 million people lost in the pandemic, the world’s richest democracies are eager to show themselves the champions of the afflicted and have committed to sharing at least 1 billion vaccine shots with struggling countries.\n\nThe U.S. is set to donate 500 million Pfizer vaccine doses in the next year, while the U.K. plans to share 5 million doses – out of a 100 million total – in the coming weeks; France and Germany each plan to donate 30 million vaccines.\n\nThe COVAX vaccination campaign got off to a slow start as richer nations locked up billions of doses through contracts directly with drug manufacturers. The alliance has distributed just 81 million doses globally, and large parts of the world, particularly in Africa, remain vaccine deserts.\n\n“It is vital that we don’t repeat the mistake of the last great crisis, the last great economic recession in 2008, when the recovery was not uniform across all parts of society,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said after leaders posed for a formal photo by the sea.\n\nUS vaccine surplus grows by the day\n\nThe U.S. is confronted with an ever-growing surplus of coronavirus vaccine, looming expiration dates and stubbornly lagging demand.\n\nThe stockpiles are becoming more daunting each week. Oklahoma has more than 700,000 doses on shelves but is administering only 4,500 a day and has 27,000 Pfizer and Moderna doses that are set to expire at the end of the month. Millions of Johnson & Johnson doses nationwide were set to expire this month before the government extended their dates by six weeks, but some leaders acknowledge it will be difficult to use them up even by then.\n\n“We really cannot let doses expire. That would be a real outrage, given the need to get vaccines to some under-vaccinated communities in the U.S. and the glaring gap in vaccinations and the inequity of vaccinations that we have globally,” said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, chair of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nEach week, states are allotted a number of doses from the government and are allowed to order shots from that. But more states, including Oklahoma, Alabama, Utah, Delaware and New Hampshire, have stopped placing orders for new doses in recent weeks because they have such a large inventory. That has added to the ballooning federal stockpile.\n\nDespite their limited effectiveness in reducing vaccine hesitancy, incentive programs – million-dollar prizes, free beer and marijuana and raffled-off hunting rifles – may be a worthwhile tool for states struggling to improve their vaccination rates and convince reluctant citizens.\n\nGov says Kentucky succeeded in fighting COVID-19 by putting science over politics\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear on Friday declared his state’s deadly fight against COVID-19 a “success story” as he ended most pandemic restrictions and said his state lessened the crisis because Kentuckians ultimately put science ahead of politics.\n\nKentucky “beat back” three surges of infection without having its hospitals overrun with virus patients, the governor said. The rollout of vaccinations was “pretty successful”: More than 2.1 million Kentuckians have received at least one dose of vaccine, he said.\n\nBeshear lifted Kentucky’s statewide mask mandate with a few exceptions, keeping the measure for such “high-risk settings” as public transit, health care settings and long-term care facilities. Prior to lifting the mask mandate, he vented his frustration with the divisions over donning a facial covering.\n\n“Masks have been used to reduce infection in health care settings for decades,\" Beshear said. “Yet somehow it became a question of liberty.”\n\nShortly before announcing he was lifting capacity restrictions for restaurants, bars and other public venues, Beshear said the pandemic was “a test of our humanity” and posed “the single deadliest threat” of his lifetime. Kentucky’s virus-related death toll has surpassed 7,000. Beshear said bringing the coronavirus under control required collective efforts of Democrats and Republicans, offering a lesson to move beyond the partisan strife that “can just be toxic.”\n\n“I’m the guy that has to try to lay my head down every night and sleep knowing that Kentuckians that we’ve lost, the grief that’s out there, the fact that so many couldn’t say goodbye and be at that bedside,” Beshear said. \"That we had thousands of Kentuckians die alone or with a nurse holding their hands. And so that perspective, each and every day, I never looked at any of this in any of the red or the blue discussion, and the rest of the country shouldn’t either.”\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/12/14/covid-omicron-south-africa-study/6502201001/", "title": "COVID omicron variant is 'highly transmissible': South Africa study", "text": "The new study from South Africa's largest private health insurer shows that two shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is just 33% protective against omicron.\n\nFull vaccination against COVID-19 continues to provide 70% protection against severe disease, according to the Discovery Health study.\n\nOmicron also appears to be able to reinfect people who had an earlier disease variant, with those infected longer ago at higher risk of reinfection.\n\nThe new omicron variant of the coronavirus is substantially more contagious and reduces the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, a study from South Africa released Tuesday found.\n\nEven though the variant so far seems to produce mostly mild disease, world health leaders warned it could bring a wave of illness that crushes health systems\n\n\"Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant,\" said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization.\n\n\"We underestimate this virus at our peril,\" he said in a news conference Tuesday from Geneva. \"Even if omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems.\"\n\nEarly data from South Africa appears to show that people who are fully vaccinated are still largely protected against severe disease, according to early data released Tuesday by Discovery Health, South Africa's largest private health insurer.\n\nThe omicron variant, which was first identified in southern Africa, appears poised to take over the world, as delta did before it. Omicron accounts for 90% of COVID-19 cases in South Africa and is a growing problem in Europe.\n\nIt has now been found in 77 countries, Ghebreyesus said. It has been seen in at least 30 U.S. states, though the delta variant still dominates the American outbreak.\n\nFormally identified the day before Thanksgiving, information on omicron's characteristics – including how contagious and dangerous it may be – are just emerging.\n\nThe new study from Discovery Health shows that two shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which provided more than 90% protection against the original virus, is only 33% protective against omicron infection.\n\nFull vaccination continues to provide 70% protection against severe disease, which seemed to hold up across high-risk groups, though it declined somewhat in people over 60 and even more in those over 70.\n\n\"This is the first time we've had any data on that,\" said Dr. Eric Topol, vice president for research at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, and a national expert on the use of data in medical research.\n\n\"Seventy percent is definitely a dropdown. It isn't great,\" he said. \"It was 95% effective severe disease when it was delta variant and then about 85% after six months of waning,\" he said.\n\nWhether those numbers will continue to hold as more patients with omicron are studied isn't yet clear, he said. \"This is all still so new.\"\n\nOther research from Pfizer-BioNTech suggests that a third, booster dose can restore the original levels of protection at least for some period of time.\n\n“The Omicron-driven fourth (wave) has a significantly steeper trajectory of new infections relative to prior waves,\" Dr, Ryan Noach, CEO of Discovery Health, said in a statement. \"National data show an exponential increase in both new infections and test positivity rates during the first three weeks of this wave, indicating a highly transmissible variant with rapid community spread of infection.”\n\nMild but dangerous\n\nWHO officials chided nations that are focusing on offering boosters to their citizens while ignoring the lack of vaccines globally.\n\n\"The priority in every country and globally must be to protect the least protected, not the most protected,\" Tedros said.\n\nVaccine for poor countries has dealt with many setbacks over the past year, brought on by export restrictions, vaccine hoarding and regulatory delays, COVAX, the global vaccine alliance, said in a statement Tuesday. However, supply has increased since September.\n\nEven if mild, omicron could easily overwhelm health systems even in highly developed nations said Dr. Michael Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme.\n\n\"If you have a huge wave of cases, you will see a lot of severity and you will see hospital systems coming under pressure,\" he said.\n\nHe warned already stressed heath systems may fail, and urged they prepare now.\n\n\"Make sure you have the health workers in place, make sure you have the clinical trials in place. Make sure you've got oxygen supplies in place. Make sure that you're vaccinating the unvaccinated,\" Ryan said. \"Make sure you're taking every opportunity individually and at the community level to stop transmission where you can.\"\n\nThe omicron variant is fueling misinformation about COVID: Experts explain why and how to spot false claims.\n\nOmicron appears able to reinfect people who caught an earlier variant of the virus, and those infected longer ago are at higher risk of reinfection.\n\nPeople infected in South Africa's first wave early last year, have a 73% chance of reinfection, while those infected with the beta variant have a 60% chance of reinfection and those infected in its most recent delta wave face a 40% risk of reinfection with omicron, the new study showed.\n\nThat fits with findings from a preliminary briefing released by the United Kingdom on Friday showing an approximately three- to eight-fold increased risk of reinfection with the omicron variant, Topol said.\n\nThere has been some hope that omicron would cause fewer cases of severe disease than its predecessors, but that remains unclear.\n\nThe rate of hospital and intensive care unit admissions is lower than with other variants – 29% lower than with the first wave of infections early last year, according to the study. But that may be because so many South Africans recently recovered from infections with delta, Noach said.\n\nChildren continue to show a relatively low rate of infection with omicron, as they have with earlier variants, the study showed.\n\nChildren infected with omicron have so far had a 20% higher risk of hospital admission for complications than they did with earlier variants, according to Shirley Collie, chief health analytics actuary at Discovery Health.\n\n“This is early data and requires careful follow up,\" Collie said in a company press release. But the finding lines up with an earlier warning from South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases of an increase in hospital admissions for children under 5.\n\nOmicron is here: How to manage your anxiety about the new variant\n\nAnecdotal reports from South African hospitals suggest that most young children hospitalized with COVID-19 tested positive on routine screening, after going to the hospital for an unrelated reason.\n\n\"It's a peculiarity that hasn't been explained,\" Topol said of the high rate of hospital admissions for children. \"It hasn't yet been seen in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway and other places hard hit by omicron.\"\n\nCollie said, “Children were 51% less likely to test positive for COVID19 relative to adults in the Omicron period, and overall, the risk of children being admitted to hospital for COVID19 complications remains low.”\n\nThe world shouldn’t focus only on the early data coming out of South Africa and the United Kingdom showing omicron might be milder, because when omicron gets to different populations it might behave differently, said Dr. Abdirahman Mahamud, WHO COVID-19 incident commander.\n\nEven if omicron does prove to be milder, delta remains a threat.\n\n“We are caught between two elephants, the delta and the omicron,” he said. “These are massive, angry elephants.”\n\nContact Elizabeth Weise at eweise@usatoday.com\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

But they remain below that seen in the wake of and during the pandemic, according to the CDC.\n\nThis follows a pattern of COVID-19 rising to a peak in late summer, slowing and then peaking again around the new year. \"Right now, we do not know to what extent JN.1 may be contributing to these increases or possible increases through the rest of December like those seen in previous years,\" the agency said.\n\nDeaths due to COVID have fallen slightly, but that could be because cause of death statistics can lag behind other results.\n\nWhat are the JN.1 COVID variant symptoms?\n\nSymptoms of COVID-19 infection as a result of JN.1 remain similar to that from other variants, the CDC says. They may include:\n\nFever or chills.\n\nCough.\n\nSore throat.\n\nCongestion or runny nose.\n\nHeadache.\n\nMuscle aches.\n\nDifficulty breathing.\n\nFatigue.\n\nNew loss of taste or smell.\n\n\"Brain fog\" (feeling less wakeful and aware).\n\nGastrointestinal symptoms (upset stomach, mild diarrhea, vomiting).\n\nContributing: Mary Walrath-Holdridge\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.What's everyone talking about?

By the time delta was named a \"variant of concern\" by the World Health Organization in May 2021, it had already spread in India for months and had been seeded across the globe.\n\nIn contrast, omicron was first reported to the WHO on Tuesday as COVID-19 cases in South Africa spiked to thousands per day. By Friday, it had been named and labeled a \"variant of concern,\" the most serious type.\n\nWith omicron's high number of mutations, experts have raised yet unanswered questions about the risk of reinfection for people who have been vaccinated or previously infected with other variants.\n\nExperts have applauded the WHO for moving quickly to sound the alarm on omicron, and South Africa for its fast, transparent reporting on the variant.\n\nThat will kickstart studies over the next few weeks into its contagiousness, virulence, and \"immune escape,\" which is its ability to resist an immune response from prior infections or from vaccines, emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University Dr. Leana Wen said.\n\n\"The level of alarm at this point is completely appropriate,\" Wen told USA TODAY. \"I would much rather that we take action and then find out that, actually this variant does respond very well to the vaccines that we have.\"\n\nEarly data is troubling, but incomplete, experts say.\n\nThe outbreak of the omicron variant in South Africa was like a \"vertical line,\" according to Dr. Eric Topol, vice president for research at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California.\n\n\"We haven't seen anything like that,\" he told USA TODAY. \"The line of slope is much higher than the initial delta line.\"\n\nTopol said the number of concerning mutations to the virus may make it more contagious than previous variants, and that it is likely to have evolved in an immunocompromised person.\n\nAlso in the news:\n\n►The CDC issued a level 4 advisory, its highest, due to \"very high'' COVID levels in eight African countries, a level that carries an \"avoid travel'' designation. The State Department also raised the countries to level 4, which means \"do not travel.\"\n\n►The WHO says it skipped two letters in the Greek alphabet — Nu and Xi — in naming the new variant omicron because Nu is too easily confused with the word \"new\" and because Xi is a common last name, according to a statement from the agency.\n\n►The CDC this week dropped its percentage of vaccinated adults in Pennsylvania by nearly five percentage points, to 68.9% from 73.7%, in what apparently was a data correction to weed out duplicates.\n\n►The World Trade Organization is postponing its conference of government ministers set to open Tuesday after Switzerland initiated new travel restrictions following the emergence of omicron.\n\n►Stocks sank Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly falling more than 1,000 points, as investors reacted to news of omicron.\n\n📈Today's numbers: The U.S. has recorded more than 48 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 776,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Global totals: More than 260.9 million cases and more than 5.1 million deaths. More than 196.1 million Americans — roughly 59% of the population — are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.\n\nKeep refreshing this page for the latest news. Want more?

He added the cases were related to travel from southern Africa.\n\nIn Germany, the Max von Pettenkofer Institute, a Munich-based microbiology center, said the omicron variant was confirmed in two travelers who arrived on a flight from South Africa on Nov. 24.\n\nThe French Ministry of Health announced eight possible cases of the Omicron variant on Sunday. Two cases were discovered in Canada after travelers returned from Nigeria, according to the Ontario government.\n\nAuthorities in the Netherlands are working to see if 61 people who tested positive for COVID-19 after arriving on flights from South Africa have the omicron variant. The Czech Republic also detected a suspected omicron case in a person who spent time in Namibia, the Guardian reported.\n\nAn Italian man who previously traveled to Mozambique on business landed in Rome on Nov. 11 and returned to his home near Naples. He and five family members tested positive, and the omicron variant was confirmed by Sacco hospital in Milan. The man had been vaccinated, Italy’s National Health Institute said.\n\nThere are likely already undiscovered cases in the U.S., Dr. Eric Topol told USA TODAY, a concern echoed by presidential medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci in a Saturday NBC interview.\n\n\"We have not detected it yet, but when you have a virus that is showing this degree of transmissibility and you're having travel-related cases they've noted in other places already, when you have a virus like this, it almost invariably is going to go all over,\" Fauci said.\n\nFauci called President Joe Biden's decision to restrict travel from South Africa and other countries in the region \"prudent\" and told Americans not to panic but to take the variant seriously as health experts learn more about omicron.\n\nHe also urged vaccinations, adding that booster shots give \"a very, very important edge\" in warding off the virus, including potentially dangerous variants.\n\nScientists wait for answers to key questions about the omicron variant...\n\n... Including key questions that remain unanswered.\n\nAshish K. Jha, dean of Brown University's school of public health, noted three metrics for evaluating the potential effect of a variant in a Twitter thread: if the new variant is more transmissible than the current predominant variant, if the variant causes more severe disease and if it will render prior infections or vaccines less effective.\n\nAll these questions remain largely unanswered, though Jha said it is \"super unlikely\" that the variant will render vaccines useless.\n\nExperts say it may take weeks to know if current vaccines are less effective against omicron. Epidemiologist Céline Gounder estimated it may take about two weeks to make this determination.\n\nGounder said in a Twitter thread that scientists don't yet know how omicron may compare to delta in terms of how infectious it is and its incubation period.\n\nWhat's happening in South Africa as omicron spreads?\n\nIn two weeks, South Africa has gone from low transmission rates to rapid growth in new cases. The spike in cases happened after a cluster of infections among university students in Pretoria, one of the country's capital cities, grew to hundreds then thousands, spreading to Johannesburg, South Africa’s largest city.\n\nScientists say the new variant is likely responsible for as many as 90% of the new cases, according to South Africa’s health officials.\n\nThe variant has also quickly infected young South Africans, reflecting a shift in the demographic profile of COVID-19 patients.\n\n\"Young people, in their 20s to just over their late 30s, are coming in with moderate to severe disease, some needing intensive care,\" Rudo Mathivha, head of the intensive care unit at Soweto’s Baragwanath Hospital, told an online press briefing. Some are vaccinated, but few are fully vaccinated, Mathivha said.\n\nDespite the country's case numbers remaining relatively low with 2,828 new confirmed cases Friday, Mathivha urged hospitals to have critical care beds ready in case of the \"worst case scenario\" that omicron has a similar effect as delta.\n\nMathivha also encouraged vaccinations. About 40% of South African adults are currently vaccinated, and vaccination rates are lower among younger adults.\n\nOmicron's impact on vaccines unclear, but contingency plans rolling out\n\nHealth experts have said it will likely be weeks before the world has good data about how omicron may reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines, but Moderna has already announced a three-point strategy to combat the new variant.\n\nModerna says its strategy for responding to omicron involves three options for boosting COVID-19 vaccination, should the variant prove problematic for current vaccines.\n\nThe three options, according to a Friday release from the company: A higher dose booster, shots currently being studied that are designed to \"anticipate mutations such as those that have emerged in the omicron variant\" and an omicron-specific booster — which is already in the works.\n\nAndy Slavitt, who previously served as Biden's White House senior adviser for COVID response, said in a tweet that both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have estimated a vaccine to combat a new variant could be developed in about 3 months, with some regulatory and logistical hurtles to follow.\n\n\"If we start in early December, new vaccines could be available by summer in much of the world,\" Slavitt tweeted.\n\nMultiple media organizations on Friday reported Pfizer-BioNTech is studying the new variant and expects data within weeks. If warranted, a targeted vaccine could be developed within 6 weeks and ship within 100 days, the reports say.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is also testing its current vaccine against omicron, according to CNBC.\n\nProfessor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told BBC Radio he was cautiously optimistic existing COVID vaccines would be effective in preventing serious illness from the omicron variant, adding that mutations in omicron appear to be in similar regions as the mutations in other variants.\n\n\"That tells you that despite those mutations existing in other variants the vaccines have continued to prevent serious disease as we’ve moved through alpha, beta, gamma and delta,\" Pollard, whose team developed the AstraZeneca vaccines, said. \"At least from a speculative point of view we have some optimism that the vaccine should still work against a new variant for serious disease but really we need to wait several weeks to have that confirmed.\"\n\n– Joel Shannon, USA TODAY & The Associated Press\n\nWith identification of omicron, are more travel restrictions ahead?\n\nJust when things were looking up for airlines and the rest of the travel industry, another COVID-19 variant has emerged. Early reports of the omicron variant instantly sparked restrictions on travel.\n\nThe United States, which lifted a pandemic-long travel ban from dozens of international countries including South Africa on Nov. 8, on Monday will reinstitute the ban for foreign nationals from eight African countries.\n\nThe CDC issued a level 4 advisory, its highest, due to \"very high'' COVID-19 levels, a level that carries an \"avoid travel'' designation. The State Department, whose COVID-19 advisories generally parallel the CDC's, also raised the countries to level 4, which means \"do not travel.\"\n\n“We're going to be cautious, make sure there is no travel to and from South Africa and six other countries in that region. Except for American citizens who are able to come back,\" Biden said Friday.\n\nRead more on what travelers need to know about the new restrictions and the potential impact on travel in the months ahead if the omicron variant spreads rapidly across the globe.\n\n– Dawn Gilbertson, USA TODAY\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/07/20/covid-after-vaccine-serious-illness-rare-breakthrough-cases-delta/8013026002/", "title": "COVID after vaccine: Serious illness is rare with breakthrough cases", "text": "Everyone wants vaccines to be perfect – and the COVID-19 ones nearly are. Only a tiny fraction of those who are vaccinated end up seriously ill from an infection.\n\nBut still, some fully vaccinated people will get sick, some will pass on the virus, and a very small number will die despite their shots.\n\n\"The efficacy of the vaccines in preventing hospitalizations and death is unbelievable,\" said Carlos del Rio, an epidemiologist and distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. \"It's not 100%. But nothing in this world is 100%.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/06/22/michigan-25-delta-covid-variant-cases-what-you-need-know/7773348002/", "title": "Delta variant in Michigan: 25 cases confirmed in state", "text": "The news is good when it comes to coronavirus in Michigan and most of the U.S. — as case rates continue to fall, the percentage of positive tests drops to the lowest point since the start of the pandemic and hospitalizations and deaths from the virus dwindle.\n\nThe country is headed for a \"bright summer. Prayerfully, a summer of joy,\" President Joe Biden said at a Friday news conference. But he said he is still concerned about people who haven't been vaccinated and their risk as a more contagious — and potentially more deadly — variant gains a bigger foothold in the U.S.\n\nCalled the delta variant, this strain originated in India and swept through that nation in April and May, causing a massive surge in cases and thousands of deaths. Since then, it has spread to more than 80 countries, including the U.S., and pushed the United Kingdom to extend coronavirus restrictions as case rates climbed.\n\n\"It's kind of been the story of the pandemic that there's always a surprise around the corner,\" said Joshua Petrie, an assistant research professor at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health.\n\nThe following are answers to some of the biggest questions about the delta variant, how many cases have been detected in Michigan and why this strain matters.\n\nWhy are people concerned about the delta variant?\n\nIt's possibly the most contagious variant to be identified so far in the pandemic.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention elevated the delta strain to a variant of concern last week, noting that this mutation of the virus spreads easily and also doesn't appear to respond as well to monoclonal antibody treatments, and it may be more severe and result in higher rates of hospitalization.\n\nDr. Michael J. Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Programme, warned during a news conference Monday that the delta variant is a real threat to vulnerable people around the world.\n\n\"This particular delta variant is faster,\" Ryan said. \"It is better. It will pick off the more vulnerable more efficiently than previous variants. And therefore if there are vulnerable people left without vaccination, they remain even at further risk.\n\n\"All of these viruses have been lethal in their own regard. This virus has the potential to be more lethal because it's more efficient in the way it transmits between humans and it will eventually find those vulnerable individuals who will become severely ill, have to be hospitalized and potentially die.\"\n\nThe key in preventing another statewide surge or pockets of outbreaks of the delta variant is getting people vaccinated, Petrie told the Free Press.\n\n\"The degree to how pocketed it is will be driven by overall (vaccine) coverage within a state,\" he said. \"So, if the state has very high coverage, there probably will be pockets of outbreaks. If it's low coverage overall, there may be kind of bigger statewide outbreaks like we've experienced throughout the pandemic.\"\n\nMichigan, where about 61% of residents 16 and older have gotten at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, is \"generally better off than a lot of states,\" Petrie said. \"But still, there's definitely room for improvement.\n\n\"We know that the vaccines work well against the Delta strain. So the best thing we can do to prevent these outbreaks is getting vaccinated.\"\n\nIs the delta variant in Michigan?\n\nYes. As of Monday, 25 cases of the delta variant have been identified in five Michigan counties — Wayne, Livingston, Oakland, Lapeer and Branch — since May 9, said Lynn Sutfin, a spokesperson for the state health department.\n\nHowever, of those 25 cases, 11 were identified among out-of-state individuals who were tested in Michigan, she said.\n\nIt's difficult to have a true, real-time picture of how prevalent the strain is in the state because only a small number of coronavirus test samples undergo whole genome sequencing to determine whether they're variant cases, she said. It takes as long as a week to complete the sequencing process for each test.\n\n\"We only have information for the subset of COVID cases which undergo sequencing,\" Sutfin said. \"During the last month, we have not seen a large increase in the B.1.617.2 cases reported ... since the first identifications.\"\n\nHow transmissible is the delta variant?\n\nIt is extremely contagious.\n\nMichigan was walloped in the spring by the B.1.1.7 variant, now known as the alpha variant, which was identified in the U.K. That strain was considered 50% more transmissible than other previous strains of the virus, and led to a statewide surge in cases, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nThe delta variant appears to be even more contagious than the alpha strain. A study by Public Health England suggests delta is 60% more transmissible than alpha.\n\n\"But I think some of the things that may be somewhat reassuring is that even with the B.1.1.7 outbreak or surge that we had in the spring here, we didn't have the level of death that we did with previous surges, and I would attribute most of that to the high vaccination coverage in older adults,\" Petrie said.\n\n\"And I think that's been kind of consistent with what they've seen in the U.K. so far, too. It is that even though they're getting another pretty big surge right now, they're not seeing the level of death that they had previously. So that might be one bright spot.\"\n\nHow prevalent is the delta variant in the US?\n\nAll indications are that the delta variant is beginning to take off across the nation, said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Last week, he told \"Face the Nation\" that the delta variant accounted for 10% of all U.S. coronavirus cases, and its prevalence is doubling every two weeks.\n\nIt could become the dominant strain of the virus nationally within one to two months, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nDo the vaccines work against the delta variant?\n\nYes. Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the president and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a news conference earlier this month that new research suggests that two weeks after the Pfizer vaccine is fully administered, it's about 88% effective against the delta strain.\n\nFauci cautioned, however, that a single dose doesn't appear to offer as much protection. Three weeks after a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the study showed it was about 33% effective in preventing sympomatic COVID-19.\n\nIt underscored, he said, that it's vital that Americans show up for second-dose appointments of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine.\n\nWhat about the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine? Does it protect against the delta variant?\n\nGottleib said the one-dose J&J vaccine appears to be about 60% effective against the delta strain.\n\n\"Even with the previous variants, the mRNA vaccines with two doses had better effectiveness than the Johnson & Johnson, but Johnson & Johnson still had pretty decent protection and it was definitely a lot, lot better than being unvaccinated,\" Petrie said.\n\nWho is most vulnerable to the delta variant?\n\nPeople who are not vaccinated: These are the most vulnerable.\n\n\"The data is clear: If you are unvaccinated, you're at risk of getting seriously ill or dying or spreading it,\" Biden said Friday. \"People getting seriously ill and being hospitalized due to COVID-19 are those who have not been fully vaccinated. The new variant will leave unvaccinated people even more vulnerable. ... It’s a variant that is more easily transmissible, potentially deadlier, and particularly dangerous for young people.\"\n\nPeople who've gotten only one dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine: Research suggests a single dose offers significantly less protection than two.\n\nPeople who have compromised immune systems: This includes those who take immune-suppressing medication to manage health conditions, such as cancer, auto-immune disorders, and people who have had transplants or have HIV.\n\nEven if they've been fully vaccinated, there is a possibility that they may not be as protected as people who are not immune-compromised.\n\nWhat should I do if I've not been vaccinated or have a compromised immune system?\n\nWhat it is recommended at the moment is in spite of the relaxation of the coronavirus restrictions and mask mandates, immunosuppressed patients should continue to wear masks, use hand sanitizer and practice self-distancing if they're going to be in a public place where no one can tell the vaccination status of the people sitting next to them, said Dr. Millie Samaniego, director of the kidney, pancreas transplant program at the Henry Ford Transplant Institute.\n\nWhen healthy people get vaccines, Samaniego said, it helps to protect those who are immune-compromised. That's why anyone who lives with people who have those underlying conditions or is close to them should be vaccinated.\n\n\"We just need to be realistic and try to do the right thing,\" she said. \"As citizens, we have responsibilities towards older people. Being immunized is one of them, in my opinion. ... I think we all should pursue vaccination.\"\n\nPeople with cancer, autoimmune diseases and those who've had organ transplants should get vaccinated, too.\n\n\"There are no contraindications,\" she said.\n\nWhere can I get a COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nThe vaccines are free and available at most pharmacies on a walk-up basis with no need for an appointment.\n\nYou can text your ZIP code to 438829 to get an immediate response with vaccination sites closest to you. The text messaging system also will help you get a free Uber or Lyft ride to and from vaccination sites or free child care.\n\nYoung kids can't get vaccinated. What about them?\n\nChildren ages 12 and older are eligible for the Pfizer vaccine in the United States, but no COVID-19 vaccine has FDA emergency use authorization for children younger than 12.\n\n\"For the older children that are eligible, (parents) definitely should consider getting them vaccinated,\" Petrie said. And as soon as a COVID-19 vaccine gets approval for younger kids, get them vaccinated as well.\n\n\"I think the position we're in now, ... especially in Michigan, we have pretty low levels of transmission. But there is that risk, particularly with the delta variant, that things could pick up again. I think that makes it kind of important to keep an eye on what are the trends in your local area, and keep an ear out for advisories from your health department or the state, and try to base some of your activities around that.\n\n\"If transmission stays low you can, as the governor has suggested, start getting back to a lot of normal activities. But if things pick back up again, you may want to consider going back to some of the measures that we've been doing throughout the pandemic,\" such as wearing a mask and avoiding large gatherings, especially indoors.\n\nCould the delta variant lead to more COVID-19 restrictions?\n\nProbably not, Biden said.\n\n\"I don't think so because so many people have already been vaccinated,\" he said, \"but the delta variant can cause more people to die in areas where people have not been vaccinated.\"\n\nCould the delta variant affect the start of the school year in the fall?\n\nIt might, Gottlieb said.\n\n\"When we saw that big surge of infection in Michigan (in March and April 2021), it happened right around the time they opened their schools,\" Gottlieb, the former director of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, told CNBC on Monday. \"And I think the consensus was among most people that the opening of the schools contributed to that big surge. We saw the schools did become focal points of spread of the B.1.1.7, which was the more transmissible strain.\n\n\"Now we have the new delta variant which is even more transmissible.\"\n\nSchools, Gottlieb said, would be smart to consider some coronavirus mitigation measures when they reopen.\n\n\"I think a lot of school districts are going to want to start the year and probably should with some forms of mitigation,\" he said, \"whether it's masks, or just some distancing and good prudent practices within the school ... until they figure out which way this goes, and whether or not these models are right.\n\n\"Most of the models showing upsurge early in the fall; they show this happening in September with the new one, with the delta variant.\"\n\nContact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

But BA.2 has 28 unique spike protein mutations, so it's like a cousin in the family of four currently identified omicron subvariants.\n\nSince omicron was first identified in November, it has infected nearly 90 million people worldwide in 10 weeks — more than were infected in all of 2020, said Dr. Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization.\n\n\"We're now starting to see a very worrying increase in deaths in most regions of the world,\" he said Tuesday. \"We're concerned that a narrative has taken hold in some countries, that because of vaccines and because of omicron's high transmissibility and lower severity, preventing transmission is no longer possible and no longer necessary.\n\n\"Nothing could be further from the truth. More transmission means more deaths. We are not calling for any country to return to so-called lockdown, but we're calling on all countries to protect their people using every tool in the toolkit.\"\n\nHis comments came as several European nations repealed or eased COVID-19 restrictions even as case rates rise. That's because hospitalizations aren't climbing at the same pace as cases.\n\n\"It's premature for any country either to surrender or to declare victory,\" Ghebreyesus said. \"This virus is dangerous and it continues to evolve before our our very eyes. WHO is currently tracking four sublineages of the omicron variant of concern, including BA.2.\n\n\"This virus will continue to evolve which is why we call on countries to continue testing, surveillance and sequencing. We can't fight this virus if we don't know what it's doing. And we must continue to work to ensure all people have access to vaccines.\"\n\nHow prevalent is BA.2?\n\nAs of Wednesday, the BA.2 omicron subvariant was estimated to account for about 1.5% of all U.S. coronavirus cases, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"Of course, that varies for different parts of the country,\" she said.\n\nIn Michigan, no cases of the BA.2 subvariant had been identified through whole genome sequencing as of Thursday morning, said health department spokesperson Lynn Sutfin.\n\nBut the BA.2 subvariant has been detected in at least 57 countries and 33 U.S. states and may be circulating in Michigan even though it has yet to be discovered among the tiny portion of coronavirus tests that undergo sequencing.\n\nAll the states that border Michigan — Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin — have identified BA.2 cases, according to outbreak.info, which analyzes data from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data, which tracks emerging variants of the virus around the world.\n\nWhy is BA.2 called stealth omicron?\n\nDr. Dennis Cunningham, the medical director of infection control and prevention for Detroit-based Henry Ford Health System, said calling the BA.2 subvariant stealth omicron is a little misleading.\n\n\"It's not that it's sneaky or anything like that,\" he said. Rapid antigen tests and PCR tests still work to detect an infection with the BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIt's just that it's not as easy to deduce from a PCR coronavirus test that it's the omicron strain rather than delta or some other variant of the virus, he said, because BA.2 mutated in a way that requires scientists to use whole genomic sequencing to determine which variant it is.\n\nThe original BA.1 form of omicron could be identified with PCR tests because one of three genetic targets was missing.\n\n\"If you had two out of the three targets, you were pretty sure it was omicron,\" Cunningham said of the original BA.1 omicron strain.\n\n\"They call this the stealth variant because it regained those three targets so you could no longer tell what strain it is unless you do all the sequencing.\"\n\nThat means a sample must undergo the expensive and time-consuming sequencing process, which can take more than a week to complete, to be certain which strain of the virus caused the infection.\n\n\"I don't know that people should really call it a stealth variant so much as it just mutated again and made it harder to detect it\" without sequencing, Cunningham said.\n\nIs BA.2 more contagious?\n\nYes, it is believed to be.\n\nA newly published study comparing the spread of omicron's BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants in about 8,500 homes in Denmark from December and January found that BA.2 is \"inherently substantially more transmissible than BA.1.\"\n\nThe study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, suggests BA.2 is about 33% more than infectious than its cousin BA.1.\n\nSo that means this newest evolution of the virus is even more contagious than the original omicron, which already was considered among the most highly transmissible diseases — estimated to spread about 100 times more easily than the delta variant, said Dr. John Brooks, medical director of infection prevention for McLaren Health Care, a Grand Blanc-based health system with 15 hospitals in Michigan and Ohio.\n\n\"It does look like the BA.2 is going to kind of leapfrog over BA.1, and that already has happened in South Africa,\" he said.\n\nDoes it cause more severe illness?\n\nNo. The BA.2 omicron subvariant appears to cause milder disease, just like its BA.1 cousin, when compared with the delta variant and other strains of the virus.\n\n\"Although it appears to be more infectious, it's certainly isn't more aggressive because we're not seeing the hospitalizations\" rise along with the rate of infection, Brooks said, in places where BA.2 is spreading rapidly, such as South Africa and Denmark.\n\nHowever, that does not mean BA.2 is harmless and won't cause severe illness and death in some people.\n\nMilder doesn't mean mild, Walensky said.\n\n\"When we look at other disease severity indicators measured among people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 — such as hospital length of stay, ICU admissions, and deaths — these indicators are lower with omicron than during previous periods of high transmission,\" she said last week.\n\n\"Although it's encouraging that omicron appears to be causing less severe disease, it's important to remember that we are still facing a high overall burden of disease. Hospitalizations have rapidly increased in a short amount of time, putting a strain on many local health systems.\"\n\nPeople who are unvaccinated are at highest risk of hospitalization and death, Brooks said, even from the omicron variant.\n\n\"When I look at my ICUs (intensive care units) throughout the health system, the people that are sick in our ICUs remain the unvaccinated,\" he said. \"They're the ones that don't have any protection at all.\"\n\nSome patients who are fully vaccinated but have not had booster doses of the vaccines also have needed hospitalization, he said.\n\n\"We do have a small number of them that have come to hospital,\" Brooks said. \"But virtually everybody that comes to the hospital who is vaccinated and not boosted ... is older with other health troubles. We've had a few boosted people end up getting admitted, but we've had nobody boosted in the ICU. So they just don't seem to be getting that sick.\n\n\"If you're vaccinated and boosted, you have really good immunity against omicron. Whether it's BA.1 or BA.2, it doesn't matter. It looks really good.\"\n\nDo the vaccines work against it?\n\nYes, especially in people who've gotten booster shots.\n\nA new study from the United Kingdom Health Security Agency suggests vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic illness from the BA.2 subvariant is 70%. That compares with about 63% for the BA.1, original omicron strain.\n\nThat's great news, said Katelyn Jetelina, an assistant professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health, in her Your Local Epidemiologist substack.\n\n\"Even though COVID-19 is getting less and less lethal on an individual-level, COVID-19 is also getting more and more transmissible,\" she wrote.\n\nIn the U.S., where the vaccination rate is still too low and the percentage of the population that's been boosted is still lower, omicron's lower severity is being canceled out by its high rate of transmission, she said, and \"continues to make a big impact on population-level metrics, like death.\"\n\nA CDC study published last week found that those who'd gotten a third booster dose of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines were as much as 90% less likely than unvaccinated people to be hospitalized from the virus.\n\n\"The percent of people who are currently hospitalized due to COVID-19 are disproportionately unvaccinated and disproportionately not boosted,\" Walensky said.\n\nIf I already had COVID-19, am I protected from BA.2?\n\n\"People who have had omicron look like they're pretty much not getting BA.2,\" Brooks said, noting that because the omicron strain has only been circulating since December, the past infection would have been very recent.\n\n\"It's a pretty short time frame, so they just have good natural immunity that hasn't waned or gone anywhere yet, so that makes good sense.\"\n\nBut not if you likely had the delta variant, alpha or any of the earlier strains, there is a risk of reinfection, especially if you haven't been vaccinated.\n\n\"We know our natural immunity to COVID wanes or goes down pretty much by four to six months in most people,\" Brooks said. \"So if you're not vaccinated, and you've had a primary infection with one of the other ones, your immunity is probably waning and that's why people are getting omicron.\n\n\"We've had a lot of people that had COVID ... back in early 2020 and they've all gotten omicron when they're not vaccinated because their immunity has waned. It's just not strong enough to protect them any further.\"\n\nCould BA.2 cause another big surge?\n\nMaybe, but probably not, Cunningham said.\n\n\"I don't really think it's going to do anything major,\" he said.\n\n\"It has already really run through our population. I expect the numbers to keep going down unless there's a brand new mutation that comes up and a brand new variant.\"\n\nJetelina said BA.2 might drive a \"prolonged omicron wave across many countries. For example, in South Africa cases are due to start increasing because BA.2 is taking hold. How much cases increases, though, will be important to closely follow over the next few weeks.\"\n\nAre we likely to see more new variants?\n\n\"We probably will have future variants,\" Cunningham said.\n\nAs long as the virus continues to spread, especially among people with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or autoimmune diseases, there's a risk for more mutated strains.\n\n\"We think that that's where we're getting all these new variants. It's in people with immune deficiencies who can't control the virus,\" Cunningham said. \"It just keeps replicating and sometimes you get an unlucky mutation that makes it a little nastier.\n\n\"That's why I encourage as many people to get your booster dose as possible so we don't get these variants running through our population. And again, going to the food store, going out shopping, if we wear a mask, we could really stop this from circulating.\"\n\nCould the omicron variant bring us closer to the end of the pandemic?\n\n\"We have to be totally honest that we don't know,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the chief medical adviser to the president.\n\n\"We believe that we are now going in the right direction and the best-case scenario ... is that with the tools that we have — the vaccination, the boosting, the testing, the masking and all the other mitigations that we know about — when you have a level of community protection ... that we will reach a stage, and I hope it's sooner or later, when ... this will not dominate our lives.\n\n\"We can't guarantee that there will not be another variant that challenges us, but the best that we can do with that is to be prepared for it. And that's why we're doing all the things that we're doing with regard to getting better, more advanced vaccine.\"\n\nA newer, more protective vaccine, along with the discovery of new treatments, Fauci said, \"will be part of the armamentarium that will ultimately — even with the appearance of additional variants — get us to the point where we will not be dominated by this virus, where we can return to a degree of normality that we all crave.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's going to take us to the end of the pandemic,\" Cunningham said. \"If there are future mutations that are similar to omicron, hopefully we get enough cross protection that it's over, but I just can't predict what the next mutations are going to be and if there's going to be cross protection\n\n\"What I think is going to be more likely to end this pandemic is a universal vaccine against all the coronaviruses. Most of the changes in the coronaviruses or COVID, specifically, have been in the spike protein. Different targets that are white blood cells called T-lymphocytes have not changed.\n\n\"So there are various groups around the country that are working on a vaccine that would hit those targets that aren't changing. So that's the hope, but that probably wouldn't be out for another year and a half.\"\n\nJetelina cited baseball legend Yogi Berra, saying: “ 'It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.' And SARS-CoV-2 is making it even more difficult with its random evolutionary patterns.\"\n\nContact Kristen Jordan Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

And yet, on the other hand, we are starting to see some new and concerning trends,\" Walensky said Thursday.\n\nIn Michigan, 54 delta variant cases were identified as of Friday — up 69% from the 32 cases that had been identified as of June 23, according to state data.\n\nThose cases have been confirmed in the following counties and the city of Detroit:\n\nNine cases each in Wayne and Branch counties\n\nSix cases in St. Joseph County\n\nFour cases in Oakland County\n\nTwo cases each in Shiawassee, Berrien and Livingston counties\n\nOne case each in Clinton, Huron, Ingham, Kalamazoo, Lapeer, Macomb, Midland and Ottawa counties as well as the city of Detroit\n\n11 cases were identified in Michigan among people from out of state\n\nHowever, there likely are far more cases that have not been identified in Michigan. That's because only a small number of coronavirus test samples undergo whole genome sequencing to determine whether they're variant cases.\n\nIt's difficult to get a true, real-time picture of how prevalent the strain is in Michigan because it takes as long as a week to complete the sequencing process for each test.\n\nIn addition to being what Walensky said is \"hyper-transmissible\" — twice as contagious as the B.1.1.7 alpha variant that drove a spring coronavirus surge in Michigan — the delta variant doesn't appear to respond as well to monoclonal antibody treatments as other strains.\n\nAlthough some early research from the United Kingdom suggests the variant may lead to a higher rate of COVID-19 hospitalization, there isn't conclusive evidence yet to suggest it causes more severe disease or that it's more deadly than other strains of the virus.\n\nDo vaccines work against delta variant?\n\nThe Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines offer good protection from severe illness, hospitalization and death from the variant in people who are fully vaccinated, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nThe mRNA vaccine made by Pfizer was shown in a study from England to be 88% protective against symptomatic disease from the delta variant and 96% protective against hospitalization.\n\n\"You can make a quite reasonable assumption that data that are applicable to Pfizer are also applicable to Moderna,\" which is a similar mRNA vaccine, Fauci said.\n\nThe J&J vaccine, he said, is similar to AstraZeneca's adenovirus vector vaccine. AstraZeneca's vaccine was shown to be \"92% effective against hospitalization from the delta variant,\" said Fauci, who also is chief medical adviser to the president.\n\nAdditionally, J&J announced earlier this month that it conducted studies to see how well its one-dose vaccine protects against the delta variant. By testing the blood of vaccinated people in its clinical trials, the company said those who got a single dose of J&J had neutralizing antibodies and \"robust, durable cellular immune response\" from the delta variant and other strains of the virus for as long as eight months.\n\n\"So what's the bottom line of all of this?\" Fauci said. \"The only conclusion one can reasonably come to ... is: Please get vaccinated. It will protect you against the surging of the delta variant.\"\n\nWhich places are at risk from delta variant?\n\nIn Michigan, two counties, Cass and Hillsdale, as well as the city of Detroit, have the lowest vaccination rates in the state among vaccine-eligible residents ages 12 and older. In all three, fewer than 40% of vaccine-eligible residents have gotten at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nStatewide, 62% of residents ages 16 and older had gotten at least one dose as of Wednesday. Nationally, 67.3% of all adults have gotten a shot, according to the CDC.\n\nIn pockets of the U.S. where vaccination coverage is below 40% — from parts of Missouri and Arkansas, to northwest Colorado, bits of Nevada, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Louisiana, Arizona and a few other states — coronavirus case rates and hospitalizations are rising, Walensky said.\n\nSome small clusters and larger outbreaks of the virus have stemmed from camps and community events where prevention strategies are not enforced.\n\n\"Widespread vaccination is what will truly turn the corner on this pandemic,\" she said. \"Please know if you are not vaccinated, you remain susceptible, especially from the ... variant and are particularly at risk for severe illness and death.\"\n\nAlthough it may feel as if the hold the pandemic has had on the nation has loosened in recent weeks, President Joe Biden said it's not over yet.\n\nIn announcing his plan to boost vaccination rates earlier this week, Biden urged young people who've yet to get a jab to take the vaccine.\n\n\"Study after study after study has shown that since early May, virtually every COVID-19 hospitalization and death in the United States has been among the unvaccinated,\" Biden said.\n\nHis administration plans to bring vaccines into neighborhoods \"literally knocking on doors,\" to get more doses to employers for workplace vaccine clinics, to pharmacies, family doctors and pediatricians so school-age kids who are eligible for vaccines can get them \"as they go for back-to-school checkups or getting ready for their physicals they need for fall sports.\"\n\nMobile vaccine clinics will also be taken to events like festivals, sports games and religious sites and \"wherever we can find people gathered,\" he said.\n\nAdditionally, federal COVID-19 Surge Response teams will be deployed to areas where outbreaks of the virus are identified to respond and prevent the spread.\n\n\"We’re going to deploy things like testing to expand detection of the virus, medicines to help treat the infected, and we’re going to provide federal personnel to fill gaps in staffing, and technical experts to help investigate outbreaks — because they’re going to happen in states with very low vaccination rates,\" Biden said.\n\nIs it time to put on our masks again?\n\nThe World Health Organization, concerned about the spread of the delta variant, continues to urge everyone — including fully vaccinated people — to wear masks indoors.\n\nBut the CDC dropped its mask guidelines for vaccinated Americans in May; despite the growing prevalence of the delta variant in the U.S., the agency still hasn't wavered.\n\nThe agency issued new guidance Friday that says teachers and students who've been vaccinated do not need to wear masks in school buildings, but their unvaccinated classmates and teachers should.\n\n\"You are protected if you are vaccinated from hospitalization, severe disease and death,\" Walensky said. \"Data in our country and numerous other countries have demonstrated that.\n\n\"I want to emphasize, however, that if you are not vaccinated — first, you should go get vaccinated. But second, until you are fully vaccinated, you're definitively not protected from disease that is around you, and in those situations, we would absolutely ... suggest continuing to wear a mask.\"\n\nFauci said people can make their own choices about masks based on their own comfort level.\n\n\"For example, if you are an elderly person or if you have ... an underlying disease, you might want to go the extra mile of protection of wearing a mask if you are indoors in an environment with a high degree of infection in the community and a low level of vaccination,\" Fauci said.\n\n\"That is not a mask recommendation; that's just for consideration,\" he said. \"Each individual has their own level of the risk that they would like to take. And there are many individuals who would feel — because of age, or because of an underlying condition — that they might want to wear a mask.\n\n\"Having said that, let me emphasize that if you are vaccinated, you have a very high degree of protection and therefore you do not need to wear a mask.\"\n\nContact Kristen Jordan Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

Tariffs may not cover them.", "text": "President Donald Trump’s tariffs won’t raise enough cash to fund the $2,000 \"dividend\" checks he proposes to send to millions of Americans, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.\n\nTrump has repeatedly floated the idea of $2,000 dividend checks to pass along revenue from his import taxes to low- and middle-income Americans.\n\nIn a Nov. 10 post on Truth Social, Trump suggested tariffs would raise enough revenue to fund dividend checks, with enough left over to \"SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT.\"\n\nTax Foundation researchers do not agree.\n\nThe foundation, which generally favors lower taxes, estimates Trump’s tariffs will raise $158.4 billion in 2025 and $207.5 billion in 2026.\n\nWho, exactly, is getting 'tariff dividend' checks?\n\nTrump has not specified who would get the checks. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested an income limit of $100,000.\n\nFor a Nov. 18 post, the Tax Foundation ran the numbers on three dividend check scenarios, with the most conservative cutting checks only to Americans who earn $100,000 or less.\n\nThe various models yielded costs ranging from $279.8 billion to $606.8 billion. All three exceed the income tariffs will generate this year, according to foundation researchers.\n\n\"The math just doesn’t work,\" said Alex Durante, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation.\n\nAt least two other independent think tanks have reached similar conclusions.\n\nOn Nov. 10, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget predicted tariff dividend checks would cost about $600 billion. On Nov. 17, the Budget Lab at Yale put the cost at $450 billion. Both analyses predicted the cost of dividend checks would exceed the revenue from tariffs.\n\nAre the $2,000 checks really a tariff dividend?\n\nIf tariffs don’t generate enough money to cover the checks, some researchers contend, it’s not really accurate to call them a \"tariff dividend.\" To the extent that their cost exceeded tariff revenues, the checks would amount to an unfunded expense, increasing the national deficit.\n\n\"You could do dividend checks, but they need to match the amount of revenue the tariffs are actually raising,\" said Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow at the libertarian American Enterprise Institute. \"So, I think they got ahead of their skis by promising $2,000, and further ahead of their skis by naming a specific cutoff.\"\n\nTrump has said he wants to send dividend checks some time in 2026.\n\nSome in the Trump administration have voiced optimism that tariffs could indeed raise enough revenue to cover them.\n\nKevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, recently told reporters that \"if you look at how much tariff revenue has been coming in, then there would actually be enough room to cover those checks and not go into the rest of the budget.\"\n\nTo test that thesis, the Tax Foundation examined various dividend check scenarios.\n\nIn the most conservative model, $2,000 checks go out solely to tax filers and their spouses, with a hard cutoff for anyone earning more than $100,000. That scenario would cost $279.8 billion, the foundation estimates.\n\nSending checks to tax filers, spouses and dependents bumps the cost to $368.3 billion. Add in Americans who don’t file tax returns, and the tab rises to $500.8 billion.\n\nIn more expansive scenarios, such as phasing out the checks gradually at higher incomes, the cost of dividend checks could exceed $600 billion.\n\nTariff dividend checks could ease the affordability crisis\n\nTrump is talking about sending money to Americans at a time when consumers are struggling with years of cumulative inflation, and amid persistent talk of a national \"affordability\" crisis.\n\nTrump won public favor in his first term by sending out two rounds of stimulus checks during the COVID-19 pandemic. President Joe Biden approved a third round of payments.\n\nCongress greenlit those payouts. Some observers question whether lawmakers would allow this one.\n\n\"I’m highly skeptical that Congress will appropriate the money necessary for these checks,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"I don’t think Congress has enough people willing to just ignore the budget math.\"\n\nSome Republicans in Congress have telegraphed their unease about writing checks to Americans at a moment when the national deficit stands at $1.8 trillion.\n\n\"I think it would be crazy to send money to people while we have a deficit,\" said Sen. Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican, according to Bloomberg.\n\nTariffs, of course, are one reason why many consumer goods cost more now than a year ago.\n\nA growing number of Americans believe Trump is contributing to the nation’s affordability problem, polls show. That sentiment may have driven Democrats to big wins at the polls in early November.\n\nTariff dividend checks could help Trump address that issue.\n\n\"The president is sort of creating a problem and then trying to fix his own problem,\" said Durante of the Tax Foundation.\n\nThe think tank’s Nov. 18 post suggests a simple alternative to dividend checks.\n\n\"A better way to provide relief from the burden of tariffs,\" researchers wrote, \"would be to eliminate the tariffs.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/11/16/trump-tariff-checks-doge-rebate-lie/87255006007/", "title": "Trump's $2000 tariff checks aren't coming. It's another lie | Opinion", "text": "I've got some bad news for you today that will probably be as unsurprising as it is disappointing: Your check from Donald Trump is not in the mail.\n\nThe president has spent much of the first year of his second term promising to send Americans \"dividend\" checks, but nothing ever comes of it. And that's because Trump sees the unrealized promise of cash as an effective way to distract Americans from issues he is not resolving and problems he is causing.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Trump is the majority owner of his own social media website, Truth Social, which has its own artificial intelligence chatbot at the ready to answer your questions.\n\nSo I asked it: \"Does Donald Trump have a history of promising dividend checks but then not sending them?\"\n\nTrump's own chatbot knows he's not sending Americans checks\n\nHere's the answer Truth Social AI gave me: \"Yes. Trump has repeatedly floated 'dividend' or rebate-style checks to Americans but has not delivered such payments to the public to date.\"\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nThe chatbot then summarized Trump's history in 2025 of dangling checks and then leaving Americans dangling, from his false claims that we were getting a $5,000 dividend from alleged savings found by DOGE, also known as the Department of Government Efficiency, to his Nov. 9 suggestion that we'd get \"a dividend of at least $2,000 a person\" fueled by his disastrous trade-war tariffs.\n\nTrump made that claim last week in an early morning Truth Social post. Here's what his Truth Social chatbot concluded a few days later: \"In short, he has a history of promising or endorsing the idea of dividend/rebate checks (tariff dividend and DOGE rebate) without following through with actual distributions so far.\"\n\nTrump, asked about the $2,000 checks on Air Force One on Nov. 14, said there was no chance Americans would see them this year but might receive them next year. He was squirrely on the timeline, a real tell for when he's trying to distract.\n\n\"It's a lot of money, but we've taken in a lot of money from tariffs,\" Trump said. \"The tariffs allow us to give a dividend, if we want to do that.\"\n\nWriting about Trump requires a close listen on every word he says while making promises. He always leaves himself an out. And \"if we want to do that\" is his exit strategy here.\n\nAmericans should always ask themselves: What is really going on when Trump is obviously trying to distract us with some shiny object, like the shaky offer of a government check?\n\nTrump's post came at the start of a new week that followed a week where his Republican Party was trounced in general election races around the country, he was taking heat for not following through on campaign promises to rejuvenate the economy, the conservative-controlled U.S. Supreme Court seemed unimpressed with his legal arguments for launching trade wars with tariffs, and he was again proposing to blow up the system that provides millions of Americans with health care, while not offering a replacement to that system.\n\n\"Hey! Who wants free money?\" Trump was shouting as his approval rating sank to new lows.\n\nTrump doesn't care if his promises make no economic sense. His tariff dividend, which he said would be at least $2,000 but would exclude high-income people, would cost about $600 billion per year. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit that educates the public about fiscal policy, calculated that Trump's tariffs may raise about $300 billion a year.\n\nI'm no mathematician, but promising Americans a \"dividend\" that would cost the country more than double the profits of Trump's tariffs seems like unsound economic policy.\n\nIs it any wonder Trump repeatedly filed for bankruptcy protection when he was a casino operator? His entire career, in business and in politics, has been driven by self-serving and dishonest distraction tactics.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Truth Social launched its chatbot back in August. So I asked it that month if Trump has a history of lying. Here's what it told me: \"Yes. Major fact-checkers, courts, and official investigations have documented numerous false claims by Donald Trump over many years.\"\n\nI double-checked last week. Trump's chatbot still gives a similar answer, adding that he has made \"false and misleading claims … across topics including immigration, elections, the economy, and Jan. 6.\"\n\nTrump's DOGE cuts and tariff antics aren't funding anything\n\nDon't expect Trump to give up his distraction tactics just because his promises never come true and his lies are easily debunked, even by his own chatbot.\n\nRemember, Trump empowered DOGE to slash away at the federal government, prompting claims of more than $214 billion in savings. But plenty of reporting debunked that number, showing that the DOGE cuts saved only a fraction of that amount.\n\nThat didn't stop Trump from touting DOGE to his supporters. In a truly Trumpian way, he asked them in emails if they wanted a DOGE dividend check while asking them to send money to his campaign account.\n\nI dug through the emails from his campaign account, known as Trump National Committee JFC, which reported having $12.2 million in the bank as of June 30. I found 22 fundraising emails from Trump from March 9 to May 30, asking, \"Would you accept a DOGE dividend check signed by Trump?\"\n\nTrump's fundraising emails in August shifted to suggestions of \"tariff bonus\" checks, while still pleading for donations.\n\nAgain, the check is not in the mail.\n\nTrump might suggest that he'll send you money. But he really wants you to send him money. And, more important to him than that, he wants you to be distracted as he flounders, failing to bring down the cost of groceries or to improve our health care system, or to win the trade wars he started.\n\nTrump will claim he is winning as his losses pile up. Try cashing that at the bank, along with that check that never came. And the next time he promises to send you money, look around to see what he's trying to distract you from.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Ask his chatbot.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Chris Brennan on X, formerly known as Twitter: @ByChrisBrennan.

He said everyone but high-income earners will get the payout.\n\nBessent said during a Fox News interview on Sunday, Nov. 16 that checks \"could go out\" to help \"working families.\" He also clarified that the U.S. Congress would need to pass legislation to release the funds and determine how and when people could get the money.\n\nEarlier in the year, Trump said his administration was considering a rebate plan but preferred to focus on reducing the national debt. The president also said that taxpayers might get a cut of savings from the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nSome estimates show the rebates could cost up to twice what the U.S. brings in in tariffs in one year.\n\nThe tariffs generated about $100 billion in revenue by the end of October, but a new analysis from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the rebate as proposed could cost up to $600 billion.\n\nAlso, the funds are pending a Supreme Court decision. Justices heard arguments about whether or not the tariffs are constitutional on Nov. 5. If they determine they're illegal, the government could have to refund billions of dollars to U.S.-based businesses and citizens who paid them.\n\nHere's what we know about the proposed tariff rebates so far. Will Americans get a $2,000 check? When? Will you meet the income requirements in Mississippi? What happened to DOGE checks?\n\nTrump tariff rebate proposal so far\n\n\"People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k’s are Highest EVER. We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place. A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" he posted Nov. 9.\n\nThe most recent report from the Labor Department shows inflation is on the rise.\n\nStock markets have seen highs in 2025. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq set records in June. The S&P 500 has been high in November. The markets also trended upward after the government shutdown ended.\n\nBessent said later in the day on Nov. 9 that he hadn't spoken with Trump about the proposal as part of an interview with George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week\", according to ABC News reporting.\n\n\"We're going to issue a dividend to our middle-income people and lower-income people ‒ about $2,000,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Monday, Nov. 10.\n\n\"And we’ll use the remaining tariffs to lower our debt,\" he added. \"We’re going to be lowering our debt, which is a national security thing.\"\n\nDays later, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"The White House is committed to making that happen, yes, and we are currently exploring all legal options to get that done.\"\n\nWill tariff checks be paid? What has to happen?\n\nBessent told Stephanopoulos that the funds could be issued in different formats than a check at first.\n\n\"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda -- you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans,\" he said.\n\nOn Sunday, Nov. 16, Bessent shared new information while talking to Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\".\n\n\"Everything is on the table,\" he said, noting that larger income tax returns based on Trump administration policy changes are expected to be sent in the first quarter of 2026. He also cited a $1,000 stock market account for each child born starting in 2026 that families can apply for in July.\n\nBessent said the suggested checks would have an income limit for eligibility.\n\nBartiromo asked about the backup plan if the Supreme Court rules against the tariffs.\n\nHe said the Supreme Court is unlikely to rule against the current plan because it's one of Trump's signature policies. The Treasury secretary also called it an emergency authority and said several peace deals rely on the tariffs. Bessent said the challenge to issue the refunds could be another determining factor.\n\nWill I get a $2,000 tariff check? Who is eligible?\n\nThe president hasn't yet said what constitutes high income, and eligibility requirements haven't been set.\n\nCalculations from the Committee for a Responsible Government assumed the payments would be structured like COVID-19-era Economic Impact Payments.\n\nIn Trump's first term, the 2020 CARES Act arranged for payments for adults with smaller disbursements for kids. To be eligible for the maximum amount, individual taxpayers could earn up to $75,000. It was $150,000 for joint income tax filers.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 18% of Mississippi residents live in poverty. The median household income in the state is $54,915, and average income per person is $30,529.\n\n$2,000 tariff checks could cost US twice what tariffs bring in\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Government cautions that $2,000 dividends sent based on CARES Act eligibility requirements could cost about $600 billion. The Trump administration reportedly says the tariffs could generate up to $300 billion per year.\n\nThe group questions whether the plan is to pay the dividend once or every year, and they argue it would prevent funds from being used to pay down the national deficit or offset other spending needs.\n\nFor comparison, the Tax Foundation analyzed economic stimulus payments sent out during COVID. Maximum amounts each person could get are listed.\n\nThe CARES Act funding sent in March 2020 gave $1,200 to adults and $500 per qualifying dependent. The estimated total cost was $292 billion.\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act issued the second round in December 2020. Adults and kids got $600. The estimated cost was $164 billion.\n\nIn March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act led to the final round of stimulus funds being sent in March 2021. Adults and kids got $1,400. The total cost was $411 billion.\n\nCan the president order that money be sent to all Americans?\n\nOnly the U.S. Congress can approve spending like reimbursement checks. So far, the $2,000 tariff checks have not been proposed in official legislation.\n\nA similar bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate over the summer.\n\nMissouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley proposed the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025 in late July. If passed, it would give $600 tariff rebates to many Americans and their children, or $2,400 for a family of four, according to The Hill. The bill was referred to the finance committee, but there have been no additional updates.\n\nWhen could I get the tariff check money?\n\nCongress would have to approve the spending and determine if a check will be issued before Americans see a penny.\n\nThere is no current timeline on when or if Congress might address the issue.\n\nWhat happened to DOGE checks?\n\nEarlier this year, Azoria investment firm CEO James Fishback pitched the concept of a DOGE reimbursement check going out to taxpayers on Elon Musk's social media platform X.\n\nFishback shared a four-page \"DOGE dividend\" proposal, saying it should be paid only to households that pay taxes and earn above a specific income level. He said the plan was developed in about two and half hours before being sent to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and other members of the Trump administration.\n\nThe Pew Research Center estimates that most citizens with an adjusted gross income of less than $30,000 effectively pay no federal income tax. Refundable credits mostly benefit those who have lower incomes.\n\nAt the time, the richest man in the world was leading DOGE, promising large-scale government cuts that would save tens of billions. Fact checks, however, showed vastly overstated totals, and some court decisions have since reversed promised DOGE cuts.\n\nThe rebate check proposal relied on DOGE hitting an estimated $2 trillion savings goal before checks would be considered.\n\nAs of Monday, Nov. 17, the DOGE Wall of Receipts claims $214 billion in savings, or about $1,329 per taxpayer.\n\nTo date, DOGE is still approximately $1.786 trillion short of its initial savings goal, and Congress has not addressed the issue.\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers, Bebe Hodges, Diana Leyva, Jordan Green, Gabe Huari, Mike Snider\n\nBonnie Bolden is the Deep South Connect reporter for Mississippi with Gannett/USA Today.

What economists say", "text": "Could President Trump issue DOGE stimulus checks? The idea of $5,000 refunds from the ongoing drive to reduce federal spending has been floated.\n\nBut don't add that bonus to your account just yet. That's because DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, ideally must meet its $2 trillion savings goal to make the kickback feasible. And that accomplishment is something even Elon Musk, the unofficial leader of DOGE, said may not be doable back in January.\n\nStill, President Trump has said the administration is considering giving 20% of \"DOGE savings\" to citizens. His comments came a day after Musk said he would confer with Trump about the idea.\n\nEven if the idea of $5,000 stimulus checks evolves, Congress would need to approve a dispersal of funds to taxpayers. Here's what we know so far.\n\nWhat do economists say about $5,000 stimulus checks?\n\nMost who have spoken out so far don't think a DOGE dividend would be a good idea.\n\n\"It would increase the deficit, it would increase immediate consumer spending, and that would have inflationary consequences which is something we don't want right now,” Judge Glock, director of research at the Manhattan Institute, told Scripps News.\n\nThe money would be better off spent going to offset the $1 trillion annual budget deficit and to offset taxes, Glock said.\n\nAnother problem with stimulus checks: inflation. If DOGE starts \"mailing out large checks to large numbers of people, wow, that's going to put a big boost to inflation because Trump's putting out tariffs and tariff means more expensive goods and services,\" Jay Zagorsky, a professor at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, told CBS News.\n\nBut Kevin Hassett, Trump's director of the National Economic Council, said Thursday during a press briefing that the checks wouldn't be inflationary because the government had already planned to spend the money.\n\n\"If we don't spend government money and we give it back to the people, if they spend it all, then you're even,\" he said, according to financial news site Investopedia. \"But they're probably going to save a lot of it, in which case you're reducing inflation.\"\n\nThe issue may be moot because DOGE is unlikely to be able to reach its goal of $2 trillion in savings, Zagorsky said. \"I'm just not sure the savings are there,\" he said.\n\nLast week, Musk said DOGE had already saved taxpayers $55 billion, but an error – listing the cancellation of an $8 million contract as being an $8 billion savings – suggested it had actually totaled savings of about $16.5 billion.\n\nDOGE won't achieve enough savings to issue checks \"big enough\" to create inflation, Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, told The Associated Press. She called the idea of a DOGE dividend “ridiculous.”\n\n“There’s no money there, and certainly not enough money to make a big contribution to taxpayers,” said Kamarck, who worked with Vice President Al Gore to cut government waste in the Clinton administration. “The guy just says things,” she added, referring to Musk.\n\nRead more on this story here.\n\nContributing: Fernando Cervantes Jr., Greta Cross, Joey Garrison, Jessica Guynn, Nick Penzenstadler and James Powel.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Threads, Bluesky and X:mikegsnider & @mikegsnider.bsky.social & @mikesnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Yet, economists have said the policies could increase inflation and cost taxpayers thousands of dollars per year, especially if Trump doesn’t reach trade deals with key partners like Canada and Mexico.\n\nFor joint filers with an adjusted gross income of over $150,000 and people filing single who earn more than $75,000, the benefit would be reduced by 5%.\n\nThe legislation has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee. It would need to pass both the Senate and the House of Representatives to become law.\n\nWhat are some of the hurdles facing the rebate?\n\nRepublican lawmakers are unlikely to be excited about increasing federal spending. The stimulus checks issued during the COVID-19 pandemic cost the government about $164 billion. If checks were issued, it would mean a significant percentage of tariff revenue would be going back to taxpayers at a time when Trump himself has said his priority is paying down $37 trillion in debt.\n\n\"The big thing we want to do is pay down debt,” Trump said in July. “But we’re thinking about rebates.”\n\nIn an interview with Semafor, one conservative lawmaker shot down the idea.\n\n\"People love spending money and granting new tax cuts when we can't afford it,\" Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, told the outlet. “We’re $37 trillion in debt and running $2 trillion a year deficits – some time, this madness just has to end.”\n\nHow is a tax rebate different from a stimulus check?\n\nA tax rebate is a reimbursement made to a taxpayer for an excess amount paid in taxes during the year, while a stimulus check is a direct payment from the federal government to households.\n\nTax rebates can be issued at any point during the year. Hawley’s news release states that the parameters for the tax rebate would be similar to the stimulus checks issued in 2020 during the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic.\n\nWhen could a tax rebate be implemented?\n\nHawley's bill has until the end of the current congressional calendar to pass through both chambers of Congress, or it will be considered dead and would need to be introduced again if lawmakers want to move forward with it.\n\nMichelle Del Rey is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

But the big thing we want to do is pay down debt. But we're thinking about a rebate,” Trump said during the July press conference. “We're thinking about a rebate because we have so much money coming in from tariffs that a little rebate for people of a certain income level might be very nice.\"\n\nA few days after the president's tariff rebate comments, Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley announced the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025, aimed at sending checks to Americans.\n\nHere's what to know about a possible stimulus or rebate check for Florida's over 23 million residents, how much and who would qualify.\n\nBut first, what is a rebate? Stimulus check?\n\nAccording to the Legal Information Institute, a rebate is a partial refund of a payment or a deduction from an amount already paid. It can also refer to a government subsidy to assist with rent payments.\n\nFor example, the 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit was given to those who didn’t claim their stimulus payments during the pandemic.\n\nAs for stimulus checks, they are money sent to taxpayers by the federal government, usually in an attempt to stimulate the economy by providing people with some spending money.\n\nWhat is the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025?\n\nSen. Josh Hawley's bill, called the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025, would provide a minimum of $600 per adult and dependent child, or $2,400 for a family of four, according to news officials.\n\n“Americans deserve a tax rebate after four years of Biden policies that have devastated families’ savings and livelihoods. Like President Trump proposed, my legislation would allow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump’s tariffs are returning to this country,” Senator Hawley said in a press release.\n\nThe bill would allow for a larger rebate if the tariff revenue exceeds projections. See PDF of Hawley's bill here.\n\nWho gets the stimulus check in 2025?\n\nEveryone would get the checks; however, some will see larger amounts than others.\n\nAccording to USA TODAY, the benefit would be reduced by 5% for joint filers with an adjusted gross income above $150,000 or single filers earning more than $75,000 individually.\n\nThat means Florida residents could see varying benefit levels, with the state’s relatively high-income earners receiving reduced rebates while others — particularly lower and middle-income households — would get the full amount.\n\nAccording to an analysis from The Budget Lab at Yale released July 28, Trump's tariffs could cost U.S. households an average of $2,400 in 2025 through higher prices passed on from companies paying higher tariff taxes.\n\nAre we getting a stimulus check or a Trump tariff rebate in 2025?\n\nTrump floated the idea of using part of the government revenue being generated by the new tariffs and returning it to taxpayers of a certain income level in the form of a rebate check.\n\nHawley’s press release said that the rebates would follow “similar parameters” to the stimulus checks sent during the pandemic.\n\nHawley’s bill, and likely any rebate to taxpayers, requires approval by Congress, which governs taxation and spending. But the House and Senate are controlled by Republicans aligned with Trump.\n\nAre DOGE dividend checks still possible?\n\nIt's unlikely.\n\nIn February, Trump said he would consider the plan to pay out $5,000 stimulus checks to taxpayers in the form of a “DOGE dividend” during a summit in Miami. He explained it as using part of the 20% of the savings identified by former government employee Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and giving it back to taxpayers.\n\nHowever, he has not shared any further specifics or details about the possible “DOGE dividend” or its certainty since then.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/29/trump-tariffs-what-to-know-liberation-day/82689214007/", "title": "What to know as Trump's sweeping reciprocal tariffs arrives", "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump's long-promised plan to shake up the economy arrives Wednesday as he prepares to unleash his most significant round of tariffs yet. He already has slapped duties on imports that have roiled markets and ignited a global trade war.\n\nTwo months into his White House return, Trump has imposed tariffs on goods from neighboring Canada and Mexico as well as China, all steel and aluminum imports, and foreign cars and auto parts. He's threatened several other countries including traditional allies in the European Union with other steep tariffs ‒ even on European wine.\n\nYet Trump has circled April 2 as the true culmination of his \"American first\" trade policy as he seeks to boost domestic manufacturing by making it more expensive for companies to ship products into the U.S.\n\nThat's when Trump is set to announce his reciprocal tariffs, which is expected to target all nations with a focus especially on the largest contributors to the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit. Duty collections from the tariffs will begin Thursday.\n\nHere's what to know ahead of what Trump has called \"the big one.\"\n\nWhat are reciprocal tariffs?\n\nTrump has said his administration's suite of reciprocal tariffs will apply to nations that charge fees on U.S. exports, promising to match those countries' duties with tariffs of the same rate.\n\nOn Feb. 13, Trump signed a memorandum that directed U.S. trade officials to go country by country and put together a slate of tailored counter measures.\n\nWhy is Trump pushing reciprocal tariffs?\n\nTrump has said the reciprocal tariffs will offset trade practices of other nations that his administration deems unfair, while encouraging companies to make products in the U.S. to avoiding having to pay the new fees.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. imported $1.2 trillion more in goods than than it exported, a record trade deficit that Trump is aiming to shrink with his action.\n\nTrump has complained the U.S. has allowed other nations to levy tariffs on U.S. exports without any consequences.\n\nWhat is the 'Dirty 15?'\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said the Trump administration beginning April 2 will apply a reciprocal tariff number to each country based on what they charge on U.S. exports.\n\nHe said the countries most impacted will be the 15% of nations that contribute most significantly to the U.S. trade deficit and impose the largest tariffs.\n\n\"There's what we would call the 'Dirty 15,'\" Bessent said on Fox Business, adding they have substantial tariffs and other unfair trade barriers. \"It's 15% of the countries, but it's a huge amount of our trading volume.\"\n\nThe White House has not released a list of the \"Dirty 15\" countries. But the countries with the largest trade deficits with the U.S. are China, the EU, Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Canada, India, Thailand, Switzerland, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and South Africa, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIs Trump narrowing the tariffs?\n\nBessent's remarks suggests the Trump administration could be narrowing the scope of the reciprocal tariffs from what Trump originally proposed.\n\nAnd although Trump this week imposed tariffs on the auto industry, his administration is likely to exclude other sector-specific tariffs that Trump has previously discussed, according to recent reports from Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThis includes 25% tariffs on all semiconductor, microchips and pharmaceutical imports that Trump has said he intends to impose but has yet to carry out.\n\nAsked on Friday if he expected to put any exemptions in place for life-saving medicines, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while flying to South Florida, \"Well, we'll be announcing it soon. But we have to bring pharmaceuticals, drugs and pharmaceuticals, back into our country.\"\n\nThe uncertainty continues a whiplash pattern when it comes to Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs, which he’s frequently threatened, only to quickly pull back, in multiple instances.\n\nWhy is Trump suddenly changing his tone?\n\nAmid growing economic anxieties at home and abroad, Trump this week downplayed the scale of the tariff rates in store for other nations ‒ a noticeable change in his tone after building the tariffs up for weeks.\n\n\"We’re going to make it very lenient,\" Trump reporters Wednesday in the Oval Office after signing the new auto tariffs. \"I think people are going to be very surprised. It’ll be, in many cases, less than the tariff that they’ve been charging us for decades.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed that sentiment Thursday, telling reporters, “He thinks that some of these numbers would be more conservative than many people are expecting.”\n\nCould the tariffs push the US into a recession?\n\nEconomists worry large-scale reciprocal tariffs could further hurt a weakening economy and lead to higher prices for consumers. Tariffs are taxes on imports that companies typically pass down to customers.\n\nMark Zandi, Moody's chief economist, told USA TODAY that broad-based reciprocal tariffs left in place for several months would create \"the fire for a recession.\"\n\nHe pointed to several consequences of the new levies: higher costs for low- and middle-income earners, a new tariff tax for U.S. businesses, retaliatory tariffs from other nations, and stock market struggles that would wipe out significant wealth of high-income earners critical to consumer spending.\n\n\"If I'm right, as that becomes evident, I do think it's likely there will be a pivot and backtrack on the tariffs and a declaration of victory,\" Zandi said. \"So I don't know that we'll ultimately ever get to a recession, but we're going to get awfully darn close.\"\n\nAt the same time, Zandi said it's hard to speculate too much given the uncertainty from Trump's on-and-off again record with tariffs.\n\nHow is Wall Street reacting to a tariff plan that Trump calls 'Liberation Day'?\n\nAhead of what Trump is calling \"Liberation Day,\" the stock market plummeted Friday as investors sold off in response to Trump's trade policy and concerns about inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 700 points, or about 1.7%., its largest drop since March 10. The S&P 500 was down more than 100 points.\n\nStock market gains that followed Trump's November election victory have been wiped out as Trump executes his trade policy.\n\nFriday's selloffs came after news that inflation in February was 2.5% higher than a year ago, according to the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, The Fed's preferred inflation measure. While that was in line with economists' forecasts, the important so-called core PCE, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, rose 2.8%, more than expectations for 2.7%.\n\nHow will other countries respond to the tariffs?\n\nTrump's reciprocal tariffs are likely to escalate a global trade war that is already building even before the announcement.\n\nCanada and China hit back at Trump's recently imposed tariffs with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, while the European Union has threatened to do the same next month.\n\nAnd Canadian Prime Minister Mike Carney responded to Trump's 25% tariffs on automobiles this week by saying the U.S. is \"no longer a reliable partner\" and vowing his nation will seek to do more business with other countries.\n\nAutomobiles that fall under the umbrella of imports protected in the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement ‒ a trade deal orchestrated by Trump in his first term ‒ won’t be subject to the full tariff rate. Instead, the U.S will only levy tariffs on the foreign parts that make up vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico.\n\nDespite those carve-outs, Carney said Canada will announce new retaliatory tariffs next week, saying, “Nothing is off the table as we defend our workers and our country.\"\n\nLeaders of Germany and France have also urged the EU to respond with retaliatory tariffs.\n\nWhat will Trump do if countries retaliate?\n\nTrump said Friday the U.S. will \"absolutely\" respond to any additional tariffs from Canada with more retaliatory tarrifs.\n\n\"Many countries have taken advantage of us ‒ the likes of which nobody even thought was possible, for many, many decades,\" Trump said. \"That has to stop.\"\n\nStill, Trump said he had a \"very good\" phone call with Carney Friday.\n\nTrump also told reporters many leaders of other nations agree with his argument on tariffs. \"Many of them actually apologize. They said, 'Look, we have taken advantage (of the United States).'\"\n\nTrump did not identify the names of these leaders.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/29"}]}

Herb Jones, forward\n\nHailing from just south of Tuscaloosa in Moundville, the Hale County alumni was key to the transition into playing Nate Oats' style of blue-collar basketball. Jones finished his four years at UA with 947 points, 630 rebounds, 285 assists, 167 steals and 98 blocks. Jones was an SEC Player of the Year and SEC Defensive Player of the Year in his final year before being drafted by the Pelicans in the second round of the 2021 NBA Draft.\n\n9. Collin Sexton, point guard\n\nThe No. 1 all-time recruit in program history, Sexton was recruited to Alabama in 2017 as the country's top point guard. He made a mark in his one-and done season, shooting 44.7% to average 19.2 points along with 3.8 rebounds and 3.6 assists. Sexton went eighth in the 2018 NBA Draft and played for the Cleveland Cavaliers until he was traded to Utah in 2022.\n\n8. Ennis Whatley, point guard\n\nBefore the Birmingham native played 10 seasons in the NBA, he forged two NCAA Tournament appearances at Alabama. Whatley shot 49.8% in college and set the program record for single-season assists with 220 in 1983. The passing wizard's career-average 6.3 assists per game are still a school record, too.\n\n7. Antonio McDyess, center\n\nMcDyess was heralded as the best big man in the SEC during his two seasons at Alabama. He averaged 13.6 points and 10 rebounds per game as a sophomore before going as the second overall pick of the 1995 NBA Draft. The 6-foot-9, 240 pounder saw the Crimson Tide to back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances.\n\n6. Derrick McKey, forward\n\nThe 15-year NBA veteran came to the league after earning SEC Player of the Year honors as a senior in 1987 and was part of three Sweet 16 runs. He averaged 6.5 career rebounds and 1.89 career blocks per game while clearing 58% of shots from the field.\n\n5. Leon Douglas, center\n\nDouglas was a three-time All-SEC selection and the program's first-ever consensus All-American in 1975. In four seasons with the Crimson Tide, the 6-10 big averaged 17.2 points, 11.5 rebounds and 2.8 blocks per game. The Detroit Pistons took him fourth overall in 1976.\n\n4. Mark Sears, point guard\n\nSears' story is unfinished, but he's the face of a new age of UA hoops. The Muscle Shoals native powered the program's first-ever Final Four run and entered 2024-25 as a preseason top pick to finish as national player of the year. Last season, Sears scored 20-plus points in 26 games, breaking a record previously held by Reggie King to become the program's third consensus All-American.\n\n3. Robert Horry, forward\n\nHorry did the dirty work when it counted from UA to the NBA, coming up with clutch shots to earn the name \"Big Shot Bob.\" The Andalusia High alum's 1988-92 Alabama stint was highlighted by three SEC Tournament championships and two Sweet 16 runs before he went 11th overall in the 1992 NBA Draft to the Houston Rockets.\n\n2. Brandon Miller, forward\n\nIn 2023, Miller became the first SEC player to win the league's player of the year, freshman of the year and tournament MVP in the same season. Miller arrived for his single year at UA as the No. 3 small forward of the 2022 recruiting class. He averaged 23 points and 10.1 rebounds per game, filling out the rest of his stat line with averages of 2.5 assists, 1.1 steals and 1.1 blocks.\n\n1. Reggie King, forward\n\nKing still holds the record as Alabama's all-time top scorer with 2,168 points in four seasons, leaving for the NBA as an SEC great after leading Alabama to its first Sweet 16 in 1976. His point total and 1,279 rebounds rank eighth and third in league history, respectively, in stats dating back to 1950. He went 18th to the Kansas City Kings in the 1979 NBA Draft.\n\nEmilee Smarr covers Alabama basketball and Crimson Tide athletics for the Tuscaloosa News.

It was 1969.\n\nWe know LeBron James is about to pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the NBA’s all-time scoring list.\n\nBut who did Abdul-Jabbar pass? And when?\n\nAnd what about the league’s all-time leading scorers before that?\n\nJust six players have held the NBA’s scoring title, with Abdul-Jabbar atop the list the longest – it's been almost 40 years since he passed Wilt Chamberlain in 1984.\n\nJames will become the seventh when he jumps Abdul-Jabbar sometime soon. At James’ scoring rate, he will score more than 40,000 points, and it may take another 40-some years before a player eclipses James.\n\nLet’s take a look at who has been atop the NBA’s all-time scoring list:\n\nJoe Fulks, 8,003 points\n\nFulks, who spent his eight-year career with the Philadelphia Warriors, won the scoring title (23.2 points per game) in the league’s first season in 1946-47 and led the league in scoring (22.1 points) the following season. Known for helping introduce the jump shot to the game, Fulks averaged a career-high 26 points in 1948-49 and retired after the 1953-54 season. Fulks attended what is now Murray State where his jersey is retired. Fulks set a then-NBA record with 61 points in 1949 and that remained the best single-game scoring effort until Elgin Baylor had 64 in 1959. Fulks, whose post-basketball career was the director of recreation at a state penitentiary, was killed in 1976 by his girlfriend’s son during a drunken argument over a handgun. He was 54. Fulks was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978.\n\nCOUNTDOWN: How close is LeBron to setting the NBA all-time scoring mark?\n\nCAN YOU SURVIVE? New pro and college basketball survivor pools are here. Free to play; terms and conditions apply. Join now!\n\nGeorge Mikan, 10,156 points\n\nMikan entered the league in the 1948-49 season from DePaul and was a scorer from the start, putting up at least 30 points in five of his first 10 games. Like Fulks, he didn’t play long, just six-plus seasons, but Mikan averaged 23.1 points (and 13.4 rebounds). He was a six-time All-NBA selection, won the scoring title three times and won five NBA titles. Another dominant big man, the 6-10 Mikan was a masterful scorer at the basket, having perfected layups with his Mikan Drill – practicing right-handed and left-handed layups over and over. Mikan passed Fulks in the 1952-53 season. Mikan, who was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, helped change the game in multiple ways, including widening the lane and banning goaltending. As commissioner of the ABA, Mikan championed the 3-point line.\n\nDolph Schayes, 18,438 points\n\nIn 1958, during the third quarter of the Syracuse Nationals’ blowout victory against the Detroit Pistons, Schayes became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer. A columnist for the Syracuse Post-Standard wrote, “with the record beckoning and his mates feeding him to help him set the mark, Schayes consistently passed off to better-positioned opponents rather than risk poor shots.” Schayes played 15 seasons, averaging 18.5 points for his career, including a career-high 24.9 in 1957-58. Schayes mastered getting to the foul line (7.9 attempts per game) and making free throws (84.9%). Schayes also played in 91% of his team’s games. He was a 12-time All-Star and 12-time All-NBA performer, entering the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1973.\n\nBob Pettit, 20,880 points\n\nA couple of things about Pettit: 1) He was one of the first players to understand the value of weight training and dismissed those who thought putting on muscle would ruin his shot; 2) When Pettit, playing for the St. Louis Hawks, passed Schayes as the NBA’s all-time leading scorer in 1964, the game was stopped and Cardinals great Stan Musial presented him with the game ball, according to a United Press International story. In the era where big men dominated, Pettit averaged 26.4 points, including a career-high 31.1 (and 18.7 rebounds) in 1961-62. He led the league in scoring twice, was an All-Star in each of his 11 seasons and was named MVP twice. He entered the Hall of Fame in 1971.\n\nWilt Chamberlain, 31,419 points\n\nPettit did not own the record for long. With Chamberlain entering the league in 1959 and unstoppable as a scorer at 7-1, he took over as the all-time scoring leader on Feb. 14, 1966. Chamberlain scored 41 points against Detroit that day and held the record for 18 years. Chamberlain is remembered for his individual scoring feats, including the 100-point game that is one of the most unbreakable records in sports. Chamberlain had 113 games with at least 50 points (next closest is Michael Jordan at 31), including 45 such games in 1961-62, the season Chamberlain averaged 50.4 points. He led the league in scoring seven times, won two titles, earned All-NBA honors 10 times, was named MVP four times and became a Hall of Famer in 1979.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar, 38,387 points\n\nAbdul-Jabbar laced ’em up year after year, for 20 seasons, torching opponents with his low-post game, including his famous sky hook. Coming from UCLA to the NBA in 1969, Abdul-Jabbar was a winner and ready to dominate. He averaged 28.8 points his rookie season, 31.7 the next and 34.8 the next and 30.2 in his fourth season. For 17 consecutive seasons, he averaged at least 22 points, most often in that 24-27 range. He shot 55.9% from the field and was a reliable 72.1% shooter from the foul line. No player has more MVPs than Abdul-Jabbar’s six. He was a 19-time All-Star, 15-time All-NBA selection, won six championships and was Finals MVP twice, joining other greats in the Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nFollow NBA reporter Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state/spartans/2025/01/30/tom-izzo-michigan-state-basketball-big-ten-record-bob-knight-magic-johnson-usc-trojans-ucla-bruins/78034770007/", "title": "Tom Izzo can break Bob Knight's Big Ten wins record in Los Angeles", "text": "EAST LANSING — Happy birthday, Tom Izzo. A present awaits you in Los Angeles.\n\nBut you have to earn it. Just the way you’d appreciate.\n\nIf No. 7 Michigan State basketball beats USC on Saturday, the Hall of Fame coach who turns 70 on Thursday will tie the Big Ten mark for the most conference victories by a coach. And if the Spartans can pull off a pair of wins, facing UCLA on Tuesday night, Izzo will pass Bob Knight’s record of 353 victories.\n\nLegendary company and a legendary accomplishment. And Izzo’s players have been buzzing about it.\n\n“These last two or three games, we were aware of the record for coach and making an emphasis on these games, specifically, for coach,” junior Jaxon Kohler said after Tuesday’s 73-51 win over Minnesota. “For everything he's done for us, we want to repay him back by getting him those wins as soon as possible.\n\n“He's a great coach and a great person.”\n\nThe timeline toward another milestone moment for Izzo has accelerated with everything happening for the Spartans. They are 18-2 overall and riding a 13-game win streak, sitting at 9-0 in Big Ten play.\n\nAll of those are superlatives that Izzo’s program last achieved during the 2018-19 season en route to his eighth and most recent Final Four appearance, the fifth-most by a Division I coach. MSU swept its December and January games for the first time in his 30-year career with the win over the Gophers, which equaled the best start in program history set by Izzo’s 2019 and 2010 eventual Big Ten championship squads.\n\n“It is sitting right there,” Izzo said on his weekly radio show Wednesday night on catching Knight, “but there's some obstacles in the way.”\n\nA victory Saturday against the Trojans (12-8, 4-5) would equal the Spartans’ 14-game win streak from the 2017-18 season, which also featured a 13-game win streak. MSU last won 15 straight in 2011-12, Draymond Green’s senior season, while Izzo’s longest single-season win streak was 22 in a row in 1998-99 en route to his first Final Four appearance.\n\n“That's our goal anyway,” senior Jaden Akins said Tuesday. “We know coach has that record in sight, but our goal is to keep winning anyway. So us doing that, it's gonna take care of that (record).”\n\nOn a video conference call with reporters Wednesday, NBA and MSU legend Magic Johnson gushed over what he has seen both from this year’s Spartans and a reinvigorated Izzo, whose 725 all-time wins are the most by a coach at a Big Ten school (Knight had 659 at Indiana).\n\n“He loves Michigan State, he loves Lansing. He loves what he's doing,” Johnson said of Izzo. “He loves developing those young men, not just on the basketball court but also off the court, too. That's why so many come back. Look at his program, right? All them guys come back, because they love him. He's like a father-figure to all those guys.”\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE: Tom Izzo thinks Spartans aren't close to ceiling\n\nIn case you were wondering, the Big Ten has not had a champion go unbeaten in league play since Knight and Indiana in 1975-76 went 32-0 overall, the last perfect national championship season. That was back when the conference had only 10 members, with teams playing each other twice.\n\nIzzo remembers those days well, both from his time as Jud Heathcote’s assistant starting in 1983 and when he took over in the 1995-96 season. Regular-season Big Ten titles — he now owns 10 of them — meant an automatic NCAA tournament berth then, before the postseason league tournament began during Izzo’s third year at the helm. Even though Izzo’s six Big Ten tournament titles are the most by any coach, he continues to put stock in the regular-season titles because of the toughness it takes to weather the winter.\n\nHe’s not even close to crowning his current team as a champion, though — he reiterated he still believes the Big Ten winner at the outset of March could have as many as five losses. Including, possibly, his own team.\n\n“We're making progress,” Izzo said Tuesday night. “I just think the road's gonna get a little rocky here. So hang on.”\n\nJohnson pointed to the way with which Izzo has shown an ability to adapt and adjust, particularly this year by using MSU’s 10-man rotation and constant ball movement. It is a style the maestro of the “Showtime” Lakers called “successful and entertaining.”\n\n“For him to figure out what was best for this team this season is one of the greatest coaching jobs I've seen,” Johnson said. “See, most guys would have stuck to ‘Imma play six guys, let me stick to playing it this way.’ He's changed. He went to the three-guard (lineup). Sometimes, he has four guards and a big man. He's doing a masterful job of understanding what he needs at that time, who's going good, mixing the veterans with the young people.\n\n“And the defense and the rebounding has not changed, right? You know that's his staple — defense, rebound. And wow. But also, they're running fast. I think that he's wearing teams down. So I would say it's been amazing. It's been fun for him too, because this is what he wanted. He wanted one more shot at it.”\n\nIronically, Izzo earned his first Big Ten victory against Knight and Indiana — a 65-60 win at Breslin Center on Jan. 4, 1996. And with one more regular-season championship, he would equal the record of 11 shared by Knight and former Purdue coach Ward “Piggy” Lambert.\n\n“It might have taken 30 years or whatever it is, but you know what? The man's heart is in the right place,” Johnson said. “He's a dynamic coach. He'll go down as one of the greatest coaches that's ever lived. He definitely will have a statue, because we gotta give him a statue.\n\n“I mean, we all live by this team. This team is so great. Think about this: Every Tuesday or every Wednesday or Thursday, my schedule, I'm trying to see what time they're playing. That's how great they are.”\n\nContact Chris Solari:csolari@freepress.com.

The Hawkeyes' success is largely due to the dominant play of star point guard Caitlin Clark. The former five-star recruit has lived up to the hype and then some in her three years on campus, emerging as one of the premier names in all of college sports.\n\nClark's stardom grew again on Sunday night with a 41-point, 10-rebound and 12-assist performance, it's the first 40-point triple double in NCAA Tournament history (man or woman). She scored or assisted on 70 of Iowa's 97 points, which is a tournament record for most points created by a player in one game. Within the course of the Sunday's game, she became the first Division I player in history, man or woman, to record 900 points and 300 assists in a single season. Those are three more statistical accolades in an already lengthy list.\n\nAnd there's another one that's pending, Clark needs just 18 more points to pass Iowa legend Megan Gustafson for the Big Ten record for points in a season (1,001).\n\nShe's a three-time All-Big Ten and All-American selection with three Big Ten championships (two tournament, one regular season) and now a Final Four appearance under her belt. Her popularity has grown through eye-popping statistical performances and long-range shooting highlights. And with at least one more year of eligibility left, it's sure to grow.\n\nAhead of Iowa's Final Four game on Friday (6 p.m. or 8:30 p.m. CT on ESPN.), here are 15 stats that put her dominance in greater focus, ranging from career accomplishments to single-season achievements and more:\n\nSome information provided by the University of Iowa sports information department.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2023/12/18/giannis-and-five-others-who-hold-four-major-nba-franchise-records/71960452007/?utm_source=jsonline-be-mke-strada&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=entertainmentnarrative&utm_term=narrative&utm_content=pmjs-milwaukee-nletter20", "title": "Giannis and five others who hold four major NBA franchise records", "text": "Giannis Antetokounmpo became the Milwaukee Bucks' all-time career rebounder on Sunday in a win over the Houston Rockets, bypassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in that department and adding another notch in his remarkable career.\n\nGiannis, in his 11th NBA season, is now the Bucks' all-time leader in points, rebounds, assists and blocks. He's got quite a ways to go to catch Quinn Buckner in steals, but if he does, he'd be on track to become one of only two players to have all five of the major stat categories conquered. Only Minnesota's Kevin Garnett, who has the top spot by considerable margins in all five categories, has a greater stranglehold on a franchise's leaderboard than Giannis.\n\nThese are the players who share the unique achievement of top spot for a franchise in four of five major stat categories.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nSeasons: 11 (active, totals through Dec. 17, 2023)\n\n11 (active, totals through Dec. 17, 2023) Points: 17,065\n\n17,065 Rebounds : 7,165\n\n: 7,165 Assists: 3,503\n\n3,503 Steals: 852 (fourth, with leader Quinn Buckner at 1,042)\n\n852 (fourth, with leader Quinn Buckner at 1,042) Blocks: 936\n\nGiannis is having a better-than-average season in steals, with 36, after averaging roughly 64 over the past four seasons. By that average, he'd still be almost three full seasons away from the top steals mark, but perhaps a bumper crop this year will help him reach the milestone in closer to two full seasons from right now.\n\nHe's chasing No. 2 Paul Pressey (894) and No. 3 Sidney Moncrief (874) and must also hold off teammate Khris Middleton, who's in fifth (819).\n\nMichael Jordan, Chicago Bulls\n\nSeasons: 13\n\n13 Points: 29,277\n\n29,277 Rebounds: 5,836\n\n5,836 Assists: 5,012\n\n5,012 Steals: 2,306\n\n2,306 Blocks: 828 (second, with leader Artis Gilmore at 1,029)\n\nGilmore's time in Chicago was over when Jordan entered the league, and he's the only player standing in the way of Jordan claiming all five categories during his storied career.\n\nLeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nSeasons: 11\n\n11 Points: 23,119\n\n23,119 Rebounds: 6,190\n\n6,190 Assists: 6,228\n\n6,228 Steals: 1,376\n\n1,376 Blocks: 695 (fourth, with leader Zydrunas Ilgauskas at 1,269)\n\nHot Rod Williams and Larry Nance both rank ahead of James, and Ilgauskas's career began before James arrived, so he was never in position to get the blocks record.\n\nHakeem Olajuwon, Houston Rockets\n\nSeasons: 17\n\n17 Points: 26,511\n\n26,511 Rebounds: 13,382\n\n13,382 Assists: 2,992 (fourth, with leader James Harden at 4,796)\n\n2,992 (fourth, with leader James Harden at 4,796) Steals: 2,088\n\n2,088 Blocks: 3,470\n\nAllen Leavell and Calvin Murphy, whose careers pre-dated Olajuwon's prime, both had more assists in their Rockets career, so Olajuwon never held all five titles.\n\nKevin Garnett, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nSeasons: 14\n\n14 Points: 19,201\n\n19,201 Rebounds: 10,718\n\n10,718 Assists: 4,216\n\n4,216 Steals: 1,315\n\n1,315 Blocks: 1,590\n\nGarnett won a championship with Boston but is truly the greatest player in Timberwolves lore. Karl-Anthony Towns is second place in three categories but is just less than 7,000 points away, more than 4,500 rebounds shy and nearly 900 blocks away.\n\nPatrick Ewing, New York Knicks\n\nSeasons: 15\n\n15 Points: 23,665\n\n23,665 Rebounds: 10,759\n\n10,759 Assists: 2,088 (12th, with leader Walt Frazier at 4,791)\n\n2,088 (12th, with leader Walt Frazier at 4,791) Steals: 1,061\n\n1,061 Blocks: 2,758\n\nAs storied as the Knicks are, Ewing rose to the top of their leaderboards, though he's nowhere close in assists. He's the only player on this list to never win an NBA title.\n\nDoes this mean Kareem Abdul-Jabbar no longer holds any Bucks records?\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar, who didn't have the luxury of a three-point line during his Bucks days — not that he'd have used it; he famously has one career three-point basket — also played four of his six seasons in Milwaukee before steals and blocks were regarded as official stats. He'd almost surely still have the blocks record if he'd been given stats from those seasons.\n\nBut to find him atop a Bucks franchise leaderboard, you'll have to use per-game stats. He remains the franchise leader in points per game (30.4), rebounds per game (15.3), blocks per game (3.4, again, that's over two seasons), and \"win shares\" according to Basketball-Reference, with 114.7 in his career (Giannis is second at 100.3).\n\nIf you wanted to argue that he's the Bucks' best player in franchise history, you'd have a case if you focused on the peak excellence of Abdul-Jabbar's six seasons in town as Giannis closes in on double the number of years as a Buck. Antetokounmpo, of course, didn't enter the league as a finished product, as Abdul-Jabbar did.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/01/14/olympians-hold-longest-nba-game-history/78444702/", "title": "Olympians hold longest NBA game in history", "text": "IndyStar\n\nAn Indianapolis basketball team set a record 65 years ago that still stands today.\n\nThe longest NBA game ever ended Jan. 6, 1951, after six overtime sessions with the Indianapolis Olympians beating the host Rochester Royals at Edgerton Park Arena. (The Royals won the NBA Finals in 1951.)\n\nThe following day, The Indianapolis Star reported, “Ralph Beard sank a breakaway shot with one second left in the sixth overtime period last night to give the Indianapolis Olympians a 75-73 decision over the Rochester Royals in a record shattering National Basketball Association contest before 3,790 fans.”\n\nA history on NBA.com says free throws in the game outnumbered baskets 75 to 34.\n\nRoyals’ player Red Holzman, who played 76 of the game’s 78 minutes, told acclaimed travel writer Harvey Frommer in the late 1980s as he wrote Holzman’s biography that the NBA matchup was one of two in the 1950-51 season to set the stage for the creation of the 24-second shot clock. The shot clock, which survives today, has been heralded as saving the NBA.\n\nAs far as drawn-out games go, the Syracuse Nationals and the Anderson Packers held the previous record, a Nov. 24, 1949, game when host Syracuse took a 125-123 decision in five overtimes at the State Fair Coliseum.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks and the Seattle SuperSonics played the only other NBA game to go into five overtimes, on Nov. 9, 1989, with the Bucks winning 155-154 at the Bradley Center, according to allaboutbasketball­.us and Sports CheatSheet.\n\nHow the Olympians formed\n\nThe Indianapolis Olympians were owned by five former University of Kentucky basketball players. Four of the players — Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, Wallace Jones and Cliff Barker — had led the United States to victory in the 1948 Olympics at London. Joe Holland was the fifth player.\n\nThe National Basketball League, battling to survive against the rival Basketball Association of America, offered the graduating seniors the opportunity to become player-owners if they would join the NBL. After the 1948-49 season, the BAA merged with the NBL to form the NBA.\n\nThe players chose Indianapolis as their home and Butler Fieldhouse as their home court. The Olympians won the Western Division title with a 39-25 record in 1949-50. The Olympians slipped to 31-37 in their second season, and Beard and Groza played in the NBA’s first All-Star Game and were first-team all-league selections. Groza averaged 21.7 points, and Beard averaged 16.8 that season. They drew a capacity crowd of 14,461 to their final game, a second-round playoff loss to the Anderson Packers, with at least 3,000 fans reportedly turned away.\n\nThe fun came crashing down on Oct. 19, 1951, when Alex Groza and Ralph Beard were charged with point-shaving while at Kentucky. Groza and Beard — who admitted to taking money ranging from $300 to $700 but not influencing the outcomes of the games — were banned for life from the NBA.\n\nThe Olympians survived for two years following the scandal, then folded. Indianapolis was without a professional franchise for 14 years until the Indiana Pacers joined the new American Basketball Association in 1967. The Pacers became part of the NBA in its 1976-77 season.\n\nFollow IndyStar visual coordinator Dawn Mitchell on Twitter: @dawn_mitchell61.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2019/05/19/memphis-bicentennial-top-50-sports-figures-history/3661526002/", "title": "Memphis Bicentennial: Top 50 sports figures in Bluff City history", "text": "Sports has given Memphis plenty to be proud of for much of its 200 years.\n\nAs the Bluff City celebrates its bicentennial, The Commercial Appeal put together a list of 50 of the top sports figures in its history. Some will inevitably disagree with one or more inclusions, which is OK — some might even encourage it.\n\nThe basic criteria for the list are that the person was either born in Memphis or made their name here.\n\nPresenting to you the 50 most notable sports figures in Bluff City history (in alphabetical order).\n\nTony Allen: Known as \"The Grindfather,\" as well as a member of the Grizzlies' \"Core Four,\" Allen became a fan favorite and a defining member of the team's \"Grit and Grind\" era, essentially coining the phrase. From 2010 to 2017, Allen scored All-NBA Defensive Team honors six times and was key in each of the four playoff series wins in franchise history. As important as anyone to Memphis and the Grizzlies, Allen once told The Commercial Appeal it was a two-way street. “My heart is here. That big ol' blue face, that Grizzly bear, that’s where my heart is.”\n\nSupport local journalism: 5 benefits of a Commercial Appeal subscription\n\nGene Bartow: Led Memphis State to an 82-32 overall record in four seasons as head coach. The Tigers' most successful campaign on Bartow's watch was the 1972-73 season when Memphis State reached the national championship game — the first of the program's two title game appearances. He was named NABC National Coach of the Year in 1973 and inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009. Bartow went on to coach at Illinois, UCLA (where he succeeded the legendary John Wooden) and UAB, where he later served as athletics director from 1977 to 2000. A personal favorite of legendary Memphis broadcaster, Jack Eaton, who once said: \"... Bartow, he was the master.\"\n\nBetty Booker: The all-time leading scorer in Lady Tigers history, Booker racked up 2,835 points over four years without the benefit of the 3-point line. She became the first-ever University of Memphis student-athlete elected to the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 2005. Booker, who later coached basketball, volleyball and track at White Station for 14 years, remains tied (with Tamika Whitmore) for the highest career per-game scoring average (20.7).\n\nIsaac Bruce: He played just two seasons for the Tigers, but they were eye-opening. The St. Louis Rams made him a second-round pick in the 1994 NFL Draft. He went on to collect the fifth-most receiving yards in NFL history and win a Super Bowl.\n\nJohn Calipari: Undoubtedly one of the least popular names on the list among Memphians, Calipari compiled 214 wins in nine seasons as Memphis coach. Those 214 victories are second-most by a Tigers coach in program history (Larry Finch's 220 is the record). Memphis won the NIT in 2002 and Calipari guided the Tigers to four Sweet 16 appearances as well as the national championship game in 2008. The school was forced to vacate all of its wins during the 2007-2008 season when Derrick Rose's SAT score was invalidated.\n\nPhil Cannon: The Memphis native eventually became synonymous with the FedEx St. Jude Golf Classic — the city's first major professional sporting event — when he served as the tournament's director from 1999 to 2015. But his relationship with the FESJC (now the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational) began as a volunteer in 1966, when he was a 14-year-old high school student at White Station. Cannon became a full-time employee in 1990. He also wore several other sports-related hats around Memphis, including being a longtime press box PA announcer for football games at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium and serving as the Mid-South Coliseum general manager for five years in the 1980s.\n\nStubby Clapp: Was given the nickname \"Mayor of Memphis\" during his four-season playing career with the Redbirds. Clapp's 418 hits are third-most in team history, while his 258 runs scored are second-most. The St. Louis Cardinals' current first base coach spent two seasons as the team's manager, winning Pacific Coast League Manager of the Year honors both years and leading the Redbirds to back-to-back PCL championships as well as the AAA National Championship in 2018. His jersey is the only one ever retired by the Redbirds.\n\nMike Conley: The longest-tenured Grizzlies player in franchise history, the team made Conley its point guard after drafting him fourth overall in 2007. In 12 seasons, the former Ohio State star has rewritten the Grizzlies' record book. He currently holds nine team records (second only to longtime teammate Marc Gasol), including points, games, assists, steals and 3-pointers.\n\nChris Douglas-Roberts: Starred at Memphis from 2005 to 2008, finishing his Tigers career as the program's 10th-leading scorer all-time. Douglas-Roberts (who later legally changed his name to Supreme Bey) was the team's leading scorer during the 2007-08 season, when the team reached the national championship game. He became the school's third Associated Press first-team All-American in men's basketball and there has not been one since. Douglas-Roberts is also the only Sports Illustrated first-team All-American and was later the 40th overall pick in the NBA draft.\n\nA.F. \"Bud\" Dudley: A native of Philadelphia and a former athletics director at Villanova, Dudley founded the Liberty Bowl in 1959 and served as its executive director until 1994. First played in Philadelphia, then Atlantic City, the game was moved to Memphis in 1965. Dudley's plan after leaving Atlantic City was to keep moving the game's locale each year, but he was once quoted as saying, \"After I got to Memphis, I never got to the other cities.\" The Liberty Bowl currently stands as the eighth-oldest active bowl game.\n\nJack Eaton: A true Memphis sports icon, Eaton was the \"Voice of the Tigers\" from 1964 to 1991, and WMC-TV's sports director from 1956 to 1991. He also called play-by-play for Memphis State basketball and Ole Miss football from 1959 to 1963 and was inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nJake Elliott: Less than a decade after Stephen Gostkowski rewrote the Tigers' record book, Elliott put his own stamp on the program. Aided by a school-record 81 made field goals (currently the eighth-most in NCAA history), his 445 points are the most in Memphis history and 14th-most in NCAA history. The Bengals made Elliott the first kicker drafted in 2017 (fifth round), but he was claimed off the practice squad by the Eagles. Elliott set numerous NFL rookie records in 2017, including the longest field goal by a rookie kicker in a Super Bowl, when his 46-yarder helped Philadelphia win Super Bowl LII.\n\nLarry Finch: Considered by many to be among the most important sports figures in Memphis history, Finch first made a name for himself as a basketball star at Melrose High. As a player, he is fourth on the Tigers' all-time scoring list and still holds the record for most points in a single game (48, on Jan. 20, 1973, against St. Joseph's). He averaged 26.8 points per game during Memphis State's run to the national title game in the 1972-1973 season. Finch was named the Tigers' head coach in 1986, made six NCAA tournament appearances and remains the program's all-time winningest coach (220-130 overall record). \"Very few people have meant more to bring the community together in their sphere than Larry Finch,\" Cato Johnson, a member of the university's board of trustees, said last year.\n\nAvron Fogelman: A retired real estate developer, Fogelman (a Central High grad) has left an indelible mark on Memphis sports. At 30, the Memphis-born Fogelman became president of the ABA's Memphis Pros. He is largely responsible for bringing pro baseball back to the Bluff City in 1978, when the Chicks (then a minor league affiliate of the Kansas City Royals) were introduced. Fogelman, who also brought the WFL's Grizzlies/Southmen and the NASL's Rogues to town, was later a part-owner of the Royals for nine seasons (including 1985, when the team won its first World Series).\n\nMarc Gasol: The second-longest tenured Grizzly, Gasol became a Memphian in 2001 when his older brother, Pau, joined the team. After attending Lausanne and earning Division II Mr. Basketball honors in 2003, he spent several seasons in Spain before the Lakers drafted him 48th overall in 2007 and subsequently traded his rights to the Grizzlies. The three-time All-Star, Defensive Player of the Year (2013) and \"Core Four\" designee was traded to the Toronto Raptors in February 2019 as the Grizzlies' franchise leader in field goals, rebounds, free throws and blocks.\n\nPau Gasol: The only Grizzly on this list outside the \"Core Four,\" but arguably as instrumental to the team's success as anyone. The elder Gasol's NBA career began in Memphis when the Grizzlies traded for him after he was picked third overall in the draft by the Atlanta Hawks. He won the Rookie of the Year award in 2002 and spent the next six seasons in the Bluff City, helping the team reach the playoffs three times. In 2008, the Grizzlies traded Gasol for — among others — his younger brother, Marc.\n\nStephen Gostkowski: A record-breaking placekicker at Memphis from 2002-05, Gostkowski also played baseball for the Tigers. He threw 65 ⅓ innings as a freshman and is still the only person in Conference USA history to make the All-Freshman team in both football and baseball. You know the rest: fourth-round pick of the Patriots, three-time Super Bowl champ, four-time Pro Bowler and an NFL-record 479 consecutive extra points made.\n\nAnfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway: Born and raised in Memphis, the Treadwell and Memphis State alum became a household name after being taken third overall in the 1993 NBA draft. The consensus first-team All-American, four-time All-Star and gold-medal winner at the 1996 Olympics, Hardaway got into coaching at Lester Middle School in 2011. He later coached AAU ball and helped lead East High to three state championships before being hired as head coach at Memphis.\n\nMichael Heisley: The man responsible for turning Memphis into a major league sports town. Heisley orchestrated the Grizzlies' move from Vancouver to the Bluff City in 2001. The billionaire businessman, who died in 2014 — two years after selling his controlling stake in the franchise to Robert Pera — was also largely responsible for getting the organization involved in the community, forming the Memphis Grizzlies Charitable Foundation to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nClaude Humphrey: A star football and basketball player at old Lester High, Humphrey was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons with the third overall pick in 1968. The Hall of Famer was taken ahead of fellow future Hall of Famers Larry Csonka, Curley Culp and Ken Stabler. Humphrey won the NFL's Defensive Rookie of the Year award in 1968 and finished his career with 126.5 career sacks — unofficially, since the NFL didn't keep sacks as an official stat until 1982.\n\nJerry Johnson: The longtime (and legendary) LeMoyne-Owen men's basketball coach led the Magicians for 46 seasons, guiding them to the Division III national championship in 1975. According to the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame, Johnson learned basketball from John McLendon, who played basketball at Kansas when the school's athletic director was James Naismith (the inventor of the sport). Johnson's 821 career victories are the 21st-most in NCAA history.\n\nGeorge Lapides: As renowned a sports journalist as there's been in Memphis, Lapides became the sports editor and columnist for the old Memphis Press-Scimitar at 27 and held the position until it closed in 1983. Lapides seemingly had a hand in all things related to sports in the Bluff City before he died in 2016. He spent 10 years as WREG-TV's sports editor, was Rhodes College's athletic director for one year and the general manager of the Memphis Chicks, but more notably hosted a sports talk radio show for 45 years, first on WHER, then on WHBQ. \"Sports Time\" was the longest-running sports radio show in the country.\n\nJerry Lawler: The WWE Hall of Famer, dubbed \"The King,\" has held more recognized championship belts than any other professional wrestler in history. Born in Memphis in 1949, his family moved to Ohio for eight years, returning to the Bluff City when Lawler was in high school. After more than two decades as one of the most popular figures in Memphis wrestling (during which time he notoriously feuded with comedian Andy Kaufman), Lawler signed with WWE where he worked as both an in-ring performer as well as a key member of the company's broadcast team.\n\nKeith Lee: The Tigers' all-time leading scorer and rebounder, Lee was a four-time Associated Press All-American and was the first AP first-team selection in school history. A native of West Memphis, Arkansas, the 6-foot-11 forward helped Memphis State reach the NCAA Tournament three times in four seasons. The Chicago Bulls used the 11th overall pick in the 1985 draft to take Lee, who spent three seasons in the NBA.\n\nTim McCarver: The Christian Brothers alum enjoyed as successful a broadcast career as he did as a player. A member of the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame, McCarver made his MLB debut at 17 years old and eventually became a two-time World Series champion, a two-time All-Star and spent 21 years in the big leagues. Memphis' minor league baseball teams played at Tim McCarver Stadium until 2000, when the Redbirds moved to AutoZone Park. During his broadcast career, he called a then-record 23 World Series and 20 All-Star games. In 2012, he won the Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasting.\n\nNikki McCray: The Collierville native helped lead Pat Summitt's Tennessee Lady Vols to a national championship in 1991. She later became a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a three-time WNBA All-Star. McCray was also a part of an NCAA championship in 2017 as an assistant coach at South Carolina. She is currently the head coach at Old Dominion. In 2015, McCray, already part of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, became the first female from Tennessee inducted into the National High School Hall of Fame.\n\nShaun Micheel: The Memphis native and Christian Brothers alum went into the 2003 PGA Championship (his only PGA Tour win) at the age of 33 and ranked 169th in the world. Micheel's approach shot on No. 18 at Oak Hill that clinched his victory was described by commentator Jim Nantz this way: \"One of the great shots you'll ever see under championship pressure. Three inches.\" In 2006, he claimed the runner-up prize at the same tournament, finishing second to Tiger Woods. In 2010, he became just the second player ever to double eagle at the U.S. Open.\n\nCary Middlecoff: One of the leading professional golfers of his era, the Christian Brothers alum's 40 PGA Tour wins is still 10th-most all-time. The World Golf Hall of Famer won two U.S. Opens and a Masters, and was part of three Ryder Cup-winning teams. At the time of his retirement in the early 1960s, Middlecoff had won more money than anyone on the PGA Tour. He once said, \"I don't deny I'm nervous. I have always maintained that a man who is not nervous is either an idiot or has never been close enough to winning to get nervous.\"\n\nAnthony Miller: The youngest person to appear on the list, Miller starred at Christian Brothers before walking on at Memphis and eventually becoming the school's all-time leading receiver. Drafted 51st overall (second round) by the Chicago Bears in 2018, Miller led the team with seven touchdown catches, becoming the team's first rookie since Willie Gault (1983) with at least seven.\n\nSputnik Monroe: A true superstar in professional wrestling when superstars were few and far between. Inducted into the Legacy Wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2018, Monroe made waves during his time in Memphis that stretched far beyond the Bluff City and the realm of professional wrestling. He is credited with desegregating Ellis Auditorium in the late 1950s after refusing to perform unless black fans were allowed to buy tickets for any seat they wanted. As written by The Commercial Appeal's John Beifuss in 2017: \"Race, pop culture, politics — Sputnik drop-kicked them to the canvas by palling around with 'coloreds' and insisting on the desegregation of wrestling matches at Ellis Auditorium at a time when the rule of Jim Crow was as accepted as the teaching of Jesus Christ.\"\n\nJohnny Neumann: Recruited out of Overton High by the likes of John Wooden and Adolph Rupp, Neumann eventually signed with Ole Miss and led the nation in scoring (40.1 points per game) as a sophomore – still the fourth-highest single-season average only behind Pete Maravich's three varsity years. That earned him All-America status and he was named SEC Player of the Year in his only varsity season with the Rebels. Neumann averaged 13.2 points per game in eight seasons as a pro.\n\nMichael Oher: The former five-star recruit out of Briarcrest became a household name before ever stepping foot on a national stage. The subject of \"The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game,\" Oher's life story was first chronicled in book form in 2006. The film adaptation was a box-office success and scored Sandra Bullock an Academy Award for her portrayal of Oher's real-life adoptive mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy. The film was released just months after Oher became a first-round draft pick of the Baltimore Ravens. He won a Super Bowl ring with the team in 2013. He last played for the Carolina Panthers in 2016.\n\nCindy Parlow: Born in Memphis in 1978, the Germantown alum won the Hermann Trophy (women's college soccer's equivalent of the Heisman) twice at North Carolina, was a four-time All-American and a three-time national champion. Parlow (now Cindy Parlow Cone) went on to win two gold medals and became a FIFA Women's World Cup champion in 1999. She was elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nElliot Perry: A McDonald's All-American at Treadwell, Perry's success at the high school level landed him a scholarship to play for his hometown Memphis State Tigers. Perry is still the program's second-leading scorer (2,209) and is one of only two players in school history to score more than 2,000 points in his career. The 37th overall pick in the 1991 NBA draft, Perry played in 547 games with seven teams, including the Grizzlies.\n\nAllie Prescott: A star baseball player at Kinsbury (a two-time Commercial Appeal All-City honoree and the paper's Player of the Year in 1965), Prescott was a 33rd-round draft pick of the Baltimore Orioles the same year. But he chose to play for Memphis State, where he earned all-Missouri Valley Conference honors as a pitcher. He later became general manager of the Memphis Chicks and the Redbirds, and was heavily involved in getting AutoZone Park built. On May 14, 2019, Prescott was named interim athletic director at Memphis.\n\nThompson Prothro: Nicknamed \"Doc\" because the Memphis native was a practicing dentist before signing his first professional baseball contract at 26. Prothro, who attended the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, managed the Memphis Chicks to four Southern Association championships (1928, 1930, 1934 and 1944). Prothro later became the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies and led them to a 138-320 record, earning him the distinction of the worst managerial record in MLB history for anyone with at least three full seasons.\n\nZach Randolph: Referred to in the wake of his departure as \"the greatest of all Grizzlies\" by The Commercial Appeal after receiving 92 percent of the vote. It isn't difficult to comprehend what made him so popular and why he will always be part of the \"Core Four.\" The only times Randolph made the NBA All-Star team came during his time with the Grizzlies and his double-double (25 and 14) in Game 1 of the first round of the Western Conference playoffs in 2011 led the team to its first playoff win. His 21.5 points per game and 9.2 rebounding average in the same series against the top-seeded Spurs propelled the Grizzlies to the franchise's first playoff series victory.\n\nAndy Roberts: A member of the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame, the Christian Brothers grad is also part of the University of Memphis M-Club Hall of Fame, the U.S. Racquetball Association Hall of Fame and the International Racquetball Hall of Fame. Roberts helped lead Memphis to two National Intercollegiate Racquetball championships.\n\nRonnie Robinson: The \"Big Cat,\" Robinson spent much of his playing career as Larry Finch's running mate, first at Melrose and later at Memphis State. The duo, whose jersey numbers were both retired on Nov. 30, 1974 (just more than a year after they led the Tigers to their first national championship game appearance) were part of the first Memphis State team to produce the school's first NCAA Tournament victory (in 1973). Robinson's 12.8 rebounds per game is still the top mark in program history.\n\nDerrick Rose: Perhaps the person on this list with the shortest tenure in the Bluff City, but this is where Rose became a household name. He led the Tigers to their second (and most recent) NCAA Tournament championship game appearance in 2008 — although, technically, every win from that season has been vacated — scoring 14.9 points per game in the regular season and putting up 25 in the team's Final Four win over UCLA. Went on to win the NBA's Rookie of the Year award in 2009 and an MVP award in 2011.\n\nKyle Rote Jr.: National Soccer Hall of Famer who served as both coach and general manager for the Memphis Americans of the Major Indoor Soccer League. Also a member of the sports halls of fame in Tennessee and his native Texas, Rote Jr. founded Athletic Resource Management, a sports representation agency in Memphis where super-agent Jimmy Sexton once served as president.\n\nVerties Sails: A legendary basketball coach whose coaching career began as an assistant at Melrose during Larry Finch's time as a player with the Golden Wildcats, Sails led Melrose to a state championship as the head coach in 1974. After five years as an assistant at Memphis State, he spent the next 33 as head men's basketball coach at Southwest Tennessee Community College (then Shelby State), where the Tennessee Sports Hall of Famer led the Saluquis to 709 wins and 16 Tennessee Community College Athletic Association championships.\n\nHarry Schuh: Considered by many to be the best offensive lineman in Tigers history, Schuh earned All-America status at Memphis State in 1963 and 1964. The Tennessee Sports and M-Club Hall of Famer is one of just six Tiger football players to have his jersey number retired and was the third overall pick in the 1965 AFL draft. He won an AFL championship with the Oakland Raiders in 1967 and was a two-time AFL All-Star. Schuh was also part of the second AFL-NFL World Championship Game (later known as Super Bowl II).\n\nJimmy Sexton: The Memphis-born super-agent, Sexton has been referred to as \"the most powerful man in college football.\" He holds the distinction of being the youngest agent ever certified by the NFL Players' Association and made his first big splash representing Hall of Famer Reggie White. Among those represented by Sexton (co-head of Creative Artists Agency's football division and a 1982 Evangelical Christian School grad) are Alabama football coach Nick Saban (as well as 10 of the other 13 SEC football coaches), Scottie Pippen, Bill Parcells and Isaac Bruce.\n\nRochelle Stevens: A graduate of Melrose, Stevens became a state champion and national high school All-American with the Golden Wildcats. An 11-time NCAA All-American at Morgan State, she later won a gold medal in the women's 4x400 at the 1996 Olympics. She also won silver at the 1992 Olympics in the same event.\n\nBill Terry: Nicknamed \"Memphis Bill,\" the Atlanta native spent most of his youth in the Bluff City. After five unspectacular seasons in the minor leagues, Terry operated a filling station and played semi-pro baseball in Memphis for four years. Acquired by the New York Giants in 1922, he became a regular in 1927. Elected to the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame in 1954, he was the last National League player to hit .400. He also managed the Giants from 1932 to 1941.\n\nAndre Turner: Dubbed the \"Little General,\" Turner will forever reside in Memphis lore as one of the best guards in Tigers history. After a standout high school career at Mitchell, Turner became Memphis State's vocal leader from 1983 to 1986 (\"If I hit the court and I felt someone wasn't giving all they could give, I didn't hesitate about saying something,\" he once said). Turner averaged 14.8 points and 7.6 assists per game during the Tigers' run to the Final Four in 1985, leading one television broadcaster to remark at the end of the quarterfinal win over Oklahoma: \"As far as Memphis State is concerned, you can understand why they want the ball in the hands of Andre Turner.\" His 763 career assists remains the most in Memphis history — 124 more than Chris Garner, who has the second-most.\n\nDeAngelo Williams: Arguably the most accomplished and decorated football player in Tigers history, Williams is Memphis' only 6,000-yard rusher and has scored more touchdowns than any other Tiger. His 6,026 rushing yards is still fifth-most in NCAA history. Williams was a first-round pick in the 2006 draft by the Carolina Panthers, and amassed more than 10,000 yards of offense during an 11-year career that ended with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2016.\n\nJames Earl Wright: A pioneer of sorts when it comes to Memphis Tigers football. Wright held 10 school records at the conclusion of his collegiate career and parlayed his success into a becoming a third-round selection of the Philadelphia Eagles in 1961. It was Wright who quarterbacked the Tigers into the big-time. In 1960 at Crump Stadium, Wright and Co. led mighty Ole Miss 20-19 at halftime. Memphis State eventually lost 31-20, but that was the game that opened the eyes of many around Memphis and the country. Legendary Alabama coach Bear Bryant was once quoted saying, “James Earl Wright is too good to play for any team other than Alabama.\"\n\nLorenzen Wright: Born in Oxford, Wright's family moved to Memphis while he was still in high school. He played his senior season at Booker T. Washington and became a consensus second-team All-American at Memphis in 1996. The same year, he was drafted seventh overall and averaged 7.9 points and 6.3 rebounds during a 13-year NBA career. In 2010, Wright was found in Germantown after he had been shot and killed. His ex-wife, Sherra Wright, and Billy Turner were arrested and charged with first-degree murder. They are set to go on trial for his death on Sept. 16, 2019.\n\nThe Just-Missed List\n\nHubie Brown: Guided the Grizzlies to the franchise's first playoff appearance in his only full season as the team's coach. Won NBA Coach of the Year honors in 2003-2004.\n\nDave Casinelli: The former Tiger fullback has the third-most rushing yards in program history and was its leading rusher for more than four decades. Led the nation in rushing yards and scoring as a senior in 1963.\n\nBilly Dunavant: Founded the Racquet Club of Memphis in 1972 and brought the U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships to Memphis in 1975. Owner of the USFL's Memphis Showboats, who also tried (in vain) to bring an NFL franchise to the Bluff City.\n\nSteve Ehrhart: Executive director of the Liberty Bowl since 1994. Former vice president and general manager of the XFL's Memphis Maniax. Ehrhart also served as executive director of the USFL, while also running the Memphis Showboats.\n\nSylvester Ford: Spent more than four decades as a high school basketball coach in Memphis and won 687 games, \"Big Time\" became a legend at Fairley. Ford coached there from 1987 to 2012. The 1993 state championship team finished 37-1 and is considered by many to be one of the most dominant in Memphis history.\n\nDean Jernigan: Memphis Redbirds founder who is responsible for bringing professional baseball back to Memphis and getting AutoZone Park built downtown.\n\nPaxton Lynch: Second-leading passer in Memphis football history (8,863 yards in three seasons). A first-round draft pick of the Denver Broncos in 2016.\n\nJohn Pennel: Born in Memphis in 1940 and inducted into the USA Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2004. The first man to clear 17 feet in the pole vault.\n\nElma Roane: A star basketball and softball player for Memphis Messick, Roane later became women's athletic director at Memphis State, and coached basketball, volleyball and badminton from 1955 to 1970.\n\nRicky Stenhouse Jr.: Born in Memphis, raised in Olive Branch, Stenhouse was the 2011 and 2012 NASCAR Nationwide Series champion. He won the 2017 Geico 500 and the 2017 Coke Zero 400. In 2013, he was named the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Rookie of the Year.\n\n10 who could make the next list\n\nJames Wiseman: The nation's top high school basketball recruit, who played at East High for two seasons and signed with Memphis.\n\nDarrell Henderson: The Tigers' second-leading rusher of all time, who was taken in the third round of the 2019 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nJaren Jackson Jr.: Fourth overall pick of the Grizzlies in the 2018 draft. Averaged 13.8 points and 4.7 rebounds during an injury-shortened rookie season.\n\nRachel Heck: St. Agnes junior (committed to Stanford) ranked as high as 11th in the World Amateur Golf rankings. She has already competed in two professional majors (2017 U.S. Women's Open and 2018 Evian Championship).\n\nEric Gray: Former Lausanne running back, who holds the Tennessee state record for career touchdowns (138). Enrolled at UT in January 2019.\n\nMaurice Hampton: Starred at MUS in football and baseball. DII-AA Mr. Football in 2018. Signed with LSU football and committed to play baseball at LSU. Projected first-round MLB draft pick.\n\nMike Norvell: Memphis football coach since 2016. Led the Tigers to 26 wins in his first three seasons. Guided Memphis to AAC West division titles in 2017 and 2018.\n\nJeremiah Martin: Became the 52nd player in Memphis history to join the 1,000-point club. His 708 points in 2018-19 are second-most by a senior in Tigers history, 13 shy of Larry Finch's record.\n\nAvery Downing: Houston High grad, paralyzed at 13 years old in a gymnastics accident, who won national championships with the Alabama women's wheelchair basketball team and the Crimson Tide's women's wheelchair tennis team in 2019.\n\nD.J. Jeffries: Mississippi Gatorade Player of the Year (2019). Won a state championship in 2018. Signed with Memphis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/high-school/2025/01/16/bass-pro-tournament-of-champions-2024-best-players-history-alonzo-mourning-jayson-tatum-john-wall/77488788007/", "title": "Ranking Bass Pro Tournament of Champions top 20 players ever", "text": "In the 40-year history of the Bass Pro Tournament of Champions, dozens of athletes who have played on Springfield's biggest stage have gone on to have either successful NBA or collegiate careers.\n\nBefore becoming multi-time NBA all-stars, current and future Hall of Famers, All-American college players or NBA or collegiate champions, these athletes have played in the Bass Pro Tournament of Champions.\n\nWe looked back at the great players who came through the tournament and ranked them based on their college and professional accomplishments.\n\nNote: Minnesota Timberwolves forward Julius Randle is considered a Tournament of Champions alum, but he didn't play with his team in 2013 due to a fractured foot, so we did not include him in this list.\n\n20. Chandler Parsons (Lake Howell, 2007)\n\nParsons was the best player on a Lake Powell team that finished as the 2007 runner-up to South Medford, which featured Kyle Singler. He averaged nearly 20 points in three games.\n\nParsons was somewhat injury-prone during his NBA career, but he had some great seasons toward the beginning of it, one with the Houston Rockets and one with the Dallas Mavericks. He was the SEC Player of the Year in 2011 and helped Florida reach the Elite Eight.\n\n19. Anthony Peeler (Paseo, 1988)\n\nPeeler was one of the earliest stars at the Tournament of Champions and still has one of the all-time great single-tournament performances. He's still in the record books with a tournament-record 15 steals across three games, including eight in one. He grabbed 15 boards in a single game, 36 in another and scored 89 points across three.\n\nPeeler had a great career at Mizzou. In his senior year, he was named a consensus All-American, and the Lakers selected him with the 15th overall pick in 1992. He then went on to have a 13-year NBA career.\n\n18. Lonzo Ball (Chino Hills, 2015)\n\nBall nearly averaged a triple-double when he earned all-tournament honors a decade ago, averaging 22.7 points, 13.3 rebounds and 9.7 assists. He and his brother, LiAngelo Ball, earned all-tournament honors.\n\nOnce his dad settled down, Ball turned into a solid NBA point guard for the Pelicans and Bulls until he had to miss two seasons with a knee injury. He's back to playing in Chicago now but isn't nearly as effective.\n\n17. Keldon Johnson (Oak Hill, 2018)\n\nJohnson helped Oak Hill beat La Lumiere (Indiana) in the 2018 championship, scoring 23 points and 10 rebounds in the victory. He was the best player on a loaded team that had Charlotte Hornets guard Keyontae Johnson and Detroit Pistons center Isaiah Stewart.\n\nJohnson has been a solid player for the San Antonio Spurs since Gregg Popovich drafted him with the 29th pick in 2018. He's coming off the bench this year and has averaged nearly 16 points per game over his career.\n\n16. Bobby Portis (Hall, 2013)\n\nPortis was the best player on a Little Rock Hall team that finished seventh in a loaded 2013 field. He scored 31 points in the seventh-place game. Later, he led the Warriors to an Arkansas 6A state championship.\n\nPortis has been a great role player over his NBA career, which included helping the Milwaukee Bucks to the 2021 NBA title. He was the 22nd overall pick out of Arkansas, where he was a consensus All-American and two-time All-SEC selection.\n\n15. R.J. Barrett (Montverde, 2017)\n\nWhen Barrett visited Springfield in 2017, he was the top-ranked sophomore in the nation. He led his team to a third-place win, scoring 28 points and grabbing 14 rebounds.\n\nBarrett was the third overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft and has since been traded to the Toronto Raptors. In his six-year NBA career, he has averaged just over 18 points per game. He was a consensus All-American when he played his one year at Duke alongside Zion Williamson.\n\n14. Cameron Thomas (Oak Hill, 2020)\n\nThomas was the MVP of the 2020 tournament when he led Oak Hill to a championship. He scored 26 points in the championship game, leading his team to a 72-57 win over Paul VI.\n\nThomas has been great in his early years playing in the NBA after the Brooklyn Nets selected him 27th overall out of LSU in 2021. This season, he's averaging nearly 25 points per game after averaging 22.5 last season. A few years from now, he could be much higher on this list.\n\n13. D'Angelo Russell (Montverde, 2013 & 2014)\n\nPlaying alongside Ben Simmons, Russell helped lead Montverde to the 2014 title after finishing as a runner-up the year before. He scored 12 points in the championship, 28 in the semifinals and 24 in the first round, earning himself tournament MVP honors.\n\nRussell is still having a solid NBA career, which includes an all-star selection in 2018-19. He's now on the Brooklyn Nets after being traded earlier in the year by the Lakers, the team who drafted him second overall out of Ohio State in 2015. With the Buckeyes, he was a consensus All-American in his lone season with the team.\n\n12. Darius Garland (Brentwood, 2018)\n\nGarland, the son of Missouri State legend Winson Garland, had a phenomenal tournament playing at his dad's old stomping grounds. He averaged 33.3 points while leading Brentwood to a third-place finish.\n\nSince an injury-shortened freshman year at Vanderbilt, the star point guard has been great with the Cleveland Cavaliers. He has one all-star appearance in 2021-22 and is currently one of the leaders of a Cavs team that has the best record in the Eastern Conference. He will have a chance to continue to climb up this list.\n\n11. Kyle Singler (South Medford, 2007)\n\nSingler was the star of the 2007 tournament, helping his team win the championship with a 34-point performance that saw him go 11 of 14 from the field and 12 of 13 from the line in the championship. He averaged nearly 31 points over three games.\n\nSingler had a six-year NBA career, but his most notable post-high school impact came at Duke, where he was a four-time All-ACC player and the MVP of the 2010 NCAA Tournament, which the Blue Devils won.\n\n10. Mario Chalmers (Bartlett, 2005)\n\nChalmers came to Springfield from Alaska and put on a show despite his team finishing eighth. He averaged 22.3 points per game, scoring 15 in a seventh-place game loss to Republic, which featured Justin Lawlor, Dusty Hagewood and Chris Ijames. He's tied for the all-time tournament record with 15 steals.\n\nChalmers went on to be the starting point guard at Kansas, where he made one of the biggest shots in NCAA Tournament history to tie a championship game late against Derrick Rose and Memphis before winning in overtime. He was the tournament's MVP. He went on to play nine years in the NBA, winning two championships with James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh while starting for the Miami Heat.\n\n9. Larry Hughes (Christian Brothers, 1997)\n\nHughes led Christian Brothers to the 1997 Tournament of Champions title, scoring 30-plus points in each game. He stole the show with 95 points, making 12 of 19 shots from deep, 23 rebounds, 13 assists, 12 blocked shots and 11 steals.\n\nHughes then had a 13-year NBA career, during which he averaged 14.1 points, 4.2 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.5 steals across 727 games. He was the NBA's steals champion in 2004-05 and also earned all-defensive recognition. He had one great season at Saint Louis before being the eighth overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft.\n\n8. Lamar Odom (Christ the King, 1996)\n\nOdom led Christ the King to a 1996 championship and was named the tournament's MVP. In the championship game, he scored 15 points, seven rebounds, six assists and four blocks. His 19-rebound performance was just one behind the tournament's all-time record at the time.\n\nOdom enjoyed a 14-year NBA career that saw him win back-to-back championships alongside Kobe Bryant with the Lakers. He was named the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year in 2010-11 while proving to be a critical player for the Lakers during their championship run.\n\n7. Ben Simmons (Montverde, 2014)\n\nSimmons was the No. 1 recruit in the nation when he visited Springfield in 2014. He scored a team-high 16 points, 11 rebounds and five assists in the championship game.\n\nSimmons was selected No. 1 in the 2016 draft and has had quite the story arc during his NBA career. Because of different injuries, Simmons has missed two seasons, making him a controversial figure throughout his career with the 76ers when he was a central piece in \"the process.\" Still, he's flashed some greatness as a defender and is a three-time all-star. His NBA career has been a lot better than many give him credit for.\n\n6. DeMarcus Cousins (LeFlore Magnet, 2008)\n\nCousins averaged a double-double when leading LeFlore Magnet to a runner-up finish in 2008. He scored 38 points and 12 rebounds in a one-point overtime championship loss to Christ the King.\n\nCousins was one-and-done at Kentucky, leading the Wildcats to an Elite Eight appearance and earning consensus All-American honors. He was one of the better centers in the NBA throughout his career until he ruptured his Achilles in 2019. Up until then, he averaged 21.2 points, 10.9 rebounds and 3.2 assists while earning four all-star appearances over the span.\n\n5. Bradley Beal (Chaminade, 2010)\n\nBeal was the best player on a Chaminade team that finished eighth in the 2010 tournament. He still got his points, as he continues to do in the NBA. He scored 30, 35 and 29 in his games but couldn't slow down the likes of Dorial Green-Beckham and Fab Melon on the second and third days.\n\nBeal has been an elite shooter throughout his now-13-year NBA career. In two different seasons, he averaged over 30 points per game and has been selected to three all-star games. He was the third overall pick after leading Florida to the Elite Eight during his freshman season in 2012.\n\n4. John Wall (Word of God, 2009)\n\nWall had one of the best championship games in tournament history. He led Word of God to a three-point win with 41 points, seven assists and 10 rebounds. He also scored 24 points in the first round and semifinals, earning himself the MVP of the tournament.\n\nWall had one of the most electric one-and-done seasons in college basketball history during his one year at Kentucky, earning himself the Rupp Trophy for college basketball's best player. He was drafted No. 1 overall in 2010 and went on to be a five-time all-star with the Washington Wizards.\n\n3. Tyler Hansbrough (Poplar Bluff, 2004 & 2005)\n\nHansbrough led Poplar Bluff to third-place finishes in 2004 and 2005, losing to Logan-Rogersville and Kickapoo in the winner's bracket semifinal games. In a 2005 third-place win over St. Raymond, he scored 44 points and grabbed 15 rebounds after the Chiefs limited him to 12 points the previous day. In the 2004 third-place game against Kickapoo, he went 12 for 12 from the field, made both his shots from 3 and sank all nine attempts from the free-throw line in a win.\n\nHansbrough, considering only college accolades, could be considered the greatest North Carolina player in the school's storied history. He was a four-time consensus All-American, the AP Player of the Year in 2007-08, and the winner of the 2009 national championship. Hansbrough went on to play seven years in the NBA and made 50 starts.\n\n2. Jayson Tatum (Chaminade, 2016)\n\nTatum led Chaminade to a third-place finish in 2016 after averaging 16 points and 9.7 rebounds in the three games.\n\nTatum is among the best players in the NBA and is already putting together a hall-of-fame career through seven seasons. He's a five-time all-star, four-time all-NBA selection and was the best player on the Boston Celtics, who won the Finals last season and have a chance to win more over the next few years. Averaging 27.7 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 4.7 assists over the last five seasons, Tatum will likely have an argument about being the best player to ever come through the Tournament of Champions once his career comes to a close.\n\n1. Alonzo Mourning (Indian River, 1987)\n\nThere's only one Basketball Hall of Famer on this list (so far), and Mourning takes the top spot as the greatest player to ever come through the Bass Pro Tournament of Champions.\n\nZo was a beast, winning the tournament's MVP honor while leading Indian River (Virginia) to a championship. In the title game, he scored 18 points and grabbed 15 rebounds. The day before, he scored 21 points and had 12 boards, and he scored 25 points and had 13 boards in an opening-day win over Hillcrest.\n\nAt Georgetown, he was a two-time consensus All-American before being the second pick in the 1992 NBA Draft. In the pros, Mourning was a seven-time all-star, and he won the 2006 NBA championship with the Miami Heat. He was a two-time Defensive Player of the Year and a two-time block champ and he averaged 17.1 points and 8.5 rebounds across his 15-year career.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2024/03/18/oakland-basketball-greg-kampe-ncaa-tournament-march-madness/72985238007/", "title": "Oakland's Greg Kampe: Longest-tenured active college basketball ...", "text": "Forty years in, Greg Kampe will get another shot as a Cinderella in the 2024 NCAA tournament.\n\nHis Golden Grizzlies are the No. 14 seed in the South region and will take on No. 3 seed Kentucky.\n\nKampe, the head coach of Oakland basketball, has been in the game longer than any of his contemporaries and notched another trip to March Madness with his 2023-24 Golden Grizzlies' squad. Oakland (23-11, 15-5 Horizon) was the undisputed high mark of the Horizon League this year, winning both the conference tournament and the regular season crown thanks to a veteran-laden team that showed up in big moments.\n\nAfter winning three straight to take home their first Horizon League tournament title, Oakland automatically qualified for the 68-team NCAA tournament field for the first time since 2010-11. It is the fourth NCAA tournament appearance for the school since making the jump to Division 1 at the end of the 90s.\n\nHere is more on Oakland and the 40-year veteran coach who leads the program:\n\nKampe's history\n\nKampe, 68, has been the shepherd of Oakland basketball throughout it all, overseeing the transition from Division II to Division I, switching conferences multiple times and most notably, delivering results for the Rochester-based university.\n\nKampe took over as head coach in 1984 when Oakland was still in the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. At 28, he got the opportunity to run his program after spending six years as an assistant at Toledo, and he has yet to pass on the reins. Kampe is the longest-tenured coach in all of college basketball at 40 seasons, followed by Houston Christian's Ron Cottrell (33 seasons), Michigan State's Tom Izzo (29 seasons) and Gonzaga's Mark Few (25 seasons). Kampe recently jumped to the top of the list after Jim Boeheim's retirement after the 2023 season.\n\nKampe has a 698-536 overall record, including a 436-366 record in the last 21 seasons at the Division 1 level. His 698 career wins are the fourth-most among active coaches, trailing Coastal Carolina's Cliff Ellis, Few and Izzo. He is in elite company with Few and Izzo as the only active coaches with over 600 wins at one school.\n\nHOW THEY GOT HERE: Oakland men headed to first NCAA tournament since 2011 after 83-76 win over Milwaukee\n\nKampe has been there for Oakland the whole time, leading the school to eight total NCAA tournaments, four at the Division 2 level and four at the Division level, including this season. He was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2017 to honor his decorated resume while building the program.\n\nHealth scare\n\nA month after his Hall of Fame induction, Kampe went to the hospital with a severe case of sepsis that nearly cost him his life, but recovered in time to return to the bench the next season. He spent nearly a week in the ICU at Crittenton Hospital with a fever that reached as high as 106.7 degrees and a heart rate flirting with 150 beats per minute.\n\nHe had to have three surgeries in total to fix the root of the issue, which was six infected kidney stones that were leaking poison into his bloodstream, leading to elevated body temperature and heart rate. The first operation happened after Oakland beat Clemson in the first round of the 2017 NIT. After the game, he went to the hospital in pain and had the operation in March. The doctors did not remove the stone the first time but inserted a stent. The stone was removed a week after Oakland lost in the NIT, but doctors discovered another, larger, stone in his kidney causing them to leave the stint in while giving him medication to shrink it for another operation.\n\nTUNE IN: Watch NCAA tournament games on Fubo (free trial)\n\nDoctors decided at the end of June to do the third operation, but Kampe held off until the end of July because he wanted to get a jump on summer recruiting. He noticed himself getting sicker at high school tournaments in Georgia, eventually booking an early return home after dry heaving and turning yellow with a fever at a tournament. He came home and attempted to treat his fever, before eventually going to the hospital.\n\n\"I don’t know if this is true or not, but they told me 80% of the people in my age group who get it die from it,’’ Kampe said in August 2017. “They saved my life. When I had the temperature of 106.7, they poured ice over me until they got my temperature down.\n\n“I’m not telling my story because I want people to feel sorry for me. In fact, a lot of coaches probably will use it against me in recruiting. I think it’s worthwhile. I just think it’s important for (people) to know, if they think something is wrong, you need to go to the hospital. Hopefully, a few people will read this. ... Sepsis is a bad deal.\"\n\nDivision I history\n\nOakland made the jump to Division 1 in the 1999-2000 season, first joining the Mid-Continent Conference (now the Summit League). In their first season in the league, Oakland went 13-17 but took home the regular season conference title with an 11-5 record, and Kampe was given the Coach of the Year award.\n\nOakland had its first winning season in D-1 in 2001-02, finishing with a 17-13 record. Kampe took his squad to the Big Dance for the first time in 2004-05 by winning the Mid-Continent tournament with a one-point win over Oral Roberts in the championship to make the field as a 16-seed despite finishing the season 13-19. Oakland won a First Four game against Alabama A&M, Kampe's only D-1 NCAA tournament win, to make the field of 64, but were beaten by eventual national champion North Carolina in the first round.\n\nGET YOUR BRACKETS: NCAA printable bracket 2024 is here: Make your March Madness picks now\n\nThey broke 20 wins for the first time in 2008-09 with a 23-13 record, but missed the tournament due to a dominant North Dakota State team in a one-bid league, but set the stage for back-to-back tournament appearances the next two seasons. In 2009-10, Oakland swept the regular season and tournament crowns with a 26-9 record, earning a 14-seed before being bounced by Pittsburgh. Oakland repeated as champions in 2010-11 with a 25-10 record, earning a 13-seed and losing to Texas by four in the first round.\n\nIn addition to the now four NCAA tournament appearances, Oakland made six other postseason tournaments between the NIT, Vegas 16 and CIT tournaments.\n\nSince making the jump, Oakland has won five regular-season conference titles to go along with the four conference tournament titles and NCAA tournament appearances. The Golden Grizzlies have also produced some NBA talent with players such as Kay Felder, Kendrick Nunn, Rawle Marshall, Keith Benson, and most recently, Jamal Cain. Oakland has had 31 players play professionally in the NBA and overseas.\n\nDivision II history\n\nKampe took over a program that had six winning seasons in the previous 16 years before him. After starting with consecutive 13-15 seasons, Oakland broke through in Year 3 with a 20-8 record and finished every season after that with a winning record until they moved up divisions.\n\nOakland's time in D-2 ended with four straight trips to that level's NCAA tournament and two conference titles in 1995-96 and 1996-97. In the first appearance, Oakland made it to the second round before losing to Wayne State by two points, followed up by first-round exits the next two seasons. In Oakland's final D-2 season, they reached the Sweet 16 before being knocked out by Northern Kentucky.\n\nHall of Famer\n\nNot only is Kampe in the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (a 2017 inductee) but last year he was enshrined in the inaugural class of the National High School Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThat's right. Before his long career as a basketball coach, Kampe was a great football player in the 1970s at Defiance High in Ohio, one of the hotbeds for football talent in the country. Kampe's class included a who's who of football history, including Jim Brown, Peyton Manning, Chris Spielman and Lomas Brown.\n\nKampe also played football at Bowling Green, from which he graduated in 1978, followed by a stint as a grad assistant with Toledo basketball, then as assistant coach before Oakland hired him in 1984.\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Bush and Trump.\n\nTrump, whose mother was from Scotland, has spoken regularly about his admiration for the British royal family. Although the royals are meant to be apolitical, they are often deployed to try to secure favorable relations with world leaders.\n\nTrump's first state visit in June 2019 lasted for three days, during which he attended a state banquet and had tea with Charles, who was then heir to the throne.\n\nThe leader of the SNP, John Swinney, said on Sunday \"it is hard to believe\" that the offer to Trump still stands.\n\nAn opposition Conservative lawmaker Alicia Kearns, previously the head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, also said that the visit should be paused until the U.S. had offered to provide the security guarantee to Ukraine.\n\nA petition calling for the invite to be canceled has attracted almost 70,000 signatures and some of the normally right-wing British newspapers have also been critical of Trump since his row with Zelenskyy.

State dinners are often viewed as a tool of soft diplomacy used to court leaders of countries with whom a strong partnership is sought.\n\n\"We share a strong respect for the history that connects us together,\" said Biden as he toasted his guests. He then quoted former President Jimmy Carter, who in 1980 hosted President Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya, saying: \"Neighbors do not share a border but share beliefs.\"\n\nBiden announced Thursday that he would work with Congress to designate Kenya as a major “non-NATO Ally” as the U.S. looks to deepen 60 years of official U.S.-Kenya partnership. The designation is granted by the U.S. to countries with close and strategic working relationships with the U.S. military and defense civilians.\n\nRuto’s trip is the first state visit by a Kenyan president to the United States in two decades and the first by an African leader since 2008. The last African leader to address Congress was Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf who spoke in the House chamber in 2006.\n\nThursday's state dinner had about 500 attendees and was the sixth hosted by Biden.\n\nThroughout the evening, guests enjoyed musical selections by the Howard Gospel Choir, award-winning country music artist Brad Paisley, and \"The President’s Own\" the United States Marine Band Chamber Orchestra and the Army and Air Force Strings.\n\nWhat was the décor like at the state dinner?\n\nAmerican red roses and vibrant fuchsia and purple African orchids were featured throughout in a nod to \"unity and friendship\" between the United States and Kenya. Glowing candles displayed along the walls of the pavilion made for a cozy ambiance while a suspended centerpiece with 15,000 pieces of layered reflective metallic strips sparkled with gold and silver hues.\n\nThe invitees, who ran the gamut from business leaders to movie stars to a couple of former presidents, were ushered into a glass pavilion with over 1,000 glowing candles, where they dined on chilled heirloom tomato soup, fruitwood-smoked beef short ribs, and butter poached-lobster.\n\nThe décor for the evening reflects the first lady's love of candlelight which she favors to make guests feel as if they're at home, even when they're part of a large group, said Bryan Rafanelli, the event planner for the evening.\n\n\"As guests leave their path illuminated by our one moon,\" said Biden, during a preview of the décor earlier. \"I hope they will be filled with the same warmth that I felt on my visits to Kenya.”\n\nWhat was on the state dinner menu?\n\nThe three-course meal, developed by White House Executive Chef Cris Comerford and White House Executive Pastry Chef Susie Morrison, started with a chilled heirloom tomato soup, followed by short ribs and butter-poached lobster with a side of baby kale and sweet corn puree. For dessert, guests were treated to a white chocolate basket with banana ganache and raspberries, peaches, and candied lime zest.\n\nWho were some of the famous guests at the state dinner?\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan, made a cameo appearance at the event. His name had not been circulated earlier in the list of attendees. The former president stopped by but did not stay for dinner.\n\nAmong other guests at the soiree were former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and actor Sean Penn. There were members of Congress and administration as well as business leaders such as Albert Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer.\n\nGifts for the Kenyan president and wife\n\nAs the official gift, the president and first lady presented the Rutos with a set of rocking chairs produced by a family-owned company in Troutman, North Carolina. The wooden rocking chairs have a cane seat, steam-bent back posts, and personalized inscriptions commemorating the state visit on the armrests.\n\nBiden also gifted Ruto with the first edition of the book \"The Trumpet of Conscience\" by Martin Luther King Jr. in a custom leather clamshell case with a hand-tooled inscription commemorating the state visit. The first lady presented Rachel Ruto with a custom pearl and Arizona peridot gemstone necklace that was crafted by a jeweler in Philadelphia.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

He named his youngest son \"Barron,\" a rank of nobility, often hereditary − though he added an extra \"r\" for good measure.\n\nHe's added a touch of gold to every White House portrait, fireplace mantel, doorway, carving and coaster in sight.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has acknowledged a love affair with royal families, particularly the British one, that traces back to his mother, a poor immigrant from Scotland.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de factor ruler, greeted him at the airport, where a lavender carpet − a color that celebrates Saudi identity and is reserved for high-profile dignitaries − was rolled out.\n\nAn honor guard lined up with golden swords.\n\nTrump was treated to tours of gilded palaces, cannon salutes and a state dinner. A fleet of Arabian horses with riders carrying flags escorted the Beast, his presidential limousine.\n\nQatar rolled out its own carpet − red this time − for Trump when he landed in Doha a day later, becoming the first American president to visit the energy-rich country since President George W. Bush in 2003. After stepping off Air Force One, Trump was greeted by another monarch, the Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Scores of U.S. and Qatari flags lined the streets. They were also placed on boats and attached to horses and camels.\n\n\"We appreciate those camels,\" Trump said.\n\nDeals, a jetliner and lifted Syria sanctions\n\nIn Qatar, Trump will take part in a second glittering state dinner and seek to strike commercial deals. Ahead of his arrival, the Qataris said they were exploring ways to gift him a luxury jetliner worth an estimated $400 million.\n\nAs Trump visits some of the world's richest countries, he appears to be having a good time.\n\n\"I really believe we like each other a lot,\" he said of the crown prince as they luxuriated on golden chairs under intricate chandeliers in the Saudi royal palace.\n\nA Qatari gift: Trump in talks to accept luxury jet\n\nTrump is chasing major trade deals in the Gulf. During a speech later in the day at a Riyadh investment conference, he described Crown Prince Mohammed as an \"incredible man\" and \"great guy.\"\n\nThe feeling appeared to be mutual. When Trump pledged to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, the crown prince placed his hands over his heart and led a standing ovation.\n\n\"Oh, what I do for the crown prince,\" Trump said.\n\n'Give them a chance at greatness': Trump will end US sanctions on Syria\n\nTrump and the royals, a fascination\n\nDouglas Brinkley, an author and professor of history at Rice University, has noted that Trump is \"always very impressed by monarchy.\" And Michael D’Antonio, who wrote \"The Truth About Trump,\" a 2016 biography, has noted that throughout his life, Trump has expressed a desire to be close to, and possibly on an equal footing with, royal families − especially the British one, and especially its late monarch, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\"This is more important than any piece of legislation he could get through Congress, greater than resolving problems at the border with Mexico,\" D’Antonio said in a 2019 interview. \"I would think one of his dying thoughts will be of this. When he is about to leave this Earth, he will think, 'I was that person, standing with the queen.'\"\n\n(Trump met Queen Elizabeth II twice during his first presidency. In 2018, they watched a military parade and had tea at Windsor Castle. In 2019, during a state visit, she held a banquet for him at Buckingham Palace. A biography by the British author Craig Brown, published after her death, alleged the queen found Trump \"very rude.\" Trump disputed that. \"Totally false,\" he told a British newspaper. \"She liked me and I liked her.\")\n\nStill, Christopher Henzel, who served as charge d'affaires for the U.S. embassy in Saudi Arabia from 2017-2019 said he didn't \"really see\" in Trump a preoccupation with Middle Eastern monarchies.\n\n\"All U.S. presidents recognize Saudi Arabia is a very important partner if you're going to get anything done in the Middle East,\" he said. \"It's not about whether you like them, are fascinated by them, or don't like them. You have to deal with them. Saudi Arabia's got a huge GDP. It's a diplomatic power. It's got religious credentials.\"\n\nHenzel added that state visits are \"meant to be impressive\" and that the Saudis are \"famous for completely over-the-top lavish events.\" He said this is something other Gulf states − Trump is also visiting the United Arab Emirates on his regional jaunt − have sometimes tried to \"copy and even outdo.\"\n\nTrump's coveted 'palace in the sky': How Air Force One stacks up to the Qatari 747\n\nAmong the pomp, Trump briefly joined a traditional male-only sword dance during his 2017 visit. \"I was there for that. I could tell he was genuinely enjoying it,\" Henzel said.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Qatar bring the glitz\n\nBrett Bruen, who served as director of global engagement at the Obama White House, said the royal treatment Trump is receiving in the Gulf helps \"paper over some of the more delicate areas in our relationship, from human rights to their deals with China.\"\n\nOne problem, Bruen said, is that Trump \"seems so mesmerized by the glitz and glamor, he forgets to stay focused on our agenda and falls into fawning over the show they put on for him.\"\n\nHenzel, the former diplomat, disagreed.\n\nHe said Trump understood the Saudi relationship, contrasting Trump with former President Joe Biden, who vowed while campaigning in 2019 to make a \"pariah\" out of the kingdom for its human rights record, in particular, for the murder of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies concluded the crown prince authorized Khashoggi's killing. Within a year of winning the White House, Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia to push the kingdom to increase oil production amid soaring prices.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nWhere Trump and Arab monarchies align\n\nAli al-Ahmed, a Saudi-born founder of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said the leaders of Arab monarchies have a \"mindset that favors showing off.\"\n\nHe said he believes Trump shares this habit.\n\n\"If you look at his homes, they are gilded,\" Al-Ahmed said, referring to the White House and Trump's opulent, 128-room Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, which features Florentine frescoes and Venetian arches.\n\nTrump met with the Emir of Qatar in an incense-scented ceremonial room at Doha's Lusail Palace. When he entered the room, he paused, looked around and marveled at the architecture.\n\n\"The job you’ve done is second to none. You look at this, it’s so beautiful,\" he told the Emir. \"As a construction person, I’m seeing perfect marble. This is what they call perfecto.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/22/pm-modi-us-visit-biden/70321862007/", "title": "Why is Biden lavishing India's right-wing PM Modi with a state visit?", "text": "WASHINGTON − India’s democracy is at a weak point. The U.S. government has accused India of engaging in significant human rights abuses.\n\nAnd yet, on Thursday, the U.S. president is throwing India’s prime minister a lavish state dinner.\n\nFor a politician who has made strengthening democracy a central theme of his administration, President Joe Biden’s courtship of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi underscores the tension between his campaign principles and the realities of being president.\n\nBiden’s administration has accused India’s government of participating in unlawful and arbitrary killings, restricting freedom of speech and allowing violence against religious, racial and ethnic minorities.\n\nOrganizations that track democracy have downgraded India. Freedom House now rates it only partially free.\n\n“It's very awkward, and embarrassing even, to have the rhetorical emphasis on democracy for the foreign policy, while at the same time this critical partner is seen as backsliding,” said Irfan Nooruddin, a professor of Indian politics at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service.\n\nModi pressed on human rights\n\nProgressive Rep. Rashida Tlaib said she would boycott Modi’s address to Congress during the visit over his “long history of human rights abuses, anti-democratic actions, targeting Muslims & religious minorities, and censoring journalists.” She described the conduct in a tweet as “unacceptable.”\n\n“It’s shameful that Modi has been given a platform at our nation’s capital,” said Tlaib, D-Mich.\n\nDemocratic Reps. Cori Bush, of Missouri, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, also are protesting the event.\n\nThe White House said Biden would raise human rights questions with Modi when they speak privately. A spokesman stressed it is a topic Biden routinely addresses.\n\n“Certainly human rights is of concern to the United States, and it's a foundational element to President Biden's foreign policy,” White House national security strategic communications coordinator John Kirby said.\n\nA group of more than 70 lawmakers asked Biden in a letter Tuesday to “discuss the full range of issues” facing the two nations during the visit. They noted that “independent, credible reports reflect troubling signs in India” and told him that “friends can and should discuss their differences in an honest and forthright way.”\n\n“We think it's important that we have a strong relationship between India and the United States, regardless of who India's prime minister is, but we also think it's important that the president raise these human rights issues and make it clear that the institutions of democracy − free press, freedom of religion, a free judiciary, an independent judiciary − these are all things that ensure a democracy,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who was born in India, said in an interview. “And without a democracy, it's going to be much harder for the United States and India to have a long-term, strong relationship.”\n\nDiscrimination, harassment and erosion of trust\n\nTrust in India’s judiciary system is also eroding. Earlier this year, a court convicted one of Modi’s chief political opponents, Rahul Gandhi, of defamation for disparaging the surname \"Modi\" in a case that is viewed as highly political.\n\nIf the conviction stands, Gandhi, who highlighted India’s struggles with democracy during a recent trip to the U.S., will be barred from competing in India’s national elections next year.\n\nModi and his political party have increasingly used government institutions to target political opponents. Discriminatory policies against the Muslim population and harassment of journalists and government critics grew significantly under Modi, Freedom House president Michael Abramowitz said.\n\n“So it is still a democracy, as they say. It’s got a thriving election system. But it's these other policies that cause concern for Freedom House,” Abramowitz said.\n\nModi has not fielded questions at a news conference since he became prime minister. But the White House said he and Biden would speak with the media on Thursday.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman who co-chairs the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, said that the U.S. should be “candid” about freedom of press and human rights questions.\n\nBut the congressman, who said he plans to attend the state dinner, argued, “The imperfections in democracy should not prevent the alliance of democracies.”\n\nUkraine on the menu\n\nIndia has refused to denounce Russia’s war on Ukraine and has continued to buy Russian oil amid the conflict.\n\nThe United States has not been able to put meaningful pressure on India to join the U.S. and its allies in working to cripple Russia’s economy. And Modi’s government views itself as having a lot of leverage in the relationship, Nooruddin said, because of how focused the Biden administration has been on maintaining positive relations with the nation that it hopes can serve as a counterweight to China.\n\nThe war will be on the United States’ agenda during the meeting, the White House says, but the conversation is likely to focus on the importance of territorial sovereignty and the humanitarian assistance India has given Ukraine.\n\n“We haven't since the beginning of this war, nor are we going to start, browbeating or arm-twisting other nations about the way they're looking at this war in Ukraine,” Kirby told reporters Tuesday.\n\nOne way that Biden could indirectly create a further separation between Russia and India is by accelerating U.S. approvals of defense equipment for India, said Richard Rossow, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n“It won’t be something dramatic. The tilt that has been happening over the years, where India is tilting away from Russia as a primary weapons supplier, I think that will accelerate,” he said. “But you’re not going to have a cold, hard stop, and I don’t think this trip is going to trigger that.”\n\nEmerging superpower\n\nBiden has sought to deepen the United States’ security partnership with India through a group known as the Quad. It is part of his administration’s efforts to counter China’s global influence.\n\nWith a population of nearly 1.4 billion people, India will soon be the world’s third-largest economy, behind only China and the United States.\n\nRossow said India’s growing economy and competition between the U.S. and China are at the heart of Biden’s decision to roll out the red carpet for Modi, who attended a large rally in Texas with former President Donald Trump in an earlier visit to the U.S.\n\nModi held a reciprocal rally for Trump in 2020 when the former president visited India. He is expected to host Biden in September during the Group of 20 Summit. The two leaders also met a month ago in Japan.\n\n“You’re not going to see the big theatrics I think that you saw with the Trump administration,” Rossow said. “So maybe not the warmth and bombast that you saw in the previous administration but regular engagement.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/emmanuel-macron-white-house-visit", "title": "Emmanuel Macron arrives in DC at key moment in France-US ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron walked into a small holding room on the margins of the Global Fund conference in New York this fall, their aides had only allotted 10 minutes for the two men to briefly touch base.\n\nBut sitting in the cramped room at 538 Park Avenue with a handful of aides, the two leaders ignored repeated attempts by US and French officials to end the meeting and usher the two men to the ballroom where several heads of state were waiting to begin the conference. About 45 minutes later, they finally relented.\n\n“They just kept talking and talking and talking. And so you eventually had protocol people from both sides just continuing to step forward. I was actually wondering if they were about to physically grab them and drag them out of the room,” a senior administration official said, describing the meeting on the condition of anonymity. “I think if they had been left to their own devices, they probably would have sat there for another two hours and just kept talking.”\n\nThe September meeting typified the close working relationship that aides say has emerged between the two men. And it belied the fact that it fell almost exactly one year after French-American relations sunk to their lowest point in decades, with Macron taking the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Washington for consultations over a US-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multi-billion dollar defense contract.\n\nThose tumultuous weeks are now far from the minds of either men or their respective administrations as Macron touches down in Washington on Tuesday evening for an official state visit, the first time Biden has bestowed that honor on any leader since taking office nearly two years ago.\n\nThe visit will put on display the critical alliance and the increasingly close working relationship between the two men, brought even closer in the nine months since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February, according to US and French officials. And it will be an opportunity for the pair – who both place a premium on personal relationships as a tool of international diplomacy – to deepen their personal relationship as well, with a private dinner with their spouses on Wednesday night ahead of the lavish state dinner the following day.\n\nSaul Loeb/Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden and Macron have met several times on the sidelines of international conferences and speak regularly over the phone to coordinate the West’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – including at least seven one-on-one calls so far this year and a dozen joint calls with other leaders. During the midterm campaign, Biden frequently invoked an anecdote involving Macron to make his case about the importance of protecting democracy.\n\nAnd when Biden turned 80 earlier this month, Macron sent the US president a handwritten birthday card, a US and French official said, wishing Biden a happy birthday and congratulating him on his granddaughter’s wedding, which took place the same weekend.\n\nAbove all, senior administration officials indicated that France’s selection for Biden’s first state visit was intended to highlight the premium Biden has placed on the US core alliances, his view of the importance of democracies in a world being tested by rising autocracies and France’s central role in both of those principles – both as the US oldest ally and Macron’s starring role in its defining battles.\n\n“I mean, if you look at what’s going on in Ukraine, look at what’s going on in the Indo-Pacific and the tensions with China, France is really at the center of all those things,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications. “President Macron has been the dynamic leader inside the G7, particularly there in Europe. And so the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country to start with for state visits.”\n\nOther natural candidates to highlight the US core alliances in Europe have become less obvious choices. The United Kingdom has been riven by political turmoil and Germany became a lesser-known quantity on the international stage following the departure of longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel. Meanwhile, Macron is the longest-serving European leader within the G7 and has sought to establish himself as Europe’s preeminent head of state.\n\n“France has in many respects jumped to the head of the queue and become America’s go-to partner when it comes to advancing transatlantic cooperation,” said Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council. “And I think that’s in part because of Macron himself, who leans into Europe’s role in the world and who in comparison with most other European leaders is quite active and quite ambitious.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden (back to camera) shakes hands with French President Emmanuel Macron during the Global Fund Seventh Replenishment Conference in New York on September 21, 2022. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUS and French officials do not expect the visit to yield any major deliverables, but both sides see it as an opportunity for the two countries to deepen their partnership on a slew of global challenges, from the war in Ukraine to policy toward China and the challenges posed by Iran’s nuclear program. The two sides will also advance working group discussions which were launched in the wake of last year’s submarine affair to step up cooperation on space, cyberspace and energy issues.\n\n“We’re in an extremely strong place with France. There has been a tremendous convergence of our policy on all the big ticket items,” a senior administration official said.\n\nUkraine will be “front and center” in Biden and Macron’s discussions, the official said, from coordinating their efforts to supply Ukraine’s military, to continuing to punish Russia for its invasion and mitigating the economic and energy fallout on the West. Those discussions come as Europe braces for the stinging effects high energy costs and tight supply will have and as Ukraine’s recent battlefield advances have ratcheted European calls for negotiations with Russia.\n\nThe US and Europe’s policy in the Indo-Pacific and toward China is expected to be a close second, following Biden’s recent meeting with Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 in Indonesia and as Macron prepares to make a trip to Beijing early next year.\n\n“The two presidents are going to want to compare notes on that,” a senior administration official said. “Our views on China are not identical, but I think there is a strong view that we should be speaking from a common script in response to China.”\n\nWhile the US and France are closely aligned on both big ticket items, that’s not to say there aren’t also areas of disagreement and divergence. As a difficult winter approaches, calls in Europe for Ukraine to move toward negotiations have begun to grow louder and concerns are emerging about preserving Western unity as the war drags on. On China, Biden will look for Macron to link arms with him in confronting the country over its trade practices and military moves in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nPerhaps the biggest point of tension will be over billions of dollars in electric vehicle subsidies included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which applies only to those manufactured in North America. Macron has slammed the measure as protectionist and French officials said he intends to raise the issue in meetings with Biden and congressional leaders. The Biden administration has stood up a working group with the European Union to address the issue, but the text of the law limits the administration’s ability to act.\n\nA French flag flies alongside the US flag in front of the White House in preparation for this week's state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, in Washington, U.S., November 29, 2022. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nMacron’s forward-leaning stance on the issue underscores another dynamic of the Biden-Macron relationship: despite the closeness of the relationship and overarching agreement on top global issues, Macron has not been shy about carving out his own space on the global stage – including by pursuing and maintaining backchannel communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin – and publicly disagreeing with Biden at times.\n\nIn March, Macron warned against the risk of escalation after Biden called Putin a “butcher” who “cannot remain in power.” The next month, he warned again about an “escalation of words,” disagreeing with Biden’s decision to call Russian war crimes in Ukraine a genocide. And in October, Macron urged “prudence” after Biden warned of the risk of nuclear “Armageddon.”\n\nMacron’s approach has rankled US officials at times, but officials and experts say the free-wheeling nature of the comments point to a relationship with Biden – and the US – built on more than just personal connection.\n\nMacron had also secured the first state visit of President Donald Trump’s term in office, after pursuing a charm offensive that left some calling the relationship a “bromance.” But that “bromance” struggled to survive as Trump repeatedly cast doubt on the US commitment to the NATO alliance, leading to a war of words between the two men.\n\nNow, both sides know they have a partner fundamentally committed to the alliance – tactical and stylistic differences notwithstanding – particularly in the face of the war in Ukraine.\n\n“The irritants in the relationship are completely overwhelmed by partnership and solidarity,” said Kupchan, the former NSC senior European affairs director under President Barack Obama. “I think with Biden, (the French) know they have an Atlanticist. And they have someone who has transatlantic partnership in his DNA.”", "authors": ["Jeremy Diamond"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/06/donald-trump-foreign-leaders-gifts/3078693002/", "title": "From chess sets to model jets, foreign leaders lavish gifts on Trump ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Before President Donald Trump’s relationship with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went south, the northern neighbor presented him with a statue of a “male lion” carved from Ohio sandstone worth $450.\n\nAnd before Trump’s administration escalated trade tensions with Beijing by imposing tariffs on billions of dollars of goods, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave Trump a paper panel with five columns of calligraphy, valued at $14,400.\n\nThe artwork is among more than 80 gifts delivered to Trump and members of his family by foreign leaders during the president's first year in office and disclosed Wednesday in an annual State Department report. The gifts, valued at more than $140,000 in all, are turned over to the National Archives or other government agencies.\n\nThey include a portrait of a smiling Trump, sporting a red necktie, painted on mother-of-pearl panels from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas; a $935 fountain pen from Germany's Angela Merkel; and a map of the United States by 18th century French geographer Louis Brion de la Tour from French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe most expensive gift bestowed on the Trump family came from Xi, a dinnerware set that includes an image of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, worth $16,250. The two leaders met at the Florida property in 2017, and are expected to do so again in coming weeks to discuss a possible trade deal.\n\nAnother Trump building, Trump Tower in New York, was featured in a photo album presented by Poland's Andrzej Duda.\n\nHoracio Cartes, the former president of Paraguay, gave Trump a chess set worth $1,800. The crown prince of Bahrain gave the president a model jet fighter, made of gold-plated silver, complete with missiles and rockets, worth $4,850.\n\nPresidents and other federal officials are barred from receiving gifts from foreign governments under the Constitution unless approved by Congress – the same clause that has inspired lawsuits alleging Trump is accepting payments through his hotels.\n\nBut gifts of \"minimal value\" presented as a courtesy between heads of state are common. In those cases, a gift can be accepted on behalf of the United States. Like an awkward exchange on Christmas morning, the administration justifies accepting those gifts by declaring that \"non-acceptance would cause embarrassment to (the) donor and U.S. Government.\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who has played an active role in the administration’s foreign policy, received $12,362 in gifts. That’s far less than the value of gifts the president received, and also less than the nearly $15,000 in gifts to Trump's daughter and adviser, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner.\n\nThe most expensive gift to Pence was a rug valued at $3,200 from the president of Afghanistan.\n\nThe king of Jordan gave Kushner a $3,630 fountain pen with an 18-karat gold nib. A fountain pen received by Ivanka Trump from the Japanese foreign minister had a 14-karat gold nib and was valued at $1,180.\n\nTrump's predecessor, Barack Obama, received a bamboo bicycle valued at $1,060 from the Philippines in 2011 and a golf bag price priced at $7,750 from then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nPresidents and other officials may purchase a gift for market value.

Here's your crib sheet.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nTrump is in the United Kingdom for a three-day state visit. A state visit is one that formally comes at the invitation of the British monarch: Queen Elizabeth II. It means that there will be an emphasis on ritualized ceremony, including banquets at the queen’s lavish London pile Buckingham Palace, wreath-laying to honor Britain’s military dead, gun salutes fired from the Tower of London and other grand displays of decorum essentially showing through soft power how Britain can be the host with the most.\n\nStill, while the queen sent the invitation and will feature prominently in the visit along with other members of the royal family, she did so at the request of the British government, meaning it won’t be all testimonial readings and charming musical performances. There will be serious talks on defense, investment, security and trade.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nFor a start, while the queen has hosted 152 state visits since becoming monarch in 1952, and met 11 of 12 sitting U.S. presidents over the last 67 years – her majesty’s royal path never crossed with Lyndon B. Johnson – only two U.S. presidents have made state visits to Britain: George W. Bush in 2003 and Barack Obama in 2011. Trump is being accorded a special honor when he arrives June 3.\n\nHowever, the visit is important for reasons that go beyond ceremonial affairs. Political scientists say it’s about reaffirming the so-called special relationship between two of the world’s closest allies who have deep cultural, economic and political ties, but who haven’t always seen eye-to-eye since Trump came to power vowing to pursue a more unilateralist foreign policy. Areas of disagreement have included Trump’s Muslim travel ban, his talking down of the NATO military alliance and U.S. exits from the climate and Iran nuclear accords. There's also difference of opinion about China, in particular what type of relationship to maintain with Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Washington thinks the company is a massive national security threat; London has a more relaxed view.\n\nTech diplomacy: Trump signs executive order potentially banning Huawei equipment\n\nThe visit also comes as Britain is mired in a weeks-long process to pick a new prime minister after Theresa May said she would vacate the role on June 7 over her handling of Britain’s impending exit from the European Union, known as Brexit.\n\nTrump 'friend' Boris Johnson: U.S.-born politician favorite to replace Theresa May\n\n\"If we get a new prime minister who the president can relate to then things might run more smoothly, especially if May's successor allows us to crash out of the EU and comes begging for a trade deal with the USA,\" said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary, University of London, referring to the possibility of a \"no-deal\" Brexit.\n\nAhead of his arrival, Trump told British tabloid newspaper The Sun that he was backing U.S.-born politician Boris Johnson to be the next prime minister. He also said that his friend Nigel Farage should be involved in negotiations to leave the EU.\n\nWho's coming with Trump?\n\nAside from the normal retinue of senior advisers and administration officials, a large portion of the Trump family, according to the New York Times. The outlet has reported that along with First Lady Melania Trump, the president will fly over his children, including Donald Jr, 41; Ivanka, 37; Eric, 35; and Tiffany, 25. It is not yet known whether Trump’s youngest son Baron, 13, will also make the transatlantic trip. The White House would not comment on which members of Trump's family would be accompanying him.\n\nStill, if the Trump family does form part of the president's entourage they would be expected to attend the banquet dinner at Buckingham Palace on Monday evening. On the British side, the dinner will be attended by outgoing Prime Minister May, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Prominent British public figures and Americans living in Britain will also be there. The queen and Trump are both expected to make speeches at the start of the banquet.\n\nWhat will he be doing?\n\nIn addition to taking part in bilateral meetings with May, and the dinner banquet, there will be a private lunch with the queen; a visit to an exhibition showcasing items that Britain's foreign office has called of \"historical significance to the United States\"; tea with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall; a chance to inspect Britain’s military Guard of Honor; a tour of Westminster Abbey (famous site of many coronations and royal weddings); and a breakfast meeting with senior American and British business leaders.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump will participate in commemorations to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. This event will take place in Portsmouth, on Britain’s south coast. It will include a fly-past with 25 modern and historical aircraft. Since Trump is known to like a good parade and military fanfare, Wednesday should be a good day for him.\n\n\"I hope President Trump appreciates the full sweep of history when he visits ... Portsmouth ... that European unity is very much an American project; that Europeans' prosperity and security are interlinked with America’s ... and that this is a project that needs America’s support,\" said Heather Conley, an expert on foreign affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nWhat kind of reception can he expect?\n\nIn short: protests.\n\nOver half of Londoners are opposed to Trump's visit to Britain's capital,\n\naccording to a recent poll by research firm YouGov and Queen Mary, University of London. Although nationwide: 46% to 40% think the visit should go ahead.\n\nWhen Trump visited London last year as part of an ordinary working visit an estimated 250,000 people protested on the streets of central London. Anti-Trump activists who oppose his divisive policies from immigration to abortion rights are planning for similar numbers this time. There will be smaller protests around the country.\n\nAnd remember Trump baby? The phone-wielding, diaper-wearing inflatable that flew above London when Trump visited in July? The team behind it told USA TODAY that the giant orange blimp will again take to the skies, on Tuesday, in Parliament Square.\n\nBritish media have reported that Trump's three-day visit will cost British police and security services about $23 million to help keep him safe.\n\nWho's giving Trump the cold shoulder?\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan, who Trump has clashed with before, was the subject of two disparaging tweets by the U.S. president on Monday. It came after Khan, London's first Muslim mayor, wrote in an op-ed in British newspaper the Observer that it is \"un-British to roll out the red carpet for Donald Trump.\"\n\nTrump tweeted that Khan was \"a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.\"\n\n\"Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height,\" Trump added.\n\nPrince Harry will meet Trump at one of the planned lunches. But his wife, the Duchess of Sussex (Meghan Markle), will sit it out. Her name is not on any of the official itineraries. Markle may have decided she would rather stay at home with newborn son Archie. Or perhaps it's the man himself. In 2016, she called him \"misogynistic.\"\n\nTrump has denied calling Markle \"nasty\" despite an audio recording of his comments.\n\nThe president has also not been invited, unlike President Obama, to address Parliament. John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, who makes that decision, has said he is \"strongly opposed\" to Trump addressing British lawmakers.\n\n\"Before the imposition of the (Muslim travel ban) I would myself have been strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall,\" Bercow told British parliamentarians in 2017. \"After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall.\"\n\nBercow said that being invited to address Parliament was \"an earned honor.\"\n\nIn a speech in Washington last week, Bercow said that over the past two years \"nothing has happened since then to cause me to change my mind.\"\n\nWhat else is the president doing in Europe?\n\nOn Wednesday, he will fly to Ireland for a meeting with leader Leo Varadkar. The meeting will take place at Shannon Airport, not Trump's golf club and hotel in Doonbeg, in County Clare, which he will visit later the same day. The White House said that the two leaders will discuss \"a range of bilateral issues\" and \"shared international interests and priorities.\" Translation: Trump wants to play golf in his family's ancestral homeland.\n\nScottish neighbors of Trump golf course: Trump's a bully who uses unsavory tactics\n\nThe next day, Trump will travel to France for further D-Day commemorations in Normandy. He will visit the Normandy American Cemetery, established by the U.S. First Army in 1944. It is the first American cemetery on European soil and contains the graves of 9,380 American military dead, most of whom lost their lives in D-Day landings.\n\nWhile in France, Trump will also hold talks with French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron and Trump have enjoyed a \"bromance\" of sorts, filled with awkward embraces, macho handshake and military parades. They also regularly attack each others' politics – Macron for his centrism, Trump for his nationalism – in tweets and speeches.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/12/01/biden-macron-state-dinner-white-house-welcomes-france-celebrities/10804791002/", "title": "Biden, Macron state dinner: White House welcomes France, celebrities", "text": "It's taken longer than usual, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it's finally here: Nearly two years after assuming office, President Joe Biden's first state dinner, honoring France, took place Thursday at the White House, giving first lady Jill Biden a chance to show off her hostess skills for America's oldest ally.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and his first lady, Brigitte Macron, joined the Bidens, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff and more than 300 guests in a pavilion on the South Lawn for a dinner that Jill Biden described as \"an expression of welcome and friendship.\"\n\n\"It's a way to connect through a language that transcends words,\" she said at a media preview of the dinner details on Wednesday.\n\nHere's what to know as Biden hosts Macron Thursday for the president's first state dinner\n\nThe Bidens greeted the Macrons at the North Portico; Jill Biden wore a black sparkling Oscar da la Renta dress, co-designers Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim confirmed to the Washington Post. Brigitte Macron dazzled in a high-necked ivory dress by Louis Vuitton.\n\nNeed a news break?

Others guests included French fashion designer Christian Louboutin, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, Apple CEO Tim Cook, \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert and singer John Legend.\n\nGrammy-wining musician Jon Batiste shared his excitement to perform at the black-tie dinner, telling reporters, \"It's going to be fire.\"\n\nState dinners at the White House are typically elaborate set pieces (although they don't compare with those at Buckingham Palace), beginning with a formal arrival ceremony, a press conference between the two leaders, a joint engagement for the spouses and the evening arrival of powerful and/or famous guests dressed to the glittery nines. But no tiaras.\n\nEven though these affairs usually follow firm protocol, the Bidens were keen to ensure that everyone had a good time, said White House Social Secretary Carlos Elizondo.\n\n\"This state dinner will not only reflect the shared colors, history and values of the United States and France; it also shows the warmth and heart of our first lady and this White House,\" he said during a media preview with the first lady.\n\nBiden said she learned her hostess philosophy from her mother, who \"made every dinner a special occasion,\" even if they were only eating fish sticks from the freezer.\n\n\"She would bring out the china, put fresh flowers on the table and light candles,\" she said. \"And I learned that setting a table can be an act of love. And once I had my own family, I did my best to keep that tradition alive.\"\n\nBiden and her East Wing team of party planers, including Elizondo, Executive Chef Cris Comerford, Executive Pastry Chef Susie Morrison and New York event planning firm Fête, appeared to have gone out of their way to make it a dinner to remember.\n\n\"The design of this dinner was inspired by the shared colors of our flags – red, white and blue – and our common values: liberty and democracy, equality and fellowship,\" Biden told reporters at the preview. \"These form the bedrock upon which our enduring friendship was built.\"\n\nThe pavilion was fully enclosed, all glass and vinyl and with a floor. Guests were taken from an opening reception in the house to the pavilion in heated trollies. \"We're not gonna have people walk down in their stilettos,\" Elizondo said.\n\nEverything about the design of the dinner, from the images on the pavilion walls to the chandeliers above and the dishes and displays on the tables, are \"symbols and celebrations of the many ties that bind our nations together,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Our hope is that the end result will be a night that balances the beauty of our friendship with the seriousness of our purpose. And we hope that French citizens everywhere feel the warmth of our welcome.\"\n\nShe said Batiste was chosen as the entertainer for the evening for reasons including that he grew up in New Orleans, a city shaped by both French and American culture. He was slated to perform a variety of musical selections accompanied by his father, Michael Batiste, and “The President’s Own” United States Marine Band, and the Army and Air Force Strolling Strings.\n\nThe menu, as usual, was American and, as usual, sounds mouthwatering, including butter-poached Maine lobster with American caviar, calotte of beef, and sunchoke and creamed watercress.\n\nBiden said she was especially pleased about featuring American cheeses for the cheese course (the French being famous as masters of cheese), including Rogue River Blue, the champion of the 2019 World Cheese Awards. In fact, Comerford said her French counterparts tipped her about Rogue River Blue during a trip to France a few years back.\n\nDessert was an orange chiffon cake with roasted pears with citrus sauce and crème fraiche ice cream. The sparkling wines were American but served in French-made glasses.\n\nThe table flowers featured roses, the official flower of the American national capital, and irises, the official flower of France. The deep pink roses are American Beauties, bred in France and brought to the U.S. almost two centuries ago.\n\nThe china used was white with gold designs and it's rented because, Elizondo says, the White House curators are leery of taking Presidential White House China outside of the house for fear of breakage.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty, a colossal gift from France in the 19th century, was the backdrop for the president's toast. The oak tree, the countries' shared national tree, was included in the décor via elements of wood and oak tones in the chairs and wall paneling. And naturally there were fleur-de-lis, woven into graphical elements in the room, mixed in with French, Art-Nouveau stained glass.\n\nBiden said she and the president are well acquainted with the Macrons, who were last fêted at a White House state dinner in 2018 by former President Donald Trump. When she went to Japan to support Team USA at the Olympics last summer, she cheered alongside President Macron during the three-on-three women’s basketball match, even though they were rooting for different teams.\n\n\"There was a camaraderie in the shared love we had for our teams,\" she said. \"And I got to know Mrs. Macron in Rome (in 2021), where we instantly clicked as educators.\"\n\n\"And now, we are so glad to welcome them to the White House as the first couple of our oldest ally: France,\" she said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the first ladies visited Planet Word, a new interactive museum in Washington focused on words and language and how they connect people.

They also participated in a bilingual poetry reading.\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers and Hannah Yasharoff, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/politics/joe-biden-consequential-week", "title": "Joe Biden's hugely consequential Covid isolation | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nA fatigued, runny-nosed President Joe Biden entered Covid solitude on July 21 with his legislative agenda stalled, a standoff brewing with the House speaker and an unfinished plan to kill the world’s top terrorist with a drone.\n\nMore than two weeks later, Biden’s second stint in isolation appears to be ending, with his agenda suddenly revived, tensions with China dramatically ratcheted up and the terrorist dead.\n\nThe two-plus weeks Biden has spent with just his German Shepherd for company have proved some of the weightiest of his presidency, with his once-bleak legislative fortunes enjoying a surprise turnabout and his foreign policy shaken by events across the globe.\n\nEven some White House staffers said they felt a certain degree of whiplash, and Biden himself has mused to confidants at the sudden turn of events.\n\n“It’s been an extraordinary few days for the nation,” he told a virtual gathering of Democrats on Wednesday.\n\nLeft unsaid was how extraordinary those days had been for Biden himself, who oversaw almost all of it from the White House residence, isolating alone with only a bare-bones, in-person staff.\n\nThe brutal months that came before had lent the Biden presidency a sense of gloom, fueled by high prices, abysmal approval numbers and swirling questions about the President’s ability to lead. Many problems – like a growing outbreak of monkeypox, the war in Ukraine and shortages of baby formula – still persist, and a new crisis is emerging with China. Democrats running for office this year are still putting distance between themselves and the President.\n\nYet Biden and his allies are now enthused at the string of victories, which includes passage of major pieces of legislation, a long-sought agreement on a climate and taxation bill, a steady decline in the price of gasoline and a surge in hiring. A primary election this week in Kansas also gave Democrats new hope for the midterms.\n\nBiden, who tested negative for Covid-19 on Saturday, is preparing a victory lap of sorts, with major White House bill signings scheduled for several days next week in the Rose Garden – the type of ceremony that had eluded him for much of the past year – once he leaves isolation, pending a second negative test.\n\nMonday, July 25\n\nWhen Biden’s top Cabinet officials and national security advisers met with him on his fourth day of Covid isolation, the President’s nose had mostly stopped running. His voice seemed less raspy.\n\nAnd he had some questions.\n\nThe team had come prepared with a final intelligence assessment showing the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was living on the third floor of a safe-house in an upscale neighborhood of Kabul. A plan was nearly ready for the CIA to take him out with a Hellfire missile when he stepped onto his balcony.\n\nBut Biden wanted to know what lay behind the windows and door to the small outdoor patio. He asked about the layout of the rooms near where his team was proposing Zawahiri be killed. And were there any other options that would reduce the potential for civilian casualties?\n\nHe’d already spent time examining a small-scale model of the house that intelligence officials constructed and carried to the White House Situation Room in a worn wooden box. But he still needed to be convinced the mission wouldn’t come with collateral damage.\n\nThe meeting went on for several hours, one official said. Biden “pressed at a granular level,” another senior administration official added.\n\nThe meeting concluded with Biden going through each of his top advisers and asking their recommendation. Eleven years ago, during a similar go-around-the-table before the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, Biden told then-President Barack Obama to hold off.\n\nThis time, Biden heard no opposition. And he authorized the strike.\n\nWednesday, July 27\n\nAt 9:12 a.m. ET, Biden swiped his nose with a cotton swab and hoped for the best. It was officially his sixth day isolating with Covid-19. His symptoms had disappeared. He’d started working out again in the White House gym.\n\nWorking mostly from the second-floor Treaty Room, an enormous oil painting of President William McKinley looking on, Biden had been going stir crazy during his isolation. The strike he’d authorized two days earlier was still in the works as operatives waited for the right moment.\n\nPresident Joe Biden removes his face mask as he arrives to speak about the economy during a meeting with CEOs in the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington, Thursday, July 28, 2022. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Susan Walsh/AP\n\nHe’d taken to strolling out to the White House balcony to wave at visitors below.\n\nFifteen minutes later, only one pink line showed up on the Abbot rapid Covid-19 test: negative. Biden was thrilled. He joked his aides might be less so.\n\n“As I was walking out, I thought I heard a rumbling in my staff saying, ‘Oh, he’s back,’” he joked in the Rose Garden, buoyant at successfully weathering the virus that he’d spent more than two years trying to avoid.\n\nIt turned out beating Covid – or at least the initial bout – was not the biggest surprise that Wednesday. As Biden was returning to work in the Oval Office, a plan was being finalized on Capitol Hill that could amount to a dramatic reversal of fortune for a domestic agenda many had left for dead.\n\nStruck in total secret between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, the chamber’s most moderate Democrat, the climate and taxation bill came as a surprise to many inside the White House, though some officials had a general awareness the two men had restarted talks.\n\n“They were basically kept apprised of what was going on to a certain extent,” Manchin would tell reporters.\n\nWhen Biden learned the men had struck an agreement that afternoon, he placed a phone call to Manchin – who was isolating himself in the mountains of West Virginia following a Covid diagnosis – for their first formal talks about the President’s agenda since December.\n\nGathered in the dining room adjacent to the Oval Office for the first time in seven days with members of his staff — all masked just in case Biden’s Covid came back — the President turned on the television to watch another long-stalled piece of legislation pass the Senate. The bill investing in domestic computer chip production and scientific research was meant to bolster competitiveness with China.\n\nIt was China that was quickly becoming Biden’s next problem.\n\nThursday, July 28\n\nSitting behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, an open binder and stacks of loose briefing cards strewn in front of him, Biden had a message for Chinese President Xi Jinping: Nancy Pelosi would decide on her own whether to visit Taiwan.\n\nAlready, her potential visit was drawing fierce recrimination from Beijing and warnings from Chinese officials to other members of Congress not to join her.\n\nA day before he tested positive for Covid, Biden had informed reporters the military didn’t think it was a good moment for the woman who’s second in line to the US presidency to visit the self-governing island.\n\nHis defense secretary had spoken personally to the speaker to provide his assessment of the security situation.\n\nAnd two weeks earlier, the prospect of Pelosi’s visit arose in a meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Chinese counterpart in Bali, according to a senior State Department official.\n\nSitting in the Oval Office for the marathon two-hour 17-minute phone call, Biden listened carefully as an interpreter translated a warning from Xi: “If you play with fire, you get burned.”\n\nMembers of his team inside the room – Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, deputy national security adviser Jon Finer, the NSC Asia Coordinator Kurt Campbell and Senior Director Laura Rosenberger – weren’t surprised at the rhetoric. Xi had used similar turns of phrase on earlier phone calls.\n\nAs the call was concluding, Biden and Xi remarked at how much work they had created for their teams, a senior administration official said.\n\nSaturday, July 30\n\nAfter 11 days without leaving the White House, Biden was ready to break free. His home in Delaware – and his wife, whom he hadn’t seen in more than a week – were beckoning.\n\nThe rapid tests he’d been taking daily had all come back negative. He was back to his regular schedule in the gym. And he was planning a surprise visit to Capitol Hill, where protesters had been gathering after Republicans blocked a bill that would dramatically expand government benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.\n\nSo, the news delivered by the White House medical team was less than welcome: “By the way,” Biden recounted being told, “it’s back.”\n\nA rebound infection was always viewed by Biden’s physician as a possibility, given similar incidents among those who took the antiviral drug Paxlovid. Beyond a cough, Biden’s symptoms never returned.\n\nBut it foiled his plans to escape the White House, a building he’d already come to view as a gilded cage, even before he was stuck there alone for more than two weeks.\n\nBiden dispatched his Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough with pizzas for the protesters at the Capitol and spoke to them on FaceTime.\n\n“I’ll tell you what, as long as I have a breath in me, I’m going to fight to get this done. As long as I have a breath in me,” he told them.\n\nWhile he was on FaceTime on the Truman Balcony, his team in the Situation Room was determining conditions were right for the strike on Zawahiri. Biden was informed as the sun was setting that the mission was underway. Twelve minutes before 10 p.m. ET, Zawahiri was dead.\n\nMonday, August 1\n\nThe dry cough was back. And Biden was staring down the possibility of a brand-new crisis.\n\nPelosi was hours from arriving in Taiwan, where the island’s leadership was preparing a lavish welcome. China had conducted live-fire exercises over the weekend on short notice, a sign of their extreme displeasure.\n\nAt the White House, national security officials saw indications that Beijing was positioning itself for further provocations, including firing missiles and sending fighter jets across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nAfter working over the previous weeks to apprise Pelosi of the risks of visiting Taiwan, including in briefings from Pentagon and other administration officials, there was a recognition by Monday she wouldn’t be scrapping the stop.\n\nBiden did not believe it was his place to tell Pelosi she should not go, and the two never spoke about it. He had avoided commenting publicly about her trip at all since his initial statement on July 21. At a certain point, administration officials determined it would be more damaging to be seen as against the trip than to have her go, whatever risks that entailed.\n\nIn any case, Biden was focused on another matter: announcing the death of Zawahiri. By Monday, officials were certain the man struck by two Hellfire missiles in Kabul on Saturday night was, in fact, the terror leader.\n\nThey didn’t have DNA test results, instead relying on visual confirmation. One official said they would never have Biden address the nation unless the identification was 100% certain.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks from the Blue Room Balcony of the White House Monday, Aug. 1, 2022, in Washington, as he announces that a U.S. airstrike killed al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri in Afghanistan.

Biden once hoped to harness it in Michigan, planning a visit there for Tuesday to sign the China competitiveness bill.\n\nPresident Joe Biden appears on screen as he listens to SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, fourth from right, speak during a virtual meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, July 26, 2022.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Susan Walsh/AP\n\nThe trip got pulled down when Biden’s rebound case emerged. And while he met with semiconductor producers virtually instead, there is open fretting among some Democrats that his persistent struggle in selling his accomplishments will hamper any upside to his recent victories.\n\nDemocrats anxiously awaiting their fate in November’s midterms saw a glimmer of optimism that night when Kansas voters overwhelming rejected a measure that would have removed abortion right protections from the state constitution. Biden, whom activists accused of being caught flat-footed by the US Supreme Court’s decision to reverse Roe v. Wade, seized on the result almost immediately.\n\nYet of all the issues pending in Washington, it was the veterans bill that was the most personal to the President. He has long suspected his son Beau’s fatal cancer was linked to burn pit exposure in Iraq.\n\nWhen he watched the vote finally pass the Senate on Tuesday evening from the Treaty Room, Beau’s memory was palpable. Family photos, including from Beau’s childhood, line the wooden shelves where the television sits.\n\nAs Biden watched the vote pass, he pumped his right fist. In his left hand, he was clutching a baseball cap from the Beau Biden Foundation.\n\nThursday, August 4\n\nThe long huddle on the Senate floor was drawing attention. Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema – the Arizona Democrat who was a last remaining holdout on the climate and tax bill – sat and talked at length, Manchin gesturing and laughing as Sinema spoke.\n\nNeither revealed details of their talk. But a few hours later, as a thunderstorm ranged outside the White House, Sinema broke her week-long silence on the bill: She would support it after tweaks to some of the tax provisions.\n\nFILE - Sen.

Scott Applewhite, File) J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe long-stalled plan was finally headed for votes. Yet if the year-long saga of Biden’s agenda seemed to be resolving itself, the standoff with China prompted by Pelosi’s 17-hour visit to Taiwan was worsening.\n\nBeijing had sent more of its warships and planes near Taiwan. And at the White House, the Chinese ambassador to Washington had been brought in for a formal protest. Campbell, the NSC Asia coordinator, condemned the escalations during a tense meeting.\n\nFriday, August 5\n\nThe cough was mostly gone. The five-day isolation period was up. And after 16 days without leaving the White House, Biden hoped a surprisingly strong employment report – 528,000 jobs added in July – might be the perfect opportunity to finally break his isolation.\n\nAfter all, strong hiring has been the White House’s strongest bulwark against recession fears. Aides made initial preparations to turn a virtual event in the afternoon into an in-person affair.\n\nBut the test was still positive.\n\nSaturday, August 6\n\nAs the Senate appeared on track to advance Democrats’ climate and tax bill, the White House announced that Biden had tested negative for Covid-19.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/22/onpolitics-biden-state-dinner-modi/70347246007/", "title": "OnPolitics: Biden to host lavish state dinner for Modi.

Nvidia also issued strong guidance based on expectations AI spending will stay high, but its gross margin forecast, or the percent of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of production, disappointed.\n\nLike many other companies that previously reported quarterly earnings, tariffs remain a wildcard for Nvidia, said Colette Kress, the company's chief financial officer, during last night's earnings conference call. Nvidia shares ended down about 8.5%.\n\nThe broad S&P 500 fell 1.59%, or 94.49 points, to 5,861.57, cementing the index into negative territory for the week and month with one trading day left. The blue-chip Dow dipped 0.45%, or 193.62 points, to 43,239.50; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.78%, or 530.85 points, to 18,544.42, pulled down by Nvidia. The benchmark 10-year yield rose to 4.269%.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump slapped a 25% tariff on the European Union and confirmed on Thursday morning Mexico and Canada would face a 25% levy on March 4. He also said China would get an additional 10% tax on that day.\n\nTrump's tough tariff talk is creating a lot of uncertainty in the markets, which is keeping investors sidelined, analysts said.\n\nEconomic worries and inflation\n\nInvestors also remain skittish about the health of the U.S. economy and whether inflation is still falling after a spate of weak economic data and January's hotter-than-expected consumer price index.\n\nU.S. weekly jobless claims rose by 22,000 to 242,000 in the latest week from the prior week's upwardly revised number, the Labor Department said Thursday. That was higher than the Dow Jones estimate for 225,000 and in line with other recent soft economic data, including lower consumer sentiment and confidence and disappointing retail sales.\n\nOn Friday morning, investors will see the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge used to determine interest rate policy. The personal consumption expenditures price index is expected to drop to 2.6% in January from December's 2.8%, according to FactSet’s consensus estimates. That's going in the right direction but still above the Fed's 2% goal, and many economists fear inflation could reverse course later this year if Trump implements all his tariff threats. All of this will keep Fed rate cuts on hold for a while, they said.\n\nOil prices rose after Trump said the U.S. is terminating this week a permit for energy giant Chevron to pump and export Venezuelan oil. The permit was set to be renewed on Saturday and over time, has become responsible for roughly a quarter of Venezuela’s oil production. Oil was last up 2.2% to $70.13.\n\nCompany news\n\nBesides Nvidia, investors had other corporate news to chew on. It includes:\n\nSalesforce.com said profits during the last three months of the year rose but the software company's sales outlook missed analysts' forecasts. Shares slid 4%.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery stock jumped 4.76% after the entertainment company said it expects streaming profits to double this year.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line predicted occupancy would decline 3% this year while expenses rise. That warning sent shares down 5.31% despite strong results in the final months of the year.\n\nOnline marketplace eBay's revenue forecast was less than analysts' expectations, and its quarterly profit fell. Shares lost 8.19%.\n\nSnowflake topped quarterly earnings estimates and forecast strong revenue growth in the current quarter. Shares of the software company rallied 4.5%.\n\nModerna stock dropped 7.42% after a report said U.S. health officials are reevaluating a $590 million contract that was awarded to the drugmaker to develop a bird flu vaccine.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin prices rebounded, attracting some buyers after the digital unit fell below some key psychologocal milestones like $90,000 and $88,000, but had dipped by the end of the day.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has agreed to drop a lawsuit against Consensys Software, which offers the popular crypto wallet MetaMask. It's seen as another sign of the more lax regulation the crypto industry might expect from Trump's administration.\n\nReports also noted institutional interest in bitcoin is picking up. According to the latest quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones nearly doubled his stake in the iShares Bitcoin Trust to 8.1 million shares from 4.4 million shares. As of mid-February, he had 4.5% of his $9 billion portfolio invested in this spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nInstitutional interest typically means large amounts of money flowing from large organizations like pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and investment banks. It is sometimes seen as \"the smart money.\"\n\nBitcoin was last down 0.23% at $83,949.44.\n\nThe story was updated with new information.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Here's how to reduce the sting | CNN Business", "text": "Editor’s Note: This is an updated version of an article that first published on August 17, 2022.\n\nEven before the crypto exchange FTX imploded this week, shaking the foundation of the digital asset world, crypto investors had been having a volatile, loss-inducing year. They watched the price of their digital assets plummet, then recover somewhat, then fall again.\n\nBitcoin, for example, is now down about 65% year-to-date, and more than 75% off its all-time high.\n\nIf you bought a cryptocurrency when it was on the rise and sold your holding this year – or are considering doing so – there are at least a couple of ways you may be able to reduce the sting of your loss.\n\nUsing a loss to your advantage\n\nYou can use a capital loss in crypto to offset any capital gain you’ve realized this year – even if it comes from the sale of another security or another property, such as a stock or a house.\n\nFor example, say you bought bitcoin at $50,000 in February 2021, then sold it in mid-August of this year at $24,000, you’d have a long-term capital loss of $26,000, because you held the investment for more than a year.\n\nThen say you also booked a $10,000 capital gain by selling a long-held stock in a taxable brokerage account (i.e., not a tax-deferred account like a 401(k) or IRA).\n\nYou can fully offset the tax owed on your $10,000 capital gain with $10,000 of your capital losses on your 2022 tax return. In addition, you also can use your losses to offset the tax owed on up to $3,000 of your ordinary income this year.\n\nWhatever losses that you don’t use up this year, you can still use in future years. So in the example above, you would use half your capital losses this year ($13,000) to offset your $10,000 capital gain and $3,000 in income. Then you can carry forward the other half of your losses into future years. And if you have a year where you don’t have any gains to offset, you can still use $3,000 of your losses to offset taxes on $3,000 of your income.\n\nBut when you die, your losses will die with you for tax purposes. You can’t bequeath them for someone else to use. “Your heirs don’t inherit the losses,” said Larry Pon, a California-based certified public accountant and certified financial planner.\n\nWash-sale rules don’t apply to crypto … yet\n\nUnlike with stocks, you can choose to sell a losing crypto asset to claim the tax loss but then buy the very same asset again around the time of the sale.\n\nHere’s why: For tax purposes, crypto assets are classified as property, not securities. So while you can use capital losses from both types of assets to offset one’s gains, there is another tax rule that governs only securities and does not apply to crypto assets. At least not yet.\n\nIt’s called the wash-sale rule. The IRS will disallow any capital loss you claim on the sale of a stock or security if you repurchase it or something “substantially identical” to it within 30 days before or after the sale.\n\nThere is no comparable rule for crypto. “Although the IRS has not specifically addressed the area, most practitioners are of the view that the wash-sale rules generally do not apply to crypto. The IRS has stated that they treat virtual currency as property, while the wash-sale rules apply to stocks and securities,” said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting.\n\nSo if you book a loss but still believe that the same crypto asset holds promise long-term, you may repurchase it at any time. Even on the very same day you sell.\n\n“If you sell [a cryptocurrency] and rapidly buy it back, that will enable you to tax loss harvest without triggering the 30 days rule,” said Kell Canty, CEO of crypto tax software provider Ledgible.\n\nThis trading advantage over securities may not last forever. Lawmakers have already proposed expanding the wash-sale rule to cover crypto and other assets in proposed legislation. But the chances of that expansion happening this year are very low.\n\n“This rule may be changing in the future, but for 2022, crypto assets are not subject to the wash-sale rules,” Pon said.\n\nOne exception may be if you have indirect exposure to crypto assets, such as through an exchange-traded fund that trades on a stock exchange, such as the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO).\n\n“Trading on a stock exchange could permit the IRS to treat such crypto as a security and [therefore] subject to the wash-sale rules,” Luscombe said.", "authors": ["Jeanne Sahadi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/14/investing/joe-biden-stock-market", "title": "All of Joe Biden's stock market gains have evaporated | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nJoe Biden may not be as obsessed with the stock market as his predecessor was – at least not publicly. But this year’s turmoil on Wall Street has dealt the president a tough blow. The S&P 500 has now lost all of its gains since Biden was inaugurated last year.\n\nThe S&P 500, one of the broadest measures of the US stock market and the economy, is down 2.7% since January 20, 2021. Stocks fell into the red for the Biden era following Monday’s 3.9% market plunge.\n\nThe blue chip index, which includes companies such as tech giants Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA) and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) as top members, has plummeted 21% this year alone.\n\nIt’s a stark turnaround for the Biden stock market. The S&P 500 was up nearly 24% from Inauguration Day through the end of last year.\n\nBut the combination of surging oil and gas prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, broader inflation worries resulting from continued supply chain disruptions and fears about aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve have sent the market into a tailspin in 2022.\n\nMany experts are quick to point out that the stock market is not the overall economy. What happens on Wall Street doesn’t always directly impact people on Main Street, especially those who aren’t active investors.\n\nHowever, consumer confidence and sentiment measures often mirror the ups and downs of the markets. Even if people aren’t investing in stocks, they read about the chaos on Wall Street on their smartphones and see coverage of it on television.\n\nMany Americans also have exposure to the market through company 401(k) plans and other retirement accounts.\n\nThere has been a boom in interest in the market thanks to the epic rise — and subsequent fall — of meme stocks like GameStop and AMC. And some average investors have started to dabble in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which have recently endured an even more spectacular crash than most stocks.\n\nAll of this could pose problems for Biden and Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nBut if there is any consolation for Biden, the market implosion during the early stages of his presidency is not as bad as those experienced by some of his predecessors, according to data from CFRA Research chief investment strategist Sam Stovall.\n\nThe market plunged 16.5% in the first 510 days of Ronald Reagan’s presidency, which was also a period of historically high inflation. Stocks were down 25% in the early part of George W. Bush’s presidency, as the market was in the midst of the dot-com meltdown and struggled to recover in the aftermath of 9/11. But both Reagan and George W. Bush wound up being re-elected.\n\nMeanwhile, stocks soared more than 20% early in both George H.W. Bush’s and Donald Trump’s tenures in the Oval Office. Neither was elected to a second term.\n\nStill, the stock market fell about 3.4% at the onset of Jimmy Carter’s presidency, just slightly more that the current Biden drop. Carter also had to cope with high inflation and geopolitical concerns, with the Iran hostage crisis occurring late in the third year of his first — and only — term in office.", "authors": ["Paul R.

But for now, one way to benefit from the current market is to harvest some losses in the taxable portion of your portfolio – that is, in those investments you hold outside of tax-advantaged vehicles like 401(k)s and IRAs.\n\nSo-called “tax loss harvesting” can benefit you in a few ways: It can lower your investment and income taxes not just this year, but in future years, depending on how big of a loss you book.\n\nIt also can provide you a welcome opportunity to rebalance your portfolio.\n\n“It doesn’t cost anything and may save you some money too,” said North Carolina-based certified financial planner Dan Tobias.\n\nBut doing it right isn’t as easy as it sounds, so you may benefit from working with a financial adviser who has experience with tax loss harvesting.\n\nHow it works\n\nWhen you sell a stock, bond, mutual fund, ETF or even a cryptocurrency for less than you paid for it, you book a capital loss.\n\nThat loss can directly offset the tax on any realized capital gains you have plus up to $3,000 in ordinary income. If you book losses this year – and don’t take any gains – you can use the losses to take a deduction on up to $3,000 of your ordinary income and then carry forward any remaining losses for use in future years. There is no time limit on when you can apply them.\n\nFor example, say you bought something at $30,000 and sell it this year at $25,000. You have booked a $5,000 capital loss.\n\nIf you also sell an appreciated asset this year, your loss will directly offset up to $5,000 in capital gains. And if you book less than $5,000 in gains, you can offset all your gains and use the rest to offset your ordinary income. If you don’t have any gains, you can use $3,000 of your losses as a $3,000 deduction against your ordinary income and then carry forward the remaining $2,000 in losses for use in the future.\n\nFor many investors using $3,000 in losses to offset regular income taxes can be more financially beneficial than offsetting gains, said Indiana-based CFP Russ Ford, because their income tax rates are higher than their long-term capital gains rate, which is 15% for most investors. And for some it’s even 0% – specifically, people whose taxable income in 2022 is below $42,000 ($84,000 if married filing jointly). If you have a short-term gain, however – which applies to an investment you hold less than a year – your capital gains rate will be the same as your ordinary income tax rate.\n\nThe best way to harvest tax losses\n\nIdeally when you harvest a tax loss you will immediately reinvest the money from the sale into an asset that is similar but not “substantially identical” to maintain the same exposure to a sector or asset class.\n\n“You never know what you’re going to miss out on,” said Michigan-based certified public accountant and CFP Ashlee deSteiger.\n\nBut you have to be careful when buying something in tandem with your tax loss sale to avoid violating what’s called the wash-sale rule. If you run afoul of it, the IRS will disallow the benefits of your tax loss.\n\nThe wash-sale rule prohibits you from buying the same stock or security 30 days before or after your loss-sale date, said Virginia-based CPA and CFP Mike Powers.\n\nAlso important to note: The rule applies across all your accounts, not just the taxable portion of your portfolio. In other words, if you want to sell your IBM stock at a loss in your brokerage account, you can’t buy IBM stock through your 401(k) or IRA within that 60-day period.\n\n“The rule applies to the tax ID of the person, not the account,” deSteiger said.\n\nBut the wash-sale rule does not (yet) apply to tax losses on cryptocurrencies, which the IRS classifies as property. That may soon change, however, as lawmakers and the SEC are seeking to better regulate crypto trading. The Build Back Better bill, for example, included a provision that would subject crypto to the wash-sale rule.\n\nThe opportunity to rebalance\n\nSelling investments to take a capital loss also gives you a tax-free opportunity to rebalance your portfolio if you also sell holdings that have capital gains – perhaps because those gains have thrown off your asset allocation or the holding no longer serves your investing needs.\n\n“Harvesting losses can help you rebalance other positions that may have large unrealized gains, such as company stock or a mutual fund with a high expense ratio you’ve been looking to sell,” Powers said.", "authors": ["Jeanne Sahadi"], "publish_date": "2022/05/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/investing/premarket-trading-stocks", "title": "Premarket stocks: Is the bitcoin winter beginning to thaw out? | CNN ...", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nIt’s been a cold, hard crypto winter. But signs of a thaw, spurred on by global currency chaos, are beginning to appear.\n\nWhat’s going on: Bitcoin rose to its highest level in more than a week on Tuesday, gaining more than 5% as the British pound and other currencies took a beating against the ultra-strong dollar. The gains gave crypto bulls hope that bitcoin was becoming a safe haven asset, or one that acts as a hedge when stocks are falling.\n\nThen, around midday, the dollar grew in strength and bitcoin came crashing down again, wiping out all of its recent gains. Bitcoin slipped about another 1% Wednesday after the Bank of England tried to shore up UK debt.\n\nWhen the dollar is strong, “there are no safe havens,” warned Glen Goodman, eToro crypto consultant, on CoinDesk TV Tuesday.\n\nSome background: Bitcoin is struggling for direction: The digital currency has been swinging between $18,000 and $25,000 since mid-June after a massive crash wiped nearly $2 trillion away from the crypto market. It is currently down 60% year-to-date.\n\nThe coin soared through the Covid-era on the wings of near-zero interest rates, stimulus cash and a big influx of investors from large-scale institutions and reached a record high of nearly $70,000 in November.\n\nThen, central banks started raising rates to fight inflation, and the dollar strengthened significantly, seducing investors as the ultimate safe haven. At the same time, the economy began to sour and those new investors who still viewed bitcoin as a risky asset exited in droves. The crash caused a wave of bankruptcies among young companies like crypto trading platforms, Voyager and Celsius.\n\n“In the current macro climate, when you have inflation and a huge sell-off and major crypto projects that failed, people are going to pull back,” Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of the crypto exchange platform Gemini, told me in an interview earlier this month. “Bitcoin is still new so it’s still viewed by many as a risk-on asset. And as people pull risk off the table, bitcoin will suffer. But all assets are suffering, bitcoin isn’t in this alone.”\n\nThe silver lining: But even as bitcoin prices fall, investors see signs of a bottom.\n\nBen Gagnon, chief mining officer at Bitfarms sees anything below $20,000 as the price where fair-weather institutional investors retreat from the currency for good, which will help stabilize bitcoin’s current volatility and send it up an upward path.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, bitcoin was sitting below $19,000.\n\n“I’d be very surprised if we ended the year this low,” said Gagnon. “I think Bitcoin is going to start to recover now that it’s kind of shaken out of a lot of the excess.”\n\n“This is an interesting time,” said Chris Kline, COO and co-founder of Bitcoin IRA, a digital asset technology platform. “For the last eight months, bitcoin has been acting like a tech stock because there have been so many institutional investors in it.” As that money floods out, he said, things could change.\n\nIt’s a big TBD, but bitcoin advocates remain cautiously optimistic.\n\nJerome Powell weighs in on crypto\n\nCrypto advocates aren’t too happy with the Federal Reserve, and that sentiment appears to go both ways.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell urged for more regulation of digital assets on Tuesday morning at a Bank of France conference about the digitization of finance.\n\nWhile crypto bulls are likely to claim the decline in markets and other assets have caused digital currencies to plummet in value, Powell said he was worried about the opposite. The recent plunge in bitcoin prices, he said, could spread and cause broader financial turmoil. Digital currencies need to be regulated and have checks in place just like other market assets, he said.\n\n“There’s a real need for more appropriate regulation,” he said, especially as crypto “expands and starts to touch more retail customers.”\n\nOther central bankers weren’t as nuanced as Powell. “I don’t see any redeeming value” in cryptocurrencies, said the Singapore Monetary Authority’s Ravi Menon. “Their time for reckoning has come.”\n\nThe Federal Reserve does not regulate cryptocurrency in the United States, but it does monitor cryptocurrencies held by banks. The central bank is also considering the launch of a Central Bank Digital Currency, which is essentially a digital version of the dollar.\n\nThat currency isn’t coming anytime soon, said Powell. “We see this as a process of at least a couple of years, where we’re doing work and building public confidence in our analysis and in our ultimate conclusions, which as I say, we certainly haven’t reached yet.”\n\nConfused about crypto? So is Congress.\n\nRepresentatives Maxine Waters and Patrick McHenry have been attempting to negotiate a bill that would regulate the companies behind stablecoins – digital assets that are pegged to the dollar and used as an alternative to the high volatility of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\n\nThe bill would subject them to Federal Reserve oversight and reserve requirements to protect customers in case of insolvency– exactly the kind of regulation Fed Chair Powell urged for on Tuesday.\n\nBut the can keeps getting kicked down the road. That’s because Congress has been “balking at how to draft the bill text,” reports Politico. They’re having trouble wrapping their heads around how to regulate crypto.\n\n“I don’t think anybody would advise that somebody who’s unaware or unfamiliar with the industry is in a position to legislate and regulate,” Ben Gagnon, who engages with politicians to advocate for his crypto mining firm, Bitfarms, told me.\n\n“There have been some federal government initiatives by agencies to study bitcoin, but that process is largely nonexistent,’ he said.\n\nThe White House recently released its own plans for crypto regulation, but critics argued that they lacked real teeth. The Blockchain Association, one of the largest digital asset industry groups, said the Biden Administrations’ report lacked “substantive recommendations.”\n\nExecutive Director Kristin Smith said in a statement that the report focused too much on criticism of the industry and was light on policy. She called the reports “a missed opportunity to cement US crypto leadership.”\n\nUp next\n\nCintas (CTAS) and Paychex (PAYX) report earnings before the bell.\n\nUS pending home sales will be released at 10 a.m. ET.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2025/02/28/stock-market-open-friday-inflation-data-reaction/80763758007/", "title": "Stock market up on inflation data but trade and geopolitics weigh", "text": "U.S. stocks closed slightly higher after the latest inflation data produced no surprises, but all three major indexes remained losers for the month.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures prices paid index, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, increased 0.3% for the month and 2.5% on an annual basis in January. So-called core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.3% for the month and 2.6% year over year. The numbers all came in as expected with Dow Jones consensus estimates.\n\nThis was a huge relief after January's hotter-than-expected consumer price index. January's CPI hit a seven-month high, fanning worries that prices were reversing course before reaching the Federal Reserve's 2% goal.\n\nThe broad S&P 500 index closed up 1.59%, or 92.93 points, to 5,954.50; the blue-chip Dow gained 1.39%, or 601.41 points, to 43,840.91; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.63%, or 302.86 points, to 18,847.28. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slipped to 4.21%.\n\nStill, all three major stock indexes recorded losses on a monthly basis as investors worry President Donald Trump's tariff plans will spark trade wars that will hurt the economy and reignite inflation. China vowed retaliation after Trump slapped another 10% tariff on Chinese goods, effective March 4. On that same day next week, he said the U.S. would impose a 25% tax on European Union products.\n\nThey also worry about heightened geo-political risks. A Russia-Ukraine peace deal may be off the table after Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky publicly clashed at the White House. The pair was supposed to discuss a minerals deal that investors hoped would lead to ending the Ukraine-Russia war. Instead, the two argued, with Trump saying at one point “You either make a deal or we’re out. You’re gambling with World War III.”\n\nMonth to date, the Nasdaq has shed around 4% in February due largely due to a 3.5% drop this week. The index finished with the worst performing month since April 2024. The S&P 500 fell 1.45% for the month and the Dow lost 1.6%.\n\nCorporate news\n\nAutodesk said it'll cut 9% of its workforce and make facility reductions. Its stock fell 2.87%.\n\nMonster Beverage reported a pick up in overall and international sales, which boosted the energy drink maker's shares more than 5%.\n\nHP said it plans to layoff 1,000 to 2,000 employees as the computer maker reported weak fourth-quarter results and warned the first three months of the year would also be weak. It said prospective tariffs would be a drag on its quarterly results. HP stock dropped almost 7%.\n\nGoogle’s “People Operations,” its human relations division, is offering buyouts to U.S.-based employees while the company laid off some members of its cloud staff this week. Shares edged up 1%.\n\nElastic reported better-than-expected results during its fiscal third quarter. Shares of the data analytics company rallied almost 15%.\n\nRedfin said its loss per share in the last three months of the year was wider than analysts' forecasts. The real estate technology stock tumbled 12.7%.\n\nRocket Lab shares added 3.3% even after the company issued a bleak outlook.\n\nDell stock lost 4.7% after the PC maker forecast a decline in its adjusted gross margin rate for fiscal year 2026, hit by higher building costs for artificial intelligence servers.\n\nTesla shares saw their second worst monthly performance, even after a 4% gain on Friday. The stock’s worst ever month was December 2022, when it declined 37%. In February, shares lost about 27% and the company's valuation remains below $1 trillion. Earlier reports said the EV maker saw a 45% decline in Europe compared with gains by its rivals.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin continues to shrug off good news to trade lower.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance Thursday evening saying it does not deem most meme coins securities under U.S. federal law. Instead, it likened the meme coins to collectibles.\n\nThe guidance paves the way for exchange operators to list more meme coins without the risk of regulatory enforcement, experts said. Trump has his own meme coin.\n\nCME Group, the biggest U.S. futures exchange, said Friday it plans to list futures contracts on blockchain platform solana. Up until now, CME has only offered futures on bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies. It had refrained from listing futures on other digital currencies out of concern that regulators might consider them securities, subjecting them to more complex regulatory oversight. CME shares gained 1.57%.\n\nSeparately, the SEC dropped a lawsuit against Coinbase that sought to regulate the company as a stock exchange.\n\nThese are all in line with views the Trump administration would be light handed in regulating the crypto market.\n\nYet, the crypto sector can't shake off its downward trend. Bitcoin dropped to a three-month low, reversing gains made just after Trump's presidential win. The digital currency was last down 0.55% at $84,277.69.\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase rose 3.49% and Robinhood added 2.71%.\n\nThe story was updated with new information.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid to 4.161%.\n\nTrump's comments erased earlier optimism for a last-minute deal to avert the full tariffs on the two U.S. allies. On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged that Mexico proposed to match the U.S. tariffs on China to avoid being hit with Trump’s tariffs and urged Canada to follow suit.\n\n“We’ll see. The Mexican leadership has offered to do that,” Bessent said in an interview on CBS' Face The Nation. “We haven’t heard from the Canadians, but I think that would be a very good start.”\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also said on Sunday in a Fox News interview the tax that would be levied against Mexico and Canada on Tuesday was still “fluid,” meaning it could be less than the 25% that's been proposed.\n\nDue partly to tariff worries, Wall Street's three main indexes logged their first monthly decline this year in February, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq coming close to a 10% drop from its all-time high. The Nasdaq's 4% loss marked its worst month since April 2024.\n\nWeakening economic data are also causing jitters. A weak manufacturing report Monday could signal an even sharper economic contraction in the first three months of the year, according to the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker. The tracker updates after major economic reports and after the manufacturing report's release, it's pointing to a 2.8% annualized decline for the January-through-March period.\n\nLater this week, investors will see labor market data, including the key February jobs report on Friday.\n\nCorporate news\n\nCapri agreed to sell Versace to Prada for nearly $1.6 billion, Bloomberg reported. Shares of Capri, a luxury-fashion conglomerate, jumped 3.87%.\n\nIntel shares reversed its gained and ended down 4.17% after Reuters reported that chip designers Nvidia and Broadcom are both running tests on Intel’s 18A manufacturing process. If Nvidia and Broadcom decide the tests are satisfactory, they could end up becoming customers of Intel's chip-manufacturing business. Nvidia and Broadcom were down 8.69% and about 6%, respectively.\n\nKroger's chief executive was ousted after its board's probe into his personal conduct.

Here's why.", "text": "Cryptocurrencies gyrated sharply Tuesday, extending a recent run of wild swings.\n\nFor the first time since January, bitcoin — the world’s most popular digital coin — briefly dropped below $30,000, a key level that technical analysts monitor. It erased its gains for 2021 before recovering to trade at $32,481.93, according to CoinGecko, a crypto market data site.\n\nBitcoin at one point shed more than 10% to trade as low as $29,154.73, losing more than half its value since hitting a record high in April. That's after a tremendous performance in 2020, with the digital currency surging more than 300%.\n\nOther cryptos joined the sell-off before paring losses, with ethereum, the second-biggest digital currency by market value, slumping more than 5%. Now it's ticked up 0.7% over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe selling also spilled over to smaller coins like Dogecoin, a meme-inspired crypto that at one point tumbled more than 25% to erase all of its gains since April.

It came under pressure in May after tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has driven traders into frenzies by mentioning cryptos at times, said Tesla will stop using Bitcoin as a form of payment over concerns of the cryptocurrency's impact on fossil fuels.\n\nSince then, cryptos have gyrated as coins such as ethereum typically to move in tandem with bitcoin.\n\nIn early June, bitcoin fell further amid concerns of its use in the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack.\n\nBitcoin, for instance, briefly touched $40,000 last week and fell again Monday after China's central bank deepened a crackdown on cryptocurrencies. China's central bank said it ordered some banks and payment firms, including China Construction Bank and Alipay, to crack down further on cryptocurrency trading.\n\nBitcoin shed more than 10% on Monday, its largest one-day drop in over a month.\n\nHow much have Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin lost in value?\n\nWith Tuesday’s losses, bitcoin has slid more than 50% from its all-time high above $64,000 in mid-April. To be sure, bitcoin is still up more than 200% over the past 12 months.\n\nEthereum has shed nearly 57% from its all time high of $4,356.99 in May while Dogecoin has shed more than 70% since it touched a record of about 73 cents last month, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIs more pain to come?\n\nCryptos could be poised for further declines based on a closely watched indicator, according to technical analysts.\n\nOver the weekend, bitcoin formed a death cross, a chart pattern that signals the potential for a major sell-off. Bitcoin’s average price over the past 50 days fell below its 200-day moving average, which means there could be more pressure on the digital coin.\n\n\"Long-term bitcoin bulls are getting nervous as a break of $30,000 could see a tremendous amount of momentum selling,\" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign-exchange trading service OANDA, said in a recent note. \"Many traders have waited for one more push lower, which could see crypto traders wait for a plunge towards the $20,000-$25,000 area.\"\n\nElon Musk, Snoops Dogg and Mark Cuban love Dogecoin. Should you?: How to stay safe when investing in cryptocurrency\n\nSome analysts think the May sell-off in bitcoin weakened institutional demand, which is likely to keep prices under pressure in the near term.\n\n\"There is little doubt that the boom and bust dynamics of the past weeks represent a setback to the institutional adoption of crypto markets and in particular of Bitcoin and Ethereum,” JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a report earlier this month.\n\nStill, some are using the recent decline in bitcoin as a buying opportunity. On Monday, MicroStrategy, enterprise software company, said it scooped up an additional $489 million worth of bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 105,085 bitcoins.\n\nAre cryptos right for you?\n\nFirst-time investors should proceed with caution. Piling all of your nest egg into something as volatile as cryptocurrencies poses big risks to your retirement, experts say. Wealth managers and finance experts have long been skeptical of these speculative investments for amateur investors due to their extreme swings.\n\nIn 2013, bitcoin began trading around $13 and spiked to more than $1,000 by December. In late 2017, the digital token surged to nearly $20,000, before crashing to almost $3,000 the following year. What followed was a dizzying rise to above $64,000 in April 2021.\n\nDogecoin has seen similar booms and swoons. It has ridden a similar Reddit-driven wave as stocks like GameStop and AMC in recent months, accelerated by a series of tweets by Musk, who was pumping the cryptocurrency.\n\nCryptos are now in 401(k)s: Are they the right investment for your nest egg?\n\nEven with the latest declines, the sharp rise in the value of bitcoin earlier this year has some analysts worried about a potential bubble in the cryptocurrency market, with bitcoin's price – at one point – more than doubling since the start of 2021.\n\nAbout 81% of fund managers polled in a recent Bank of America survey in June said bitcoin was still a bubble. That’s up from about 75% of managers who said so in May.\n\n“While there's no guarantee that Bitcoin will recover this time, those who believe in its long-term future may well see this decline as an opportunity to invest more,” James Royal, analyst at Bankrate.com, said in a note.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency traders, especially individuals, need to know the risks of what they own,\" Royal added. \"In some cases, the risks could be a complete loss of their investment.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2021/08/11/bitcoin-crypto-investments-robinhood-dogecoin-nft-gen-z-millennials/5390611001/", "title": "Crypto FOMO: Millennials, gen Z face risks in Robinhood, bitcoin boom", "text": "Hamez Trezhnjeva became so enthralled with stocks and Dogecoin during the coronavirus pandemic last year that he decided to make day trading a full-time gig this summer.\n\nThe 27-year-old Albanian immigrant recently quit his job as a bartender at a French restaurant in Manhattan to spend more time trading on his phone.

Even Moody's stripping the U.S. of its top AAA rating last week did little to stop stocks from erasing an early loss on May 19 to end higher.\n\nInvestors shrugged off the downgrade because it \"doesn’t reveal anything new—the US fiscal trajectory has been unsustainable for some time,\" said Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James.\n\nHowever, the blue-chip Dow ended down 0.27%, or 114.83 points, to 42,677.24; the S&P 500 lost 0.39%, or 23.14 points, to 5,940.46; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 0.38%, or 72.75 points, to 19,142.71. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.479%.\n\nFocus shifts to tax cuts\n\nThough tariff worries may continue to linger, the big focus now is on tax cuts, some economists say.\n\nWith the tax cut bill making its way through Congress, \"we now need to explicitly include a large middle-class tax cut into our second-half 2025 and 2026 macro forecasts,\" said Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA. Assuming the tax cut bill is passed by the end of summer, he now expects an economy slowed early in the year by tariffs to return to \"above-trend growth later in the year.\"\n\nCorporate news\n\nMost companies have already reported quarterly results, but there remain a few that investors will keep an eye on.\n\nRetailer Home Depot's sales topped analysts' expectations and held onto its full-year guidance. Home Depot's chief financial officer said the home improvement chain has no plans to raise prices because of tariffs. That contrasts with Walmart, which last week said it expected its prices to increase soon because of tariffs, prompting President Donald Trump to say Walmart should \"eat the tariffs.\" Home Depot shares slipped 0.61%.\n\nAmer Sports shares jumped 19% after the company increased its 2025 revenue forecast.\n\nViking Holdings' results in the first three months of the year topped analysts' forecasts. However, the company said its fiscal year 2026 is only 37% booked as of the end of the first quarter. That's down two percentage points from the same time last year.

The dictionary has selected \"parasocial\" for its 2025 Word of the Year.\n\nThe pick, in part, stemmed from fans' reactions to one of the year's biggest moments in pop culture, Taylor Swift's engagement with football star Travis Kelce. The \"Life of a Showgirl\" singer's fandom, commonly known as the Swifties, has formed a deep interest in her romantic life, despite not knowing her in real life.\n\n\"Millions of fans related to Taylor Swift’s confessional lyrics about dating, heartbreak, and desire, leading to what psychologists describe as 'parasocial' bonds with stars,\" the news release stated.\n\nWhat does 'parasocial' mean?\n\nCambridge Dictionary defines \"parasocial\" as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know,\" according to a news release obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThe word \"parasocial\" has been around for decades, more specifically since the late 1950s, amid the expansion of television in people's homes and the growing connection with on-screen public figures, from news anchors to soap opera stars.\n\nElizabeth Perse, a professor emeritus of communication at the University of Delaware, told USA TODAY in 2021 that in a parasocial relationship, there is an \"illusion of friendship.\"\n\nCambridge Dictionary: Millions are engaged in 'parasocial' relationships\n\nIn 2025, the term is more relevant than ever with the rise of content creators and streamers who give fans access to their daily lives. In television, people have shown deep investment in storylines in popular shows like \"The Summer I Turned Pretty,\" according to the news release.\n\nIn the unscripted programming space, the contestants from \"Love Island USA,\" the summer dating series that has become a cultural phenomenon, have gained millions of followers online and launched influencer careers, with fans following their every move and drama postshow.\n\nCambridge Dictionary also pointed to an uptick in people developing parasocial relationships with artificial intelligence programs like ChatGPT, with some using the tools as their therapist or romantic partner. Some experts have expressed concerns about the growing trend.\n\n“Millions of people are engaged in parasocial relationships; many more are simply intrigued by their rise. The data reflects that, with the Cambridge Dictionary website seeing spikes in lookups for 'parasocial,'\" Cambridge Dictionary's Colin McIntosh said in the news release.\n\n\"The language around parasocial phenomena is evolving fast, as technology, society and culture shift and mutate: from celebrities to chatbots, parasocial trends are fascinating for those who are interested in the development of language,\" McIntosh continued.\n\nOther popular words this year\n\nLast month, Dictionary.com named the popular slang term, \"6-7,\" as its Word of the Year. \"6-7\" has an accompanying hand movement – moving the hands up and down, palms up like weighing two objects.\n\nThe phrase is popularly used by Gen Alpha. While some interpret the phrase to mean \"so-so\" or \"maybe this, maybe that,\" it is also used as an exclamation, according to a Dictionary.com.\n\nContributing: Elise Brisco, Greta Cross\n\nTaylor Ardrey is a news reporter for USA TODAY.

That was the day it was the Wordle answer, provoking frustration from non-American users unfamiliar with the term as they attempted to secure a win by guessing the word within the game’s six-guess limit.\n\n“Homer” is an informal American-English term for a home run in baseball, Cambridge Dictionary said in a news release Wednesday. Others might know it as the name of a Simpsons character or an ancient Greek poet.\n\n“Many players outside the US had not heard this word before,” added the news release. “Huge numbers of players expressed their frustration and annoyance on social media, but many also turned to the Cambridge Dictionary to find out more.”\n\n“Still angry about ‘homer,’” one person tweeted on May 31. “It’s been weeks now. Furious.”\n\nThe ‘Wordle effect’\n\nThere were several other American-English words that appeared on Wordle and later spiked in searches on the Cambridge Dictionary website – described by the dictionary’s news release as the “Wordle effect.”\n\nThe American spelling of “humor” saw increased traffic, with almost 30,000 searches on the day it was the Wordle answer, while more unusual words like “caulk” and “bayou” were also searched thousands of times.\n\nCambridge Dictionary’s choice for word of the year illustrates the popularity of a simple game that could be shared online when global pandemic restrictions limited social interactions for millions.\n\n“Perhaps it’s no wonder that people enjoy the focus and mental challenge of a simple word game that can be a shared experience with family and friends, whether they’re physically together or not, at a time of volatility and prolonged recovery from a global pandemic,” Wendalyn Nichols, from the Cambridge Dictionary, said in the release.\n\n“Even the complaints about the choice of words seem to be part of the fun.”\n\nAfter Wordle’s viral popularity, it was bought by the New York Times and drove the best ever quarter for net subscriber additions to its games sections, CEO Meredith Kopit Levien said in the earnings release in May.", "authors": ["Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/08/18/cambridge-dictionary-new-words-skibidi-delulu-meanings/85706666007/", "title": "Cambridge Dictionary's new words include 'skibidi.'

While some interpret the phrase to mean \"so-so\" or \"maybe this, maybe that,\" it is also used as an exclamation, according to a Dictionary.com news release.\n\n\"It’s part inside joke, part social signal and part performance,\" Steve Johnson, director of lexicography for the Dictionary Media Group at IXL Learning said in a news release. \"When people say it, they’re not just repeating a meme; they’re shouting a feeling.

Here's a look at how the slang got started.\n\nWhat is 'brain rot'? Learn this Gen Alpha slang\n\n'Group 7' is taking off on TikTok. And no, it doesn't have anything to do with '6-7.'\n\nWhere did '6-7' come from?\n\nThe origins of \"6-7\" tie back to the song \"Doot Doot,\" released by rapper Skrilla in December 2024. In the song, Skrilla sings, \"The way that switch, I know he dyin'. 6-7. I just bipped right on the highway.\" According to Know Your Meme, a database for memes and internet slang, some people say \"6-7\" in the song is in reference to 67th Street, perhaps in Philadelphia, where Skrilla is from. But the rapper had not confirmed the numbers' meaning as of Oct. 28.\n\nThe same day \"Doot Doot\" was released, TikTok user Matvii Grinblat posted a video of Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. In the video, Grinblat discusses Ball's height, which is 6-foot-7. At this point in the video, the lyric from \"Doot Doot\" in which Skrilla sings \"6-7\" is dubbed. As of Oct. 28, the TikTok video had 10.1 million views.\n\n\"6-7\" died down for a few weeks before exploding again with the \"67 Kid\" meme. In March, content creator Cam Wilder posted a YouTube video of an Amateur Athletic Union basketball game. In the video, an excited boy says \"6-7\" to the camera as he moves his hands like weighing two objects, palms up, moving his arms up and down, according to Know Your Meme. The phrase and hand movements have gained widespread traction among Gen Alpha.\n\nSee the aforementioned clip below at the 13:24-minute mark.\n\nAs \"6-7\" doesn't appear to be dying down anytime soon, teachers have begun implementing the slang into the classroom, sharing the results on social media.\n\nIn September, kindergarten teacher Sara James posted a TikTok video of her counting to 10 with her students. When she and the students get to 6 and 7, James does the popular hand movement as the children yell out in excitement.\n\n\"Hey, whatever they like, I'm down for,\" James wrote in the video's caption. \"As long as it keeps them engaged.\"\n\nWhat words were Dictionary.com Word of the Year finalists?\n\nThough \"6-7\" came out on top, here are some of the words that were in the run for Dictionary.com's 2025 Word of the Year:\n\nAgentic: Digital technology, like artificial intelligence, capable of acting independently to accomplish a goal or task; acting like a human agent, according to Dictionary.com\n\nDigital technology, like artificial intelligence, capable of acting independently to accomplish a goal or task; acting like a human agent, according to Dictionary.com Aura farming: The act of constantly trying to look cool, confident and unbothered to build \"aura moments,\" per Know Your Meme\n\nThe act of constantly trying to look cool, confident and unbothered to build \"aura moments,\" per Know Your Meme Gen Z stare: A blank, expressionless stare said to be commonly used by Generation Z used in a place of greeting or small talk, per Know Your Meme\n\nOvertourism: A situation in which too many tourists travel to a popular destination, causing the place to suffer negative environmental, economic and sociocultural impacts, according to Dictionary.com\n\nA situation in which too many tourists travel to a popular destination, causing the place to suffer negative environmental, economic and sociocultural impacts, according to Dictionary.com Tariff: An official list or table showing the duties or customs imposed by a government on imports or exports, according to Dictionary.com\n\nAn official list or table showing the duties or customs imposed by a government on imports or exports, according to Dictionary.com Tradwife: A married woman who chooses to be a homemaker as a primary occupation and adheres to traditional femininity and female gender roles, often associated with conservatism, according to Dictionary.com\n\nThis story has been updated to fix a typo.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

Did you spend it going into full goblin mode, trying to distract yourself from the general feeling of permacrisis brewing about you? Perhaps you had to stave off gaslighting of some sort, or learned more about the theatrical (literally) origins of the term.\n\nEvery year, the top arbiters of the English language tease out the most noteworthy, zeitgeist-y words to describe the current moment. Sometimes they’re fun, or educational. Sometimes, they reveal a world that’s gone, well, a little feral. Here’s quick look at this year’s offerings:\n\nOxford Languages: goblin mode\n\n“a type of behaviour which is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations.”\n\nThis term was popular on social media, and despite its negative implications, it isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes our inner goblin must be fed.\n\nCollins Dictionary: permacrisis\n\n“an extended period of instability and insecurity”\n\nCollins, a British dictionary, also noted nine other words of the year, most of which have a very “permacrisis” air to them, especially partygate, Kiev and lawfare. Oh, there’s also splooting: “the act of lying flat on the stomach with the legs stretched out.”\n\nMerriam-Webster: gaslighting\n\n“the act or practice of grossly misleading someone especially for one’s own advantage.”\n\nMerriam-Webster noted that searches for this term increased 1740% this year. Never an organization to shy away from the political side of things, MW specifically connected this term to the ubiquity of fake news and conspiracy theories.\n\nOther top words from MW this year were oligarch, omicron, codify and queen consort. Truly a mini tour of international news, from Roe v. Wade to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOh, but that’s not all! Choices from other international English language giants really add some color to the confusing tapestry that was 2022:\n\nCambridge Dictionary: homer\n\n“Short for home run: a point scored in baseball when you hit the ball, usually out of the playing field, and are able to run around all the bases at one time to the starting base”\n\nDon’t be fooled! You can draw a direct through-line between this common sports term and “goblin mode,” since interest in “homer” spiked after it was featured in the online game “Wordle” – a daily staple for goblins and wordsmiths everywhere. Non-American English speakers, however, were not pleased. (This is also an absolutely hilarious definition to American baseball fans, and hopefully we say a lot of sports things that give our British friends a chuckle in return.)\n\nMacquarie Dictionary (an Australian English dictionary): teal\n\n“A political candidate who holds generally ideologically moderate views, but who supports strong action regarding environmental and climate action policies, and the prioritising of integrity in politics”\n\nThe term comes from the fact that many of these candidates wore the color teal. Several such candidates prevailed in Australia’s federal elections this year. “Teal embodies the year that’s been, and truth-telling is the year that’s to come – let’s hope that’s the case,” the Macquarie committee said. “They’re both really important concepts, central to Australian culture and politics.”\n\nWhen normal words just won’t do\n\nSo, to recap: There were a lot of crises this year, political and otherwise, and they exhausted us in ways we could barely describe. In fact, sometimes life got so weird we literally needed to invent new words to describe it.\n\nSuch words are called “neologisms,” or words that are fairly new on the English language scene. These are the greener phrases some old-school lexiphiles often pooh-pooh, raising their hands to the sky in lament for what the language has become. Then, there are those like literary icon Stephen King, who see these young words and know exactly what to do with them.\n\n“When you come across a new word that just clicks, there’s something so comforting about the realization that someone else has had the same experience or thought,” says Martha Barnette, co-host of “A Way with Words,” a radio show and podcast.\n\nBarnette says new words are thrown at us all the time; others arise organically to serve a certain purpose that others do not.\n\n“The words that end up lasting are the ones that are useful, and that arise unobtrusively,” she says. “Some words are kind of imposed on us, from media or marketing, and those can be a flash in the pan.”\n\nFor the strictly rule abiding linguists among us, Barnette offers a reminder that dictionaries aren’t prescriptive – in that, they aren’t necessarily a record of how language should be used.\n\n“They’re a reflection of how our language is, of how people are talking and using it,” she says.\n\nInnumerable words that we use every day, like “laser,” “lonely” and “critic,” were once strange neologisms on the fringe of our usage. (Laser, of course, is actually an acronym, and we have Shakespeare to thank for “lonely” and, ironically, “critic.”) Neologisms can be formed from a word borrowed from another language, like “cliché;” shortening words, like “flu,” or smashing two words together. It’s also common for neologisms to stem from entertainment or media, like “gaslighting” does. Many are also portmanteaus, like “permacrisis.”\n\nTo truly come full circle, many of this year’s top words were once “sniglets” (which is, in and of itself, a neologism). A sniglet is a humorous term coined by comedian Rich Hall in the 1980s that describes “any word that doesn’t appear in the dictionary, but should.”\n\nSo congratulations, “splooting” and “goblin mode.” The sniglets have become promising neologisms, and now, for better or worse, they’re some of the most meaningful words of 2022. What does that say about us? Well, maybe we need a new word for that, too.", "authors": ["Aj Willingham"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2025/05/30/eclaircissement-meaning-national-spelling-bee-word/83944584007/", "title": "What does éclaircissement mean?

While its prefix may conjure images of the chocolate-drizzled pastries known as éclairs, the term has nothing to do with sweet treats.\n\nThe French word, first used in 1667 according to Merriam-Webster, means to clear up or clarify something, or to explain or enlighten.\n\nUsing the word in a sentence, you may say something like, \"The book provided an éclaircissement on the author's intentions\" or \"The detective's éclaircissement of the crime was crucial in solving the case.\"\n\nHow do you pronounce éclaircissement?\n\nWhen it comes to pronunciation, hearing someone do it right tends to be the way to go, so we suggest listening to the video below if you intend to incorporate the winning spelling bee word into your daily vocabulary.\n\nIf you're more of a sounding-it-out type of person, the phonetic spelling, according to Cambridge Dictionary, is eklɛʀsismɑ̃.\n\nWhat are previous winning spelling bee words?\n\nIn 2024, a tie-breaker between Zaki and the eventual winner, Bruhat Soma, entailed a lightning round in which Soma won by spelling 29 words correctly in 90 seconds, meaning there wasn't one singular winning word.\n\nIn 2023, 14-year-old Dev Shah correctly spelled psammophile, a plant or animal that lives in sandy areas, to become the 2023 champion.\n\nIn 2022, 14-year-old Harini Logan won the first-ever spell-off, again securing the title via the correct spelling of multiple words in rapid succession.\n\nIn 2021, 14-year-old Zaila Avant-garde spelled murraya, a genus of tropical trees, to win the title.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/11/02/uk-train-stabbing/87050478007/", "title": "Police say \"nothing to suggest\" UK train stabbing was terrorism", "text": "British police have arrested two men in connection with a mass stabbing that injured 11 people aboard a London-bound train.\n\nPolice responded to reports of knife attacks on a train from Doncaster, a city in the northeast of England, to London’s famous King’s Cross station at around 8 p.m. on Nov. 1. The train made an unscheduled stop in Huntingdon, a market town near the University of Cambridge, and police say they arrested two men on suspicion of attempted murder within minutes.\n\nTen people were taken to a nearby hospital by ambulance, and one other person later admitted themself to a hospital, according to police. Initial reports suggested nine people suffered life-threatening injuries, but four have since been released from the hospital. Two remain in critical condition.\n\nPassengers who spoke to the BBC recounted a bloody, gruesome scene. One passenger, Olly Foster, told the outlet he believed the stabbing was a Halloween prank when people initially began shouting. Soon, though, a man “covered in blood” walked into his train car and sat down.\n\n\"I put my hand on this chair ... and then I look at my hand, and it's covered in blood. And then I look at the chair, and there's blood all over the chair.

People in the train car used a bottle of whiskey to protect themselves against the attackers, Foster told the BBC.

These days, \"brain rot\" is largely used to describe the latter and can serve as an umbrella term for the words and phrases below.\n\nThe phrase \"You stole my brain rot\" is specifically in reference to a Roblox game called Steal Brainrot. In the fast-paced, heist-style game, users are tasked with stealing other players' \"brain rot,\" which appears as different silly characters.\n\nUse in a sentence: \"This year's back-to-school slang is full of brain rot.\"\n\n6-7\n\nDefinition: \"6-7\" is less of meaningful phrase than a meaningless response.\n\nOrigin: 6-7 is derived from the song \"Doot Doot,\" released by rapper Skrilla in December 2024. In the song, Skrilla sings, \"The way that switch, I know he dyin'. 6-7. I just bipped right on the highway.\" According to Know Your Meme, a database for memes and internet slang, some people say the \"6-7\" in the song is in reference to 67th Street, perhaps in Philadelphia, where the rapper is from. But Skrilla had not confirmed the numbers' meaning as of Sept. 4.\n\nThe same day of the song's release, TikTok user Matvii Grinblat posted a video of Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. In the video, Grinblat discusses Ball's height, which is 6-foot-7. At this point in the video, the lyric from \"Doot Doot\" in which Skrilla sings \"6-7\" is dubbed. As of Sept. 4, the TikTok video had more than 10 million views.\n\nSeveral other videos dubbing Skrilla's lyrics grew in popularity at the start of 2025. While the line was initially used in reference to Ball's height, it began to morph.\n\nFor example, in late January, TikTok user Tibitoye posted a video with the on-screen caption, \"I got 67/100 on that test. What ab (about) you?\" The video is set to Skrilla's song, in which the \"6-7\" line is played. The second half of the on-screen caption reads, \"Me bc (because) I heard 67:\" As of Sept. 4, the video had 3.6 million views.\n\n\"6-7\" died down for a few weeks before exploding again with the \"67 Kid\" meme, Know Your Meme says. In March, content creator Cam Wilder posted a YouTube video of an Amateur Athletic Union basketball game. In the video, an excited boy says \"6-7\" to the camera as he moves his hands like weighing two objects, palms up, moving his arms up and down. The phrase and hand movements have gained widespread traction among Gen Alpha.\n\nSee the aforementioned clip below at the 12:34-minute mark.\n\nWhile some students may just be saying the phrase and doing the trendy hand movements, others have taken \"6-7\" a bit further. In a TikTok video posted by user Mrs. Barron on Sept. 3, the science teacher addresses an issue with her class: Students had been circling the numbers \"6\" and \"7\" on classroom rulers. Barron continues to have a conversation with her students about vandalism of school property and discipline within the classroom.\n\n\"Mrs. Barron understands that the person probably just thought it was funny and they made a wrong choice,\" the teacher tells her class. \"This is an opportunity for me to address everybody and talking about leveling up and how to be respectful and be the best version of yourself that you can be.\"\n\nSDIYBT\n\nDefinition: SDIYBT is an acronym for \"start digging in yo butt, twin.\" The phrase may sound crude, but it really doesn't have any meaning. It's just a phrase that has become repeatable and it may be more common to hear kids just say or use, \"SDIYBT.\"\n\nOrigin: SDIYBT is derived from another, shorter slang phrase, \"Diggin in yo butt, twin,\" which went viral in July. The catchphrase took off when a content creator posted a clip from the \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" episode \"Welcome to the Chum Bucket.\" In the episode, the character Plankton asks a robot with SpongeBob's brain in it to make him a Krabby Patty. But in the viral clip, the robot's response is dubbed over with \"Start digging in yo butt, twin,\" according to Know Your Meme.\n\nSee the aforementioned video below.\n\nThough SDIYBT became popular this summer, memes with the phrase actually date back to 2019, according to Know Your Meme.\n\nClock it\n\nDefinition: \"Clock it\" is used as validation, given to someone who is sharing new information or gossip. The phrase is used in conjunction with a finger thumb tap, in which a person taps the tips of their thumb and forefinger together to represent a miniature clap, according to Know Your Meme.\n\nOrigin: The origins of the \"clock it\" phrase and associated finger tap are murky, but it is likely derived from AAVE, or African-American Vernacular English. Specifically, the phrase may have roots in ballroom culture, an LGBTQIA+ subculture founded by Black and Latino communities in the mid-20th century, according to 21 Ninety, an online publication dedicated to telling stories by and for women of color.\n\nThe phrase has made its way in the mainstream several times over the years. In 2023, for example, drag queen Monica Beverly Hills sang her original song \"Not a Soul Can Clock\" on Episode 11 of Season 8 of \"RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars.\"\n\nThe phrase and finger tap resurfaced this year when \"Love Island\" Season 7 contestant Allen \"Ace\" Greene referenced it in a freestyle rap video posted to TikTok in April. The clip of Greene's song had been dubbed in more than 272,000 TikTok videos as of Sept. 4.\n\n🥀Dead rose emoji\n\nDefinition: The red, wilted rose emoji (🥀) is used to represent damage or heartbreak, according to Know Your Meme.\n\nOrigin: The dead rose emoji was added to Unicode, the universal character language, in 2016 as part of the 9.0 update.\n\nOne of the most popular, satirical uses of the emoji was in 2023, when an X user posted an AI-generated photo of Peter Griffin from \"Family Guy\" sitting in a dark room, looking out a window. The caption said, \"If I told you a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it? 🥀\" The line is from Kendrick Lamar's 2018 single \"Poetic Justice.\"\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

Will sayings about the coin go away, too?", "text": "By now, most Americans know the U.S. Mint won't be making any more pennies. Some businesses began reporting shortages of the coins even before the last pennies were stamped.\n\nAnother possible repercussion of the penny's passing? Some colorful colloquialisms making use of the word \"penny\" might not make any cents – I mean sense – in the near future.\n\nThese days, phrases and cliches coined about the penny are a dime a dozen: \"A penny for your thoughts,\" \"Worth every penny,\" \"Cost a pretty penny,\" \"A penny saved is a penny earned,\" and \"Find a penny pick up and all day long you'll have good luck.\"\n\nWill these phrases fade away? Could the future be a world in which your thoughts cost a nickel or more? Will another coin emerge as lucky when you pick it up off the ground?\n\nAs for the saying, \"a penny saved is a penny earned,\" that phrase has already been made moot, in a way. That's because the U.S. Mint had told the Treasury Department in its annual report that each penny costs 3.69 cents to make. That suggests the government earns money by not saving the penny.\n\nStill, with language, \"it's hard to predict what will happen, (as) a lot of language today can have a short half-life,\" said Philip Duncan, assistant professor in the department of linguistics at the University of Kansas.\n\nPolice raided a Kansas newspaper: Now they have apologized and will pay millions.\n\nAn idiom for your thoughts on penny phrases\n\nA phrase such as \"worth every penny\" is an idiom, defined as a \"phrase that behaves like a word,” according to the book, \"From the Horse's Mouth: Oxford Dictionary of English Idioms,\" by John Ayto.\n\nAn idiom like \"raking someone over the coals,\" which Ayto mentions is an exaggerated way to say someone was harshly reprimanded, but comes from a medieval form of torture, according to Dictionary.com. And \"kick the bucket,\" which means to die, likely arose from the method of killing pigs three hundred years ago, the site says.\n\nIdioms can \"have a lot of staying power and stick around even if an item is not so common,\" Duncan said. Examples he offers are \"have an ax to grind\" and \"keeping one's nose to the grindstone,\" both of which exist, while thankfully, few of us come into contact with actual axes or grindstones.\n\nThe last U.S. penny may have been made, but an estimated 300 billion pennies remain in circulation, and the penny remains legal tender. So the language around pennies won't immediately die either.\n\n\"Words and phrases associated with the iconic penny will stay in circulation for some time to come,\" Colin McIntosh, who is the chief editor on the Cambridge Dictionary, told USA TODAY.\n\nAs the penny lives on, we will continue to \"talk about things being 'worth every penny' and 'penny-pinching' accountants, and use 'not a penny' to mean 'no money at all',\" McIntosh said. \"But these phrases will gradually start to feel old-fashioned as the penny has less and less impact on people’s lives and becomes symbolic rather than real.\"\n\nThe penny has already dropped on some phrases, \"thanks to the penny’s loss of value,\" McIntosh said. \"We no longer have 'penny candies,' for example.\"\n\nDuncan points out that some other penny-related idioms have already faded away, such as “think/deem one's penny (good) silver,” which meant someone thought themself or their opinions worthy above others, or “a penny in the forehead/face,\" used as a reminder that you can't take material possessions with you.\n\nPenny phrases may go way of cash, which is 'cringe' to young Americans\n\nFor younger Americans, some penny-related idioms are already meaningless. When Duncan discussed penny idioms with his children and his eighth grade daughter's friends, some weren't familiar with several penny-related sayings, including \"my two cents,\" \"pinching pennies\" and \"a penny for your thoughts.\"\n\nMany viewers of the film adaptations of Stephen King's \"It\" – the 2017 \"It\" and 2019's \"It Chapter Two\" – and the new HBO prequel series \"IT: Welcome to Derry,\" may not know the name of the character Pennywise the clown comes from the archaic saying, “penny-wise and pound-foolish,” Duncan said.\n\nWhat's uncertain, Duncan says, is whether younger people may just be less familiar with these phrases because they are simply being used less, or if other factors are playing a role, such as younger people using cash less than older folks. He references a Nov. 6 Harris Poll that found more than half (53%) of Gen Z (ages 13 to 28) say they only use physical cash as a last resort, and nearly one-third (29%) describe cash users as “out of touch” or “cringe.”\n\nMeanwhile, many high school kids are getting \"broccoli perms,\" while younger schoolchildren \"are still relishing in\" the slang memes \"6-7\" and “41” – both are numbers mentioned in rap songs that became viral phrases, Duncan said.\n\nThe numbers have pretty much run their course with most older students, and \"for many, these are current trends that will likely fade soon,\" he said. \"Can you imagine if these became idioms?\"\n\nGen Z and Gen Alpha like to put their 'two cents' in\n\nThere are other signs young people have already mothballed many penny phrases, says Betsy Sneller, an assistant professor of linguistics at Michigan State University. She is the project leader on MI Diaries, an oral history collection program begun during the COVID-19 pandemic that now includes audio diaries from more than 2,000 people, ages 3 to 80-plus, who live in Michigan.\n\nSneller searched the collection and found that the youngest person who used any penny-related idioms was 36 years old. However, the phrase \"my two cents\" is on the rise, being used by Gen Z and Gen Alpha (those born from 2010 to 2024).\n\n\"I don't really have a prediction as to whether phrases like 'penny-pincher' will end up going away, but that is where I would put my money,\" Sneller said. \"Nowadays, people would never say, 'Oh, he's a couple shillings short of a pound,' because 'shilling' is not a thing we use. So it's possible that in 50 years or 100 years, if you call somebody a penny-pincher, they'll be like, 'What are you talking about?'\"\n\nIn for a penny, in for the long run?\n\nBut some penny phrases may stand the test of time, says Matthew Gordon, professor in the department of English at the University of Missouri.\n\n\"The expressions in which 'penny' is used more loosely as a reference to money, like 'worth every penny' or 'cost a pretty penny,' seem likely to endure,\" said Gordon, who is also the director of the university's linguistics program. \"I mean, I don’t know the last time I actually used pennies to pay for anything or even had them in my pockets, and these phrases don’t seem to have declined in currency in our increasingly cashless society.\"\n\nAn example of currency that remained in conversation beyond its actual use is the \"bit,\" a monetary unit equal to 12.5 cents. That word remains part of sayings such as “two-bit criminal” and in the cheer “2 bits, 4 bits, 6 bits, a dollar,\" Gordon said.\n\nPenny idioms could stick around \"even when speakers are not aware of what they originally referred to,\" he said. \"Do people think about opening sea passages when they talk about 'breaking the ice'? Every email program has a 'cc' option, but when was the last time we held a literal carbon copy of a message?\"\n\nThe bottom line: we may not know which penny phrases have staying power and which are dropped. \"So even if penny idioms have their day of reckoning (another idiom, by the way!), it may be hard to pin down why,\" Duncan said.\n\nPenny phrases could \"continue to be used and have social capital,\" he said, \"even if actual pennies don't.\"\n\nContributing: Greta Cross\n\nMike Snider is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Are you saying it ...", "text": "How's your vocabulary? We've all said a word wrong in front of people. Every now and then, we remember and feel that flush of embarrassment again. And again.\n\nWell, the good news is you're not alone. There are plenty of words that are leaving people stumped.\n\nUnscramblerer.com, a site that helps people find fast answers to letter-based word games like Scrabble or Words With Friends, analyzed Google Trends data from Jan. 1 to Oct. 27, 2025. They analyzed searches of \"How do you pronounce\", \"pronunciations of\" and \"How to pronounce\". They also added up different variations of searches for the same term.\n\n\"Our research about the most searched for mispronunciations gives an interesting insight into American culture. Exposure to new words through media, music, pop culture and social platforms drives curiosity,\" an Unscramblerer spokesperson said in a news release.\n\nThe word wizards found the most mispronounced word in every state and the most misspoken words in America. The list is full of proper names, non-English words, foods and medical terms.\n\nThey noted that people usually look up a word most when there's a difference in how it's spelled and how it sounds, so traditional phonics doesn't work. University of Oxford research found that English spelling and pronunciation match about 75% of the time. And about 60% of English speakers said they often mispronounced at least one common word in a Cambridge University linguistics survey.\n\nPaczki (pronounced \"POONCH-kee\") was the most common search. It led Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. The traditional Polish pastry is similar to a filled donut and is very popular around Lent.\n\nWorcestershire sauce (said \"WUSS-ter-sheer\") and the country of Qatar (\"KAH-tar\") both led in three states.\n\nHawaii has the biggest tongue-twister of them all. Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia (pronouned \"HIP-oh-pot-oh-MON-stroh-ses-kwip-uh-dal-ee-oh-FOH-bee-uh\") is the fear of mispronoucing long words. (The irony is palpable.) According to Healthline, it can also be called sesquipedalophobia. Neither is a recognized medical term, but both have roots in social anxiety. (Don't judge me!)\n\n\"Correct pronunciation is closely tied to perceived intelligence and competence. The desire for correct pronunciation is a mix of avoiding social embarrassment and simple curiosity,\" the Unscramblerer spokesperson said. \"There are over 40 regional accents across America. No wonder people are searching for how to pronounce words.\"\n\nReady to see how many you know? Are any of these words and phrases new to you?\n\nWhat word does Mississippi mispronounce the most? What does it mean?\n\nAccording to the Google Trends data, the most mispronounced word in Mississippi is chinoiserie. It's said \"SHIN-wah-zuh-ree.\"\n\nMerriam-Webster dictionary defines chinoiserie as \"a style in art (as in decoration) reflecting Chinese qualities or motifs.\" It can also mean an object in that style.\n\nSo now you know how to say it properly.

Miller's 2009 book, \"Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\" per USA TODAY.\n\nThe exhibition will explore \"the importance of style to the formation of Black identities in the Atlantic diaspora,\" particularly in the United States and Europe, and interpret \"dandyism\" as both an aesthetic and a socio-political strategy through garments, art and other objects from the 18th century to the present.\n\nHere's what to know about dandyism and the 2025 Met Gala theme.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala theme?\n\nThe 2025 Met Gala theme celebrates the Costume Institute’s new spring exhibition, titled \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" (on view from May 10 to Oct. 26).\n\nThe exhibition, which explores the importance of clothing and style to the formation of Black identities in the Atlantic diaspora, will be arranged by 12 characteristics of Black dandyism. The exhibition was spearheaded by curator in charge Andrew Bolton, as well as guest curator Monica Miller, professor and chair of Africana Studies at Barnard College, Columbia University.\n\n\"Superfine\" will feature garments, paintings, photographs and more from artists including Torkwase Dyson, Tanda Francis, André Grenard Matswa and Tyler Mitchell, all exploring the indelible style of Black dandies, from the 18th century through the present day.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala 2025 dress code?\n\nAlthough it's different, the dress code, \"Tailored for You,\" will coincide with the \"Superfine\" Costume Institute exhibit.\n\nThe dress code is \"purposefully designed to provide guidance and invite creative interpretation,\" according to Vogue, as its top editor Anna Wintour co-chairs the event. As in years past, some fashion houses will likely be strict constructionists, veering toward literal interpretations of the theme, while others will take it as a mere jumping-off point.\n\nWho's hosting the Met Gala?\n\nLeBron James will serve as honorary co-chair while Pharrell Williams, Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky and Lewis Hamilton are also slated to be co-chairs of the event.\n\nHowever, James posted to X on Monday that due to an knee injury, he will not be in attendance.\n\nWhat is a Black dandy? What is dandyism?\n\nBlack dandyism started emerging as far back as 1700s England, when slave owners who wanted to flaunt their wealth began dressing their slaves in expensive clothing, creating a \"dandified black servant\" or \"luxury slave\" trend, according to Miller, a professor at Columbia University who also serves as The Met's guest curator for this exhibit.\n\nBut Black dandyism is about more than just aesthetics, Vogue reports. Black dandyism became a practice in which Black people used the power of clothing, personal style and even humor and wit as a form of resistance, and a way for them to push back on societal limitations and negative perceptions not just in terms of race, but also class, gender and sexuality.\n\nAs USA TODAY writes, \"Black men read the room, recognizing the power dynamics clothing signaled, and began making their involuntary uniforms their own.\"\n\nAt its core, the Black dandy figure uses fashion and aesthetics to engage in these power dynamics, highlighting the importance of personal style in shaping one's identity.\n\nWhat is Black dandy fashion?\n\nAlthough Black dandy fashion prioritizes versatility and self-expression above all else, there are some defining style characteristics, Vogue writes. Sharp suits, polished shoes and bow ties have historically been common elements found in dandy fashion. Modern and classic Black dandies also tend to embrace bespoke tailoring, extravagant accessories and bold color palettes.\n\nVogue adds that Black dandy fashion also tends to mix European tailoring with African textiles, American street style and other Black diasporic influences to create an aesthetic that is both \"universal and deeply personal.\"\n\nBlack dandy examples\n\nMiller points to historic figure Julius Soubise as an example of the Black dandy. Soubise was a freed slave and 18th-century London socialite described as a \"sartorial impresario.\"\n\nBut modern-day examples include Prince, André Leon Talley, André 3000, Dapper Dan, LaQuan Smith; Tyler, the Creator; Pharrell Williams, Colman Domingo, Janelle Monáe, Solange and others.\n\nWhat is a zoot suit?\n\nZoot suits are characterized by high-waisted draped pants and oversized jackets with exaggerated shoulders and large lapels, CNN reports. Zoot suits gained popularity during the Harlem Renaissance, a cultural, artistic and literary movement within the Black community that emerged in the early 20th century and was a pivotal time for Black dandyism.\n\nThe zoot suit was later adopted by Mexican American and Filipino American men in Los Angeles, CNN adds.\n\nWhat were the Zoot Suit Riots?\n\nThe Zoot Suit Riots occurred in 1943 and were a series of attacks by white servicemen and police officers against Black, Mexican and Filipino men, particularly those who were wearing the style.\n\nWhat time does the Met Gala start?\n\nThe Met Gala will be livestreamed on Vogue's website and social media channels, including YouTube, beginning at 6 p.m. ET.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/05/31/farm-day-helps-girls-find-path-ag-careers/101466748/", "title": "Farm Day", "text": "Tyler Hersko\n\nTyler.Hersko@vcstar.com, 805-437-0312\n\nFarming is challenging work, but it is an industry that is open to everyone, regardless of gender.\n\n“You see a lot more men than women in ag, and the stereotypical image is a farmer on a tractor out in the field or working with cows,” said berry company Driscoll’s employee Sarah Wool. “But there are a fair amount of women in agriculture who are strong and independent, and they should have a voice, as well. ... Young girls see that they can aspire to be like them if they are interested in the industry.”\n\nInspiring more women to become involved in agriculture is a topic that Wool, 24, cares deeply about, and one of the reasons she and dozens of other local agricultural workers took part in the recent 15th annual Farm Day at Mesa Union School in Somis.\n\nThe event, which was hosted by California Women for Agriculture, a 42-year-old statewide organization that seeks to promote the importance of agriculture to women throughout the state, aimed to connect the region’s students to their neighborhood agricultural workers. The statewide organization’s Ventura County chapter hosts a variety of educational and promotional events to foster the growth of both women in agriculture and farming in general.\n\nFarm Day is one of California Women for Agriculture’s largest events, and beyond general networking, serves as a platform to inspire the county’s young women to pursue their professional passions and open their eyes to the variety of agricultural jobs that will be available to them in the future, said Mary Vanoni, vice president of the Ventura County chapter and Farm Day organizer.\n\nVanoni, whose family has been farming in the area for about 100 years, joined CWA in 1999 to spread awareness about farming. She referred to agriculture as an equal-opportunity industry and considered Ventura County a particularly welcoming region for aspiring female agricultural workers.\n\n“Farming is definitely something women can do just as well as men, and I think Ventura County farmers are very open to women in agriculture,” Vanoni said. “So many of these (Farm Day) stations are run by women, and if they’re representing big businesses, they are high up in the business. Local women are just as involved as men in agriculture.”\n\nAlthough CWA’s Farm Day was not gender-specific, many of its presenters were women, several of them successful business owners. Brittany Collins, owner of HawkEye Imaging, ran one of the event’s most popular stations and gave live drone demonstrations to student attendees. An active-duty Air Force pilot, Collins manages her business, which uses drones to provide local agricultural leaders with data on their farms and vineyards on her days off from the national service branch.\n\nCollins encouraged young women to work toward careers that interest them, regardless of gender stereotypes. She noted that although negative gender stereotypes still exist in male-dominated fields such as agriculture and aviation, dedicated women who work hard would earn respect and find success in their careers.\n\n“If you want to be treated fair and equal, you’ve got to put yourself out there for the challenges and perform at the same level as everyone else, and then gender isn’t eligible for discrimination anymore,” Collins said. “When I was going through pilot training, I was held to the same standards as every male I was with, and as long as I did my job, I got through just fine. A girl can fly a drone just as good as a boy and vice versa, and we should just be focused on doing things that we are passionate about.”\n\nFarm Day presenters and organizers agreed that introducing students to career opportunities ― in agriculture and otherwise ― from an early age plays a key role in motivating them later in life. Wool urged students to explore all aspects of farming and cited important roles research, shipping and logistical careers play in the agricultural industry, while others, such as Mesa Union School Principal Stephen Bluestein, added that there are several educational avenues for students interested in learning more about agriculture.\n\nMesa Union School began offering an agriculture-focused elective last fall to promote the idea of agriculture as a profession. The class has been popular, said Bluestein, who hosted Farm Day at his school to further connect students ― particularly young women ― to the surrounding agricultural community.\n\n“We built an agricultural field and partnered with farmer families to work with soil and build a chicken coop, which has been a fascinating learning experience for everyone,” Bluestein said. “I suspect we have about fifty-fifty boys and girls in the class. I don’t see any unique challenges or obstacles for women getting involved in agriculture.”\n\nWhile some event presenters considered gender stereotypes a hurdle aspiring female agricultural workers would need to overcome, most Farm Day organizers argued that agriculture is an equal-opportunity industry and that issues facing the field are more universal. Due to the math- and science-intensiveness of the industry, education is widely considered to be a key challenge for those interested in getting involved in agriculture, albeit an entirely manageable one, said Jeff Turner, superintendent of the Mesa Union School District\n\n“There are equal opportunities whether you’re a guy or lady farmer, and it’s important to show that the ladies can jump in and contribute,” Turner said. “This Farm Day is an example of growing opportunities for ladies, and if we can get a handful of kids excited about ag today and that leads them to more hard science and math classes, then we’ll have had a successful event. I would encourage young ladies to take those classes and not let the stereotypes of today be a barrier.”\n\nAlthough the number of women farmers in the nation fell about 2 percent from 2007 to 2012, the share of the nation’s farms owned by women has still nearly tripled in the past three decades, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That said, department studies also noted that women-owned farms remain small and have annual sales of less than $10,000.\n\nOverall, women constituted around 30 percent of the nation’s farmers, although California boasts more balanced numbers: 40,072 women worked as farmers in the state, slightly under half as many male farmers (82,315) in California, according to the Department of Agriculture’s 2012 census.\n\nDespite statistical equality in agriculture still being a way off, farming professionals such as Collins are confident that women will continue to make strides in the industry. Noting the state’s progressive tendencies, Collins expressed optimism about the possibilities for female agriculture workers in California and believes the trend for more women getting involved in the industry will continue well into the future.\n\n“Progress can be slow and challenging, but it is progressing and eventually this will catch on and we won’t need to have these conversations or news articles about women in agriculture,” Collins said. “We’re getting to that point. Soon it will just be: This is what cool people are doing and this is exciting stuff.\n\nFor more information about California Women for Agriculture, visit http://cawomen4ag.com.\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2017/06/24/denmark-teen-has-eye-fashion/410951001/", "title": "Denmark teen has an eye for fashion", "text": "DENMARK – A recent Denmark High School graduate will take a message of empowerment and his eye for fashion to Parsons School of Design in New York this fall.\n\nKessler Vogel’s acceptance to the elite design school, widely regarded as one of the best in the world, is a huge recognition of the 18-year-old's talent and the skills he developed in an unlikely place — a small community in northeastern Wisconsin.\n\nOver the years, the old computer room at his parents' home has gone through several incarnations as his interests developed. First it served to house the computer, then it was a music room where Vogel practiced piano. It now functions as a sewing room.\n\nOn the desk is a Singer sewing machine, a sewing kit decorated with colorful cats and various sketchbooks. In the corner is a burgundy dress mannequin wearing a gold and black prom dress that Vogel designed for a friend. A second prom dress hangs from a curtain rod.\n\n“Ever since elementary school, I’ve always just loved art. I really didn’t start designing until maybe end of middle school (or early) high school,” Vogel said.\n\nDuring the last two years he pursued private sewing classes with a teacher at Northeast Wisconsin Technical College and took a sewing class at Denmark High School.\n\nHe used those skills to design and construct two prom dresses.\n\n“Just seeing that people liked what I did boosted my confidence and my purpose to design,” he said.\n\n'This has been his goal'\n\nHeidi Linden, Denmark School District's now-retired family and consumer education teacher, has known Vogel for two years.\n\nDuring Vogel’s senior year he took a fashion, clothing and textiles class with Linden.\n\n“He came to me with a fairly good base knowledge (in sewing). He’s a little bit self-taught,” she said.\n\nLinden mainly helped him with the finer points of sewing his designs.\n\n“If you are going to construct a couture garment, it has to be just so,” she said.\n\nVogel also started a fashion club at the high school, Linden said.\n\n“He seeks things out on his own. You don’t have to hold his hand or lead him,” she said. “This has been his goal. He’s worked for it … I think that’s truly incredible.”\n\nThe first piece he designed and sewed was a gold and black vest edged in artificial black fur. Since, he has worked his way up to women’s blouses and gowns.\n\nVogel prefers working with black and white colors.\n\n“Black and white are eternal colors, so they will never really die in art or the fashion world,” Vogel said.\n\nHis work is influenced by other designers, including the late designer Alexander McQueen. Vogel also draws inspiration from singers and fashion icons such as Nicki Minaj, Beyoncé and Lady Gaga.\n\nHe sees the clothes people wear as something personal.\n\n“I would define my style as edgy chic, but when you design something and when it comes to life … it can make an impact on people’s lives. Fashion affects people’s lives every day,” he said.\n\nDream college\n\nVogel said he initially didn't have enough confidence in his skills to apply to Parsons. Eventually he applied to Parsons and two other schools.\n\nBesides the standard essays, the Parsons application asked for a portfolio of 10 to 15 pieces of work he had created. Vogel's portfolio included samples of his photography, garments and drawings.\n\n“I got into all of them. Parsons was the last one to let me know I got in,” Vogel said.\n\nThe school awarded him a scholarship that will amount to about $100,000 over four years. Vogel plans to major in fashion design and minor in photography.\n\n“When I think of designing in general I would really like to empower women and just empower people,” he said.\n\nHe has seen firsthand how clothing can make people feel more confident in themselves.\n\n“If they wear something that they like. They feel confident enough to do whatever they want,” Vogel said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/coronavirus/2020/12/05/bars-restaurants-suffer-thanksgiving-eve-fear-future-losses/3832023001/", "title": "Hospitality industry hopes for happy holidays despite seasonal ...", "text": "‘Twas the night before Thanksgiving, when all through the state, not a drink could be poured, ‘til the next day at eight …\n\nWhile restaurants and bars across the commonwealth have become accustomed to new rules, regulations and other targeted mitigation efforts related to COVID-19, the news of an early alcohol sales cutoff on Thanksgiving Eve came as a shock, and, quite possibly, an indication of challenges to come.\n\nJust a few days prior to what is widely regarded as the biggest drinking day of the year, Gov. Tom Wolf and Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine issued a directive cutting off “all sales or dispensing of alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption at businesses in the retail food services industry, including bars, restaurants, and private catered events” at 5 p.m. on Nov. 25.\n\nThe backlash from the industry was immediate and, in many cases, rather livid.\n\nOwners and operators had expected some changes, but what they were dealt made them worry for their businesses and workers, who were counting on the pre-holiday to at least make up some of the losses they had experienced throughout the season.\n\n“My immediate concern was for my employees,” Philip Abruzzese, general manager of the Pineville Tavern in Wrightstown, Bucks County, said. “As one of the biggest drinking days of the year, it is a night in which a lot of employees — employees, by the way, who have already fallen on incredibly hard times — might have been looking forward to at least making some money.”\n\nJohn Longstreet, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Restaurant & Lodging Association, felt that the order itself was inherently flawed. Longstreet noted that announcements pertaining to the order didn't even mention that to-go sales were still permissible, and food sales were not part of the restrictions, leading to many customers simply avoiding going out at all.\n\nWhile it appeared that the intent was to curtail the congregating normally associated with drinking on the night before Thanksgiving, previous directives — requiring customers to order food with their drinks, eliminating bar seating, etc. — seemingly had that under wraps already.\n\n“Instead, it really hurt dinner business and small group business,” Longstreet said. “I talked to two restaurant operators in the Lehigh Valley, and one said based on the private parties that they lost — this is a full service restaurant, but they had a number of private parties booked for families — they lost 30% of their business; the other one lost 30% just in dinner business.”\n\nSimilar losses, and some even greater, were felt across the commonwealth.\n\nTrip Ruvane, president and co-founder of Barley Creek Brewing Company in Tannersville and president of the Northeastern Chapter of the PRLA, also noted 30% losses in revenue for the evening. Taking on-site alcohol sales off the table was particularly devastating for his establishment, he said, especially since his business had taken extra precautions to ensure customer and employee safety.\n\n“We are a brewery/distillery, and one of the primary reasons to visit Barley Creek is to see the equipment, meet a brewer/distiller, sample what we’ve created and enjoy a local craft beverage with dinner,” Ruvane said. “All of this can be done safely. We know the rules and have invested in an effort to exceed what is required.”\n\nVeronica Murray, owner of The Cinder Inn in East Stroudsburg, has been fearful of business losses throughout the pandemic. When the 5 p.m. cutoff was announced, that dread escalated: at least one of her long-time staff members, a woman named Ashley who had been part of the team for 13 years, had begun to consider changing occupations after it became a struggle to support her family through working at the bar.\n\nNov. 25 only confirmed Murray’s concerns, as she reported devastating losses for the evening.\n\n“Our sales were overall down at least 60%; staff didn’t make out nearly as well (as they normally do),” Murray said. “We were definitely nowhere near as busy as we would have been.”\n\nIn an attempt to recoup some of the cash that her staff should have picked up, Murray opted to open The Cinder Inn’s doors the next day. While it didn’t result in an avalanche of income, it did help out a bit, and perhaps more importantly, it made for an enjoyable evening, a break from the otherwise dreary atmosphere.\n\n“We did decide to open up on Thanksgiving night to make up from the loss, and we were a little slow, but we did make people’s nights,” Murray said. “They came in and had some Thanksgiving dinner.”\n\nAbruzzese said that traffic at the Pineville Tavern was dismal, and if the rest of the holiday season played out in a similar fashion, it might even necessitate cutting staff hours.\n\n“It was dead,” Abruzzese said. “We did $8,000 on the day before Thanksgiving last year, and this year, we did $1,800, so we were down nearly 80%. No bar, no booze.”\n\nBut not all accounts were so devastating. Steve Peer, assistant manager at Hop/Scotch 22 in Doylestown, said that the bar was able to make at least a little cash, even with the early cutoff.\n\n“Honestly, it wasn’t your typical Thanksgiving Eve, but we did pretty OK,” Peer said. “We were pushing our to-go program that’s still in effect that we’re still allowed to do, and that’s really helped us a lot, because a lot of people came out to bring stuff home instead of going out.”\n\nHappy holidays?\n\nNevertheless, what many in the industry have seen thus far in the season doesn’t bode well for the upcoming holidays.\n\n“(With the) holidays going forward, and the rest of the winter, I don’t see this getting any easier for the licensed independent restaurant industry. Travel is being discouraged, going out to dinner is being discouraged,” Ruvane said.\n\nNormally, the Pineville Inn sees heavy traffic between Thanksgiving and Christmas — Abruzzese estimates they sell between $30,000 to $40,000 in gift cards and book somewhere around 25 to 30 parties, with at least half of those celebrations set up already by this point. But in the Age of the Pandemic, business is nowhere close to what it was in the past.\n\n“We haven’t gotten a single call,” Abruzzese said on Dec. 3.\n\nAs to whether projected losses can be attributed directly to the pandemic or policies from the Wolf administration remains a point of debate in the industry.\n\nAccording to Longstreet, restaurant and bar traffic is already set to decrease due to the fact that those customers usually pop in to grab a bite to eat and a drink while shopping.\n\n“There’s no question that retail, in-store shopping is going to be down significantly this year, and I think they saw that on Black Friday,” Longstreet said. “Secondly, consumer behavior is going to be changed by concern about being in any place – whether it’s a retail store, a restaurant, or anywhere else – where there’s other people. So there’s no question that this has an impact on it.”\n\nBut some restaurateurs still maintain a fear that Wolf and Levine may end up implementing additional rules and regulations in the coming weeks in what they consider a misguided attempt to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in the commonwealth.\n\nAbruzzese said that any further policies directed toward restaurants and bars during the holiday season would be troubling, and in the case of New Year’s Eve, “It would destroy the incentive to celebrate,” which he considers “the most irresponsible decision that I think any politician could make.”\n\n“I can see that after they did (the early Thanksgiving Eve cutoff), there has been a substantial resistance, and I’m hoping that the response that was precipitated from such an arbitrary position was enough to, at the very least, keep from adding any more restrictions,” Abruzzese said. “Because, I can tell you that at this point, we would have serious trouble sustaining any more limitations.”\n\nRuvane noted that in light of Wolf renewing the statewide emergency declaration, there is a strong possibility that further regulations could very well come up.\n\n“His actions for a 5 o’clock cutoff for Thanksgiving Eve, and an emergency declaration in his pocket, he has the ability to do anything he wants with this administration,” Ruvane said. “Their ultimate goal is to protect the citizens of the commonwealth, and the restaurant industry is not part of the discussions.”\n\nThat remains a fundamental point of contention for restaurant and bar workers and owners: not having a seat at the table when decisions affecting their industry are made. While many can understand the perceived intent for mitigation efforts related to restaurants and bars, they also fear that not having a resident expert on the panel that makes those decisions could result in devastating effects.\n\n\"With so much emphasis on preserving health, I have to wonder, what exactly are they trying to preserve if when all of this is finished, there’s no economy left?\" Abruzzese said. \"You’re trying to preserve a kingdom that is burning to the ground so that you can say, ‘This is my kingdom,’ and when you turn around to look at your kingdom, it’s just ash.”\n\nWeathering the storm\n\nAs to how restaurants and bars across the Keystone State will make it through what already appears to be a grueling winter, there are several schools of thought.\n\nLongstreet hopes that a $908 billion stimulus plan under consideration by the federal government could supply some relief. He also hopes that unemployment support can be expanded to help workers in the restaurant and bar industry get through difficult times.\n\n“That’s the good news, that there’s some movement, some belief that there has to be something done before the U.S. Congress goes home for Christmas. We have some hopes for that,” Longstreet said. “The other thing that is going to be very important is unemployment relief, because Pennsylvania restaurants are laying off more employees now than they had in the spring, so it’s going to be very important to get unemployment to those folks. That’s going to be necessary.”\n\nWhen it comes to grant and loan relief, however, support from the state may be out of the question following Pennsylvania’s decision to utilize $1.3 billion in remaining CARES Act funding to balance the commonwealth’s budget.\n\nIn the event that Congress cannot come to an agreement to help out small businesses, the responsibility will inevitably fall upon restaurant patrons in Pennsylvania.\n\nRuvane said that customers have plenty of options to support their favorite places to eat and drink, even if they cannot get out for a sit-down meal.\n\n“For the next few months— If you are comfortable— go out to dinner,” Ruvane said. “Support the local restaurant that's doing a good job. If you are not comfortable yet, remember these family businesses want to survive and need you to order for pick-up. Buy a gift card. Support them any way you can. At Barley Creek, order a case of beer, buy a bottle of vodka, (order) spirits online. Order a t-shirt online and ship it to a friend with the note ‘See you in the Pocono Mountains in 2021 – we’ll share a cold beer.’”\n\nProviding some sense of stability to those that work in an already unpredictable field during such tumultuous times is vital most vital, Peer said. After making it thus far through 2020 and all the pandemic has brought upon their industry in particular, a little bit of holiday cheer could really go a long way.\n\nA little financial support wouldn’t hurt either, so make sure to pick up a gift card for your favorite Italian place, or maybe a sweatshirt from your go-to pub as well.\n\n“Most servers in this industry, most bartenders in this industry, we live paycheck to paycheck, and we rely on big days like (Thanksgiving Eve),” Peer said. “It’s a day when a lot of servers are like, ‘Cool, I can get caught up on my bills now,’ and stuff like that. You’re expecting to get at least something during those times, during those days, and to have that taken away… If they could reassure people in the industry – the people who work in this industry, not who necessarily own it – that they will be okay, I think that would be very helpful.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/03/06/first-take-nancy-reagan-huge-influence-her-husbands-presidency/81404898/", "title": "First take: Nancy Reagan was a huge influence on her husband's ...", "text": "Owen Ullmann\n\nUSATODAY\n\nIn the first years of Ronald Reagan's presidency, his wife, Nancy, was widely considered a liability.\n\nAfter all, she spent lavishly on redecorating the White House and hosting glittering parties at a time when the country was struggling through a recession marked by both high inflation and unemployment.\n\nAt the time, I was a reporter covering the Reagan administration for the Associated Press and later Knight-Ridder Newspapers. And, I admit, I was among the journalists who wrote many critical stories about the first lady: Her devoted gaze when she looked at the president. Her fierce protection of his image and zero tolerance for aides who exhibited the slightest disloyalty. Her love of high fashion and glamour at a time of economic distress. Her hiring of an astrologer in the wake of her husband's near-fatal shooting to make sure future public events were safe for him.\n\nYet, in the later years that I covered the White House, I came to appreciate the enormous influence Nancy Reagan had on her husband's domestic and foreign policies to ensure a successful presidency. She was his only close confidant and friend, and his No. 1 adviser. In retrospect, I must say she served him — and the country— very well.\n\nNancy Reagan, protector of former president's legacy, dies at 94\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nNancy Reagan's 'Just Say No' effort was pop-culture icon\n\nWhile Reagan gave sharply worded speeches that embellished his conservative views on small government and his antipathy toward the Soviet Union, Nancy Reagan softened her husband's sharp edges to produce a pragmatic president who could cut deals with the political opposition in Congress and Soviet leaders he had assailed. Such bipartisan agreements that advance the public's agenda are all but non-existent in Washington today.\n\nOn domestic policy, Nancy Reagan encouraged compromises on budget policies to preserve some programs for the poor in return for cuts in other programs that did not target those most in need.\n\nAlthough the president gave rhetorical support to the anti-abortion movement, Nancy restrained him from taking actions that would further restrict a woman's right to an abortion, keeping him in line with the majority sentiment in the nation.\n\nAt a time when society was largely homophobic and discrimination against gays was the rule, Nancy preached tolerance toward people of all sexual orientations. She often invited gay friends from Hollywood to the White House and even encouraged the appointment of gays — who remained in the closet — to administration jobs.\n\n5 things to know about the life and legacy of Nancy Reagan\n\n2016 candidates react to the passing of Nancy Reagan\n\nOn foreign policy, Nancy prodded her husband to reach out to the Soviets to negotiate arms control treaties. He refused to engage any Soviet leaders during his first term, saying they kept dying on him. He finally did so in his second term, establishing a strong relationship with then-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nThey met four times — in Geneva; Reykjavik, Iceland; Washington and Moscow. (I covered all four summits.) Their meetings led to several arms limitation deals, a remarkable friendship between a lifetime anti-communist and lifelong communist, and the eventual end of the Cold War and breakup of the Soviet Union.\n\nNancy never upstaged her husband or took credit for these accomplishments. She always stood in his shadow, encouraging him, whispering responses to reporters' questions when he couldn't think of one, even rescheduling the ceremony for signing one nuclear treaty on the advice of her astrologer.\n\nI was watching a new episode of House of Cards the other night and thought of the Reagans when first lady Claire Underwood told her husband, Frank, during a vicious fight that they were a team and only succeeded when they worked together, not when they kept undercutting one another.\n\nThat was true of the Reagans: They made a great team, without the scheming and fighting. They adored one another and had a close-knit relationship unlike any I've witnessed in Washington.\n\nNancy Reagan was vital to Ronald Reagan's success.

The culmination of the work of these creative entrepreneurs being shown online earned Prize Fest the title of being the largest online film, music, food, fashion and startup event in the world.\n\nIn its 10-day run, Prize Fest showed 20 films (viewed over 45,000 times), hosted seven days of filmmaker panels and mentor roundtables, 26 live festival update shows, and featured a globally broadcasted live fashion show and competition and an eight-hour live music festival.\n\n“When we moved Prize Fest to online, we knew we were being ambitious with our programming but, to be honest, we weren’t sure the people would show up,” said Gregory Kallenberg, founder of Prize Fest. “We couldn’t believe it when we passed 10,000 views on Film Prize, and our minds were blown when we went over 45,000 views and started seeing our online audience flock to Fashion Prize and Music Prize.”\n\nPrize Fest, headquartered in Shreveport, streamed to 37 states and nine countries. The unique festival/competition combination allowed attendees to view the various festival broadcasts and allowed them to vote on the Food Prize, Music Prize, Fashion Prize and Film Prize winners.\n\nThe Film Prize, Prize Fest’s short film competition, awards $25,000 to the winner, the world’s largest cash prize for a short film.\n\n“For the Prize Foundation, despite being in the middle of a pandemic, we never quit,” said Kallenberg. “We were determined to take our special event online to support and celebrate the independent filmmaking industry and creative entrepreneurs in the state of Louisiana, and we’re proud that so many people from all over the world tuned in and made Prize Fest 2020 so incredibly special.”\n\nLouisiana Film Prize\n\nThe 2020 Louisiana Film Prize grand prize winner and recipient of the $25,000 grand prize (the world’s largest cash prize for a narrative short film) is “Untitled Post-Baby Project,” directed by Lorna Street Dopson.\n\nDopson is the first female director as well as the first New Orleans director to win the Louisiana Film Prize.\n\nThe winning film was chosen from the Top 20 short film finalists, all of which were filmed in Louisiana, and determined by a combination of votes from passholders and national industry judges.\n\nThe other short films that joined “Untitled Post-Baby Project” in the Top 5 this year were: Anne Nichols Brown’s “Away,” Paul Petersen’s “Double Date Night,” Topher Simon’s “Imminent” and Michael Landry’s “Nice to Meet You.” All but one of the top five filmmakers are Louisiana-based. Along with Dopson (New Orleans), Brown is from Monroe, Petersen is from Shreveport, and Simon is from Baton Rouge.\n\nGarrett Kruithof won this year’s Best Actor for his performance in “Three Mile Hell,” and Teri Wyble won Best Actress for her performance in “Nice to Meet You.”\n\nLouisiana Music Prize\n\nThe 2020 Louisiana Music Prize winner and recipient of the $2,000 cash award is Lance Thompson.\n\nThompson competed against nine other independent music acts during an online livestreamed music showcase. Online passholders were able to watch all bands, cast their vote for their favorite band and ultimately help declare the winner.\n\nThis year’s Louisiana Music Prize was retooled to help the independent music scene in the region. All bands were given the opportunity to play 25-minute sets, were allowed to promote themselves and garner tips from the Music Prize audience, and each band will be given a recording of their performance to help promote the band.\n\nLouisiana Food Prize\n\nThe 2020 Battle for the Golden Fork: Power to the People competition was incredibly close, ending in a tie between Tootie Morrison, chef of Abby Singer’s Bistro (and Louisiana Food Prize’s inaugural Golden Fork champion) and Anthony Felan, chef/owner of Fat Calf Brasserie. Each chef will be the recipient of a $1,000 cash prize.\n\nOther chefs competing for this year’s Golden Fork title were Jessica Tyler Comegys (Glow Alchemy Kitchen), Eleazar Mondragon (Ki Mexico), Jon Ortiz (The Noble Savage Tavern), and Sean Sullivan (Frank’s Louisiana Kitchen.)\n\nThe Battle for the Golden Fork was reformulated this year in an effort to energize and support the local restaurant community. Rather than a live cookoff, over 500 Golden Fork Passports were distributed across the competing chef’s restaurants, and diners had one month to visit and patronize at least three participating restaurants before casting their vote for their favorite chef.\n\nAs part of this year’s Prize Fest, the Louisiana Food Prize also hosted three sold-out celebrity chef cook alongs in which passholders received curated Home Chef Baskets and the opportunity to virtually cook along with nationally recognized award-winning chefs.\n\nLouisiana Fashion Prize\n\nIn its second year, the Louisiana Fashion Prize hosted an online livestreamed presentation of seven local designer’s collections. The innovative broadcast allowed viewers to meet the designers, get up close and personal with the designer’s collections and watch a live-judging from the celebrity panel.\n\nHephzibah Thomas was named the winner of the judges’ grand prize award and $2,000 cash prize. Thomas was also voted the audience choice winner and received a gift basket with curated goods from local artisans and businesses.\n\nThe competing designers were Thomas, Crystal Green, Kirsi Hardy, Brittani Shabazz, Victoria Smith, Donna Strebeck, and Emily Zering. Each designer’s collection was showcased and filmed in a different location, and the online presentation also included behind the scenes footage, interviews with the designers and commentary from the judges.\n\nThe judges’ decision was made by a panel of fashion industry professionals, including Golda Blaise (Co-Founder, Meow Wolf), Thaddeus (a voice of fashion from the West Coast), and Tracee Dundas (Founder/Producer, New Orleans Fashion Week).\n\nLouisiana Startup Prize\n\nThe Louisiana Startup Prize hosted Come & (Re)Build It, an online mini-conference focused on diversity, parity and inclusion within the startup and entrepreneurial ecosystem, and drew a national audience of incubators, accelerators, and entrepreneurs.\n\nThe conference kicked off with keynote Victor Hwang, Founder and CEO of Right to Start, an advocacy group whose mission is to bring entrepreneurial opportunity to all, regardless of race, gender, background, place or circumstance. Other panelists included Katie Hall (CEO, Claria), Chris Offensend (CEO, Qwally), Kate McCrery (Director of Programs, Digital Undivided), Sonal Shah (Executive Director, Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation at Georgetown University) and Howard W.
