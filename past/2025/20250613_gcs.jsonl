Here's what ...", "text": "AI-assisted summary U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers are increasingly searching electronic devices of travelers entering the country.\n\nThese searches, while legal, are raising concerns about free speech and privacy rights.\n\nTravelers are advised to be mindful of the content on their devices and online profiles, and to understand their rights when it comes to border searches.\n\nA recent string of legal U.S. residents being detained or deported following information found on their cellphones is worrying some travelers they'll be stopped when traveling through the country's border.\n\nEarlier this month, Lebanese physician and assistant professor at Brown University Rasha Alawieh was flagged at Boston Logan International Airport by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. She was returning from visiting family back home when officers found photos and videos on her cellphone pertaining to Hezbollah. Her visa was canceled, and she's been deported back to Lebanon.\n\nWhile not at the border, an Indian Columbia Ph.D. student’s visa was revoked, and she self-deported to Canada after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided her apartment for pro-Palestinian activity on her social media and participating in campus protests. Fellow student Mahmoud Khalil was a protest leader and is being held in immigration detention in Louisiana in what some Democratic Senators are calling an abuse of immigration laws. Most recently, a Georgetown University researcher from India who was recently accused of having connections to a Palestinian militant group is also facing deportation.\n\nUnder orders by the Trump administration to increase national security – including a full review of visa programs by the U.S. State Department and a potential travel ban on more than 40 countries – more travelers are facing scrutiny by immigration and border control officers, including a search through your electronic devices by CBP.\n\nUp until this past January, these searches have been \"almost negligible,\" according to Susanne Heubel, senior counsel at New York-based immigration law firm Harter Secrest & Emery LLP. \"I travel a lot, I have clients who travel a lot, of all sorts of nationalities and visa statuses, and nobody has ever complained about these searches until now,\" she said.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHere’s what travelers should know:\n\nWhy does CBP search your devices?\n\nBorder searches of electronic devices, including cellphones, laptops and iPads, are meant to \"enforce the law at the U.S. border and to protect border security,\" according to the CBP website.\n\n\"Any traveler entering the U.S. is subject to CBP inspection,\" CBP Assistant Commissioner Hilton Beckham said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"CBP follows strict policies and directives when it comes to searching electronic media. These searches are rare, highly regulated, and have been used in identifying and combating serious crimes, including terrorism, smuggling, human trafficking, and visa fraud. Any claims of politically motivated searches are completely unfounded.\"\n\nMake your journey safer and smarter: Sign up for USA TODAY's Travel newsletter.\n\nAccording to Heubel, the officers are checking to ensure the claim you're making about who you are and your visa status are true, so if you're on a tourist visa but there's suspicion that you may be working while in the U.S. From a national security perspective, they're also seeing if there is any criminal data or activity on your devices.\n\nHowever, recent cases have brought to light that public activity relating to free speech, like social media posts on political issues, are now being subject to searches and subsequent visa issues.\n\n\"In some ways, they might be, but there's also another rule where if you show any indication that your conduct could be contrary to the interests of the United States in terms of security and foreign policy, a lot of this is sort of being mixed together right now,\" Heubel said.\n\n\"People who are very loud and open about their opinions here are starting to get in trouble,\" she added. \"Now we're starting to see what I would call really, not an assault, but an infringement on what I think every normal person would call free speech.\"\n\nWhat do CBP officers do when they search your devices?\n\nThere are two types of searches: basic and advanced, according to the CBP website. The former is manually going through the content of your devices, such as your photos or videos, including any deleted ones that are still on your phone.\n\nAn advanced search is when an officer is using external equipment to review, copy, or analyze content on your phone if \"there's reasonable suspicion of a violation of law enforced or administered by CBP or a national security concern.\" However, approval must be obtained from a senior manager for this search to be conducted.\n\nDuring these searches, your device is typically in airplane mode or offline, so the officer can only go through what's on the hard drive or operating system. Heubel said they're not allowed to go through your work email or whatever is stored in the Cloud. However, if your social media profiles are public, it could be easy for them to look at them on their end, she noted.\n\nWhat are my rights during a device search?\n\nThe Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable search and seizures, but the line gets blurred within 100 miles of international borders. At any port of entry, all of these searches are considered a \"reasonable search,\" so no warrant is required. \"So, long story short, you have rights, but really, you don't have any rights,\" Heubel said.\n\nIf you agree to be searched, officers can go through your person and your luggage. If you are a U.S. citizen and disagree with being searched, they're still obligated to let you into the country. However, for foreign nationals, even on approved visas, it's iffier.\n\nHeubel recommends travelers say something along the lines of: \"I understand what's going on. I'm just telling you, for the record, I'm not agreeing to this, but I'm letting you do it because I know that you have the right to search my device without a warrant and without probable cause.\"\n\nHere are some tips for travelers when it comes to CBP device searches:\n\n◾For the most part, if travelers are mindful of what's on their phones and public online profiles, they should get through U.S. borders without issues. If you are cleaning up your phone, make sure to hard delete anything so it's not just in the deleted folder, which is still accessible on your device.\n\n◾When you travel, bring as few devices as possible with you. Obviously, you'll bring your phone with you, but leave your laptop at home if you can.\n\n◾If you're a green card holder, do your research. \"You have to have a good understanding of what the visa category that you're coming in allows you to do and does not allow you to do,\" Heubel said.\n\n\"Look, on any given day, there are still hundreds of thousands of people entering the U.S. successfully,\" she said. \"The stories that you're hearing in the news are really ones that have some kind of special component to them ... But if you are a common sense sort of careful traveler, you should not have any issues getting into the U.S.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/15/rnc-2024-convention-live-updates-in-milwaukee-news-events-schedule/74403433007/", "title": "RNC 2024 convention updates in Milwaukee: Trump makes ...", "text": "Monday's first day of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee was action-packed, including an announcement about Donald Trump's vice president pick of Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and the former president's official nomination at the GOP's presidential candidate.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel provided live coverage of Monday's events. Here's a full review:\n\nBrewer's Hill warehouse party draws police presence\n\nA large police presence was keeping watch on Reservoir Street and Buffum Avenue as ticketed guests milled into an exclusive party at a warehouse in Brewer’s Hill around 11 p.m. Residents have previously expressed frustration with the lack of communication about the late-night event.\n\nTwo police officers confirmed that someone had been throwing projectiles at police cars from the roof of a neighboring building that abuts the back of the warehouse. There was traffic on the usually residential street as people were being dropped off at the event.\n\n— Vanessa Swales\n\nTwin DJs embraced by the right seek to add more fun to politics\n\nRWB Milwaukee, a bar on Old World Third Street, is usually closed Mondays.\n\nBut a Dallas-based set of twin brothers partnered with the bar to put on a ticketed event, the Red, White and Blue Jamboree, for RNC attendees. Paul and James McElwain are a DJ duo unofficially embraced by the right and seeking to infuse more fun to politics.\n\nThe two have been involved in DJ event production for around a decade under the name “Milk N Cooks.” Paul said they entered the politics afterparty production scene after noticing a “gaping hole” in fun parties and entertainment surrounding the often intense and contentious political realm.\n\nServers wore tank tops with “No tax on tips” printed across their chests, a Republican Party talking point earlier in the day. About 100 people crowded around the bar around 10 p.m.\n\nPaul said he hopes the event brings people together.\n\n\"We lean a certain way, but we're not explicit about that and it's just, hey, we're trying to put on a good event for people to want to hang out, have good time and socialize,” Paul said.\n\n— Claudia Levens and Kelly Meyerhofer\n\nMichigan Rep. John James trolls Packers fans\n\nAt the beginning of his remarks at Monday night's session, Michigan Rep. John James said, “Good evening, Wisconsin. Warmest regards, warmest regards from Detroit – home of the NFC North Champion Detroit Lions!”\n\n— USA TODAY\n\nThird Ward restaurants report normal or lower-than-normal diner levels\n\nSome businesses in the Third Ward neighborhood said they were hoping for a convention boost in business but it had yet to materialize. Employees at several restaurants said a variety of factors beyond the RNC — the early weekday, humidity and rain — could have played a role in reducing foot traffic.\n\nAt Cafe Benelux, an employee said the number of diners was “significantly” lower than a normal Monday night.\n\nAt the Milwaukee Public Market, stools at the Tiki Bar were mostly filled. An employee said traffic was about what he’d expect.\n\nCity Social employee Jeloni Woulard also said business was normal for a Monday. She said she was expecting increased business but stressed it was only the first day.\n\nDominic Reed, manager of the Wicked Hop, said business was “a lot” slower than normal.\n\n“We’ve just got to wait and see,” he said\n\n— Kelly Meyerhofer and Claudia Levens\n\nTrump leaves convention’s first day without speaking\n\nAfter making his first public appearance since his assassination attempt, Trump left Fiserv Forum without speaking on the first day of the convention.\n\nAdditional streets were closed downtown between Fiserv Forum and the Pfister as Trump’s motorcade was expected.\n\nRepublican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley declared the convention in recess until Tuesday afternoon.\n\n— Tristan Hernandez\n\nKenosha priest at RNC impersonates Trump before prayer\n\nThis Wisconsin pastor gave one heck of a Donald Trump impression at the RNC in Milwaukee Monday. Here's the full story\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\nTrump shows up at the Republican convention\n\nThe former president made his first public appearance since Saturday's shooting — cameras in the convention hall filmed him walking into a luxury box with a bandage on his right ear.\n\nTrump waved as the crowd roared and the cover band played a version of \"So Caught Up in You.\" The crowd at Fiserv Forum erupted into loud chants of \"USA!\" \"Fight!\" and \"We want Trump!\n\n— David Jackson, USA TODAY\n\nArea surrounding hard perimeter quiet as storms move in\n\nWith storms moving in and night-time conventions speeches underway, the area surrounding the hard perimeter was quiet around 8:30 p.m. Monday.\n\nLP on N. King Dr. had four patrons inside, and down the street at Who’s On Third, the Old German Beer Hall and Brat House each had about a dozen people eating and drinking.\n\nAt Milwaukee's famous German restaurant, Mader's, the large outdoor beer garden was empty, and a third of the tables inside occupied.\n\nPere Marquette Park, a fenced-off area which is an extension of the Republican National Convention, had a handful of people sitting on benches as the sun set and the storm began to roll over Milwaukee.\n\n— Jordyn Noennig and Vanessa Swales\n\nFormer president Trump is en route to the Republican National Convention, CNN, ABC are reporting\n\nDonald Trump is expected to make an appearance, but is not expected to speak, according to ABC News.\n\n“A large motorcade recently left the hotel where Trump is staying and appears to be heading in the direction of the venue,” ABC News said.\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\nDrink Wisconsinbly gets business as official watch party\n\nDrink Wisconsinbly in the Deer District was getting good business, thanks to its location near Fiserv Forum and the home of the watch party, according to Nick Olgray, manager at Drink Wisconsinbly.\n\n“This is busier than what we were expecting,” he said.\n\nHe suspected that the shooting of Trump Saturday “brought out a lot of people.”\n\nOlgray said that, when the convention took a break in the afternoon, the space was full, with a line out the door.\n\nAround 7:30, there was a lull, with about 30 people in the bar and a Fox News setup for a live broadcast. Olgray said the bar benefited from hosting both private parties and then opening to the public for watch parties.\n\n“It’s the best of both worlds,” he said.\n\nMarc Wontorek of New York was at Drink Wisconsinbly watching Sen. Tim Scott give a convention speech. Wontorek was there as a guest of a New York delegate. He had been inside at the convention but took a break at the pub.\n\n“The beer here is better,” he said while drinking On Wisconsin beer from Badger State Brewing.\n\n—Jordyn Noennig\n\nSen. Ron Johnson says teleprompter loaded wrong speech\n\nAfter the speech, an aide to Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the speech Johnson read was not the final version he intended to deliver.\n\nHis final speech began with Johnson saying \"we should all heed President Trump's call for unity, strength and determination,\" the aide said. And he read a line that he did not want in the final version: \"Today's Democrat agenda, their policies, are a clear and present danger to America, to our institutions, our values and our people.\"\n\nAsked who was responsible for the error, Johnson's staff replied: \"Not us.\"\n\nRead full story\n\n— Lawrence Andrea\n\nSen. Ron Johnson attacks Democrats' 'fringe' agenda in opening night RNC speech\n\nJohnson opened a convention billed as one of unity Monday night in Milwaukee by leveling criticism squarely at Democrats.\n\nThe Democratic Party, Johnson said as he welcomed Republican delegates to Wisconsin, are the party of “open borders, reckless spending, weaponized government and weakness on the world stage.”\n\nHe called Democrats’ agenda “fringe” and attacked them for discussing gender-related issues. “Vice President Harris and President Biden,” Johnson said, “have made our lives less safe and more expensive.”\n\nRead full story\n\n— Lawrence Andrea\n\nU.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden praises Vance as 'exquisite' pick\n\nU.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin told the Journal Sentinel that Vance was an \"exquisite\" running-mate pick for Trump's campaign.\n\nVan Orden spoke of his shared experiences with Vance as a person who grew up in rural poverty to a single mother, joined the military, and pursued a position in Congress.\n\nHe believes Vance will attract voters in the 3rd Congressional District because they share a similar experience. Van Orden said Vance's upbringing and commitment to serving voters who live in rural areas or below the poverty line will offer a balance to the Republican ticket, contrasting Trump's billionaire status.\n\n\"If you look at that, that's an expression of the American dream,\" he said. \"People are going to gravitate towards that.\"\n\n— Tamia Fowlkes\n\nLocal government leaders decry Trump assassination attempt\n\nLocal government leaders from across the U.S. gathered at Milwaukee City Hall to highlight the importance of the level of government closest to the people.\n\n“America’s mayors are driving solutions at the local level,” said Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who was joined by Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, Rancho Cordova, California, Mayor David Sander and New York City Council member Joseph Borelli.\n\nThe group said whether Trump or President Joe Biden wins a second White House term, local governments will need a strong partnership with the federal government to address challenges in communities.\n\nJohnson pointed to the federal pandemic aid that reached local governments through the American Rescue Plan Act, saying it helped prevent Milwaukee from becoming insolvent and gave Wisconsin’s largest city the time it needed to reach a funding agreement with the state.\n\nThe group also condemned the assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nSander, who is also president of the National League of Cities, called the attempted assassination an “attempt to murder democracy.”\n\n“That violence is a reminder of the responsibilities we all have as leaders to create stronger communities and to act swiftly to disavow hate and violence wherever we find it,” he said. “It was a reminder quite frankly of what our fellow mayors and council members and aldermen have known for way too long: that hate and violence toward elected officials in our country has been rising and it must end.”\n\nLeaders, he said, must “model better ideals for our democracy.”\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nFire and medical personnel field heat exhaustion calls\n\nA man experiencing what a police officer said was heat exhaustion got help from Milwaukee police and medics around 5:40 p.m. near the corner of State and Water streets as vehicles entered the convention perimeter.\n\nTemperatures in Milwaukee reached the upper 80s Monday. With the high humidity, the heat index reached around 92 degrees.\n\nAs of 6:30 p.m., fire and medical personnel have responded to a dozen heat-related calls, according to Milwaukee Fire Department Lt. Carlos Velazquez Sanchez.\n\n— Drake Bentley, Gina Castro, Bridget Fogarty\n\nLiz Truss, former UK prime minister, is attending the RNC\n\nLiz Truss, the former Conservative Party prime minister of the United Kingdom, is at the RNC.Truss posted a photo of herself in front of Fiserv Forum on X, formerly Twitter, Monday afternoon.\n\n“Great to be at @RNC in Milwaukee seeing President Trump get nominated,” she said in the post. “The leadership the West needs.”\n\nAccording to The Guardian, Truss is expected to speak at the event.\n\nFollowing an assassination attempt on Trump, Truss encouraged her 666,400 X followers to pray for the former president and America. She later took to X again to call Trump “the strength the world needs.”\n\nTruss was a member of Parliament for South West Norfolk in various capacities from 2010 to 2024. Earlier this month, she lost her seat in Parliament in the U.K. general election.\n\nIn 2022, Truss resigned around a month and a half after becoming UK prime minister, making her the shortest-serving UK PM, BBC reported.\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\nU.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin and Cory Booker meet with high school students\n\nU.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Cory Booker of New Jersey spoke with a group of high school students at the Milwaukee Youth Symphony Orchestra Monday afternoon, listening to stories of why investing in the arts should be more important for the federal government.\n\nThe two also weighed in on Trump’s vice presidential selection in the hours after the announcement.\n\nBaldwin said that Trump’s selection of Vance was an “expected choice in many ways.” She said she’s worked to author legislation with Vance, but said that Democrats now have to keep the focus on their values.\n\n“What we have to keep the focus on is the difference between what Democrats stand for and our ticket,” she said. “And what (Republicans) stand for, Project 2025 is extremely scary. And voters need to know that they have a real choice.”\n\nBooker echoed that sentiment.\n\n“They don’t stand with the values of the majority of American people when it comes to things like health coverage, with reproductive rights,” he said. “So this is going to be a very clear choice.”\n\nThe senators also addressed the growing amount of political violence in America, which culminated in former president being shot Saturday.\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nInterview with Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley\n\nChurch flies LGBTQ+ Pride flag as message of love\n\nJust a couple of blocks east of Fiserv Forum at Village Church, Pastor Donna Brown and congregants hung up an LGBTQ+ Pride flag outside the front of the unassuming building.\n\n“We’re called to be inclusive and loving,” Brown said. “Anybody is welcome in, even if they don’t agree with us.”\n\nShe and four members of the church were laying out food and drinks inside the building, preparing for the rescheduled gathering. It’s a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America denomination with a special designation to welcome LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nEarlier, she had placed a sign in large font on the front door reading “No Weapons Allowed.\"\n\n“We don’t feel violence is an answer,” Brown said. “More weapons cause more violence.”\n\nLifelong Milwaukeean and member of the church Bill Koehn, 73, said security and the events of the last 48 hours were the main topics of conversation at the church’s Sunday service.\n\n“The bottom line is we are all about spreading the message of love and we don’t discriminate,” Koehn said.\n\nGesturing to the flag, he said: “If somebody has an issue with this being displayed or the fact that there is a church right here, on whatever level, that’s why we have our doors open so we can sit down and have a dialogue like this and get the opinions from people.”\n\nWhile he lamented Milwaukee's failed DNC in 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Koehn said he was “OK” with the convention being in Milwaukee, especially the economic benefits and how it highlights the city of Milwaukee “in a way that doesn’t happen very often.”\n\n— Vanessa Swales\n\nMan disrupting protesters arrested by Milwaukee police\n\nA 36-year-old man was arrested Monday afternoon after disrupting protesters during the end of a march at Red Arrow Park, according to the Milwaukee Police Department.\n\nAuthorities say the man took signs from protesters and attempted to knock over a booth, causing a disturbance to protesters who just finished a march that ended at the park, 920 N. Water St., around 3:20 p.m.\n\nMilwaukee police said the man was arrested, cited and later released.\n\nThe video of the incident, which was posted on X, has more than 6,000 views:\n\n— Adrienne Davis, Gina Castro, Bridget Fogarty\n\nTrump cereal for sale\n\nCrosswords lovers can have a Trump-themed start to their morning with a MAGA-branded cereal available for sale.\n\nIn the “soft” pedestrian zone, Milwaukee residents Crystal King and another person employed by the Trump campaign hung up posters advertising Trump cereal boxes that promises “greatness in every bowl.” They said it tasted like Fruity Pebbles.\n\nBoxes are $30 a pop, or $20 if you’re willing to forgo the cereal inside it.\n\n“Missing those lively family discussions? Trump Cereal is your new table centerpiece,” the website says. “It's not just about the crunch, but the conversations it sparks — from light-hearted banter to deep political chats.”\n\nThe crossword puzzle on the back includes phrases like “fake news,” “crooked Hillary” and we won’t spoil the rest.\n\n— Claudia Levens and Kelly Meyerhofer\n\nCanary Coffee seeing more customers 'for a Monday'\n\nCanary Coffee, just outside the hard security perimeter at 720 N. King Dr., saw an uptick in business on the first day of the convention.\n\n“A lot more business than normal for a Monday,” said employee Josh Beamsley, adding the customers are not their normal clientele.\n\nIn preparation for the big week Canary Coffee stocked up on extra ingredients including double the amount of milk it normally has.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nResearchers surveying protesters for study on contemporary U.S. politics\n\nStudent volunteers were surveying protesters at Red Arrow Park on Monday afternoon to understand why people choose to protest and the impact protests may have on contemporary politics in the U.S. The survey is funded and led by Rutgers University, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and the University of Glasgow in Scotland.\n\nMichael Heaney of the University of Glasgow and his team have surveyed about 140 people at the RNC in Milwaukee so far. He’s also surveyed protests at previous RNC and DNC conventions in 2008 and 2016. In comparison to previous RNC protests, this year’s is less organized and smaller, Heaney said, possibly due to the recent assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump.\n\n“It may make the protests smaller because people are nervous about political events. I would project marginally smaller and marginally more intense protests,” he said.\n\nSasmit Rahman, 22, and Emily Chu, 22, traveled to from Minneapolis to march on the RNC. Rahman said they are looking forward to the results of the survey specifically around race and gender of protesters. Chu is interested to learn how people’s emotions may push them to attend protests.\n\n“I think it’s interesting to see whether it’s fear or hope that motivates people more,” Chu said.\n\n— Gina Castro\n\nNorth Carolina delegate loves Trump’s VP pick\n\nNorth Carolina delegate Pauline Bruno gushed about Vance as Trump’s vice presidential pick.\n\n“We are so pleased,” she said in a seersucker blazer and Trump-printed shoes she bought on Etsy.\n\nBruno loved Vance’s focus on the Rust Belt in his bestseller \"Hillbilly Elegy\" that she read two years ago.\n\nMilwaukee has been “so welcoming,” she said. She praised the police and said she had “no concerns” about security.\n\n— Kelly Meyerhofer and Claudia Levens\n\nGuests and delegates appeared to be in high spirits as they wandered downtown Milwaukee after the first afternoon of the convention.\n\nAsif Shahzada, a Wisconsin delegate and La Crosse resident, said the energy was “wonderful” inside Fiserv Forum when Trump was officially confirmed as the Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“I love Trump’s policies,” Shahzada said. “Everybody is energetic. It’s fun to meet other delegates.”\n\nShahzada, who recently immigrated to the U.S. from Pakistan, is attending the RNC for the first time this year and said he’s already met people from at least five other states. He owns and operates The Sushi Pirate, a restaurant in downtown La Crosse.\n\nFor other convention-goers, it’s far from their first rodeo: Floyd Brown, a Phoenix resident, said he’s attended every RNC since 1984, save for the mostly virtual convention during the pandemic.\n\n“The party is more unified than I’ve seen in decades,” Brown said after the delegate roll call. “It’s more somber this year, but people are also very upbeat.”\n\nBrown, who is an invited guest at the convention, is also a political commentator and author of “Counterpunch,”a 2023 book advocating for peaceful resistance against leftist movements. He said he feels the Republican party has unified in the face of rising political division, especially given the assassination attempt on Trump just days before the convention.\n\nBrown is attending the RNC with his wife, Mary Beth, who said she was excited by Trump’s announcement of Vance as his running mate this afternoon.\n\n“I think he’s going to do an excellent job,” Mary Beth Brown said of Vance.\n\n— Maia Pandey\n\nBobby Flowers, florist at Marius Bell Floral & Design, arrived at the Milwaukee Public Market around 11 a.m., and as of 5:30 p.m. said he's never seen the market so empty on a Monday.\n\n\"It's been dead,\" he said. \"There's usually a lot of tourist traffic here on Mondays, and it's just been so quiet today. It feels so strange.\"\n\nAs of 6 p.m., only eight patrons were seated in the market's upstairs dining area with roughly 20 to 30 patrons shopping or dining on the main floor. Five open tables were available at St. Paul Fish Co.\n\nOutside at the St. Paul Palapa tiki bar, all bar stools were occupied.\n\n— Rachel Bernhard\n\nA photo posted on X shows British comedian and actor Russell Brand, a Trump supporter and conservative internet personality, walking around downtown Milwaukee late Monday afternoon.\n\nThe post says he was seen taking photos with fans and police officers near the Baird Center.\n\nBrand is scheduled to perform at 7 p.m. Monday at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Peck School of the Arts music recital hall, and at the Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts in Brookfield on Wednesday.\n\n— Quinn Clark\n\nCity Attorney Evan Goyke Monday evening called the Coalition to March on the RNC protest “extremely smooth and safe.”\n\n“I was really pleased with everyone, I think globally,” said Goyke, who observed the march on the first day of the Republican National Convention. “We had protesters and counter protesters. Everyone that was here seemed well organized, there was communication, law enforcement were everywhere they needed to be, communicating with individuals.”\n\nHe said he and his staff would be out in the coming days as well to monitor areas people are expressing their First Amendment rights and how government responds if an incident does occur.\n\nHe also said he got to talk with the Columbus Police Department’s 13-member Police Dialogue Team that was also out at the protest.\n\nIt’ll be interesting, he said, to see whether Milwaukee pursues a similar team at its own police department.\n\n“It’s a special team with training and background to go into protests or potential civil unrest, these kind of emotion-filled environments, and I thought they did a great job today,” he said.\n\nCommunication ahead of time helped ensure everyone was on the same page, Goyke said.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nPopular Wisconsin beer sparks political discussion\n\nSpotted Cow, the beer from the New Glarus Brewing Company, prompted the start of a discussion about the beer and its place in Wisconsin culture and politics.\n\nPolitico correspondent Adam Wren reported that Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told a passerby that Spotted Cow is pretty good, “but the owner is ultraliberal. Leinenkugel’s is the conservative one.”\n\nHowever, social users have also made their opinions on the beer and the senator’s criticism.\n\nJournalist Robert Evans said that Wisconsin should be proud of Spotted Cow.\n\n“My primary takeaway from the Milwaukee RNC: Spotted Cow is an excellent beer, shocked by how good it is,” Evans said in an X post.\n\nX user Josh Geise (@joshgeise) said, “Was at Kohler this weekend. Had my first Spotted Cow. So glad to hear it’s ‘ultraliberal.’”\n\nAnother X user, Chaddy (@brewcity43) said, “Spotted (C)ow is okay, and (Leinenkugel’s) is average, as well.”\n\n– Angelika Ytuarte\n\n50 Cent will not attend the RNC, rep says\n\nFollowing reports that rap icon 50 Cent was in discussions with Republican officials about appearing at the convention, his representatives told TMZ that he will not be attending.\n\n\"He is not attending (the RNC), as he is slated to be in Shreveport preparing for his ‘Humor and Harmony’ festival,” his rep said\n\nThe business mogul, born Curtis Jackson, made a post on X on Saturday of his iconic 2003 album cover but instead replaced himself with Trump.\n\n— Drake Bentley\n\nDoc’s Smokehouse looking for patrons\n\nDoc’s Smokehouse setup a pop up Beer Garden just outside of the hard security zone and not many people have shown up throughout the first day of the convention.\n\n”I think the security measures are more restrictive than we anticipated so it’s really difficult for people to get here,” Brent Brashier, owner of Doc’s Smokehouse, said.\n\nHe added there is an exit right in front of the beer garden but not many are going through that way.“Not really anybody knows it’s an exit because it’s padlocked,” Brashier said.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nModel Amber Rose spotted around Milwaukee\n\nMilwaukeeans have seen popular model and TV star Amber Rose around the city in recent days after she announced last week she would be a speaker at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nA Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter spotted the model, rapper and television personality eating at the Tupelo Honey Southern Kitchen & Bar in downtown Milwaukee Sunday afternoon. Fans gathered around the model and took photos with her, including one resident who snapped a selfie with Rose outside the restaurant.\n\nThe popular television personality has been trending on social media following her announcement back in May that she was in support of former President Donald Trump. Rose announced on July 8 on X that she would be a speaker for the RNC.\n\n— Adrienne Davis, Quinn Clark\n\nJason Storms criticizes Republican Party's abortion stance\n\nJason Storms, national director for Operation Save America, appeared outside the Marcus Center around 5 p.m. to criticize the Republican Party for not taking a stronger stance on abortion.\n\n“We’re committed to the protection of preborn children,” said Storms. Storms was scheduled to speak at Haymarket Square at 4 p.m. but relocated because it was deserted.\n\nWhen the Republican Party finalized its platform this week, it did not include language calling for a national ban on abortion.\n\nThe platform stated: “We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those rights.”\n\nAccording to its website, Operation Save America argues a “biblical worldview must govern all areas of both our private and public lives.” It is known for displaying graphic images of aborted fetuses as part of its anti-abortion advocacy and has stated that women who have abortions should be subject to the death penalty. Storms is the son-in-law of anti-abortion extremist Matt Trewhella.\n\nStorms was accompanied by several of his teenage children, who held large banners with anti-abortion imagery and quotes from the Bible.\n\n— Alex Groth and Cleo Krejci\n\nAttendee mixes RNC with her bachelorette party\n\nTemperatures have remained steadily in the high 80s across Milwaukee’s downtown.\n\nAnd as the afternoon has chugged along, Milwaukee’s Deer District has started to fill out with delegates, guests and volunteers spilling out from Fiserv Forum, seeking out cooling refreshments at local establishments like freshly opened New Fashioned, and its veteran neighbors, The DW Pub and The Mecca.\n\nConservative nonprofit Turning Point Action blasted out from speakers, ringing loudly throughout the plaza, discussing the recent pick of J.D. Vance as Trump’s vice presidential pick.\n\nFor Texan delegate alternate Rachel Sikes, it’s where she’ll celebrate her bachelorette party as the table calls for more cheese curds at The New Fashioned\n\n“It was just happenstance,” she said.\n\nShe’s getting married July 27. So far, they’ve enjoyed drinks on Lake Mendota in Madison, where they're staying.\n\nShe said she was OK with the vice presidential choice.\n\n“It wasn’t my first choice, but I support the president,” she said.\n\n— Vanessa Swales and Jordyn Noennig\n\nSenate candidate Rejani Raveendran campaigns at Red Arrow Park\n\nRejani Raveendran, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, was introducing herself to people in Red Arrow Park Monday afternoon to encourage them to vote for her in the Republican Party primary election Aug. 13.\n\nRaveendran was the first Republican candidate to challenge Tammy Baldwin, and will run against Eric Hovde inthe GOP primary. A U.S. citizen who immigrated from India and lives in Stevens Point, Raveendran worked as a nurse and is now at UW-Stevens Point, earning her degree in political science.\n\nShe said she's concerned about food and gas prices, border security and homelessness.\n\n“I just want to do what I can because I do not trust any politicians,” she said.\n\nRaveendran said she wasn't invited to speak at the convention and has received several phone calls from Republican leaders, asking her to step down and support Hovde.\n\n“I said I cannot do that, because I do not want to betray the people,” Raveendran said.\n\n— Bridget Fogarty, Gina Lee Castro\n\nWisconsin Republican Chairman Brian Schimming praises J.D. Vance as VP pick\n\nRepublican Party of Wisconsin Chairman Brian Schimming praised Trump’s vice presidential pick Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance as someone with a “compelling personal story” and said Vance’s Midwest ties could help Wisconsin Republicans.\n\n“As with most swing states, we’re looking for surrogates. We’re looking for people who can come in and identify with voters quickly,” Schimming said. “And he can do that.\"\n\n“That’s why it makes a difference,” Schimming added. “He can roll into a state like Wisconsin and immediately click. So anytime he wants to come to Wisconsin, I will put him in the car and personally drive him around.”\n\nAsked about Vance’s opposition to abortion, Schimming said Trump is the candidate “driving the issues and driving where people are.”\n\n“Donald Trump has not been laid back about saying, ‘Look, I’m not signing a national abortion ban,” Schimming said.\n\n— Lawrence Andrea\n\nWarm weather cools off sales for Convention Fest\n\nWalking outside in near 90 degree weather isn't an ideal shopping environment, but that was the case for the first day of Convention Fest.\n\nMonday, dozens of vendors showed off their products or services to credentialed delegates, media and other officials.\n\nMadan Raj, founder and president of Bobbletopia, started his company in Omaha, Nebraska, four years ago and quickly moved to Milwaukee.\n\nRaj had several versions of Trump in presidential form, but also as William Wallace from the movie \"Braveheart,\" and the Trumpinator, inspired by the \"Terminator.\"\n\n“People have taken pictures of the Trump bobbleheads,” Raj said, adding he’s had a few sales but many people have opted to buy items later in the week, so they don’t have to carry it as long.\n\nRaj said he's been working with the Committee on Arrangements for the Republican National Committee to register for the event and drop off his inventory.\n\n“They have great staff behind the scenes who take care of all of that. They set up the tent, the tables were provided. All I had to really take care of was inventory, which I brought in,” Raj said. “We had to set up Thursday and Friday. Secret Service did their sweep on the weekend ... and today, just final setup.”\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nProtest zones draw few demonstrators\n\nZeidler Union Square, one of the city’s two designated protest zones, has been empty for most of Monday, except for a couple dozen security staff.\n\nThere’s been more dog-walkers than protesters, a security staffer said. A small group of about 15 people were in the park earlier in the day.\n\nHaymarket Square, another of the city’s two protest zones, had no protestors at 4 p.m. The platform has been quiet all day.\n\n— Kelly Meyerhofer and Claudia Levens\n\nVance gets official RNC nomination for vice president\n\nHours after former Trump announced U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance was his pick for vice president, the nomination became official at the RNC in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nWhen Vance entered the arena, he was greeted by cheers and chants of “J.D.” as well as “USA!”\n\nHis welcome seemed to be delayed by an apparent teleprompter malfunction that led to a jam band playing for at least 30 minutes.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\n50 Cent memes flood social media, RNC appearance rumored\n\nJournalists at CNN reported Monday afternoon on X that rap icon 50 Cent has spoken with Republican officials about making an appearance at the convention, according to people \"familiar\" with the situation.\n\nThe rapper and producer for hit television shows has been trending on social media lately following Saturday's attempted assassination of Trump.\n\n50 Cent, born Curtis Jackson, survived a shooting in 2000. On the track “Many Men” from his 2003 album “Get Rich or Die Tryin,” 50 Cent raps about having enemies and people targeting him. The song has become a soundtrack for many on social media after the assassination attempt.\n\n50 Cent posted to X on Saturday his iconic album cover, edited with a picture of Trump instead.\n\n“Trump gets shot and now I’m trending,” he said.\n\nIn early June, 50 Cent and civil rights attorney Ben Crump appeared on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., to advocate for more opportunities in the liquor industry. Speaking with CBS News at the time, 50 Cent said that he hadn't decided who he wanted to vote for in the upcoming election but could see Black men \"identifying with Trump.\"\n\n— Drake Bentley\n\nRNC band steps up after apparent teleprompter malfunction\n\nA band was rocking out at Fiserv Forum after House Speaker Mike Johnson announced a teleprompter malfunction at the RNC.\n\nThe band played for about 30 minutes before the teleprompter started working properly again.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\nRepublicans, equipment makers address manufacturing at RNC event\n\nMilwaukee-based Association of Equipment Manufacturers hosted a policy-focused event Monday with Republicans Gov. Glenn Youngkin, of Virgina; U.S. Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, and U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin.\n\nA panel discussion addressed pro-growth economic policies, which Republicans say are necessary to bolster U.S. manufacturing and competitiveness.\n\nIt also highlighted the storied history that manufacturing and mining equipment manufacturer Komatsu have in Milwaukee.\n\nThe event was held at Komatsu’s mining equipment headquarters in Milwaukee’s Harbor District.\n\nKomatsu builds some of the world’s largest mobile land machines. Its biggest mining shovel weighs nearly 4 million pounds and has a bucket the size of a two-car garage. In front of the company's mining equipment headquarters in Milwaukee's Harbor District, there's a 60-foot-tall electric mining shovel and 850,000-pound truck on display.\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\nRipon’s Little White Schoolhouse gets an RNC roll call shoutout\n\nWhen Brian Schimming, chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, welcomed convention-goers during the RNC roll call at Fiserv Forum on Monday afternoon, he gave a shoutout to the GOP’s Wisconsin roots.\n\n“One hundred and seventy years ago, this great party was founded down the road in Ripon, Wisconsin, in a little white schoolhouse,” Schimming said, flanked by former Gov. Scott Walker and others.\n\nRipon’s Little White Schoolhouse is yet more proof that there is indeed always a Wisconsin connection.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\nStreet vendor selling bloody Trump photo and pins for $5 each\n\nA T-shirt vendor is selling Trump merchandise, including a photo and pin of Donald Trump after he survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on Saturday.\n\nFor delegates and credentialed guests looking to get their hands on the golden Trump sneakers for $600, 365 Campaign is selling two pairs outside the Baird Center, sizes 6.5 and 7.5, for $600 each.\n\n“They’re very hard to come by,” manager Anthony Montgomery said. “They sell out quick.”\n\nMontgomery has a pair of his own.\n\n“I just wanted to see what it felt like to walk like President Trump,” Montgomery said. “This is the closest thing to it.”\n\nBefore coming to Milwaukee, Montgomery said the company was selling merchandise in Pennsylvania when Trump was nearly killed by an assassin.\n\n“It felt like a regular rally,” Montgomery said. “President Trump showed up, and I call it the seven-minute speech because that’s literally all he really had before they tried to take his life.”\n\nMontgomery said the shots sounded like fireworks but when he saw people running, that’s when he knew something serious happened.\n\n“I felt disrespected in a sense,” Montgomery said. “I felt like, 'How could they let something like this happen?'”Montgomery said he tried to keep his composure and help out people where they needed it.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nTensions rise between RNC protesters, anti-abortion group at Red Arrow Park\n\nProgressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, an anti-abortion group, is demonstrating in Red Arrow Park, where protesters from the Coalition to March on the RNC are resting after their march.\n\nTensions are high between the anti-abortion group and those who disagree with them. But Coalition security guards formed a barrier around the group as they laid on the ground to demonstrate.\n\nThe group staged a “wedding” between the “abortion industry” and the Republican Party. A woman in white dress spattered with fake blood “married” a man wearing a pool noodle on his nose to represent an elephant trunk.\n\nA person was shouting through a bullhorn at close range to the group, and members of the group shouted back. One member activated a siren sound on his bullhorn.\n\nThis all occurred as speakers affiliated with the Coalition held their own rally feet away on the slab of concrete that in the winter serves as an ice rink.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nBiden-Harris campaign criticizes Trump VP pick\n\nBiden-Harris Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon criticized Trump’s selection of J.D. Vance as his running mate Monday afternoon.\n\n“Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,” Dillon said in a statement.\n\nShe also condemned Vance’s stances on abortion, tax cuts and certification of the 2020 presidential election. Vance is staunchly against abortion but told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he supports access to the abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nThe statement said the Biden-Harris ticket is “focused on uniting the country, creating opportunity for everyone and lowering costs” while the Trump-Vance ticket’s “harmful agenda will take away Americans’ rights, hurt the middle class, and make life more expensive — all while benefiting the ultra-rich and greedy corporations.”\n\nDemocratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler in a Monday statement said, “The stakes of this election just got impossibly higher” as a result of Trump’s selection of Vance as his running mate.\n\n“Should Donald Trump win another term in the White House, there’s no question that J.D. Vance would put loyalty to Trump and the GOP’s extreme agenda over the country,” Wikler said. “In election after election, we’ve seen Wisconsinites reject the extreme, anti-freedom Trump-Vance agenda — and they’ll do it again this November.”\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nTrump is officially nominated for president\n\nIt's official: Trump was officially nominated for president during the delegate roll call at the RNC Monday afternoon.\n\nEric Trump, Donald Trump's son, delivered the delegates that formally put the former president over the top, USA TODAY reported.\n\n“On behalf of our entire family and on behalf of the 125 delegates in the unbelievable state of Florida, we hereby nominate every single one of them for the greatest president that’s ever lived, and that’s Donald J. Trump, hereby declaring him the Republican nominee for president of the United States of America,” he said.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump has his VP pick: Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance\n\nA little over an hour before his vice presidential choice was set to be revealed, Trump announced on Truth Social that he chose U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio to be his running mate.\n\nVance will be \"strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American workers and farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond,\" Trump wrote.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC passes Fiserv Forum\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC 2024 passed the northern end of its march route a block from Fiserv Forum early Monday afternoon, crossing the Juneau Avenue bridge about 1:20 p.m.\n\nDespite its size, the group’s chants were largely inaudible to a reporter on the Deer District plaza, where music was playing and at least one interview was taking place over a loud speaker at one point.\n\nThe group stopped for a few minutes outside the entrance to the credentials-only “hard” security zone at North King Drive and West Highland Avenue. While they were there, their shouts mingled with music on the southeast end of the plaza.\n\nThe group had said its primary goal was to be within “sight and sound” of Fiserv Forum, and its route went right up against the fence that delineates the credentials-only “hard” zone from the security “footprint” where members of the public are able to enter.\n\nIts route took the group closer to Fiserv Forum than the city-designated demonstration area at Haymarket Square Park a bit farther north.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nParental rights, gender ideology take center stage in Heritage Foundation Policy Fest afternoon session\n\nHeritage Foundation researchers promoted traditional family values and bashed gender ideology during the afternoon panel of “Heritage Policy Fest: Fighting for America’s Future.”\n\nHeritage Foundation panelists Vice President of Domestic Policy Roger Severino, Senior Legal Fellow Sarah Parshall Perry, Senior Research Associate for the Tech Policy Center Daniel Cochrane criticized the Biden administration's handling of Title IX and children's social media usage in a panel moderated by conservative personality Liz Wheeler in the Bradley Symphony Center.\n\n“We have to take back as parents our God-given right to parent our children, even when it's tough,” Perry said.\n\nBiden, in one of his first executive actions , expanded federal anti-discrimination statutes that cover sex discrimination in regards to gender identity and sexual orientation, including for transgender individuals.\n\nPerry said the first thing she’d like to see Trump do in office is revoke “all guidance” on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n“From that first pebble, we see an avalanche of gender identity and orthodoxy in every system in America,” Perry said. “That is the primary responsibility, I think, of the next administration is to make sure that they don't sacrifice children on the altar of woke progressivism.”\n\nCochrane said gender ideology is spreading on platforms like Tik Tok. Panelists criticized youth access to inappropriate social media content and pornography. Cochran said sites like Tik Tok, Instagram and YouTube should enact age-verification requirements.\n\nPerry also said she wants Biden’s timeline on Title IX to remove expansions on gender ideology rescinded. She blamed teachers’ unions for “outsized influence” over educational policy agenda items like critical race theory, LGBTQ+ curriculum and hosting “drag queens for story hours.”\n\nLGBTQ+ experts say the Biden administration’s expansion of LGBTQ+ protections and gender affirming care has helped combat harassment and discrimination. His policies have earned him the endorsement of LGBTQ+ advocacy groups like the Human Rights Campaign.\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nCombating deep fakes in politics requires quick action but not over-reacting\n\nThe challenges posed by deep fakes in election campaigns are global, but on Monday, Microsoft Corp. addressed them as part of the RNC.\n\nDeep fakes are images, videos or audio recordings convincingly altered to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say. One example in the presidential campaign was a fake voice message claiming to be President Joe Biden urging New Hampshire voters not to take part in the primary election.\n\nMonday at noon, as part of its Democracy Forward campaign, Microsoft offered free training in identifying and addressing deep fakes, especially in political campaigns.\n\n“We’re very concerned about what the next few months look like leading into the U.S. election,” Ginny Badanes, general manager of Democracy Forward said in a Journal Sentinel interview.\n\n“I would say anywhere a political leader is talking publicly and being recorded, there’s a risk of that recording being manipulated to make it look like they said something at that event they didn’t say,” she added.\n\nA poorly made deep fake may be easy to identify. Voices that sound robotic, or unnatural speech patterns, are signs. Strange eye movements and a lack of blinking are other indicators. But detection is more difficult in a professionally made deep fake, and some of the most convincing are in local elections, according to Microsoft.\n\nA quick response, pointing people to the correct information, is important when a political campaign has been attacked with a deep fake or other type of false narrative.\n\nHere are some tips from Microsoft:\n\nInitiate an immediate response, based on factual data, that dismantles the falsehoods without amplifying them.\n\nTo start, evaluate the content’s potential impact. While a campaign may dislike AI-generated parodies of their candidate, an aggressive response risks being seen as humorless or suppressing free speech.\n\nFor content not warranting a serious response, options include ignoring it while monitoring for escalation or responding in a lighthearted manner, which can turn a negative into a positive. But if the content crosses ethical or legal boundaries, swift and unified action is necessary to contain its spread and control the narrative.\n\nBy promptly addressing false claims, you establish your version of events as the initial narrative, potentially inoculating audiences against subsequent misinformation.\n\nIf it’s a deep-fake video of a candidate, typically there’s a genuine video on which the fake was based. “That is one of the best antidotes, to get that out publicly, and say it’s the real video,” Badanes said.\n\nWhen deep fakes come with a high probability of losing votes, options include calling a press conference, issuing a public statement, or asking for a retraction. When there's a medium risk, options include activating supporter networks to push back, and considering a public statement. Low risk: Do nothing, so as not to amplify the falsehoods.\n\nHere’s a Microsoft quiz to test your abilities: Real Or Not (realornotquiz.com)\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\nSevere thunderstorms expected for Milwaukee area in late afternoon and evening\n\nThe National Weather Service says more severe thunderstorms will move into the Milwaukee area late this afternoon and into the evening, peaking between 6 and 10 p.m.\n\nSevere winds, heavy rain and hail are the main threats, though Milwaukee County has a 2-4% chance for tornadoes. Storms are expected to be stronger along Wisconsin's border with Illinois.\n\nThe outdoor Convention Fest is scheduled to end at 5:30 p.m., and the evening official session inside Fiserv Forum runs from 5:45 p.m. until 10 p.m. That means delegates and media are likely to be indoors when severe weather comes through.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nRNC uses influencers to reach young voters\n\nThe RNC is using a new method to reach youth voters this week — more than 70 influencers. Youth Advisory Council Co-Chairs Brilyn Hollyhand, 18, and CJ Pearson, 21, lead the effort.\n\n“Young people don't trust billboards, they don't trust pamphlets, they don't trust direct mail, they don’t trust TV ads. They trust people,” Pearson said. “If we can mobilize influencers to fight for America, to come to our side, we can mobilize legions of young people as well.”\n\nAmong them are former Miss Universe judge and social media personality Emily Austin, Mikel Simmons of Bravo’s “Southern Hospitality” and Xaviaer DuRousseau, a creator with conservative organization PragerU.\n\nDuRousseau said influencers help bridge the trust gap between candidates and voters.\n\n“We are able to make the information palatable,” DuRousseau said. “We've gone through all the fluff, we've seen the details. Now, here is a summarized version from me, an influencer, someone that you trust.”\n\nThe Democratic National Convention Committee last month announced similar plans to five influencers access credentials in Chicago.\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nAnti-abortion protesters rally in Haymarket Square\n\nAbout 50 anti-abortion protesters rallied at Haymarket Square Park around noon.\n\nAmong them was Matt Sande, Pro-Life Wisconsin legislative director. He said the initial goal was to encourage the Republican Party to strengthen their stance on abortion.\n\nBut after the RNC platform committee announced a softened stance on abortion, Sande turned from “frustrated” to “angry.”\n\n“The national Republican Party, the RNC and the president ought not to take the pro-life base for granted,” he said.\n\nHe said some who find the GOP abortion stance objectionable may stay home from the polls. Others will vote but will avoid enthusiastically door-knocking and other get-out-the-vote efforts, he said.\n\nHe said even if Trump were elected, it would be difficult to pass the kind of anti-abortion legislation he wants — such as a ban at conception or “fetal personhood” protections.\n\nFetal personhood would grant embryos and fetuses legal and constitutional protections that are equivalent to the person who's carrying them at every stage of pregnancy.\n\nLegal experts have said any recognition of fetal personhood could have ripple effects far beyond a nationwide ban on abortion with no exceptions, potentially outlawing in vitro fertilization, embryonic stem cell research and some forms of birth control.\n\n“This is really taking the air out of the tires,” Sande said. “Literally and emotionally, it’s deflating to the base.”\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nCheese curd vendor at Convention Fest brought over 360 pounds of cheese\n\nThere's one vendor at Convention Fest that will undoubtedly be popular: Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds, owned and operated by David and Sanita Hofer. They've been in business for 16 years, working about 60 fairs and festivals in the Milwaukee area each season.\n\n\"This is not our first rodeo,\" David Hofer said about introducing out-of-state visitors to cheese curds. He has a sign set up next to the tent that explains the process of making cheese curds.\n\nHofer likes fried and raw cheese curds equally, but \"every time I think I'm getting sick of eating fried curds, I find myself still eating fried curds.\"\n\nHofer first learned about Convention Fest by reading about it in the paper. They went to a trade show, and convention organizers asked them a few months ago if they'd be interested in being a vendor.\n\nHofer, who was working the booth Monday afternoon with his two daughters, was getting customers even before Convention Fest officially started at 2 p.m. And they expected to keep selling even after the event wraps up at 5:30 p.m.\n\nHe found a calculator and estimated he brought 360 pounds of cheese for the curds to Convention Fest, plus 60 pounds of sliced cheese for grilled cheese sandwiches. Those cheeses come from Ellsworth and Plymouth, Wisconsin.\n\n\"I'm just hoping that we can represent the great state of Wisconsin with high-quality food,\" Hofer said.\n\nThere were plenty more Wisconsin vendors outside, including a beef stick stand. Drink Wisconsinbly also had tents and displayed not-so-political signs, such as \"I support fish frys,\" \"Pro-beers & bratwursts\" and \"Vote yes: Brandy old fashioneds.\"\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nMilwaukee City Attorney Evan Goyke observes march\n\nCity Attorney Evan Goyke and former deputy city attorney Adam Stephens, who's working for the city this week as special counsel, observe the march from the front.\n\nGoyke declined to answer questions. He previously told the Journal Sentinel that he and Stephens would be observing protest activity around the RNC throughout the week.\n\nSo far, there hasn't been a large law enforcement presence around the march. A unit of officers on bicycles were seen staying a couple blocks away from the demonstration.\n\nMilwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman has said he wants the department to be largely \"invisible\" when it comes to policing mass demonstrations during the RNC.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC begins, route to go through downtown Milwaukee\n\nHundreds of people started marching at noon Monday.\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC has a planned route of heading south on Water Street, across the Milwaukee River on Wells Street, before marching south on Plankinton Avenue.\n\nThe group will then cross the river again and march north on Water Street to West Juneau Avenue, then south on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive before crossing the river again at West State Street.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nEvent staff near Haymarket Square are trained in de-escalation\n\nThe first two groups scheduled to speak at the Haymarket Square Park protest zone were no-shows.\n\nThat's according to Ashanti Hamilton, director of the city's Office of Community Wellness and Safety (formerly the Office of Violence Prevention). He was at the zone to coordinate the speaker's platform and a group of event security staff in orange shirts.\n\nMost of the staff were community organizers trained in de-escalation and mediation tactics, Hamilton said.\n\n\"These are the most experienced folks that we have in crowd control,\" he said.\n\nFrom 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., 15 speakers were scheduled to take to the platform, he said. Because the park was nearly empty, at least one group of protesters stopped by, then promptly left, Hamilton said.\n\nHe said the Trump assassination attempt changed the potential protest landscape.\n\n\"I'm just hoping, now that we have heightened tensions, that those things don't boil over into any of the demonstration activities,\" he said.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nBay View restaurant to donate portion of sales to progressive organizations this week\n\nBay View restaurant Heirloom MKE, 2378 S.

About a handful of security staff wearing bright orange T-shirts are scattered throughout the area.\n\nAt around 11:40 a.m., three people at the square's pavilion briefly read testimonies from both local and national victims of gun violence, attracting one spectator.\n\n— Quinn Clark\n\nRipon's Little White Schoolhouse replica at RNC built by high schoolers\n\nA replica of the Little White Schoolhouse from Ripon, Wisconsin, is on display at the RNC's Convention Fest outside the Baird Center and Panther Arena.\n\nA one-third scale replica of the schoolhouse, constructed by Ripon High School students for parades and city events, will be on display at the RNC.\n\nThe full-size schoolhouse was Ripon's first public school, built in 1853, and is now more popularly known as the Little White School House, the birthplace of the Republican Party.\n\n\"We are so excited to have a way to showcase the incredible history that took place here in Ripon 170 years ago,\" Ripon Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Mandy Kimes told the Fond du Lac Reporter. \"This is Ripon’s unique history and contribution to the development of our nation.\"\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nMilwaukee firefighter staffing double for RNC, union president says\n\nThe Milwaukee Fire Department is staffing about double its normal number of workers for the RNC.\n\nEric Daun, the president of the Milwaukee Professional Firefighters Association, said that, on an average day, there are about 200 firefighters staffed around the city, but there’s “well over 200” additional staff for the convention.\n\n“I would say the members are being taxed to the max of their capacity,” Daun said. “We’re doing it to the best of their ability. I’ll say that.”\n\nHe said the department is getting help from suburban Milwaukee County departments. However, unlike with the police, there’s no out-of-state help.\n\n“Stress is at a higher level, but it is what it is. It’s to be expected,” Daun said.\n\nMilwaukee Fire Chief Aaron Lipski said the department had responded to a handful of minor incidents Monday morning. Overall, he said the day was going well.\n\n\"We got a lot of the kinks out on Sunday,\" he said. \"We're feeling OK with things out here.\"\n\n— David Clarey\n\nAbout 500 people gather for Coalition the March on the RNC rally at Red Arrow Park before march\n\nWith a rally underway ahead of the noon march by the Coalition the March on the RNC, a crowd of about 500 has gathered at Red Arrow, so far smaller than what organizers said they anticipated, about 5,000.\n\nAttendees have come from across the country to bring attention to a range of issues.\n\nCharlie Berg came from Minneapolis with the Climate Justice Committee. He said the Democratic and Republican parties have both failed to address climate change.\n\n“We need a platform and policy that is actually going to address climate change and we can’t do that so long as we have U.S. militarism, so long as we have reliance on fossil fuels, and so long as those corrupt parties are in power,” Berg said.\n\nBadger Van Grey, who is hosting a sign-making station, said the most common signs have included a focus on immigrant rights, LGBTQ rights, “We can no longer afford the rich” and “Free Palestine.”\n\nA handful of counter-protesters are at Red Arrow, deriding LBGTQ+ people and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA speaker with the group said he was from Indiana and identified himself only as Jim with Street Preachers. The man protested outside the 2016 RNC in Cleveland and has appeared on college campuses for many years.\n\nSome march attendees stood around the small group to film them but there were few interactions.\n\n— Rory Linnane\n\nJournal Sentinel's JR Radcliffe, Kristin Brey preview RNC in Milwaukee\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC protesters speak about Gaza, abortion rights\n\nAs hundreds gathered in Red Arrow Park Monday, Kobi Guillory, a Chicago teacher and central committee member of Freedom Road Socialist Organization, kicked off the press conference with a focus on Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n“Our government, in a bipartisan initiative, is committing genocide in Palestine with our tax dollars and reinforcing daily militarism,” Guillory said.\n\nAhead of the march, Coalition Co-Chair Omar Flores said he expected the top issues for marchers would be abortion rights and standing with Palestinian people.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages in a cross-border raid into southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nIsrael has retaliated with an intense military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, including women and children, medical authorities in Gaza have said.\n\nSeveral people told the Journal Sentinel they had come from Atlanta and Minnesota with Gaza top of mind.\n\nVictoria Hinckley, who said she was expelled from the University of South Florida for her involvement in a Palestinian-solidarity encampment there, attended the march with others from Students for a Democratic Society. Hinckley’s remarks Monday focused on abortion.\n\n“These attacks on reproductive freedom and abortion access are harshly felt in the South, especially in states like Florida and Texas with the emergence of anti-abortion bills banning abortion within the first few weeks of pregnancy,” she said.\n\n— Rory Linnane and Ashley Luthern\n\nMilwaukee 70-something couple comes to march against RNC\n\nBill Nantell and girlfriend Kathleen Joynt, both in their mid-70s who live near downtown Milwaukee, said they came to Red Arrow Park Monday to march against Republican policies on abortion, racism and senior benefits.\n\n\"I have voted for both Democrats and Republicans,\" Nantell said. \"This is not a Republican Party I am familiar with at all.\"\n\nNantell said he would like President Joe Biden to step aside for a younger candidate. But he will vote for him if Biden stays in.\n\n— John Diedrich\n\nStreet evangelists among the few at Haymarket Square Park\n\nA handful of street evangelists stood in a strip of shade on Haymarket Square Park, at North King Drive and West McKinley Avenue, holding signs with Bible verses.\n\nOne man with a microphone was preaching to a near-empty park.\n\nWarren Marquardt of Polk City, Florida, affiliated with Calvary Chapel, said he attends four or five public events a year to spread his message. He recognized the other preachers as regulars at big events.\n\n“There’s no politician that’s going to come on the scene and make it all right,” he said.\n\nStirling Long of Dawsonville, Georgia, affiliated with Providence Bible Church, a Reformed Baptist church, held a sign that read, “Are you going to Heaven? Free test.”\n\nAsked about the Republican Party’s softer abortion stance in its RNC platform, Long said he would not “vote for baby killers.”\n\n“They’re doing it for votes,” he said. “This is a game.”\n\nMarquardt also distanced himself from the GOP stance on abortion, saying, “God will do what God wants to do,” no matter the president in office.\n\nElsewhere along the security perimeter, streets were quiet. Event security staff in orange T-shirts milled around chatting. Police boats trawled the river.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\n'Reagan' movie posters showing up around RNC security perimeter\n\nPosters for an upcoming movie on President Ronald Reagan have popped up around the security perimeter in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Reagan\" stars Dennis Quaid and is scheduled to be released Aug. 30.\n\nThe RNC is also screening \"Reagan\" all day every day in the Regency Ballroom at the Hilton Milwaukee City Center for convention-goers.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nConvention Fest sets up outside Panther Arena\n\nMid-Monday morning, white vendor tents were going up between the Baird Center and Panther Arena for Convention Fest, where those with credentials can experience local food and products.\n\nAmong the 100 local businesses participating in Convention Fest are Immy's African Cuisine and Scrima's Pizza. A Wisconsin cheese curds tent was in a prime location.\n\nIn the center of the road stood a replica of the Little White Schoolhouse from Ripon, Wisconsin, considered to be the birthplace of the Republican Party.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump expected to announce his VP pick Monday afternoon\n\nFox News’ Bret Baier says Trump confirmed to him he’ll announce his running mate Monday.\n\nSources said the schedule calls for a vice presidential nomination shortly after 3:30 p.m., local time; Trump may make an announcement before then.\n\nTop names for the spot include Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. But it’s not out of the question that Trump will make a more surprising pick.\n\nTrump had previously hinted he would announce his VP at the RNC, though that announcement typically came a few days before the convention in campaigns.\n\n— Hope Karnopp and USA TODAY's David Jackson\n\nArtists stage live climate change installation next to RNC security perimeter\n\nA team of actors and artists from Climate Power, a strategic communications organization that seeks to educate Americans on climate change, debuted a public art installation in the windows of the Germania Building, 135 W. Wells St., Monday morning. It’s located just outside the RNC's hard security perimeter.\n\nThe exhibit features five street-facing window displays depicting life-sized scenes of people affected by extreme weather situations, including excessive heat and flooding. Actors will bring to life the experiences of real extreme weather survivors who Climate Power and its partner artists have interviewed.\n\nNew York-based artist Annie Saunders said the installation is inspired by museum dioramas.\n\n“The aesthetic of a diorama is recognizable; it’s usually for history, it’s for prehistory, it’s for things that were frozen in time and are not happening anymore ...,” she said. “So, using that aesthetic to represent something that is happening but is being willfully ignored is what we’re trying to do.”\n\nThe first window of the exhibit depicts a child’s playroom affected by extreme heat. A small plastic chair is melting, crayon wax is pooling on the table, construction paper pinned to the wall is fading, and the wallpaper is curling at the edges. An actor tries frantically to start an air conditioner.\n\nAnother window shows men in suits sitting around an office table for a business meeting with their heads literally stuck in a pile of sand in the middle of the table. File cabinets in the hallway leading to the meeting room are strewn about and black tar leaks out of them.\n\nSaunders said this represents politicians and officials who “have their heads in the sand” when it comes to the effects of climate change and choose to accept donations from oil and gas companies.\n\n“The problem with climate change is it’s so conceptual, and the language is so saturated ...,” Saunders said. “It’s being communicated with words, which are fundamentally abstract objects, and you have to hear the word and then have a visual or an emotional response.”\n\nDue to the installation’s proximity to the RNC, Saunders said Climate Power hopes to send a message to elected officials and people in power. She hopes the images stick with officials and help them realize that they too could be the victims of extreme weather.\n\n“Extreme heat and these issues do not discriminate on the basis of wealth and power,” Saunders said. “It’s coming for everyone.”\n\nSaunders and the Climate Power team have been working on the installation for over two months and have been setting it up on the Germania Building’s first floor for five days. Passersby will be able to see it through the windows all day Monday and until about noon Tuesday.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nHundreds already gathering at Red Arrow Park for march on RNC\n\nOrganizers with the Coalition to March on the RNC 2024 are setting up Monday morning at Red Arrow Park, where they plan to hold a press conference at 10 a.m. and rally at 11 a.m. before marching in protest outside the RNC.\n\nSeveral hundred people already had gathered at the park by 10 a.m. and the event is expected to draw more than 5,000 people.\n\nOrganizers plan to march within a block of the convention’s main site, Fiserv Forum. They have remained committed to the plan despite heightened anxiety about security in the city after the apparent assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nThe coalition plans to avoid the credentials-only “hard” security zone around the RNC but plans to enter the “soft” security zone. While the city has a sanctioned march route in the soft zone, the group plans to take its own route to get closer to Fiserv.\n\nOn Friday, Coalition Co-Chair Omar Flores said the group had a \"handshake agreement\" with city officials that the group would be allowed to use its own route. City officials didn’t confirm such an agreement but confirmed they were working with the group to ensure marchers could safely exercise their rights.\n\nThe “soft” security zone has special rules under the city’s extraordinary event ordinance, including a ban on certain items like non-plastic water bottles, umbrellas with a metal tip, bike locks, and bags larger than 18-by-13-by-7 inches.\n\nThe Coalition consists of local and national organizations, including the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Reproductive Justice Action Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Anti-War Committee.\n\nWhile the groups' individual missions vary, the Coalition's shared priorities include fighting for reproductive rights, standing with Palestinians and defending the rights of immigrants and LGBTQ people. Many organizers are also unsatisfied with the Democratic Party and plan to protest the Democratic National Convention in August in Chicago.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nMajor Goolsby's teams with Broken Bat Brewing to release Screamin' Eagle Lager\n\nIf there's a official beer of the RNC, it might be at Major Goolsby's.\n\nThe well-known sports bar, just on the outside of the convention hard security zone, partnered with Broken Bat Brewing Company to release Screamin' Eagle Lager.\n\nThe restaurant describes the beer as \"crisp, refreshing.\" It's available in 16-ounce cans \"until we sell out!\"\n\n\"A beautiful spin on our traditional Eagle, all artwork was down by our very own Orissa Camille,\" the restaurant wrote on Facebook. \"Get them while they last!\"\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nLong lines form at security checkpoint outside RNC\n\nA long line of cars and other vehicles had formed by 8 a.m. along North Water Street, leading up to a security checkpoint on West Michigan Street near North Plankinton Avenue.\n\nThe cars were waiting to go through one of the five security checkpoints along the edge of the security zone surrounding the RNC.\n\nLaw enforcement personnel were instructing drivers at the checkpoint on West Michigan Street to open the hoods of their vehicles, roll down all windows and remain in their vehicles. Once at the checkpoint, law enforcement opened each vehicle’s trunk to check inside and walked a canine around the vehicle.\n\nFrom near the front of the line at 7:45 a.m., Olivia Rivers of Racine said she had been waiting in line about an hour and a half. She works at the 3rd Street Market Hall and had gotten in line about 6:20 a.m. She was supposed to start work at 7.\n\n“The Market Hall told us we’d need an extra hour of travel time,” she said. “I didn’t figure it would take this long.”\n\nBritney Carter of Milwaukee also works inside the security zone and was late to work Monday morning because of the delays.\n\n“I didn’t know it would be like this,” she said.\n\nShe works at the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra and waited in line for about 40 minutes.\n\nAvery Leo, who lives in the security zone, also didn’t expect the long wait and said he would consider taking a different route to get home.\n\n“It’s annoying,” he said.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\nDowntown RNC 'soft' security zone quiet\n\nThe downtown “soft” security zone/footprint where pedestrians can freely cross inside, was quiet Monday morning.\n\nPedestrians with various levels of credentials — or not — walked through and police at the fences denoting the credentials-only “hard” zone seemed relaxed. A few vehicles moved through the area.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nMicrosoft has 'deep fakes' training at noon and 5 p.m.\n\nAs part of its Democracy Forward campaign, Microsoft Corp. is offering free training in Milwaukee on Monday aimed at helping political campaigns, activists and party officials identify and address deep fakes, which are images or videos convincingly altered to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say.\n\nThe sessions, focused on women, democracy and elections, are at noon and 5 p.m. at Northern Lights, an event venue at 106 W. Seeboth St. Speakers will include Ginny Badanes, general manager of the Democracy Forward campaign; and Republican U.S. Reps. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma; Burgess Owens of Utah; and Kat Cammack of Florida.\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\nRon Johnson chart credited as difference-maker in Trump assassination attempt\n\nU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson may have played a serendipitous role in Trump surviving the Saturday assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.\n\nThat’s because Trump, as he detailed in an interview with the New York Post, turned his head slightly the moment before shots were fired to read a chart on illegal immigration. The source of that chart? Johnson, who spoke about it on Fox News's Special Report with Bret Baier.\n\nIn an interview with Baier, the senator said he initially showed a chart on illegal immigration to Trump on a plane ride to a rally in Green Bay. The senator said that Trump liked the chart, and his team took it, tweaked it and used it at the Saturday rally.\n\nA bullet pierced Trump's right ear, but he wasn't seriously injured.\n\n“I’m happy to have been of service there,” Johnson said on the Fox News program.\n\n— David Clarey\n\nPolice make two arrests Sunday near RNC security zone, welcome party\n\nPolice made two arrests near the Republican National Convention grounds and its events Sunday.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said both incidents involved drunk people. One person was arrested near the Summerfest grounds, near where a convention welcome party was being held, and another was arrested after driving into a security barrier near the convention.\n\n“The events overnight were described to me as really uneventful,” Johnson said at a morning press conference. “There’s been a lot of preparation that’s gone on into the planning of this political convention and the bulk of that planning has been directly involved in and around the area of public safety.”\n\n— David Clarey\n\nRNC weather: It'll be a hot, humid day, with a chance of storms Monday night\n\nThe weather forecast looks hot for the convention's first day.\n\nMilwaukee is expected to see a high of 89 degrees around 5 p.m., with a heat index of 95, according to the National Weather Service. Heat indices in the 90s are expected between 1 and 8 p.m. High humidity is also in the forecast throughout the day, causing things to feel \"uncomfortable,\" said Milwaukee-Sullivan NWS meteorologist Marcia Cronce.\n\nThe heat and humidity should feel similar to Sunday, when Milwaukee County was under a heat advisory. However, a heat advisory isn't expected to be issued Monday because heat indices will be just below 100 degrees instead of at or over 100, Cronce explained. Still, the Weather Service urges people to stay hydrated, limit time outside and take other precautions to prevent heat-related illness.\n\nShowers and thunderstorms are possible between 7 p.m. and midnight, with chances peaking at 62% around 9 p.m. Some storms could be severe, Cronce said, with damaging winds being the main threat.\n\nHeavy rain, hail and even tornadoes are possible, Cronce added. The risk for severe storms is more likely near the Illinois border. Brief, heavy downpours are likely but shouldn't stay over single areas for extended periods.\n\nThe hot weather should subside by Tuesday after a cold front moves in overnight, Cronce said.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nWhat time is the RNC? Here's the Republican National Convention schedule, events for Monday\n\nThe first official session of the convention starts at 12:35 p.m. and runs until 4:45 p.m. A second official session will follow at 5:45 p.m. and lasts until 10 p.m.\n\nHowever, the day is littered with events before and after the official sessions.\n\nThe events kick off at 8 a.m., with The Heritage Foundation’s policy-centric event called the Heritage Policy Fest: Fighting for America’s Future and state delegation breakfasts throughout the early morning. Other events include things like a screening of \"Reagan,\" the 2024 Dennis Quaid-led biopic of the former president.\n\nThe convention isn't open to the general public, but according to an RNC spokesperson, you can stream it on YouTube, X, Facebook Live, Rumble, Amazon Prime, Twitch and Direct TV.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel will also be streaming RNC events.\n\nThe City Channel will broadcast the Republican National Convention beginning at 6 p.m. Monday. It'll air 24/7 and end at midnight Friday. Viewers can watch via Spectrum Cable on Channel 25 as well as on the “Livestream 1” feed.\n\nOther coverage will be available through Spectrum News and Fox News Media.\n\nThe official convention watch party takes place each day at the Drink Wisconsinbly Pub, 320 W. Highland Ave., across from Fiserv Forum.\n\nThroughout the week, guests are invited to attend official sessions at the convention venues; group receptions; groups like Moms for Liberty, the American Jewish Committee and the European Union will host events; and there will be more movie screenings, too.\n\nMany events require tickets or registration and more information can be found here.\n\n— David Clarey\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson strikes tone of unity\n\nIn a briefing outside City Hall early Monday morning, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he would avoid focusing on political differences in light of the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nJohnson, a vocal supporter of President Joe Biden’s re-election bid, instead struck a tone of unity.\n\n“While Democrats and Republicans differ substantially on how we get there, the fact of the matter is … that we all want people of this country to succeed,” he said. “We want families in Milwaukee to have the opportunity to thrive. We want financial stability. We want peace, we want growth, we want health for citizens here, across our state and across our country.”\n\nJohnson also said he thought Biden was “showcasing leadership” in the wake of the attack on Trump by pausing political ads and events.\n\nHe also acknowledged the presidential election rematch between Trump and Biden in November.\n\n“Although the president may not be engaging in political activity in this specific moment in light of what’s happened, I’ve got no doubt that those things will continue,” Johnson said. “Obviously, the Democratic National Convention will take place in Chicago next month and the president will have the opportunity to showcase the difference between his policies, what he’s done, what he intends to do for the United States and its people in the future.”\n\nHe said he was looking forward to serving as a delegate at the Democratic National Convention and working to ensure Biden wins a second term in November.\n\nJohnson said he felt “great” about having the RNC in the city, saying he wanted the event to serve as a stepping stone toward further growth.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nRNC security plan 'strengthened,' Secret Service says\n\nThe Secret Service has \"strengthened\" its security plan in the wake of Saturday’s attempted assassination of Trump, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said in a statement Monday morning.\n\n“I am confident in the security plan our Secret Service RNC coordinator and our partners have put in place, which we have reviewed and strengthened in the wake of Saturday’s shooting,” Cheatle’s statement said.\n\n“In addition to the additional security enhancements we provided former President Trump's detail in June, we have also implemented changes to his security detail since Saturday to ensure his continued protection for the convention and the remainder of the campaign.”\n\nThe statement comes a day after the Secret Service’s RNC coordinator, Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, said the agency was “not anticipating any changes to our operational security plans.”\n\nIn Monday’s statement, Cheatle said the security plans for events like the RNC are “designed to be flexible.”“As the conventions progress, and in accordance with the direction of the President, the Secret Service will continuously adapt our operations as necessary in order to ensure the highest level of safety and security for convention attendees, volunteers and the City of Milwaukee,” she said.\n\nThe Secret Service has come under intense scrutiny after a gunman was able to shoot and injure Trump in the right ear during a campaign rally Saturday in Pennsylvania from a nearby rooftop. One man, Corey Comperatore, was killed and two people were injured, and Secret Service snipers killed the gunman, identified by the FBI as Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\nTrump will appear at the convention on Monday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will make an appearance Monday at the Republican National Convention, said RNC committee member David Bossie in an interview with WISN-TV (Channel 12).\n\nTrump has yet to name his vice presidential pick. Asked whether a running mate would join Trump on stage Monday, Bossie said: \"I don't get ahead of him, but that's — the plan is, it's imminent, for certain.\"\n\nTrump’s motorcade arrived Sunday night at the Pfister Hotel, where many expect he'll be staying.\n\nSecret Service agents lined the perimeter and eyed the surrounding rooftops as dozens of SUVs pulled up to the storied hotel.\n\nTrump, however, could not be spotted exiting his vehicle. A tent was waiting outside the entrance, and security quickly pulled the curtains shut.\n\n— Genevieve Redsten\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC 2024 will continue as planned Monday\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC held a press conference Sunday afternoon to share updates on their planned march route Monday.\n\nOn Friday, organizers shared a revised route plan and said they had reached a “handshake agreement” with the Milwaukee Police Department and the city attorney’s office, though city officials didn't confirm the agreement.\n\nOmar Flores, the coalition’s co-chair, said the group reconfirmed the route with the city Saturday night.\n\nThe group said Sunday that a representative from the city attorney’s office would join the route “to ensure that there’s no problems.”\n\nThe route is separate from the city’s designated parade route.\n\nFlores said the attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump does not change their messaging. Asked multiple times by reporters if the group condemned the shooting, Flores repeated “it has nothing to do with us.”\n\nThe coalition will hold a press conference 10 a.m. Monday, followed by a rally at 11 a.m. and a march at noon. The group currently only plans to march Monday.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nWhat road closures and parking restrictions will be in place during the RNC?\n\nNumerous downtown Milwaukee streets will be closed in downtown Milwaukee in and around the security perimeter until Friday at about 1 a.m.:\n\nWest Wisconsin Avenue closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and James Lovell Street\n\nWest Wells Street closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and James Lovell Street\n\nWest Kilbourn Avenue closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and North 8th Street\n\nKilbourn Avenue exit tunnel closed from Interstate 43\n\nKilbourn Avenue entrance tunnel closed to I-43\n\nWest State Street closed between North 8th Street and Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive\n\nWest Juneau Avenue closed between North 8th Street and Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive (Moderne Condo garage will be accessible to residents)\n\nNorthbound I-43 offramp closed at eastbound and westbound Fond du Lac Avenue\n\nWest Fond du Lac Avenue, West McKinley Avenue and East Knapp Street closed between I-43 and North Water Street\n\nOld World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, no northbound traffic past West Juneau Avenue (the Aloft Hotel will be accessible to guests)\n\nOld World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, no southbound traffic past West McKinley Avenue\n\nNorth Vel R. Phillips Avenue closed between West Michigan Street and West McKinley Avenue (the parking garage entrance on North Vel R. Phillips Avenue immediately south of West Michigan Street will be accessible to vehicles)\n\nNorth 6th Street closed between West Michigan Street and West McKinley Avenue (the 5th Street Parking Garage will be accessible to residents of the 550 Ultra Lofts Building and guests of the Trade Hotel via 6th Street)\n\nNorth James Lovell Street closed between West Wells Street and West Juneau Avenue\n\nSouthbound I-43 ramp closed from Fond du Lac Avenue\n\nEastbound I-794 ramp closed from North James Lovell Street\n\nAlso, the westbound I-794 ramp to the northbound I-43 ramp will have intermittent closures as needed for bus traffic.\n\nWidespread street parking restrictions will also be in effect until Sunday.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nHow will the RNC affect public transportation?\n\nMultiple Milwaukee County Transit System bus routes will be disrupted or follow detours until Friday, including the East-West Bus Rapid Transit CONNECT 1. There will also be disruptions to the County's paratransit service, Transit Plus, for riders with disabilities.\n\nBublr Bikes, Milwaukee's bikeshare system, will shut down seven of its stations until Friday. The stations are all located downtown in and around the security perimeter.\n\nMilwaukee's Hop streetcar will run on a normal schedule from 5 a.m. to midnight and arrive every 15 minutes.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nWhen does the RNC start? When is the Republican National Convention?\n\nThe RNC begins Monday, July 15.\n\nHow long does the RNC last? What are the RNC convention dates?\n\nThe convention runs four days, from Monday, July 15 through Thursday, July 18.\n\nHow to watch the RNC convention\n\nThe convention venues are closed to all but delegates, politicians, media members and volunteers. However, there are plenty of ways to watch the RNC. Numerous platforms will stream the convention, including the Journal Sentinel. FOX News Media will also have coverage across all of its platforms.\n\nWhat's the RNC 2024 convention schedule?\n\nHere's the master schedule of events for the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe convention is closed to all but delegates, politicians, media members and volunteers.\n\nThroughout the week, guests are invited to attend official sessions at the convention venues; affinity group receptions; lectures and presentations; and film screenings.\n\nMany events require tickets or registration; be sure to consult the master calendar for information on how to register.\n\nThe official convention watch party takes place each day at the Drink Wisconsinbly Pub, 320 W. Highland Ave., across from Fiserv Forum.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nWhat's the RNC convention location?\n\nFiserv Forum, home of the Milwaukee Bucks, is the main venue for the RNC. That's also where the first Republican debate was held in August. Thousands of delegates will gather there to hear the big speeches.\n\nThe nearby University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena and the Baird Center will also be used as spaces for the event.\n\nHere's more about each venue:\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nCan I get tickets to the Republican National Convention?\n\nUnless you're a delegate, politician, media member or volunteer, you won't be able to attend the RNC. Those attendees already have credentials to get inside the convention venues.\n\nIn other words, you can't buy a ticket to get into the convention if you're a member of the public.\n\nBut there are other RNC-related events that are open to the public. And, there are plenty of ways to watch the RNC. Numerous platforms will stream the convention, including the Journal Sentinel. Fox News Media will also have coverage across all of its platforms.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nWhen is the Democratic National Convention, or DNC, in 2024?\n\nThe Democratic National Convention will be held in Chicago — less than 100 miles south of the RNC — from Aug. 19 to Aug. 22.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/op-ed/greg-moore/2024/08/22/trump-weird-supporters-arizona-visit-rally/74875034007/", "title": "Trump has 'weird' supporters at his Arizona rallies. They scare me", "text": "Donald Trump is returning to Arizona this week, visiting the border on Thursday and holding a rally in Glendale on Friday, but I won’t be anywhere near him.\n\nI’ve covered politics for much of the last 20 years, including Trump campaign rallies, and I’ll never do it again.\n\nIt’s not about Trump.\n\nHe’s a presidential candidate for a major political party, and therefore merits coverage regardless of how much his lies and election denials and racist statements bother me, personally.\n\nJournalists, especially opinion journalists such as myself, should call out these missteps loudly and frequently. It’s our role in making sure our nation has a strong democracy.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nBut I’ll be doing it from the office. Because Trump’s supporters are often, well, weird.\n\nGood people support Trump. They're not the issue\n\nI don’t say that lightly.\n\nI’m not a fan of Tim Walz branding Trumplicans with the “weird” sobriquet. For me, the Michelle Obama “when they go low, we go higher” strategy has the most dignity.\n\nAnd if I were a GOP strategist, I’d be printing up “weirdo” T-shirts as a point of pride, turning the insult into a battle cry.\n\nAlso, some of my closest friends are Trump supporters. I attend a predominantly white evangelical Christian church, and Trump bumper stickers aren’t hard to spot. (Although, as one of the few African American congregants, I’m probably just as easy to pick out in the parking lot.)\n\nThese are good people who oppose abortion from the depths of their souls, and they can speak reasonably about complicated issues. To have the opportunity to learn from them is a privilege, even as we disagree on whether Trump is fit to guide the nation.\n\nThe problem is the supporters who get rowdy\n\nMy problem is with the Trumpers who — how can I put this delicately? — like to get a little rowdy.\n\nYou know, the ones who show up at polling places armed for combat? Or the ones who tried to take over the U.S. Capitol in a deadly riot? Or the ones who carried tiki torches through Charlottesville?\n\nTrump might consider them as “very fine people,” but they scare me.\n\nI was wrong about Harris: That's a problem for Trump\n\nSometimes, the people at Trump rallies are kind of funny.\n\nConsider the older Black woman, an entrepreneur of the highest order, who was selling Trump condoms outside an event in Milwaukee in 2016. The prophylactics were $5 each, and they said “Trump” in big, bold letters.\n\nShe was screaming, “Trump condoms! … Next time you get that rump, think of Trump!”\n\nWeird.\n\nI don’t know what else to call it.\n\nTheir behavior is weird. How else do you say it?\n\nOr the white woman selling Trump T-shirts and Confederate flags from the back of her truck at a Phoenix rally in 2020.\n\nI was sitting in my car across from her tent, talking on the phone to a source, when she came over to my window, knocking violently, demanding to know what I was doing there and threatening to call the police.\n\nShe had no authority to question me. And given the state of race relations in the nation at the time, she was trying to use the police to bully me for simply existing within her line of sight.\n\nAgain, weird.\n\nFor me, I can’t understand how conservatives of conscience could allow a candidate like Trump to represent them. Or at least why they aren’t louder in demanding he stop dog whistling to these weirdos.\n\nSo, I won’t be going to the border on Thursday or the rally on Friday.\n\nI love my job.\n\nBut I love my safety and sanity more.\n\nTrump doesn't worry me as much as they do\n\nI’ll watch the videos of what he says, and if there’s good reason for me to give my opinion, I will.\n\nAgain, it’s my job.\n\nBut it’s not my job to put myself in harm’s way, even if I still regret not buying one of those condoms as a souvenir. (I just wasn’t about to walk past the “Hillary for Prison” T-shirts with AK-47s printed near her name to get one.)\n\nIt’s not Trump who worries me as much as it is some of the people who support him.\n\nThey’re the reason I don’t intend to ever go to another Trump rally.\n\nReach Moore at gmoore@azcentral.com or 602-444-2236.

But he's busy writing a piece about that decision for AOPA, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association magazine. At age 85, two decades after his 19-year run as lead news anchor at WDIV-TV (Channel 4), Crim is still thriving by turning the page.\n\n“You’ve got to keep moving,” the familiar, reassuring voice says via telephone from his home near Jacksonville, Florida. “Life is a journey.”\n\nCrim, 85, has compellingly annotated that journey in an autobiography titled \"Anchored: A Journalist’s Search for Truth.\" He reports and reflects on events along a path from his childhood in rural downstate Illinois to on-air prominence in two major television markets and network radio. As with every life’s journey, Crim’s featured a few wrong turns. He doesn’t spare himself in telling the tale.\n\nCrim’s Detroit tenure, from 1978 to 1997, put him front and center in one of the more important ownership shifts in Detroit newspaper and television history. Ownership of a major TV station is, after all, more than a business proposition: It is an enormous influencer of a city’s self-image.\n\nWhen owners of the Washington Post and the Detroit News, nudged by media regulation law, decided in 1977 to swap television stations they owned in the nation’s capital and in the Motor City, it set a tone for news and public affairs at Channel 4 that would last for decades. Washington-based Post-Newsweek would trade its D.C. station and $2 million in cash for the historic station founded in Detroit by the Evening News Association.\n\nChannel 4’s new owners installed Crim as their new acquisition’s franchise player. He soon became one of the most famous faces in town. All but the youngest Detroit generations still recognize his avuncular voice on occasional television ads.\n\nA rural boyhood\n\nCrim grew up in a culture far removed from Detroit’s. West Frankfort, Illinois, lies in the deep southern part of the state, equidistant from the Kentucky and Missouri borders. Crim describes his hometown as “culturally more Southern than Western … a bastion of ultra-conservatism and racism.” African Americans were banned from the city after dark. His father and his father’s twin brother were preachers in the Church of God denomination. “We had so many clergy in our family,” Crim writes, “we could have started our own denomination.”\n\nCrim originally intended to climb his family tree into the pulpit. His book includes a photograph of 16-year old Morton Crim at a revival. When he began to seriously think of abandoning the family trade for a broadcasting career and found himself conflicted about the decision of whether to abandon the ministry, he wrote to Chicago-based Paul Harvey for advice. Harvey, then the biggest voice in radio, said he wouldn’t vote either way, but suggested that radio could use a man of integrity. Young Mr. Crim took that as a yes.\n\nIn the end, prayer and preparation led Crim into broadcasting. He apprenticed on the Armed Forces Radio Network while in the Air Force, then graduated from Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism in 1964. He landed a job at New York City’s WNEW-AM, then moved on to the ABC Radio Network, where he was an officemate of Ted Koppel and Dr. Joyce Brothers. Anyone listening to the moon launch on the ABC Radio Network heard Crim describe the mission.\n\nBy the 1970s, the action was in television. Crim knew it, and that’s where he headed.\n\nWith none other than Walter Cronkite vouching for Crim’s journalistic chops, the young newsman landed a job on Louisville’s WHAS-TV, that city’s CBS affiliate. His old calling as a preacher proved a good foundation for making the leap to TV. “I had delivered hundreds of sermons and speeches, was very comfortable at the podium,” Crim wrote, “and thought that looking into a camera and reading the news should come quite naturally.”\n\nHis next stop, Philadelphia’s KYW-TV, punched his ticket to the big time. The station paired Crim with a young anchorwoman, Jessica Savitch, who would go on to national stardom at NBC before her untimely death by drowning in a car accident. Crim and Savitch were supremely simpatico on-air, fronting one of the most successful local news operations in the country. The Eastern TV establishment, including network executives, took notice.\n\nIn an unflinchingly honest recounting, Crim’s book describes how his on-camera relationship with Savitch morphed into an off-camera affair that began when he visited Savitch’s apartment for Chinese food between newscasts. He writes that the affair “unleashed a torrent of guilt and regret unlike anything I ever felt. A romantic involvement with Jess was wrong. It violated everything I believed about commitment and marriage.”\n\nIt sent Crim into a “dark tunnel.” How much did his wife, Nicki, know? According to Crim, she never asked about the relationship and had no interest in details. The affair was broken off. Savitch left for NBC News. Crim felt he needed to get out of Philadelphia.\n\nAfter a brief, unhappy stint at Chicago’s CBS-owned television station, Crim settled on Detroit’s Channel 4, which had faced challenges for almost a decade. Television news was changing, but the station wasn’t changing with it.\n\nA TV market primed for change\n\nChannel 4 was Detroit’s first television station. The Evening News Association, parent company of the Detroit News, made Channel 4 the local news leader well into the 1960s. Then came an event that changed the city and another that had an equal effect on the Detroit broadcasting landscape. The first was the 1967 civil disturbance in which 43 people died in a five-day insurrection. The second was the American Broadcasting Co.’s decision to pour money into its Detroit station, WXYZ-TV (Channel 7).\n\nChannel 7 hired a brash young radio newsman named Bill Bonds while a nine-month newspaper strike shuttered the News and the Free Press in 1967 and 1968, delivering a monumental gift to local television. The newspapers went dark during some of the most consequential months in U.S. history, including the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, the Vietnam War and the announcement that President Lyndon Johnson would not run for re-election. Detroiters turned to TV find out what was happening.\n\nChannel 4, under ENA ownership, never adapted to the new world of the 1970s. Local news, led by Bonds’ swagger and pizzazz, infused events of the day with drama and energy. Meanwhile, Channel 4 had Dean Miller, a competent anchorman, but a man of the 1950s who had played the character Matt Henshaw on CBS’s “December Bride” from 1954 to 1959.\n\nFederal courts changed the playing field, coincidentally pushing open the door that led to Channel 4’s rejuvenation.\n\nA case making its way through the federal system hinged on whether a newspaper should be allowed to own a television station in the market where it published. The thinking was that a newspaper/TV station combo gave the owners too much of a monopoly on information in a city. This sounds quaint in an era when cable television, the internet, social media, podcasting and smartphones spew news endlessly in real time. But the legal threat was real, and most analysts thought the U.S. Supreme Court would agree with a lower court ruling. To avoid losing their television licenses, which amounted to ATM machines with transmitters, the Evening News Association and Post-Newsweek decided to make a deal under their own terms rather than under judicial threat. It was announced in late 1977.\n\nThe timing for Crim could not have been better. He was about to be out of a work as an anchorman in Chicago. And Post-Newsweek wanted a new anchorman in Detroit.\n\nJim Snyder, the new Channel 4 news director, pitched Crim: “Seems to me there could be a lot worse ways to spend the second half of your career than help an old, beat-up city find its way back.”\n\nThe word went out that Crim would get $200,000 a year, making him the “highest-paid anchorman” in town. The newspapers referred to the amount constantly. Problem: This sent the mercurial Bonds into overdrive, although Bonds would eventually get to the million-dollar-year club.\n\nCrim’s description of Bonds: “Loud, arrogant, hard-drinking, profane, funny and at times totally outrageous.” All true. But Detroiters liked it, and awarded Channel 7 impressive ratings for a decade. The late Sonny Eliot, the longtime Channel 4 weatherman, warned Crim going in: “You have your work cut out.”\n\nSo there it was: Crim was cast as the anti-Bonds. Post-Newsweek knew the turnaround would take time.\n\nInitial reception was brutal. Channel 4’s newcomers were branded as carpetbaggers. The Free Press’ Chris Stoehr made fun of the moisture she saw on Mort Crim’s lip one night. Some of the news choices could be a bit stuffy, such as Crim on a tour of European transit systems. Crim became so rattled by the lack of progress he offered to resign.\n\nPost-Newsweek worked hard to overcome that outsider image. While many companies were bolting to the suburbs, the company put up a new building on the west end of downtown Detroit, making it —still —the only Detroit TV station with offices inside the Detroit city limits. The tab for the new digs: $13.5 million (almost $38 million today), graced with work by Detroit artists.\n\nThe station immersed itself in uniquely Detroit events, including the airing of Detroit’s Thanksgiving Day parade and Fourth of July fireworks. There were Dick Purtan comedy programs and a half-dozen or more Count Scary specials. A new jingle, \"Go 4 It,\" was sung by Detroit artists. The station aired Detroit Tiger games in 1984, a year the team won the World Series. Channel 4 hired Eli Zaret, the young sportscaster who had developed a hip fan base with his sportscasts on WJZZ-FM and later WRIF-FM. The station assembled a stellar collection of reporters, such as Jennifer Moore, Anne Thompson, Mike Wendland, Mike Lewis and others.\n\nThe uphill climb was slow, but progress was steady. Detroit Free Press critic Mike Duffy wrote in 1982: “Channel 7 and its undisputed news prince, Bill Bonds, have been sitting on a big lead that has now eroded to the point of serious concern.”\n\nCrim meanwhile gained national visibility as a regular substitute for his former adviser, Paul Harvey. That all came to an end when Crim, his wife, Harvey and Harvey’s wife, Angel, met for lunch.\n\nAngel Harvey asked Crim whether he believed in the Bible, adding “… if you believe the Bible, and you believe the prophecies, then we know the whole world is going to be destroyed by fire. That probably means there’ll be a nuclear war. Do you think we can stop a prophecy?”\n\nCrim’s reply: “I don’t think prophecy is my business as a Christian.” He had challenged Angel. Not a good career move. Only two days later, Crim’s days of subbing for Harvey were over. Crim would retire from Channel 4 at age 65. He says it was his choice. He had plans of developing his company, Mort Crim Communications, and boosting a nationally syndicated radio show.\n\nPromotional material touts Crim’s book as “the Legendary Journey of the REAL Ron Burgundy.” It’s an odd choice, considering the loathsome nature of imaginary anchor Burgundy, played by actor Will Ferrell in two \"Anchorman\" movies. But Crim meeting Ferrell is the lead anecdote of the book, and promotional material tends to be grabbed from, well, page one. The dust jacket includes a photo of Ferrell in full Burgundy mode, clueless and arrogant. (Sample line from the movie script: “I’m very important. I have many leather-bound books and my apartment smells of mahogany.”)\n\nCrim's book also has a spiritual side. He may have left the pulpit, but the pulpit hasn't left him.\n\nAs he writes: “I believe it was the spirit of unconditional love for all humanity that survived (Jesus’) grave; it was hope, meaning and confidence that there is an ultimate purpose to my life and to yours.” He adds that his spirituality meant taking “time to listen to a discouraged or distraught friend, or make an extra effort to speak to that colleague who was unpopular, even shunned by his coworkers.”\n\nHow it all turned out\n\nAnd here, as Paul Harvey said to millions of listeners, the rest of the story:\n\n• Savitch anchored a news brief on NBC, apparently drunk, stoned, or both. One of her first calls when she got off the air, knowing she had made a serious mistake, was to Crim. She died in 1983 when her car plunged into a creek in Pennsylvania. Police said no alcohol was involved.\n\n• Devin Scillian, Crim’s replacement at Channel 4, still anchors the news, and Bernie Smilovitz still does sports. Carmen Harlan only recently retired.\n\n• Post-Newsweek eventually spun apart when Katherine Graham’s descendants sold off the Washington Post to Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. But the Graham family kept Channel 4 and the rest of the Post-Newsweek TV stations. Crim’s biggest gift to his employer may be the sense of stability.\n\nStability. What a concept.\n\nTim Kiska is an associate professor in the Language, Culture, and Communication Department at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.\n\n'Anchored: A Journalist's Search for Truth'\n\nBy Mort Crim\n\nBeaufort Books, 352 pages, $24.95\n\nYou can get a copy of the book, complete with autograph if you wish, at https://www.mortcrimspeaks.com/.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/us/highland-park-suspect-family-turmoil-invs", "title": "Highland Park gunman's family was in turmoil for years leading up to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Bob’s Pantry and Deli opened for business in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park in 2008, loyal customers lined up in the snow at 4 a.m. to support Bob Crimo, who was striking out on his own after years running a convenience store franchise. Photos from opening day showed customers hoisting massive sandwiches and Crimo posing with his beaming family – including his eight-year-old son Robert Crimo III, who went by Bobby.\n\nThe deli quickly became a popular local fixture: a hangout spot for teenagers, a friendly gathering place for the neighborhood, and a pit stop for an affordable, delicious lunch.\n\nBut behind the scenes, the Crimo family was in turmoil. Police reports show that officers were regularly called to their home over domestic disputes between Crimo and his wife, and in 2019, police briefly confiscated a collection of knives after then 18-year-old Bobby threatened to “kill everyone.”\n\nMore recently, after the once-bustling deli closed, the family appeared to fall into dire financial straits, with foreclosure cases proceeding against both of the homes they owned and Bob Crimo telling a judge several weeks ago he was on food stamps.\n\nThen, as Highland Park prepared to celebrate the Fourth of July this week with the annual parade through the city’s picturesque downtown, Bobby allegedly climbed onto a cosmetics store rooftop with a semi-automatic rifle and opened fire on the festivities, killing seven people and injuring dozens of others.\n\nIn the wake of the tragedy, the close-knit community of Highland Park is reeling and trying to understand a massacre with no apparent motive. Locals said that it was even more shocking that the shooter was Bobby Crimo – the son of a well-known local figure beloved by his regular customers, who even ran for mayor several years ago.\n\nBob Crimo at the Bob's Pantry and Deli opening in 2008. Obtained by CNN\n\nThe elder Crimo is facing scrutiny in part because he sponsored a permit allowing his son to purchase firearms before he turned 21, including the gun he used in the shooting. Locals who once lined up for “Nicky D” sandwiches at Bob’s say they can’t comprehend how the family could have missed warning signs, including violent imagery in the music videos Bobby posted online, or why Crimo would have signed the gun permit application.\n\n“To be that irresponsible and signing off is mind-blowing to me,” said Barbara Medina, a longtime Highland Park resident who often shopped at the deli and was marching in the parade when the shooting took place. “It’s a shock that it’s anybody in your town, that they could come in and do that to their own community.”\n\nCrimo did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment, but in an interview with the New York Post, he said he had no idea Bobby was preparing to commit the shooting and that he wasn’t responsible for his son’s actions.\n\n“I’ve been here my whole life, and I’m gonna stay here, hold my head up high, because I didn’t do anything wrong,” he declared.\n\nPolice called to family home several times\n\nMore than a dozen Highland Park residents who knew the shooter or his family spoke to CNN about his upbringing, as they tried to piece together how their city had joined the long list of American communities whose names have become shorthand for mass shootings.\n\nBy all accounts, Bobby Crimo was a quiet kid, who could be seen running around his dad’s shop as he grew up. His father ran the White Hen Pantry, a franchise of a local convenience store chain that became known for its sandwiches.\n\nIn an affluent lakeside suburb where most shops closed early, the White Hen Pantry was open 24 hours, giving teenagers a safe hangout spot at night. Regulars remembered the elder Crimo as a gregarious, generous presence who would let customers waiting on a paycheck buy food on credit, and who seemed to be manning the counter at all hours of the day and night.\n\nLocals described Crimo as “the mayor of Ravinia,” the local neighborhood where the store was located, who knew all his customers and their regular orders.\n\nLoyal customers eagerly await the opening of Bob Crimo's deli in 2008. Obtained by CNN\n\nCrimo could be eccentric: One time, a friend said, he competed with another local restaurant owner to see which business could go longer without replacing any lightbulbs – until both stores were almost completely dark.\n\nCrimo’s shop closed after 7-Eleven bought out the White Hen Pantry chain. But Crimo reopened in a new location under his own name, and his loyal clientele followed.\n\nStill, there were signs of trouble in the family. One longtime customer and friend of Crimo’s — who asked to remain anonymous to speak candidly about the family — remembered that he and his wife, Denise Pesina, would have heated arguments in the deli, even in front of customers.\n\n“It was awkward for people,” the friend said. “I remember thinking, if that’s the public arguments, I can only imagine the private ones.”\n\nPolice reports released this week show that the couple’s fights continued behind closed doors. In the six years after the deli opened, officers were called to their home at least a dozen times to settle domestic disputes or respond to allegations that one or the other was intoxicated.\n\nIn one 2010 incident, Crimo alleged that Pesina “had hit him with a screwdriver on the left forearm” – before recanting once he got to the police station – and in another, he claimed she hit him on the head with a shoe.\n\n“He threatens to call the police for any and every argument we get in,” Pesina wrote in one handwritten witness statement. “He says he wants the police to think I’m crazy.”\n\nThere is no record that any of those incidents led to criminal charges against either Crimo or Pesina.\n\nThe two separated at some point, according to friends, with Pesina staying in their Highland Park home and Crimo moving to his father’s home in neighboring Highwood. Bobby lived in both homes over the years.\n\nPesina had had another brush with the law as well: In 2002, when Bobby was nearly two years old, she was arrested for child endangerment after allegedly leaving him in a locked car at a Toys-R-Us parking lot for about 27 minutes on a 79-degree day with the windows rolled up, according to court documents. Pesina pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment, and completed a year of court supervision.\n\nPesina did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment. Her lawyer at the time, Steven Lunardi, said that she admitted having made a mistake.\n\nJeremy Cahnmann, who taught Bobby and his brother in an elementary after-school sports program, said the boys stuck out in his memory because their parents almost never picked them up on time.\n\n“I remember talking to faculty at the school about how uninvolved the parents were,” he said. Bobby was “always the kid there at the end who didn’t get picked up.”\n\nFormer classmates describe suspect as withdrawn and odd\n\nAt school, Bobby kept to himself, with former classmates of the future gunman describing him as an odd, soft-spoken kid who showed little interest in class, school activities or his peers. But he explored a different side of his personality with rap songs and music videos he posted online – some of which included troubling imagery.\n\nMolly Handelman, who attended middle school and high school with Bobby, described him as a “very quiet” guy. “When he did talk, he was very soft. He didn’t seem aggressive ever, at all,” she said.\n\nHandelman, who worked with Bobby on class projects a few times, said “something definitely seemed off” about him. “He made it very clear he didn’t care about school,” she said.\n\nAnother former classmate who asked not to be named due to privacy concerns said he and Bobby used to hang out, play video games and skateboard together in middle school. “He would make YouTube videos all the time back then,” the classmate said, “DIY videos on how to grip a skateboard or replace a wheel, stuff like that.”\n\nBut in high school, the former classmate said, Bobby grew more insular and distant. “He was always by himself,” he said. “No one seemed to try to be his friend.”\n\nAccording to a school district spokesperson, Bobby stopped attending Highland Park High School in 2016, after his freshman year. It’s unclear whether he went to another school after dropping out.\n\nA body is transported from the scene of a mass shooting during the July 4th holiday weekend in Highland Park, Ill. Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune/AP\n\nIn recent years, Bobby revealed a louder side of himself online, posting music videos he apparently made – some of which featured ominous lyrics and animated scenes of gun violence. Bobby, who made music under the moniker “Awake the Rapper,” uploaded his music on several major streaming outlets and on a personal website.\n\nIn one video titled “Are you Awake,” Bobby sports multicolored hair and face tattoos and declares, “I need to just do it. It is my destiny.” The video shows a cartoon animation of a stick-figure man resembling Bobby in tactical gear, carrying out an attack with a rifle.\n\nIn another video, a similar stick-figure cartoon character resembling Bobby is depicted lying face down on the ground in a pool of his own blood, surrounded by police officers with their guns drawn. And in a third, Bobby is seen wearing a helmet and a tactical vest and dropping bullets onto the floor of a classroom.\n\nFinancial struggles took a toll\n\nAs Bobby was struggling in school, his father’s business was also having trouble staying afloat. Regular customers said that they noticed more of the shelves in the store going empty, and the hours it was open shrinking. In conversations with friends, Bob Crimo complained about a downturn in the business, increases in rent, and fees he said he had to pay the city.\n\nIn 2018, Crimo settled on a solution: running for mayor of Highland Park. People who knew him said they were puzzled about why he would embark on what seemed like a quixotic campaign against the popular incumbent, Nancy Rotering, who was Bobby’s former Cub Scout leader.\n\nIn a local news profile, Crimo talked about making the city more business-friendly, but he didn’t seem to actively campaign, and it’s unclear how seriously he took the race. State records show Crimo didn’t receive any campaign donations other than a $560 loan from himself, which he spent on yard signs. In the end, Rotering won 72% of the vote in the April 2019 election, soundly defeating Crimo.\n\nIn another blow, Crimo’s deli shuttered around the same time. Google Street View photos show that while the shop had a big “Bob Crimo for Mayor” poster hanging in the window in late 2018, by September 2019, the storefront was vacant and empty.\n\nAccording to court documents, the store was under a mountain of debt: A lender sued the deli and Crimo in late 2018, alleging he owed more than $764,000. A judge ruled in the lender’s favor by default in March 2019 after Crimo failed to appear in court. It’s unclear whether the debt was ever paid.\n\nGun permit granted despite ominous threats\n\nAround the same time, Bobby started showing more troubling behavior.\n\nIn April 2019, according to police reports released by Highland Park, officers performed a wellness check on the 18-year-old Bobby after receiving a report that he had “attempted to commit suicide by machete” a week prior. Mental health professionals handled the episode, officers wrote.\n\nThen in September of that year, police received the report that Bobby had “stated that he was going to kill everyone.” Bobby admitted that he was depressed and had a history of drug use, according to the report. His father turned over a collection of 16 knives, a dagger and a “Samurai type blade” to police, and officers sent the Illinois State Police a “clear and present danger” report related to the threats Bobby made. But the state police declined to approve that determination, which could have blocked Bobby from buying guns, because there wasn’t enough evidence to do so, the agency said this week.\n\nJust three months later, Crimo signed his son’s application for a Firearm Owners Identification card, a requirement to buy guns in Illinois. Under state law, young adults under 21 years of age need a parent or guardian to sponsor them in order to get the permit.\n\nCrimo told the New York Post that he sponsored the application so his son could shoot at a gun range. This week, an attorney for Bob Crimo – who no longer represents him – told the Chicago Tribune that Crimo was not aware of the incident that resulted in the confiscation of the knives when he signed the card. Yet, according to the state police, Crimo was actually the one who reclaimed the knives from officers. In the Post interview, Crimo downplayed Bobby’s threats in that incident as a “childish outburst.”\n\nAttorney George Gomez, who is representing both parents, told CNN that “the family denies that there was any issues of suicide at the time,” and stressed law enforcement found “no safety risk.”\n\nBobby went on to use the card to legally purchase multiple guns before he turned 21 last year, passing a total of four background checks, according to the state police. That included the semi-automatic rifle he used in the shooting.\n\nMeanwhile, the family’s finances appeared to unravel in recent years. HSBC Bank filed for foreclosure on their Highland Park house, where Bobby had grown up, in December 2019, alleging Crimo, Jr. owed more than $460,000. The case was delayed amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the lender restarted efforts to take possession of the home last year.\n\nIn April 2022, a mortgage servicing company filed to foreclose on a second property Crimo owns in the neighboring town of Highwood. The company, NewRez LLC, alleged that he had failed to make payments since July 2020, and owed more than $197,000.\n\nIn the Highland Park case, a judge granted Crimo a full waiver of court fees in May after he appeared in person and provided proof that he was receiving food stamps, according to court documents.\n\nLast Thursday – four days before the shooting – Crimo filed a last-ditch motion to block foreclosure of the house, arguing the lender hadn’t given him sufficient notice of being in default or of accelerating the due date for the balance of the mortgage.\n\nPaul Crimo, Bob’s brother, who lives with him and worked at his delis, told CNN he didn’t think the financial stress affected Bobby.\n\n“My brother always made sure his kids always had a roof over (their) head at all times,” he wrote in a text message, adding that Crimo “is a great father.”\n\nCommunity looks to family for answers\n\nMourners embrace during a memorial for the victims of the July 4th parade shooting on July 5, 2022 in Highland Park, Ill. Taylor Glascock for CNN\n\nSome of the Highland Park residents who were at the parade when Bobby opened fire said they blamed the father for allowing his son to buy guns.\n\nThe elder Crimo “should be held liable for it and responsible for it,” declared Fred Kroll, a three-decade Highland Park resident who attended the parade with his wife and daughter and said he saw multiple people shot dead. “Whether it’s civil lawsuits by the survivors or he goes to jail … he should be punished.”\n\nState officials have poured cold water on the idea of Crimo facing criminal responsibility over the deaths. “There’s not a criminal liability that’s directly attached to vouching for someone else… and they end up doing something terrible like this,” said Eric Rinehart, the Lake County State’s Attorney.\n\nGomez said the family is “trying to cooperate with all local, state, and federal authorities at the moment.” When asked if he felt there was any criminal wrongdoing on part of his clients, particularly the father, Gomez said, “we take the position that my client, Crimo Jr., did nothing wrong in this case.”\n\nCrimo reportedly has said he wants “a long sentence” for his son, who faces seven counts of first-degree murder and a sentence of life in prison, if convicted. Illinois abolished capital punishment in 2011.\n\nStill, even Crimo’s friends say they doubt he’ll be able to stay in his hometown, or ever open a business here again.\n\n“His kid shot up his hometown, and he’s going to have to come to terms with that action and, honestly, the role he played in his son’s evolution as a person,” one friend said. “It was his son’s name on the news – and that’s his name, too.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan Daniel A.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nCrowds hurried out of Music City Center by the hundreds just before 4 p.m., at the end of Trump's speech, signaling the end of the weekend’s crypto fervor.\n\n−Hadley Hitson\n\nTrump proposes national Bitcoin stockpile\n\nThe United States is currently one of the largest holders of Bitcoin with over $5 billion-worth that it had obtained through legal seizures.\n\nTrump said Saturday that if he wins the 2024 election, he will guarantee that the U.S. will retain all of the Bitcoin it currently holds to be the \"core\" of a Strategic National Bitcoin Stockpile.\n\n“For too long, our government has violated the cardinal rule that every Bitcoiner knows by far: Never sell your Bitcoin,“ Trump said.\n\n\"If I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration to keep 100% of Bitcoin the U.S. government holds or acquires into the future. This will serve in effect as the core of the strategic national bitcoin stockpile.\n\n\"We’re going to make that one of the greatest industries on earth. Thank you and God bless you.\"\n\n− Hadley Hitson\n\nTrump takes aim at Kamala Harris\n\n“We have a country to run. The problem is that Kamala is worse than Joe. She’s a radical left lunatic. She’s got a little honeymoon going on right now.\n\n“We will reward success. We will not punish success. I’ll deliver massive tax cuts for families and individuals. That includes no tax on tips.\n\n“We will end the inflation nightmare that this administration has created and we will end it quickly. It’s destroying our country. Inflation is a country-buster. Look at what happened to Germany during their period of huge inflation.\n\n\"Bitcoiners understood inflation frankly better than anybody else. If only they had listened — 20-30% of the value of every dollar was wiped out quickly. The life savings of millions of Americans was rapidly destroyed. It’s a stealth taxation. I call it the Biden tax, now I call it the Harris tax. Inflation is a 50% tax on people. This is a human tragedy.\n\n“When I return to the White House, I will stop the wild and wasteful spending of this administration. I’m going to stop World War III because we’re closer to World War III since we’ve ever been since World War II. I will close the borders. We will defeat inflation and together we will bring back the American dream for citizens of every race, religion and creed.\"\n\nTrump takes the stage at Bitcoin2024\n\nTrump walked onto the Bitcoin2024 stage at 2:57 p.m. Saturday, nearly an hour after originally scheduled.\n\n\"God Bless The USA” played over the speakers, and the crowd of thousands cheered and sang along.\n\nAt the same time, nearly every screen in Music City Center illuminated with the livestream. Hundreds of conference attendees who did not make it in to see the speech live gathered in overflow rooms nearby.\n\n\"This is the kind of spirit that built America,\" he told the crowd. \"This is the spirit that’s going to help us make America great again. I stand here today filled with respect and admiration for what the Bitcoin community has achieved. This is the steel industry of 100 years ago. It's the 9th most valuable asset anywhere in the world.\n\n\"The reason I’ve come to address the Bitcoin community today can be summed up in two simple words: America first. If we don’t do it, China and others are going to be doing it. Let’s do it and do it right. If crypto is going to define the future I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA.\"\n\nTrump claimed the title of first American president to address a Bitcoin event Saturday afternoon.\n\nHe focused on keeping the U.S. ahead of China and other countries in cryptocurrency and Bitcoin innovation as the “crypto capital of the world.”\n\n“Bitcoin is going to the moon, as we say,” Trump said. “You’re going to be very happy with me.”\n\nHe promised to fire SEC Chairman Gary Gensler \"on day one,\" drawing raucous applause from the crowd and said he would appoint a crypto adviser to \"design transparent regulatory guidance\" in 100 days.\n\n\"We will end the war on American energy and we will drill, baby, drill. We have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation. With low energy costs, America will be a Bitcoin mining powerhouse. You will not have to move your family to China. Bitcoin and crypto will grow our economy and strengthen our country long into the future.\"\n\n− Vivian Jones, Hadley Hitson\n\nTrump's speech delayed for 'special guest': Elon Musk?\n\nAt 2 p.m., as Donald Trump was scheduled to take the stage, a conference host said he is \"not ready yet.\"\n\nThe conference paused as the packed crowd awaited Trump.\n\nMinutes later, hosts said they were waiting for \"a special guest\" who would be \"worth the wait.\" Ultimately, though, there was no special unannounced guest.\n\nBut social-media speculation centered for days around Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, SpaceX and Memphis-based xAI, being a guest.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2015 Gulfstream G650 jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC and reportedly used by Musk flew over Tennessee, according to the ADSB Exchange aircraft-tracking website. But the jet landed in Memphis, not Nashville, just before 3 p.m. as Trump took the stage in Nashville.\n\nThe jet’s flight path left Paris, France earlier in the day. Musk attended the Paris 2024 Olympics on Friday. He posted on X that the “Olympics laser show was amazing!”\n\nOn Saturday, he posted a video of Trump at a campaign rally promising to sign an executive order to cut federal funding for any school “pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content.”\n\nMusk captioned the clip: “Save our kids!”\n\nTrump arrives in Nashville\n\nJust after noon on Saturday, a conference official took the stage to inform the audience crowded into Music City Center that Trump has landed in Tennessee.\n\n“The big man just touched down,” the conference official said.\n\n− Hadley Hitson\n\nA Speedo and an opinion\n\nStanding outside the convention in a matching American flag speedo and face mask, Preston Kamler yelled his opposition to soy while waving a sign advertising his cryptocurrency with a fake Trump endorsement.\n\n“We like Trump,” he said, speaking of his fitness-focused cryptocurrency brand while adjusting his form-fitting speedo. “We support masculinity, we reject modernity and support exceptionalism.”\n\nHe said how support for Trump was based in his belief in the importance of elevated masculinity.\n\n“(My group) is into fighting, working out, boxing, MMA. Any extreme sport,” he said. “We’re into being a tough guy…we reject all that modern bull***t.”\n\n− Angele Latham\n\nFormer President Donald Trump to speak\n\nRepublican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump will headline Bitcoin2024 at 2 p.m., on the third and final day of the highly-anticipated conference that has drawn an estimated 20,000 attendees to downtown Nashville's Music City Center.\n\nTrump's appearance comes exactly two weeks after an attempted assassination attempt at his Butler, Pa., campaign rally.\n\nHundreds of crypto-industry insiders are on the agenda for the three-day event. Also speaking today are U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Brentwood, former Republican U.S. presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and industry leaders including MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor and Bill Miller IV of Miller Value Partners, among others.\n\nTrump gets a Bitcoin gift\n\nBTC Media CEO David Bailey announced Saturday that he is gifting Trump a Bitcoin to “officially welcome” him to the Bitcoin community.\n\n“It’s not a red-party thing, and it’s not a blue-party thing. It’s an orange party thing,” Bailey said. “And who better than Donald Trump to lead the orange party?”\n\nAll of Bitcoin’s branding is colored a shade of orange.\n\nA standing-room-only crowd waited on edge for former President Donald Trump to arrive on stage.\n\n“Bitcoin is the future of this country,” Bailey said.\n\nHe held up a Casacius Bitcoin, which he said the donor had “flown halfway around the world” to deliver.\n\n“On behalf of the entire Bitcoin community, I want to give Donald Trump a Bitcoin — a noncustodial Bitcoin — and I want us to officially greet him as a Bitcoiner.”\n\nThe crowd roared and stood to welcome him, but then there was a pause.\n\n“He’s not ready yet,” Bailey said.\n\nAround the crowd many held signs that read “In Bitcoin We Trust” and “Bitcoin = Freedom.” Others held signs distributed by right wing outlet The Daily Wire that read “Scamala,” a nod to the outlet’s new expose podcast chronicling the life of Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe crowd went back to listening to music awaiting Trump's arrival.\n\n− Hadley Hitson, Vivian Jones\n\nSurprise visitor makes a virtual cameo appearance\n\nMinutes before Trump was set to take the stage, former presidential candidate Dr. Ron Paul spoke virtually to the crowd in conversation with Bitcoin conference host Pete Rizzo − eliciting a loud cheer and standing ovation.\n\n“So privacy has been a big issue in what I've done in Congress; to emphasize the need because privacy,” Paul said. “That's what liberty is all about: privacy. You're an individual. You can do what you want with your money.”\n\nPaul touted his proposed legislation to establish alternative currencies.\n\n“I was a supporter very very early on,” he said.\n\nAsked which presidential candidate he supported, Paul stopped short of making an endorsement.\n\n“I don’t get into the personalities … I don’t deal with parties … I’ve met Trump. One thing about Trump, and this may be talking out of school, he might say ‘you shouldn’t be talking about our conversation,'' but his personality was different. He was much more cordial than I ever believed, personally. It was different.”\n\nThere was a loud roar of applause when Paul concluded.\n\n− Vivian Jones\n\nProtest group makes noise\n\nA large group of demonstrators marched past Music City Center around 1 p.m. Saturday protesting the recent rise in neo-Nazi activity in Nashville, including the harassment of five young boys last week as they busked downtown.\n\nThe group, which identified themselves as the Black Panther party, shouted at attendees gathered outside asking why they weren’t “speaking against it,” and “where they were for the children of their city.”\n\n“We’re here today because of the Nazis antagonizing our children,” one member told the Tennessean, who asked only to be identified as a member of the Black Panther Party and the New Black Panther party. “They’ve been out here the last few weeks, and it’s not going to happen anymore.”\n\nHe pointed to the suddenly, drastically increased police presence. “The people in the city, they did nothing. But we know (the Nazis’) names now. We’re coming for y’all.”\n\nOrganizers stopped in front of the conference and presented the five young boys —Rontarious and Detonio Wilson, 14 and 10, Kamond Williams, 11, and Jaquial Forrest, 9 – who were harassed and chased by neo-Nazis in an incident denounced by Tennessee lawmakers earlier this week.\n\n“We care about all the children of this city,” organizers shouted. “Where were you for ours?”\n\nWhen asked to “walk with us if you oppose racism,” the conference crowd stood quietly. One man, walking past, scoffed.\n\n“Who is this, Hamas?” he asked.\n\nElizabeth Williams, standing on the corner of 6th Ave And Demonbreun, held a cardboard sign with the name “Harris” scrawled on it in marker.\n\nWilliams, a longtime Nashville resident who immigrated from the UK, said she came out to show support for Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris − as well as the marching demonstrators because she “usually sits at home and stews over Trump.”\n\n“I figured I could come out here and double stew, and do something about it,” she laughed. “I don’t have many avenues to speak out, but I can at least stand here on the street corner and tell people Nashville isn’t everything you’ve been seeing lately, with the Nazis. We’re better than that.”\n\n− Angele Latham\n\nT-shirts ask to 'Free Ross'\n\nOutside Music City Center, crowds thickened in anticipation for Trump’s arrival on Saturday afternoon. Secret Service officers could be seen darting around amidst an eclectic crowd of people wearing cowboy hats, suits, fringe, Bitcoin meme signs and a number of shirts encouraging attendees to “Free Ross, Vote Trump.”\n\nRoss Ulbricht, of New York, was sentenced in 2015 to two life sentences for creating the “Silk Road,” a now-defunct digital dark marketplace used to anonymously buy and sell items, including a thriving illegal drug-sales network. It is widely known as the first functional use of Bitcoin.\n\nAt recent speeches, Trump promised to free Ulbricht “on Day 1.”\n\nAs crowds swirled, a box truck emblazoned with a “MAGA VP Support” message circled the block, with Trump and Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance’s face looming over the road with the Bitcoin-branded red laser eyes.\n\nWhile loudly blaring Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA,” the truck promised MVP tokens for $20 and a sweepstakes for Trump-branded sneakers.\n\n− Angele Latham\n\nEar bandages pay homage to assassination attempt\n\nAndrew Gordon, a tax attorney from Chicago who specializes in cryptocurrency law, surveyed the crowd as he handed out square bandages, similar to the one he sported, to conference attendees in line.\n\nThe bandages, printed with the words “countrymen, lend me your ears,” paid homage to the bandage former President Trump wore on his ear after surviving an assassination attempt two weeks ago.\n\nGordon said he’s handed out around 500 bandages, and plans to hand out hundreds more.\n\n“I’m excited to see Trump today,” he said, explaining his interest in merging politics and cryptocurrency. “I think taxes are probably the biggest crypto issue no one talks about.”\n\n− Angele Latham\n\nSen. Blackburn hosts 'Biscuits and Bitcoin'\n\nU.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn held a “Biscuits and Bitcoin” campaign event on Saturday morning near the Music City Center featuring remarks from former presidential candidate and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, who also spoke at the conference.\n\nOther guests included Bitcoin supporter U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, former Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, and Knox County Mayor and likely 2026 gubernatorial candidate Glenn Jacobs.\n\n“@VivekGRamaswamy knows investing in Bitcoin is investing in the future, and I'm glad to have him in Nashville today!” Blackburn shared in a social media post.\n\nEarlier this month, Blackburn’s campaign announced it would accept donations contributed in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\n\n“Great to meet the brilliant @VivekGRamaswamy today and I appreciate his support for our great state of Tennessee 🇺🇸,” Skrmetti wrote in a social media post.\n\n− Vivian Jones\n\nFirst Cybertruck bought with crypto makes appearance\n\nBlocks around the Music City Center were bustling with cryptocurrency signs and hats for sale three hours ahead of former President Donald Trump’s speech scheduled for this afternoon.\n\nAround 11 a.m., a Tesla Cybertruck decorated with Bitcoin logos drove down Demonbreun Street.\n\nThe truck is owned by THORChain founder JP Thor. THORChain is a decentralized network to facilitate exchange of cryptocurrencies without relying on a centralized intermediary.\n\nThe Bitcoin’d Tesla Cybertruck, designed for its debut at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, is the first Cybertruck purchased with cryptocurrency in an effort to increase integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream transactions.\n\nAn increased police presence is evident outside the building, with trailers of mounted Metro Police horses and rows of MNPD vehicles around the building.\n\n− Vivian Jones\n\nSetting the scene\n\nBy 10:30 a.m. Saturday, Secret Service agents and a few hundred variations of red “Make America Great Again” hats were scattered throughout Music City Center.\n\nSome read “Bitcoin Made In America,” “MAGA” and “Make Bitcoin Great Again.”\n\nA long line of conference-goers waited to get inside the event. Security officials told attendees that they will not ”clear the room” ahead of Trump’s speech.\n\n“Once you’re in, stay in,” one security official said.\n\nMeanwhile, rumors swirled online that SpaceX, Tesla and Memphis-based xAI founder Elon Musk would make an unscheduled appearance.\n\nDavid Bailey, CEO of conference organizer BTC Media, posted on X: \"Just want to be clear, if anyone acts up during any speech today I’ve asked security to remove them immediately. We’re on a mission today.\"\n\nWhile excitement for the GOP presidential nominee’s arrival buzzed downtown, several crypto investors at the conference said they planned to leave before Trump takes the stage. Some said it was a form of “protesting.”\n\n\"I’m more of a libertarian, so I’m not here for that,” attendee Johnny Miles said.\n\nMiles said he wasn’t interested in the politics around Bitcoin unless they made his investments more valuable. However, his wife Lisa Miles said she plans to stay alone. It will be her first time hearing from a former president, and she plans to vote for Trump in November.\n\nEdward Snowden, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Russell Brand draw packed crowds Friday\n\nOn Friday, presidential contender Robert F. Kennedy Jr., celebrity Russell Brand and famous political dissident and government-surveillance whistleblower Edward Snowden stole the show.\n\nKennedy Jr. won thunderous applause for promising to not only build up a U.S. reserve of at least 4 million Bitcoins, if elected, but to also make Bitcoin transactions unreportable to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n\"I am a huge supporter of Bitcoin,\" Kennedy Jr. said. \"I put most of my wealth into Bitcoin.\"\n\nHe also took aim at Trump.\n\n\"I understand that tomorrow President Trump may announce his plan to build a Bitcoin Fort Knox and authorize the U.S. government to buy a million Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset,\" Kennedy Jr. said. \"I welcome President Trump’s new enthusiasm for Bitcoin. But he’s only weeks into the Bitcoin dialogue.\"\n\nSnowden delivered a virtual speech from exile in Russia, decrying the \"fundamentally unfair\" power system in America. He urged attendees to push back against \"the systemization of technologies designed to order our lives for the benefit of the institution.\"\n\nHis face, with his characteristic thin-rimmed glasses, was projected on the stage against a two-tone blue background.\n\n\"Look at the economy. There’s an increasing concentration of resources into fewer and fewer hands,\" Snowden said. \"You play by their rules or you don’t play at all, and that should be changing.\"\n\nHe urged stronger data privacy protections.\n\n\"When they have your transaction history they have your life history,\" he said. \"We’re all running on a treadmill. For what? Right now, we’re doing it for the likes, trying to get approval, acceptance. We need to start cooperating instead of competing to find our way out of this hole that’s not this election — it’s this system.\"\n\nBrand, a comedian and actor who has a popular talk show on Rumble and who publicly faced several sexual-assault allegations last year, took to the stage with conservative social-media platform Rumble founder and CEO Chris Pavlovski.\n\n\"No one should be mediating your connection to God or your connection to money or your connection to free speech,\" Brand said, promoting decentralized technology platforms. \"Bitcoin epitomizes above all else decentralization, transparency, open communication and the possibility for new human relationships.\n\n\"This is not just a digital form of the Gold Rush but this is a set of systems through which we may bypass our atrophying corrupt hypocritical systems of government, big tech, media. The loss of moral authority that they are experiencing is deserved,\" Brand said.\n\nTraffic, travel delays expected for Trump security\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Metro Nashville Police Department told residents to expect travel delays on Saturday afternoon as part of security precautions for former President Donald Trump's Nashville visit.\n\n\"Expect intermittent traffic delays in the areas of BNA & downtown Sat afternoon for the security of Former President Trump. If you are catching or meeting a flight Sat afternoon, please allow for extra travel time,\" MNPD posted on X.\n\nBitcoin2024: High-powered lineup, security on tap\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service is managing security for the event, which organizers said has been increased.\n\nBitcoin2024 spokesperson Kristyna Mazankova said conference security was upgraded following the assassination attempt against Trump: \"Prior to Saturday’s events in PA, our security and production teams were already working closely with the Secret Service to incorporate additional measures for President Trump’s attendance in Nashville.\"\n\nA U.S. Secret Service spokesperson said the agency would not provide any details regarding security plans for Trump's Nashville appearance.\n\n\"The safety and security of our protectees is the U.S. Secret Service’s top priority,\" the spokesperson told The Tennessean. \"Out of concern for operational security, the Secret Service does not discuss the means and methods used for our protective operations.\"\n\nHow much are Bitcoin2024 tickets? A lot\n\nBasic ticket packages start at $699 — for only exhibit hall and main stage access — and $3,999. Attendees get a 21% discount for paying with Bitcoin.\n\nBut that's just the start.\n\nVIP \"Whale Pass\" tickets for the three-day conference are priced at $21,000 per person and include access to VIP lounges, all-inclusive food and beverage service, an after-party pass and exclusive panels.\n\nAnd many attendees are seeking out upscale events around town after hours.\n\nWeekend events and related parties are expected to take place at the Westin Hotel rooftop bar, the Twelve Thirty Club, 5th + Broadway's Skydeck, AVA rooftop on Broadway and Oak Steakhouse.\n\nTickets for a fundraising reception event for Trump's presidential campaign are going for $844,600 per person. It's a discounted $60,000 a person to snap a photo with him and attend a reception.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. is hosting a catered meet and greet event in collaboration with the Trump campaign, where he will be joined by political commentators Candace Owens and Camryn Kinsey. The event is at the L27 rooftop lounge at the Westin hotel, and tickets cost $3,000 per person or $5,000 per couple.\n\nRepublican politicians make a spash at Bitcoin2024\n\nTrump's keynote appearance at Bitcoin2024 two weeks after a deadly public assasination attempt at his campaign rally won the conference's biggest headlines.\n\nBut, even before Trump's arrival, a strong political contingent of Republican and libertarian legislators and celebrities was notable.\n\nSnowden commented on the influx of politicians on Friday.\n\n\"I notice we have a lot more political representation here. They fight us, then they try to get us to love them,\" he said. \"Cast a vote but don’t join a cult. They are not our tribe. They are not your personality. They have their own interests. Don’t give yourselves to them, even if you have to vote for them.\"\n\nWhat's drawn legislators and crypto-industry insiders together in Nashville?\n\nMany crypto supporters emphasize the shared values of freedom and deregulation. But it also signals that the industry represents a significant voting bloc.\n\n“Politicians follow votes,” BitcoinIRA cofounder Chris Kline said. “These are the same reasons they make stops in battleground states like Wisconsin, Ohio and even Nevada and Arizona. Bitcoin is no longer a niche interest group.”\n\nBitcoin's stance as inherently apolitical is changing as the industry seeks consistency and acceptance in federal regulation.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump pivoted on his critical Bitcoin views to embrace digital currencies. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden vetoed legislation that crypto leaders said would have improved their abilities to work with traditional banks.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/10/01/trump-rally-marsha-blackburn-johnson-city-tennessee/1412293002/", "title": "Trump: Democrat control would be bad for nation, elect Blackburn", "text": "JOHNSON CITY – The first of October brought an animated President Donald Trump to a rally in Johnson City and tens of thousands of supporters on a warm, sun-filled Monday afternoon.\n\nPresident Trump came to support Marsha Blackburn’s campaign in a tight, crucial U.S. Senate race against Democrat Phil Bredesen.\n\nRepublicans have a narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate, and it's widely believed the GOP's control of the House may be in jeopardy as well.\n\nThe significance of the race for the candidates vying to succeed U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., became clear minutes into Trump's speech when the president said a Democrat takeover of Congress will plunge the country into chaos, causing the stock market to drop, taxes to rise and crime to \"flow into the nation through open borders.\"\n\nTrump made his remarks at his Make America Great Again rally at a full-to-capacity Freedom Hall in Johnson City, which holds approximately 8,000. Tickets were handed out on a first-come, first-served basis. The president said 20,000 were outside the arena.\n\n“A vote for Marsha is really a vote for me and everything we stand for,” he said. “It’s a vote for Make America Great Again.”\n\nBlackburn returned the praise.\n\n“If you want a U.S. senator who is going to stand with the president, (help) build the wall, cut your taxes and make certain we take care of our men and women in uniform, I’m asking you to stand with me,” she said.\n\nTrump: Don't let Democrats get power\n\nThe audience responded with loud cheers when the president said, \"We are standing up proudly for our flag and for our national anthem. This is your time to choose ... look at what we've done in less than two years. It's up to you to choose prosperity and pride over socialism and decay.\"\n\nTrump pointed out the importance of the midterm elections, just five weeks away, and began by talking about the turnaround in the economy and \"putting America first.\"\n\nHe touted the replacement of the \"job-killing disaster known as NAFTA with a brand-new U.S./Mexico/Canada trade agreement and we're calling it USMCA. No more NAFTA.\"\n\nCalling it \"fair, modern and balanced,\" he said it's the largest trade deal the United States has ever negotiated and will produce jobs so companies will stop leaving the country.\n\nThe $1.2 trillion agreement, which must be approved by Congress, comes one month after the U.S. and Mexico announced they had reached a new trade pact to replace NAFTA, which essentially eliminated tariffs on most goods traded among the U.S., Canada and Mexico, and made it easier for companies in those three countries to move goods and supplies across their borders.\n\nHe referred to the Democrats as obstructionists and enablers of the fake news media. The party campaigns \"on resistance. They'll take everything, including your Second Amendment, away.\"\n\nHe called them the \"party of crime\" based on the immigration policies Democrats support.\n\nBlackburn: Blue wave will hit 'great red wall'\n\nBlackburn, who spoke briefly, addressed the \"blue wave\" some say is coming in the midterm elections.\n\n\"When that blue wave gets to the state line, it’s going to run right into the great red wall,\" she said to loud applause.\n\nBlackburn thanked the crowd \"for sending Donald J. Trump to the White House. He has had an amazing 20 months.\"\n\nShe pledged to cut taxes and build the wall.\n\nTrump said \"she's all about Tennessee values. It's a vote for Make America Great Again.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Phil Bredesen wants to raise your taxes. As governor he raised taxes and fees in your state by more than $1 billion. He supported driver certificates for illegal aliens. He doubled unemployment. Phil was a major financial supporter of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nWhen Bredesen was governor, he raised taxes on cigarettes to help fund education, implemented a one-year hospital assessment fee and increased employer taxes to prevent the state’s unemployment trust fund from going broke. A 2010 Chattanooga Times Free Press article estimated about $1 billion was raised as a result of such changes during Bredesen’s administration.\n\nTrump’s comment on Bredesen and taxes had previously been used by Blackburn and outside interest groups.\n\nBredesen: Trump visit matters little\n\nEarlier Monday in Chattanooga, Bredesen was asked directly about President Trump's visit and how it affects voters.\n\nHe issued this statement: \"I don’t think it does much for votes. I’ll be honest with you, I’ve found Tennesseans to be pretty independent-minded about that. If you’ll remember back in 2002, I ran against Van Hilleary, President (George W.) Bush came down here ... I lost count the number of times he came to Tennessee during that governor’s race. That was at a time, by the way when he was extremely popular. That was right after 9/11, his approval ratings was in the low 70 percent, which is vastly higher than it is for President Trump at the moment.\n\n\"In the end, it was fine. I won even though Al Gore had lost the presidency. It wasn’t a slam dunk. It was nothing like that. The lesson to me was it's good for fundraising, but for actually driving votes and changing minds, most people in Tennessee like to think for themselves for these kinds of things. I’m much more interested in getting out there and selling myself.\"\n\nSupporters applaud Trump's remarks\n\nFor Stephanie Williams, the rally was every bit as good as a Vols game — “and this time we’re winning.”\n\nShe brought her mother and 12-year-old daughter to see the president but left early to get ahead of the traffic.\n\n“It was everything I hoped for and more,” she said. “The energy was like a football game back when the Vols won.”\n\nWilliams was one of the lucky ones. Most of the tens of thousands who stood in line for the rally at Freedom Hall Civic Center had to watch from outside.\n\n“We’re disappointed because it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance,” said Hunter Dotson. “But it was worth the trip.”\n\nTrump’s remarks drew cheers throughout the night, particularly jeers at Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren of Massachusetts and calls for the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n“They’re trying to smear a good man,” Williams said.\n\nFor Thomas Taylor, it was bigger than a ball game, louder than a rock concert and more exciting than a thriller.\n\nWho cares if a few details got fudged or stretched here and there?\n\n“A lot of it is Trump just pulling liberals’ chains and making jokes,” said the retired coal miner who drove from Rogersville, Tenn. “In this day and age, a president has got to do that. Ten years ago, I wouldn’t have said that. But now that’s changed forever..”\n\nHis favorite moment came at tonight’s Donald Trump rally came when the president trumpeted changes promised to the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.\n\n“Jobs can heal all society’s problems,” Taylor said. “People right now are so dead-set against each other there could almost be a civil war. Jobs can bring them back together.”\n\nKaren Tolley of Church Hill, Tenn., said her son and daughter both credit their jobs in an improved economy to Trump.\n\n“I truly do not think there’s been a president for us, the people, for years,” said Patti Sidock of Bristol, Tenn., as she left. “The Democrats are all criminals. Obama divided this country. Trump is building it back.”\n\nMost of the rally-goers showed support for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn, although most said they would have voted for her anyway. But they didn’t come to Freedom Hall to see Blackburn.\n\n“I came for Trump,” Sidock said. “I don’t think anything could change my mind on Trump.”\n\nTrump on Kavanaugh\n\nTrump reaffirmed his support for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as the FBI this week investigates claims of sexual assault against him. The battle over Kavanaugh has fired up voters in both parties just more than a month before the November midterm elections.\n\nTrump accused Democrats of being driven by a “blind rage” over the outcome of the 2016 election.\n\n“They’ve been trying to destroy him since the very first second he was announced,” Trump said of Democrats.\n\n“Let’s see how it all works out but I’ll tell you what, they’re trying to destroy a very fine person and we can’t let it happen,” he said.\n\nAnd on 2020\n\nTrump briefly veered away from the midterm elections to discuss potential Democratic rivals in the 2020 presidential election, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who he said he would like to fight behind a bar, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. He criticized each while blasting Democrats more broadly.\n\n“They got some real beauties going,” Trump said.\n\nCongressman Roe: 92,000 wanted tickets to rally\n\nU.S. Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., said 92,000 had requested tickets to the event. He said that's the most ever for a Trump rally.\n\nTrump arrived at the airport at 5:18 p.m. and departed in his motorcade at 5:41 p.m., arriving at Freedom Hall at 6:11 p.m.\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Lee had waited inside the Tri-City Aviation building to greet the president and his accompanying guests, including Blackburn and Congressmen Chuck Fleischmann, Scott DesJarlais, John \"Jimmy\" Duncan and Roe.\n\nSupporters lined up early for rally\n\nTrump supporters began arriving Sunday night for the rally.\n\nBy 2 p.m. Monday, the line outside Freedom Hall Civic Center snaked down the hill and around the surrounding blocks as thousands waited to get inside. As of 4:30 p.m., the doors were open and people were filing in for the 7 p.m. rally.\n\nThere were thousands of “Make America Great Again” hats and “Marsha, Marsha, Marsha” T-shirts along with \"Trump 2020\" shirts.\n\nA few minutes after Trump landed — toward the end of Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believing,” — the crowd erupted in an impromptu, raucous chant of “Trump!” The crowd got so loud the sound was turned down before the song could finish.\n\nA few minutes later, the crowd chanted, “Lock her up!”\n\nSaundra Kiczen drove 14 hours from the U.S.-Canadian border to stand in line for the rally.\n\nShe was one of thousands of Trump supporters lined up by approximately 11 a.m. Monday.\n\nKiczen didn’t get there first. At 8:30 a.m., she and more than 100 others already lined Pactolas Road outside the center, waiting for the doors to open. A police officer brought the words they’d waited for just before 9, and the crowd headed for the parking lot.\n\n“I’ve been going to these rallies since the (2015) primaries,” she said. “Lines are always an issue.”\n\n“It’s like waiting for a concert, but with less music,” said Annalise Busenlehner of Kingsport.\n\nTrump supporters point to more money in paychecks\n\nLyn McKinney lives within a five-minute drive of Freedom Hall, but said she arrived before midnight to claim an early spot.\n\nShe hasn’t stepped inside the center in 40 years.\n\n“That was for Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1978,” McKinney said. “I haven’t been this excited since. It’s like being a groupie again.”\n\nShe said she sees Trump’s presidency as heaven-sent.\n\n“I have a son in the Navy, and I wouldn’t have slept a night if Hillary had been elected,” McKinney said. “I think God sent Trump because he loves Trump, too.”\n\nShe said she’s happy with everything the president’s done so far, from the Kavanaugh nomination to the ongoing trade war. The warnings of higher prices and budget shortfalls down the road don’t bother her.\n\n“I want to hear the things nobody will report, and he’ll tell us,” McKinney said. “None of these other countries are playing fair. He’ll make them. We bought a new car and made improvements to our house last year. We couldn’t do that under Bush or Obama.”\n\nFirst one at rally arrived early\n\nJerry Sheffield of Jonesborough, Tenn., showed up first. His friend Nathan Raines got there second in a star-spangled Uncle Sam suit and top hat.\n\n“I work at a theater, so I just grabbed a little bit of everything,” Raines said.\n\nThey hoped to hear about the Kavanaugh nomination, about the wall along the Mexico border they want to see built and about trade deals with Canada and other nations.\n\n“We love Trump, and we love what he does for our police and our country,” Sheffield said. “Sometimes when you’re fixing something, you’ve got to break it.”\n\nSome of the crowd haven’t seen the president in person before. Others have seen him dozens of times.\n\nKiczen and a friend, Brendan Gutenschwager of Wyandotte, Mich., make a habit of going to rallies together. He’s been to 23 so far, counting Monday's.\n\n“I think this is a historic moment, and I want to see history being made,” he said. “I don’t agree with everything Trump says, like on climate change. But I love the energy and the atmosphere.”\n\nProtesters hope for blue wave\n\nKate Craig, chair of the Washington County Democratic Party, said she hoped to see as many as 1,000 to 2,500 people turn out to demonstrate Monday. A count was not immediately available.\n\n“This is not anti-Trump,” she said. “We want to participate in our democracy and show what Democrats are for.”\n\nTrump supporters headed into the rally threw occasional jibes toward the demonstrators, but most passed in peace. Officers nearly arrested one man who stopped to harangue the demonstrators with profanity and insults.\n\nEven in a state as red as Tennessee — where 91 out of 95 counties voted for Trump in 2016 — it’s not out of the question to hope for a blue wave, the demonstrators said.\n\nNo mention of the 'witch hunt' Russian investigation\n\nTrump has frequently used Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein as his personal punching bag as the Special Counsel’s Russia investigation, which he oversees, continues. Monday night, however, Trump was tight-lipped about the probe he has consistently labeled a “witch hunt.”\n\nRosenstein will reportedly be meeting with Republicans in coming weeks to discuss a New York Times story which claimed he had suggested secretly taping Trump to expose a chaotic White House and which would begin the process of removing him from office under the 25th Amendment. Rosenstein has repeatedly denied the report.\n\nTrump gathered earlier for pre-rally fundraiser\n\nTrump came for the rally, but also as the Republican Party’s biggest ticket item for fundraising. The president met with a smaller group of donors before the rally.\n\nTickets cost $10,000 per couple, including a photo with Trump; or $25,000 a couple, including the photo and a roundtable with Trump. Contributions will fuel Blackburn's joint fundraising committee.\n\nUSA TODAY Network-Tennessee staff writers Matt Lakin, Brittany Crocker, Joel Ebert and John Fritze contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/12/01/new-dylans-nashville-band-on-brink/19106421/", "title": "New Dylans: Band on the Brink", "text": "Nate Rau\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee\n\nAbout this project\n\nThere are countless similar bands in Nashville. To illustrate the new reality for working musicians in Music City today, the Tennessean chronicled one year in the life of the New Dylans as they navigated the business and the art of making music. Nearly three decades after they burst onto the scenes, and two decades after they first called it quits, the New Dylans came back to life. This is their story.\n\nFull Documentary:\n\nOn Tuesday, our \"Band on the Brink: The New Dylans\" project came to life at the Belcourt Theatre in Hillsboro Village. Guest were given a premiere screening of the documentary followed by a live concert by the New Dylans and panel discussion with music industry experts. We thank those who came out to celebrate this great community collaboration and important journalism about our music industry.\n\nBack to Life: A look at the trailer\n\nThe New Dylans were left for dead by the music industry.\n\nThey were lauded by critics and tastemakers in the 1980s. They were signed to a record deal and heaped with praise in the pages of Village Voice and Rolling Stone and on the airwaves of MTV and NPR in the 1990s. They toured the country ferociously.\n\nAnd then, at the end of 1996, broke and burnt out, the folk rock band from Warren, Pa., broke up.\n\nThis is the story about how the New Dylans, after an 18-year hiatus, returned to making music in Nashville. And it is the story about a shrinking sector of the music industry — the middle class — in 2014. It may be boom times for artists like Taylor Swift, the Black Keys, Jason Aldean and Jack White, but for middle-class musicians like those who comprise the New Dylans, making music in 2014 is a rather gritty chore.\n\nAs an independent songwriter, Jim Reilley lives the kind of precarious year-to-year existence that is typical of Nashville's working music professionals in 2014.\n\nAt the same time the New Dylans were heading into the studio to record their first album in 18 years, Reilley, the band's co-founder, was waiting to find out whether his publishing deal would be renewed for another year.\n\nA publishing deal essentially pays a songwriter an annual salary to write songs - Reilley writes dozens per year. His publisher hooks him up with other writers for co-writing sessions, pitches his songs to artist managers and record labels and licenses the music for television or film. For instance, earlier this year a song Reilley cowrote was licensed to the television show \"Nashville.\"\n\nBut despite his successes, in many ways, Reilley's career trajectory makes him the poster child for the troubled state of the songwriting profession.\n\nAt the same time world-renowned artists like Taylor Swift, the Black Keys and Keith Urban have been hoisted up as evidence of Nashville's it-city status, the music industry has actually been in a state of unrelenting decline.\n\nSince 2000, the number of full-time songwriters in Nashville has fallen by 80 percent according to the Nashville Songwriters Association International. Album sales have plummeted, dropping below 4 million weekly sales in August, which marked a new low point since the industry began tracking the data in 1991. Streaming services are increasing in popularity, but they've been unable to end the downward spiral.\n\nThe result has been the collapse of Nashville's musical middle class - blue collar songwriters, studio musicians, producers and bands who eek out a living with the same lunch-pail approach that a construction professional brings to a work site. In the pages of fawning national publications, Nashville has emerged as a glamorous place populated with music celebrities. But in actuality, making a living at music is a rather gritty chore.\n\nIndependent songwriters like Reilley work under pressure-packed year-to-year deals. Professional musicians like Chris Autry, who plays bass for the New Dylans, are constantly on the hunt for a shrinking number of well-paying gigs. And working drummers and producers such as Ken Coomer, who plays drums for the band, earn a living project by project.\n\nFor each Jack White, Carrie Underwood or Kings of Leon, there are dozens of artists the national media has never heard of, but we know them well in Nashville because they're our neighbors, coworkers, friends and family.\n\n\"As a creator it's not the perfect environment for creation. It's Music City, but it's really Music Business City,\" said Reilley, who moved to Nashville in 1998 to pursue a career as a songwriter.\n\n\"There's not a lot of people who've been doing it long who aren't really hollow and bitter, because that's kind of what it makes you.\"\n\nWhat's it like to make a living at music in 2014? Members of the New Dylans discuss working as songwriters, musicians and producers in an industry that has seen its middle class disappear, according to Nashville Songwriters Association International Executive Director Bart Herbison.\n\nEvery September, Reilley waits to find out if he has a job.\n\nShortly after coming to town in 1998, Reilley scored a publishing deal with Curb Music Publishing in a joint venture with Chris Keaton. Reilley was given a $20,000 annual salary under a one-year deal with four options, which gives the publisher the chance to extend the deal for one year. Reilley's deal with Curb lasted eight years. His salary rose $5,000 per year, topping at about $40,000, Reilley said.\n\nSongwriters don't start to enjoy the royalties their songs generate when cut by other artists until the publishing company recoups its cumulative investment. Reilley never got to that point at Curb.\n\nAfter his time at Curb ran out, Reilley signed a one-year deal with Rare Spark Publishing, which he said paid about $12,000, and he has since signed two one-year deals with Keaton Music Publishing, which he said pays over $20,000 per year.\n\nWhile the late summer is pressure-packed for Reilley, as he waits to find out if he has a salary, his livelihood doesn't depend solely on the publishing deal. He also works regularly as a producer, mostly for aspiring artists. Since coming to Nashville, he's produced more than 50 projects. This year he got good news as his deal was extended.\n\n\"That's how I've lived for the last 16 years, living one year at a time,\" Reilley said. \"With songwriting, you've got one year. If you do well that year, if you get any pipeline activity, then you get another year. If you don't, that's it. You can't help but think about that every day.\"\n\nNSAI Executive Director Bart Herbison said Reilley, who has had about three dozen cuts over his career, has been held up as a model by the songwriters association.\n\nHerbison said NSAI used to hand aspiring songwriters an essay written by Reilley called \"The Reality Check,\" which showed all of the networking, financial sacrifices and hard work that goes into the job. Herbison said he's never seen a harder worker.\n\nNSAI chalks up the decline of the songwriting profession to the rise in music piracy, the loss of album sales and the increase in popularity of consumption models like streaming that don't pay songwriters as well.\n\nHerbison has been advocating for more favorable federal laws in order to, as he describes it, pay songwriters a fair market rate for their work.\n\n\"I'd challenge the premise that there is much of a middle class anymore,\" Herbison said. \"It's the haves and have-nots.\"\n\nAnatomy of a Songwriting Deal\n\nThis chart shows how songwriter Jim Reilley's publishing deals have changed throughout his career.\n\n1986-96 — Caveat Emptor: Original New Dylans songs published on company formed by Reilley and Campbell.\n\n1998-2006 — Curb Music Publishing: One-year deals starting at $20,000 per year with $5,000 raises. Curb and partner Keaton Music Publishing owned 100 percent of the publishing rights.\n\n2012-13 — Rare Spark Publishing: One year deal at about $12,000. Reilley owned 50 percent of publishing rights\n\n2013-present — Keatunes/Luck Of The Amish: One-year deal with publisher Chris Keaton at over $20,000. Reilley owns 50 percent of publishing.\n\nSource: Jim Reilley\n\nNot a Lucrative Business\n\nKen Coomer had a modest goal when he decided to make music as a profession - he just wanted to earn a little money so he could buy an old house and an old car.\n\nOn their new album, the New Dylans tabbed Chris Autry to play bass and Coomer to play drums.\n\nFor Coomer, working in music seemed inevitable because his father was a musician. He flipped burgers to earn enough money buy his first drum set at age 14 and then played in bands while attending Middle Tennessee State University.\n\n\"My goal was if I could buy an old house and an old car from playing drums, I win, and everything else is gravy,\" Coomer said from his lovely East Nashville home studio.\n\nIn the early 90s, Coomer drummed in a popular band called Clockhammer, which was recording in Boston, where he met the members of Uncle Tupelo. That connection led to the formation of Wilco, the now legendary independent band.\n\nAfter Wilco, Coomer drummed in a wide array of projects and began producing records.\n\n\"Is it ever lucrative?\" Coomer said of working in the music business. \"Once it becomes what you think is lucrative, then you buy a house. Then you have a child.\n\n\"I always lived modestly. I had the house in East Nashville before it was the hip place to live. I'd just throw my gear in there and kind of go on the road. I came home, I bought an old 60s Impala and kind of was living the dream.\"\n\nTo grow his work as a producer, which has been booming of late, Coomer went into debt to build his own studio. He works like any independent business man with the overarching goal of seeing his revenue surpass his expenses, like his loan payment. These days much of his work comes from independent bands paying for their records through crowdsourcing. Coomer called a recent Kickstarter-funded project producing Virginia band Sons of Bill a \"pleasure cruise.\"\n\nBut the Kickstarter financing is a far cry from an early project over a decade ago when a major label literally sent him a blank check book and said, \"Go make a record.\"\n\nAfter graduating from Belmont, Autry used his connections to earn an array of paying gigs. Among others, Autry supported Shane McAnally — now one of the city's hottest songwriters — SHeDAISY, Deanna Carter and Craig Morgan. Autry found his groove several years ago when he was hired to play in Jo Dee Messina's band. Despite his credentials, Autry said he lives on a tightrope similar to his songwriter friends like Reilley. He said networking is a constant in his line of work.\n\n\"It's really hard actually. You're constantly going out,\" Autry said. \"I go out five nights a week to look, to shake hands and remind people that I still live here.\n\n\"I've been fortunate with the Jo Dee Messina gig. We work 40, 50 dates a year. She's had nine No. 1 songs, sold a bunch of records. We work every year and she's really active at keeping her career going. So I've been fortunate.\"\n\nCrowd-funded records. Nightly networking. Year-to-year publishing deals. It was against this backdrop that the New Dylans went about creating music for their new album.\n\n\"I gave up a lot to do this as a songwriter and a musician,\" Reilley said. \"I gave up a good portion of my nervous system and my life to this game. And I've been lucky. I've had lots of cuts, I've had a couple publishing deals, a couple record deals, we've done our thing and we're doing this again. There's a lot of people who would like to do just one of those things and never be able to. So I'm not saying poor me.\n\n\"But I am saying, it's hard to do this. Every victory is a hollow victory. And I know people who are way more successful in this business than I am who are just not happy people. It's not a business to go into if you want validation and happiness.\"\n\nA Uniquely Nashville Story\n\nAfter three decades of uncertainty and disappointment, fond memories tainted by financial stress, critical acclaim met with commercial failure, the New Dylans are back for more in 2014.\n\nThe band formed on a whim in 1986 in Warren, Pa., and quickly recorded a batch of quirky, cerebral folk-rock songs. Those songs became a vinyl EP that, to their utter surprise, charmed a slate of music industry tastemakers like R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe.\n\nArmed with Stipe's endorsement, interest from record labels in New York, and buzz in national and regional music publications, the New Dylans took their considerable momentum and promptly broke up. Four years later, the band got back together, scored a record deal, released two albums that again won over critics, built a cult following by touring the United States several times over and then promptly broke up a second time.\n\nAfter an 18-year hiatus, the New Dylans reformed in 2014 and wrote new songs about heavy topics such as love and loss, drug dependency, child sex abuse, global warming, natural gas fracking, urban gentrification and the scary state of today's music industry. The New Dylans thought up early song ideas in a small Berry Hill writing room and turned them into polished recordings that came to life in a garage studio in East Nashville.\n\nOn a personal level, the New Dylans' return to making music is a victory unto itself for cofounders Jim Reilley and Reese Campbell, who have dedicated much of their lives to the band. But, by reforming, the New Dylans join a new music industry that is rapidly shrinking and violently evolving at the same time. The very way people listen to music is changing, seemingly by the week as new streaming services come online, and the result is an industry that is especially challenging for middle class professionals like the New Dylans.\n\n\"I'm at a place where I haven't done much else other than music since I was in my early 20s and I'm 53,\" Reilley said. \"I've kind of known the game for a while and being here in Nashville for the last 16 years my eyes have been way opened to this game and how it works and I don't like it sometimes. It's a very ugly business. Yet we're stuck, we're kind of stuck in it.\"\n\nOver the last year, The Tennessean followed the band as it navigated the business and art of making music, and as it dredged up the beautiful, mundane, gut-wrenching and poetic memories that define the New Dylans' perpetually almost-famous career.\n\nWhat emerges is a uniquely Nashville story about an underdog band still on the cusp of commercial success. What makes Nashville truly unique from other ascending cities is how bands like the New Dylans, comprised of Reilley and Campbell along with drummer Ken Coomer and bassist Chris Autry, are so commonplace.\n\nSmall Town Standouts\n\nWarren High jazz band teacher Richard West said a typical music teacher would be fortunate to go an entire career and have one student as talented as Jim Reilley and Reese Campbell. West had them at the same time.\n\nThe New Dylans technically didn't form until the mid-1980s, but the seeds for the band were actually planted in the 1960s in the backyard of a preschool in Warren, Pa. It was there at Mrs. Smith's Preschool that Reilley and Campbell met as 4 year-olds.\n\n\"I remember Jim tried to drown me in the backyard above-ground swimming pool,\" Campbell said.\n\nThe two have been brother-like friends ever since. Their childhoods paralleled each other. Both had one parent die young and then were raised as only children by single parents - Reilley by his mother and Campbell by his father. Both showed prodigious ability as musicians and followed typical paths to learning and loving the artform. They participated in jazz band in high school. As teenagers, they joined competing cover bands - Reilley's was named Thunder and Campbell's was named Concord - which played weddings, birthday parties and at local social clubs.\n\nIn a small town, they were standouts.\n\n\"I think any music teacher would be lucky to have one student as talented as Jim or Reese over their whole career and I had them both at same time,\" West said.\n\nReilley and Campbell used music as an outlet to cope with the trauma of having a parent die young, and to manage the out-of-place emotions that artistic adolescents confront. After his father died when he was 15, Reilley recalled how West kept him focused on music. Campbell said his dad would take him to the local music shop where he'd buy whatever top-40 vinyl single the teenager behind the counter recommended.\n\n\"We're both only children of people of single parents. We were really brought up to get our own way. We were very indulged because first we were only children and then we were both sympathized with because our parents had died.\"\n\nWarren is a bucolic town on the Allegheny River just south of the New York state border. With a population of 10,000, Warren is blue collar, quiet and safe. At night, the downtown goes dark early making it the kind place where parents know their kids don't have much trouble to get into, and where teenagers dream of escaping.\n\n\"I remember growing up, Warren was perfect,\" Reilley said. \"It's nice now, and maybe this is just me being old and thinking, 'Boy things aren't like what they used to be,' but I really remember it as just a perfect place to grow up.\"\n\nBut for all of its strengths, Warren didn't offer many opportunities to make a go of it musically. That's why Reilley and Campbell, who were in their mid-20s at the time, were floored when the alternative-rock band 10,000 Maniacs, from the neighboring town of Jamestown, N.Y., broke and landed a record deal with Elektra Records.\n\nThe duo befriended bassist John Lombardo and drummer Jerry Augustyniak from 10,000 Maniacs and with their help created the first iteration of the New Dylans.\n\n\"We thought it's not impossible to launch something like that from a little town,\" Campbell said. \"Literally, Jim was like, 'Well if these guys can do it, then we can do it.'\n\nForeshadowing a whole career of tongue-in-cheek, self-deprecating sarcasm, Reilley and Campbell decided on the name the New Dylans. It was an homage to Bob Dylan and a jab at the music press which for decades had anointed up-and-coming singer-songwriters as \"the new Dylan.\"\n\n\"It was like, 'Of course we're not the next Dylan,'\" Reilley said. \"I mean we were just trying to be funny and ironic.\"\n\nAlmost as soon as the New Dylans had formed, recorded their original six songs and found themselves unexpectedly on the launching pad for a career in music, the band broke up.\n\nTo record its debut EP, the new band rented studio time in Pittsburgh in 1986 and over the course of a single weekend recorded and mixed a six-song EP. Then they had to figure out a way to raise money to release it themselves. Well before crowdsourcing was a thing, Reilley and Campbell solicited funds from friends and family to help pay for a vinyl pressing with their parents picking up the remainder of the bill.\n\nTheir record was actually pressed at United Record Pressing in Nashville.\n\nWithout a real plan for how to release the record, they went to Reilley's mom's house and stuffed envelopes with the records they would send to music critics, record labels and other music businesses.\n\n\"We just naively boxed them up and sent them out,\" Reilley said.\n\nTo the band's astonishment, the EP got positive feedback almost instantly. Robert Christgau, regarded as a luminary in the field of music criticism, tabbed it as one of his top-five EPs in the revered Village Voice annual \"Pazz and Jop\" poll. Record labels wanted to talk to them. While on tour with REM, 10,000 Maniacs frontwoman Natalie Merchant shared the EP with Stipe, who called the record his \"pick of 1987\" in \"Rock Express\" magazine. Peter Zeremba, lead singer of the Fleshtones, featured the band on the monthly MTV show \"The Cutting Edge,\" which he hosted.\n\nBut while the music was ready, the New Dylans were not. It was their first harsh lesson in the realities of the music industry.\n\n\"We had no infrastructure to make anything happen - no band even,\" Campbell said, pointing out that their rhythm section returned to 10,000 Maniacs and left the New Dylans without any replacements. \"I guess we didn't expect anything to happen. We didn't have a game plan and were pessimistic about our chances and the whole thing did click with a few tastemakers. (But) it's like, 'OK what do we do now? There's nobody around to put a band together with.' It just kind of faded away at that point.\"\n\nThe New Dylans were lauded by critics immediately. Here is a look at what critics and music media said about the New Dylans during their runs in the 80s and 90s.\n\nThe reference section on the second floor of the Warren Public Library has a manilla folder stuffed entirely with clips about the New Dylans.\n\nWhen the band got a favorable review in Rolling Stone or set out on a tour, the local newspaper, the Warren Times Observer, covered every turn. In a town of 10,000 people, the New Dylans became local celebrities.\n\n\"My sister Tammy is real good friends with Jim's wife,\" New Dylans fan Todd Ristau said. \"And so we had a copy of the EP of course. And she played it and said, 'What do you think this is a local band?' And I thought it was the coolest thing ever because they were from Warren. The music was interesting, I enjoyed the music.\"\n\nSupporting the New Dylans meant enduring a rollercoaster ride.\n\nRistau said the town and the band's fans were disappointed to learn they broke up in the 80s.\n\nAfter going their separate ways and working on other music projects, the New Dylans decided to reform in 1992 with a new lineup of drummer Scott Franklin and bassist Chris Peroski joining Campbell and Reilley.\n\nNow anchored primarily in Rochester, N.Y., this time the band had a plan and better organization than in the 80s. They recorded the songs that would become the first full-length album \"Warren Peace\" for about $4,000 and began to network.\n\nOne of their connections was with Chuck Cuminale, a luminary in the Rochester music scene who fronted a band called the Colorblind James Experience. Cuminale hooked the New Dylans up with Minnesota folk label Red House Records, which signed the band to a record deal. The new music continued the New Dylans' trend of winning over music critics.\n\nRolling Stone gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars with critic Paul Evans likening the band to Elvis Costello\n\n\"James Reilley and Reese Campbell craft folk rock songs so fine that their quartet's name seems less playful hubris than fact,\" Evans wrote in his May, 1994 review. \"The New Costellos however might be more apt; their tunes take on a melodic buoyancy that recalls Elvis' pop rather than Bob's blues.\"\n\nTheir last full-length album was \"American Way,\" which came out in 1995 and generated still more music press buzz. NPR featured the band's music on \"All Songs Considered.\" Music mags like Spin and Mojo showered the New Dylans with praise.\n\nCritics, like the Boston Globe's Jeanne Cooper, appreciated the band's smart lyrics and \"lean toward irony.\"\n\n\"If there's any justice, the tuneful truth of 'The American Way' will bring the New Dylans a legion of fans,\" Cooper wrote in her April 5, 1995 review.\n\nBut the positive reviews were also a double-edged sword. It was during the New Dylans' time on Red House Records that they began to tour ferociously. Between 1993 and 1996, they were on the road virtually full-time.\n\nEric Peltoniemi, current president at Red House Records, was the vice president when the New Dylans were signed to the label. Peltoniemi said the very attributes that made the New Dylans appealing to critics made it difficult for the label to market them to radio programmers. It would be an understatement to call the band's song topics outside-the-box. In their early years, they wrote about scientists trying to relocate the tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh, scheming small town courthouse lawyers and other off-beat topics.\n\n\"I think maybe that might be part of why we had a little hard time getting them to connect,\" Peltoniemi said. \"I remember live when they performed at our festivals audiences loved them.\"\n\nCampbell said the buzz did not translate into spins on the radio, which meant their well-reviewed albums did not sell. The critical acclaim also did not always lead to strong attendance at their shows, even though it did enable the band to garner bookings. Campbell served as the de facto booking agent, scheduling as many shows as possible. Over a three-year stretch, the New Dylans played hundreds of shows in 45 states. They opened for the likes of the Band, Townes Van Zandt, Shawn Colvin, the Fleshtones, 10,000 Maniacs and Superdrag.\n\nThe heavy touring schedule created lasting memories - like coasting into Fargo, N.D. flat broke and on fumes, and scrambling to find la ast-minute gig that ginned up enough cash to get back on the road. Or the time the band's van broke down in Colorado, which created one of Reilley's favorite scrapbook photos: a shot of the New Dylans' van being towed by Dillon Towing Company.\n\n\"And our drummer and bass player were fighting at the time. So we made them sit in the back of the van that was being towed on this flatbed and work it out while Reese and I rode in the tow truck,\" Reilley said. \"So there's this shot of our van getting towed with half our band in it so we could get to Boulder to play at the Sink.\"\n\nA ferocious touring schedule didn't necessarily mean a glamorous life for the New Dylans. On one tour in the 90s, the band members found themselves coasting into Fargo, N.D. completely broke.\n\nThe New Dylans split up, again\n\nBut the relentless touring also proved to be an unwise business strategy. The band lived in the red with the cost of touring constantly exceeding the money they earned on the road. Campbell joked that the New Dylans played more gigs in college towns than any band over that four-year stretch. Unfortunately most of the gigs were in the summer when students weren't on campus.\n\n\"It was almost going into the red to tour,\" Campbell said. \"I think in retrospect also our hubris at that point was that we really bit off more than we should have too early. The sort of career development path of a band, you need to start locally, develop a following, move regionally.\n\n\"We just jumped right into national tours, because you know we got reviewed in Rolling Stone. We thought we skipped that organic growth step and we can just kind of jump into doing this and get people in clubs. We over-reached a bit in that aspect of it. A lot of times we really wouldn't have a lot of people (at the club), because you know, we read Rolling Stone but most people don't.\"\n\nPlaying gigs for small crowds and small booking fees was especially tough for the other members of the New Dylans. Reilley jokes that, although none of their drummers ever died, the New Dylans went through more drummers than Spinal Tap in the famous 1984 mockumentary comedy.\n\nAs time wore on, the emotional toll of being on the road was too much to bear and the New Dylans broke up for a second time in 1996.\n\n\"You go out on tour and you're playing in clubs and you're making $100 or $150 and that's just enough gas to get to the next place,\" Campbell said. \"It's tough. The drummer and bass player, whoever they happened to be at the time, were certainly not getting any attention. It was always obvious that the New Dylans were Jim and me. So what's in it for those guys other than the privilege of playing with us?\"\n\nAfter breaking up, Reilley moved to Nashville to pursue a songwriting career. He quickly ingratiated himself to the local music community and landed a publishing deal with Curb Music Publishing. He released a solo record, which Tennessean music columnist Peter Cooper tabbed as one of his favorites in 2003, writing, \"Someone hurry up and make this guy famous.\"\n\nBut fame and monetary success never followed Reilley. Even still, he's been able to carve out a living creating music. Instead of serving coffee, Reilley spends much of his time at the Portland Brew on 12th Ave. South, networking, tinkering with song ideas. In the last 16 years, he's produced over 50 albums, and he's very much focused his career on mentoring aspiring artists.\n\nThe reality, however, is that Reilley never made the record he wanted to make. That's why he got the itch to reform the New Dylans. Imagine spending your entire life creating something, and knowing the end result never quite came out the way you wanted. Reilley contacted Campbell in late 2013 about getting back together.\n\nHe recruited Coomer, a veteran drummer and record producer who was a founding member of indie rock legends Wilco, and Autry, an emerging star bassist, who tours with Jo Dee Messina's band.\n\n\"It's one goal. To try to make a really good record we can be proud of,\" Reilley said. \"That's the whole reason I wanted to do this in the first place. Because, although I love the songs on those records, I wasn't really happy with the records.\"\n\nAfter 18-year-hiatus, New Music\n\nIt is not a coincidence that \"Betadine,\" the first song from the New Dylans in nearly 20 years, hits its high point as co-founder Jim Reilley croons, \"the downbeat just goes on.\"\n\nNearly 30 years after the band first formed, the downbeat just goes on for the New Dylans.\n\nThe band earned its rep writing about unconventional topics and, true to form, this is surely the first song about addiction to \"Betadine,\" the potent antibiotic solution. Reilley opens up the song by singing, \"You came in with the night/Brought me suicide,\" and \"Betadine\" generally stays dark throughout its four minutes and 27 seconds. But, long-time fans of the band will hear how its music has evolved in the last 18 years.\n\nMuch of the music on \"Meta,\" their new album which will be released next year, seems to have the New Dylans settling in as a pure and simple rock band. Co-founder Reese Campbell said the goal on the new album was not fame or fortune. It was simply to make music that makes the band happy. Reilley, now a grizzled veteran of the Nashville music industry, agreed.\n\n\"Having produced so many records and being here and spent thousands of hours in the studio since I've been here, I really know what I want and I know how to get it,\" Reilley said. \"This is far and away the loudest, rawest, most emotional, most dynamic record we've ever made. It's going to surprise some people if they listen if they may have known us from before, because it's different from anything we've ever done. And it's something I always wanted to do. We've really come into agreement that we wanted this record to be that way. It's going to be really nice and loud.\"\n\n\"Betadine\" emerges\n\nThe New Dylans co-founder Jim Reilley discusses the band's first single on the new album Meta called \"Betadine.\"\n\nNew Album, New Players\n\nNearly 30 years after they began creating music together, Jim Reilley and Reese Campbell still hadn't recorded the album they truly wanted to make.\n\nReilley described it as a certain form of torture to spend his career as a songwriter, producer, singer and guitarist and never quite come out with the right music. Reuniting in 2014 to create \"Meta,\" their first album in 18 years, was the culmination of three decades of unfinished business.\n\nNow in their early 50s, Reilley and Campbell brought a well-lived realism to their lyrics and song topics, which are wide-ranging. On \"Meta,\" the New Dylans tackled everything from global warming to child sex abuse within the Morman church to the troubled state of Nashville's music industry.\n\n\"Meta\" is filled with songs that would be hard sells to radio programmers. And yet, the band has maintained its sense of melody and hooks, which charmed music critics in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\"The way I see this record is this place we're at right now in the world is not necessarily as great as it could be,\" Reilley said. \"There's a lot that's wrong with the world. The older I get, the more confused I get about how to fix it or if it is even possible to fix it?\"\n\nWhen they first reunited in January, Reilley and Campbell worked under somewhat pressure-packed circumstances. They had a finite amount of time together before Campbell, who lives in Pennsylvania, would have to go home. Nearly 20 years after they wrote the previous New Dylans song, would the childhood friends be able to get their groove back? As it turns out, Campbell said the creative process was more comfortable than in years past.\n\nThey developed song ideas inside a claustrophobic writing room in Berry Hill, then headed to an East Nashville barn to record the album under the guidance of engineer and co-producer Eric Fritsch. They recorded the album over the span of five days in September. The album included contributions from legendary mandolin player Tim O'Brien and Roy Agee, who plays trombone in Prince's band. Arrangements include lush horn sections, quirky, ornate interludes and the same playful, acerbic lyrics that slayed music critics earlier in the New Dylans' career. Yet, it's also clear the band's sound has evolved over the last 20 years, as Reilley and Campbell have subtracted the folk from their former description as a folk-rock band. Now it's straight rock music, this time a commentary on the music industry and the world around them.\n\n\"I think we're much more mature now,\" Campbell said. \"We've been really collaborating this time. It used to be we kind of brought in songs and the other person would add something to it, some lyrics, a bridge or something.\"\n\n\"This time we really kind of tossed stuff back and forth. I think the songs kind of evolved a bit more organically this time.\"\n\nReilley and Campbell have opposite approaches to music and songwriting. Campbell is very literal in his lyrics and mathematical in how he plays piano. Reilley is more inclined to use symbolism in his lyrics and alter how a song sounds based on how it feels.\n\nNew Dylans bassist Chris Autry said he gravitates more toward Campbell's measured approach - Autry could give a master course on the Nashville number system, which most studio musicians use to chart and learn songs.\n\n\"Jim and Ken work exactly the same and Reese and I work the same. And we just meet in the middle,\" Autry said. \"Because Reese is very analytical, and very sharp, and on it and structured, which is how I work. And Jim and Ken are like, 'This feels great! Let's do it this way!'\"\n\nIn the studio, Coomer would frequently eschew charts in favor of song lyrics and ask Reilley, \"what kind of feel are we going for on this one?\" To which Reilley would respond with descriptions like, \"kind of a Ramones pretending to be the Beach Boys vibe,\" for the surf-tinged \"Fresno Beach.\"\n\n\"I like serving the song, which really sounds cliche,\" Coomer said. \"But at the end of the day if you're worried about the fills you're going to make in a bridge or a chorus or in a song in particular, instead of serving the song, then I think you're kind of missing the point.\"\n\nThe New Dylans co-founder Reese Campbell discusses the inspiration for \"Fresno Beach.\"\n\nMusic is like faith\n\nThe New Dylans returned to the studio in October for the first time in 18 years.\n\nEvolution of 'Complicated'\n\nWhen the New Dylans first rehearsed \"Complicated\" in co-founder Jim Reilley's songwriting room in Berry Hill, there were no lyrics. It had been 20 years since Reilley and co-founder Reese Campbell last wrote together. But, shortly after they reunited in January to begin sharing song ideas, it was clear almost instantly that the band had found its groove.\n\nEven though the band was working under a stringent deadline, since Campbell only had a few days before he had to head back to his home in Pennsylvania, the writing sessions were relaxed and the ideas flowed freely.\n\nBy the end of three days, the New Dylans had at least seven song ideas hammered out. The first two clips were recorded during those initial sessions in January.\n\nWhen the band gathered in an East Nashville barn-studio in September, the same deadline existed. Campbell had set aside five days to record the album before he had to head back home. But, \"Complicated\" was one of a majority of tracks the New Dylans knocked out without issue. At the 3-minute mark, drummer Ken Coomer and the rest of the band comes in and turns Reilley's idea into a good old-fashioned rock song.\n\nEvolution of 'Colorado City'\n\nIf you were looking for a catchy piano-driven pop song about the child sex abuse scandal in the Morman church, then the New Dylans have you covered.\n\nContinuing their predilection for off-the-beaten-path song topics, which over the years have ranged from efforts to relocate the tomb of an Egypitan pharoah (\"Happy Birthday Ramses II\") to skeezy courthouse (\"Mr. Parking Tickets\"), the New Dylans broached the subject in this song.\n\nIn July, the band recorded a rough demo of the song in East Nashville.\n\nUnlike other songs on \"Meta,\" lead writer Reese Campbell arrived with a fully-formed idea for \"Colorado City.\" Lyrics like, \"No, he's Father not your brother/Well, we married one another at the prophet's will/Oh no, it's not incestial 'cause our union is celestial/Listen, when you grow a chest I'll let you know the drill.\"\n\nCampbell said he was driven by external problems in the world when he set out to write songs for the band's album. His song topics also tackled natural gas fracking and global warming.\n\nThe song's bouncy beat in the final version conceals its dark subject matter.\n\nEvolution of \"Heather Place\"\n\nAbout one-third of the songs on the New Dylans' third full-length album were inspired by co-founder Jim Reilley's gritty experiences with the Nashville music industry.\n\nReilley said he personfied the music business as a lover who he's given up everything to be with. \"Heather Place\" finds Reilley reflecting, \"That's what I get for looking up at broken skies/No remedy no return innocence to tired eyes/Cyanide summer winter falls/A place to keep me from it all.\"\n\nThose are not warm and fuzzy thoughts. Heather Place is the Berry Hill road that housed Reilley's writing space, where he and co-founder Reese Campbell worked on their initial song ideas.\n\nHere are three versions of \"Heather Place,\" from their first rendition without lyrics, which they practiced inside the writing room, to a version this spring after Reilley added his lyric and finally the finished recording.\n\nThe New Dylans trailer\n\nLyrical Journey\n\nThe final lyrics to the songs on \"Meta.\" All lyrics are by Jim Reilley and Reese Campbell.\n\nBilly Block\n\nNashville music industry mainstay Billy Block talks about the New Dylans and Jim Reilley's career.\n\nNew Dylans partner with Nashville start-up\n\nThe wide variety of ways the New Dylans will distribute \"Meta,\" their first album in 18 years, illustrates how the music industry has evolved in the last two decades.\n\nIn 1996, the New Dylans and their label Red House Records distributed the band's music almost exclusively in the form of CDs sold at record shops or at merchandise tables after concerts. That was actually an advanced distribution model compared to a decade earlier when the band members solicited donations from family and friends to fund a vinyl pressing of their debut EP and, with absolutely no distribution, sold the records almost exclusively at concerts.\n\nFor \"Meta,\" the New Dylans will have physical copies of the album distributed by Keaton Music Publishing, license the album to online retailers like iTunes, and make it available on streaming services like Spotify.\n\nAnd in the most progressive version of music distribution, the band will make songs available through a partnership with Nashville-based music technology start-up Featuring.Me.\n\nThe concept behind Featuring.Me is for fans to be able to customize their own versions of original recordings provided by their favorite band. Through an app, fans are given all the recorded elements of a song, the drum section, guitar and bass parts, vocals and other elements like horns or solos. That means New Dylans fans will be able to select from different guitars, different drums, or even alternate lyrics in order to tailor the song to their individual taste.\n\nFeaturing.Me was selected to participate in a LAUNCH competition at TechWeek in Los Angeles. In addition to the New Dylans, the company has partnered with two bands from the west coast and is in conversations with bands, labels and management companies.\n\n\"If you think about it, the way music has been distributed hasn't really changed since vinyl first emerged decades ago,\" Featuring.Me founder Gregory Green said. \"The band records the music, puts it on a record, maybe that record is on vinyl or maybe it's downloaded MP3s — but that's it. That's what you have to listen to.\n\n\"With Featuring.Me, the artist is able to get more of their creativity out to fans, who are then able to explore and engage with the music more broadly than listening to just one static version that has been offered in the past.\"\n\nReilley said Featuring.Me appealed to him as a music nerd. He frequently buys deluxe versions of albums by his favorite bands like the Beatles or Rush so he can deconstruct all the different elements of a song. Reilley also said he hoped the partnership with Featuring Me would demonstrate that the band isn't lost in the 1990s.\n\n\"You've got all these people debating the merits of Spotify, but none of them are sort of regular, working independent bands,\" Reilley said. \"It's all these mega-rich, mega-successful people like Taylor Swift or the Black Keys, who I think are great by the way. But our strategy is, let's get our music in front of as many people as possible in as many interesting ways as possible.\n\n\"If that means they edit my guitar parts out of a song, I guess I'll just have to live with that.\"\n\nMusic Distribution\n\nHow the New Dylans distributed their music:\n\n1986: Paid for their debut EP themselves, pressed the record on vinyl, and distributed it by hand at concerts.\n\n1992-'96: Signed to a record deal with Red House Records, which distributed two albums, \"Warren Peace\" and \"The American Way,\" on CD.\n\n2014: Paid to record \"Meta\" out of the demo budget on Reilley's songwriting deal with Keaton Music Publishing, licensed music to digital retailers like iTunes, and streaming services like Spotify and Soundcloud. Signed exclusive distribution deal with Featuring Me, a Nashville firm that allows fans to create their own original mixes of a band's material.\n\nThe New Dylans perform in '93\n\nThe New Dylans, who practically lived on the road for three years in the 1990s, perform \"Desmond\" on June 12, 1993 at the Jamestown stadium benefit.\n\nMeet the New Dylans\n\nReese Campbell, co-founder, songwriter, singer, piano and keys. Campbell's other projects include independent rock band Modified Nouns, Djava, Gary Belloma & The Blue Bombers. When the New Dylans were signed to Red House Records in the 1990s, Campbell served as the de facto booking agent and tour manager.\n\nJim Reilley, co-founder, songwriter, singer, guitar. Reilley moved to Nashville in 1998, scored a publishing deal with Curb Music Publishing. After eight years with the company, he has had several iterations of a publishing deal and also worked as a producer on over 50 projects for independent bands and artists.\n\nKen Coomer, drums: Coomer is a music industry veteran. After graduating from MTSU, he played in several bands, including rock band Clockhammer. He was a founding member of Wilco and played on the legendary Chicago independent band's early albums. He's played as a studio musician for artists from virtually ever genre and carved out steady work as a producer.\n\nChris Autry, bass: Autry graduated from Belmont with a degree in business. He's played bass for artists like Shane MacAnally, Craig Morgan, sheDaisy and most recently Jo Dee Messina, in addition to playing in Nashville jazz bands and other projects. Besides studio and touring work, Autry also has developed the skill of horn arranging.\n\nBookmark this page, visit often and engage with us on The Tennessean on Facebook and Twitter!

Swinging away at Trump, the Democratic presidential candidate also blasted her Republican opponent for cultivating turmoil when he was in the White House.\n\n“America for too long, we have been consumed with too much division, chaos and mutual distrust. It can be easy then, to forget a simple truth: It doesn't have to be this way,” Harris said. “We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms. It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the fear and division.\"\n\nShe told a crowd, which her campaign estimated at 75,000: “It is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership.\"\n\nWith a week left until Election Day on Nov. 5, Harris and Trump have traded insults as they crisscrossed the country trying to drum up support in a race that is statistically tied. The two politicians have been making last-ditch efforts to appeal to disengaged voters by holding large, attention-grabbing events like the controversial rally Trump held on Sunday evening rally at Madison Square Garden and Harris’ speech on Tuesday night at the Ellipse.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Trump has blamed Harris for inflation and high prices across the nation. He has also hit the incumbent Democratic vice president on the Biden administration's immigration policies, saying she is to blame for the rise in migrants coming to the United States.\n\nIn a prepared statement on Tuesday, Trump's campaign slammed Harris' speech for its \"dark, angry, and negative message that was marked by her sheer desperation.\"\n\n\"While Kamala peddles division, President Trump is honing in on the issues that matter to voters — fixing the economy, securing the border, protecting Americans' freedoms, and re-establishing America's strength around the world,\" the Trump campaign said.\n\nHarris' remarks were directed primarily at Americans watching at home who may not be planning to vote in the election. She also acknowledged in her speech that many of the attendees at the rally have probably already cast their ballots.\n\nFor those who have not, she told them, \"We know who Donald Trump is, he is the person who stood in this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election. An election that he knew he lost.\"\n\nShe said she would offer a different path than Trump or President Joe Biden if she's elected on Nov. 5.\n\n“My presidency will be different, because the challenges we face are different,” she said, adding that four years ago she and Biden were focused on ending the pandemic and reducing the economy. “Now, our biggest challenge is to lower costs, costs that were rising even before the pandemic and that are still too high.”\n\nThe vice president has been repeatedly asked how she will be different from the current administration, but has been reluctant to draw a contrast between her and Biden.\n\nCommitting to working with all Americans, Harris touted her proposals to lower costs for Americans, including a federal ban on price gouging, capping insulin prices and supporting first-time home buyers.\n\nWith a week until Election Day, Harris also acknowledged she's still introducing herself to voters who may not know who she is.\n\nElection Day is days away.Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for breaking news and exclusive analysis.\n\nWhile Harris in her speech promised to take the United States in a new direction if elected, remarks from Biden from earlier Tuesday snatched the spotlight away from his vice president.\n\nAddressing the racist comments a comedian at Trump’s rally on Sunday made about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage,\" Biden said during a virtual event with Voto Latino: “The only garbage I see floating out there are his supporter’s – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American,” according to a transcript released by the White House.\n\nBiden's remarks sparked immediate backlash from Republican lawmakers and from Trump, who held a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday evening at the same time as Harris' event. Trump said Biden’s remarks were “terrible,” and likened them to Hillary Clinton's comments calling some of his supporters \"deplorables\" during the 2016 presidential campaign that he won.\n\nBiden later wrote in a post on X that he was referring “to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage.”\n\n‘Reclaiming’ the Ellipse from Jan. 6\n\nAhead of her speech, thousands of Harris supporters waited in a line that snaked up and down 15th Street in Washington D.C. from the National Mall to Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nStreet vendors walked up and down the crowd selling t-shirts, buttons and other gear to support the Democratic nominee. Music filled the air as a buzz of voices waited to be allowed on the Ellipse. Many attendees wore clothing in support of Harris’ candidacy, while others wore shirts that said “Vote” and “Black Lives Matter.” Some attendees were dressed up as Harris’ signature shoe: Converse.\n\nInside the event, a DJ played songs like Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off” and Jennifer Lopez’s “Let’s Get Loud” – both artists have endorsed the vice president. The DJ also played a Trump campaign classic, the Village People's Y.M.C.A.\n\nVolunteers passed out an array of snacks, including cotton candy, pop tarts and fruit snacks. At the end of the night, volunteers gave away a surplus of cotton candy.\n\nDaraja Carroll, 28, lives blocks away from the White House and rode a scooter to the event with her friend, Sharlie Goodson, 29. Like Harris, Carroll hails from California – the same place Harris first served as district attorney, San Francisco. And like Harris, Carroll has dreams of being an attorney general one day.\n\n“I just couldn't sit on my couch,” she said. “I am a black woman attorney. I am a descendant of enslaved people. I am a history buff who knows my family's history…There's so many reasons why I came today to support her. I felt like I couldn't sit at home.”\n\nFour years ago, Carroll joined in at a block party at St. John’s Lafayette Square church – the same location Trump cleared out during a Black Lives Matter protest in 2020 after Biden beat Trump. Carroll said at the time, they were reclaiming that space.\n\nNow, Harris is reclaiming the Ellipse, she said.\n\n“Because as much as you disrespect the Black history in the city, here we are reclaiming it,” she said. “Being in D.C., like the slaves built this, and so for her to be on this stage in front of these buildings that were built by my ancestors and disrespected by these racist white people, it is special. We do have to reclaim it.”\n\nTosha Taylor of Hughesville, Md., said Harris’ rally is a “clear contrast” from the Trump rally Americans saw four years ago. Taylor, an Air Force and Army veteran, said Harris’ event is one that is “full of solidarity and love for country and real patriotism.”\n\nBut Trump’s Jan. 6 rally was “full of hate,” Taylor said.\n\n“This is totally different,” the 53-year-old said. “Put the two pictures beside each other. You see solidarity, happiness and joy and pro-country. The other one is anti-country, trying to overthrow your government. It was full of hate and violence and all kinds of crazy stuff, and wannabe patriots.”\n\nSuzy Wagner and her husband, Eric, said they believe that Harris hit the nail on the head of why voters should support her.\n\n“Everything that she came out with was the antithesis of what he's been saying and the fear mongering that he's been pushing out there,” said Suzy Wagner, 54, of Arlington, Va. “We're just over it.”\n\n(This story has been updated with a new photo.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/30"}]}

But during a recent interview with her, I showed Hanson my attempts to recreate her style with just a few keystrokes.\n\nUsing Stable Diffusion, a popular and publicly available open-source AI image generation tool, I had plugged in a series of prompts to create images in the style of some of her paintings of California poppies on an ocean cliff and a field of lupin.\n\n“That one with the purple flowers and the sunset,” she said via Zoom, peering at one of my attempts, “definitely looks like one of my paintings, you know?”\n\nWith Hanson’s guidance, I then tailored another detailed prompt: “Oil painting of crystal light, in the style of Erin Hanson, light and shadows, backlit trees, strong outlines, stained glass, modern impressionist, award-winning, trending on ArtStation, vivid, high-definition, high-resolution.” I fed the prompt to Stable Diffusion; within seconds it produced three images.\n\n“Oh, wow,” she said as we pored over the results, pointing out how similar the trees in one image looked to the ones in her 2021 painting “Crystalline Maples.” “I would put that on my wall,” she soon added.\n\nAn image created by CNN's Rachel Metz with input from artist Erin Hanson, using the AI platform Stable Diffusion. It resembles Hanson's work, particularly with its colors and simulated brush strokes.

She’s one of several artists interviewed by CNN Business who were unhappy to learn that pictures of their work were used without someone informing them, asking for consent, or paying for their use.\n\nOnce available only to a select group of tech insiders, text-to-image AI systems are becoming increasingly popular and powerful. These systems include Stable Diffusion, from a company that recently raised more than $100 million in funding, and DALL-E, from a company that has raised $1 billion to date.\n\nThese tools, which typically offer some free credits before charging, can create all kinds of images with just a few words, including those that are clearly evocative of the works of many, many artists (if not seemingly created by the same artist). Users can invoke those artists with words such as “in the style of” or “by” along with a specific name. And the current uses for these tools can range from personal amusement to more commercial cases.\n\nIn just months, millions of people have flocked to text-to-image AI systems and they are already being used to create experimental films, magazine covers and images to illustrate news stories. An image generated with an AI system called Midjourney recently won an art competition at the Colorado State Fair, and caused an uproar among artists.\n\n\"Crystalline Maples\", a 2021 oil painting by Erin Hanson. Courtesy Erin Hanson\n\nBut as artists like Hanson have discovered that their work is being used to train AI, it raises an even more fundamental concern: that their own art is effectively being used to train a computer program that could one day cut into their livelihoods. Anyone who generates images with systems such as Stable Diffusion or DALL-E can then sell them (the specific terms regarding copyright and ownership of these images varies).\n\n“I don’t want to participate at all in the machine that’s going to cheapen what I do,” said Daniel Danger, an illustrator and print maker who learned a number of his works were used to train Stable Diffusion.\n\nWhen fine art becomes data\n\nThe machines are far from magic. For one of these systems to ingest your words and spit out an image, it must be trained on mountains of data, which may include billions of images scraped from the internet, paired with written descriptions.\n\nSome services, including OpenAI’s DALL-E system, don’t disclose the datasets behind their AI systems. But with Stable Diffusion, Stability AI is clear about its origins. Its core dataset was trained on image and text pairs that were curated for their looks from an even more massive cache of images and text from the internet. The full-size dataset, known as LAION-5B was created by the German AI nonprofit LAION, which stands for “large-scale artificial intelligence open network.”\n\nThis practice of scraping images or other content from the internet for dataset training isn’t new, and traditionally falls under what’s known as “fair use” — the legal principle in US copyright law that allows for the use of copyright-protected work in some situations. That’s because those images, many of which may be copyrighted, are being used in a very different way, such as for training a computer to identify cats.\n\nBut datasets are getting larger and larger, and training ever-more-powerful AI systems, including, recently, these generative ones that anyone can use to make remarkable looking images in an instant.\n\nA piece by illustrator Daniel Danger that was included in the training data behind the Stable Diffusion AI image generator. Courtesy Daniel Danger\n\nA few tools let anyone search through the LAION-5B dataset, and a growing number of professional artists are discovering their work is part of it. One of these search tools, built by writer and technologist Andy Baio and programmer Simon Willison, stands out. While it can only be used to search a small fraction of Stable Diffusion’s training data (more than 12 million images), its creators analyzed the art imagery within it and determined that, of the top 25 artists whose work was represented, Hanson was one of just three who is still alive. They found 3,854 images of her art included in just their small sampling.\n\nStability AI founder and CEO Emad Mostaque told CNN Business via email that art is a tiny fraction of the LAION training data behind Stable Diffusion. “Art makes up much less than 0.1% of the dataset and is only created when deliberately called by the user,” he said.\n\nBut that’s slim comfort to some artists.\n\nAngry artists\n\nDanger, whose artwork includes posters for bands like Phish and Primus, is one of several professional artists who told CNN Business they worry that AI image generators could threaten their livelihoods.\n\nHe is concerned that the images people produce with AI image generators could replace some of his more “utilitarian” work, which includes media like book covers and illustrations for articles published online.\n\n“Why are we going to pay an artist $1,000 when we can have 1,000 [images] to pick from for free?” he asked. “People are cheap.”\n\nTara McPherson, a Pittsburgh-based artist whose work is featured on toys, clothing and in films such as the Oscar-winning “Juno,” is also concerned about the possibility of losing out on some work to AI. She feels disappointed and “taken advantage of” for having her work included in the dataset behind Stable Diffusion without her knowledge, she said.\n\n“How easy is this going to be? How elegant is this art going to become?,” she asked. “Right now it’s a little wonky sometimes but this is just getting started.”\n\nWhile the concerns are real, the recourse is unclear. Even if AI-generated images have a widespread impact — such as by changing business models — it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re violating artists’ copyrights, according to Zahr Said, a law professor at the University of Washington. And it would be prohibitive to license every single image in a dataset before using it, she said.\n\n“You can actually feel really sympathetic for artistic communities and want to support them and also be like, there’s no way,” she said. “If we did that, it would essentially be saying machine learning is impossible.”\n\nMcPherson and Danger mused about the possibility of putting watermarks on their work when posting it online to safeguard the images (or at least make them look less appealing). But McPherson said when she’s seen artist friends put watermarks across their images online it “ruins the art, and the joy of people looking at it and finding inspiration in it.”\n\nIf he could, Danger said he would remove his images from datasets used to train AI systems. But removing pictures of an artist’s work from a dataset wouldn’t stop Stable Diffusion from being able to generate images in that artist’s style.\n\nFor starters, the AI model has already been trained. But also, as Mostaque said, specific artistic styles could still be called on by users because of OpenAI’s CLIP model, which was used to train Stable Diffusion to understand connections between words and images.\n\nChristoph Schuhmann, an LAION founder, said via email that his group thinks that truly enabling opting in and out of datasets will only work if all parts of AI models — of which there can be many — respect those choices.\n\n“A unilateral approach to consent handling will not suffice in the AI world; we need a cross-industry system to handle that,” he said.\n\nOffering artists more control\n\nPartners Mathew Dryhurst and Holly Herndon, Berlin-based artists experimenting with AI in their collaborative work, are working to tackle these challenges. Together with two other collaborators, they have launched Spawning, making tools for artists that they hope will let them better understand and control how their online art is used in datasets.\n\nIn September, Spawning released a search engine that can comb through the LAION-5B dataset, haveibeentrained.com, and in the coming weeks it intends to offer a way for people to opt out or in to datasets used for training. Over the past month or so, Dryhurst said, he’s been meeting with organizations training large AI models. He wants to get them to agree that if Spawning gathers lists of works from artists who don’t want to be included, they’ll honor those requests.\n\nDryhurst said Spawning’s goal is to make it clear that consensual data collection benefits everyone. And Mostaque agrees that people should be able to opt out. He told CNN Business that Stability AI is working with numerous groups on ways to “enable more control of database contents by the community” in the future. In a Twitter thread in September, he said Stability is open to contributing to ways that people can opt out of datasets, “such as by supporting Herndon’s work on this with many other projects to come.”\n\nTara McPherson's \"The Wanderers\" is one of her works that was included in the dataset underpinning Stable Diffusion. Courtesy Tara McPherson\n\n“I personally understand the emotions around this as the systems become intelligent enough to understand styles,” he said in an email to CNN Business.\n\nSchuhmann said LAION is also working with “various groups” to figure out how to let people opt in or out of including their images in training text-to-image AI models. “We take the feelings and concerns of artists very seriously,” Schuhmann said.\n\nHanson, for her part, has no problem with her art being used for training AI, but she wants to be paid. If images are sold that were made with the AI systems trained on their work, artists need to be compensated, she said — even if it’s “fractions of pennies.”\n\nThis could be on the horizon. Mostaque said Stability AI is looking into how “creatives can be rewarded from their work,” particularly as Stability AI itself releases AI models, rather than using those built by others. The company will soon announce a plan to get community feedback on “practical ways” to do this, he said.\n\nTheoretically, I may eventually owe Hanson some money.

However, it is still solid considering that the film is rated R, isn’t tied to a blockbuster brand or sequel and had a relatively modest production budget of $68 million.\n\nThe opening for “Nope” tops Peele’s first film, “Get Out,” which made $33 million in 2017, but falls short of “Us,” which blew past expectations three years ago, opening to roughly $70 million — more than tripling its $20 million production budget in a single weekend. Both films eventually made $255 million worldwide.\n\nThis isn’t a spectacular opening the way “Us” was, but the film could have legs considering it has good reviews with a 83% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n“When it comes to Jordan Peele, it’s not so much about the opening weekend as much as it’s about building that word of mouth,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business. “His movies are in it for the long haul.”\n\nDergarabedian also noted that there’s really no competition in the weeks to come, which may be good news for ticket sales going forward.\n\nWhy “Nope” didn’t make more could be due to myriad reasons. For starters, Peele’s films — while entertaining — are reliably cerebral. That could leave some audiences perplexed rather than pleased, which explains the film’s “B” CinemaScore.\n\nAlso, the marketing around “Nope” was deeply cryptic and that may have led to more people being wary of diving in this weekend. This is especially the case right now as inflation is soaring and audiences are being careful with how they spend their money.\n\nAll in all, the opening of “Nope” was in the range of projections and will go down as another win for Peele and Universal.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/crime/957470/inside-fci-tallahassee-ghislaine-maxwell-prison", "title": "Inside FCI Tallahassee: the low-security prison where Ghislaine ...", "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell has been moved to a low-security prison in Florida where she can take part in yoga classes and try her hand at baking while she sees out the remainder of her sentence.\n\nThe former socialite was found guilty of recruiting and trafficking underage girls for disgraced billionaire Jeffrey Epstein last December and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Prisons, Maxwell has been moved to Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Tallahassee, a low-security, all-female prison in Florida’s capital, near where the majority of her crimes took place.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The Guardian said experts had described the jail as being “‘like Disneyland’ compared with the Brooklyn institution” where Maxwell has been held since her arrest in July 2020.\n\nThe Metro said the socialite “hated her time at the notoriously tough” Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, where Epstein was found dead in his cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\n\nThe Times reported that the 60-year-old, “who lived a life of luxury before her arrest, said she shared her tiny cell with rats, was served food infested with maggots and was abused by guards”. Her lawyers repeatedly complained she was being held in solitary confinement and her family even filed a complaint with the United Nations over her treatment.\n\nJudge Alison Nathan, who presided over Maxwell’s case, had supported her lawyers’ request to the Bureau of Prisons for Maxwell to be sent to FCI Danbury, “known as ‘Club Fed’ because of its amiable conditions”, said The Telegraph.\n\n“It is not clear why the law enforcement agency went against the Judge’s decision”, added the paper.\n\nWhat is life in FCI Tallahassee like?\n\nThe prison opened in 1938 with the capacity to house 755 female-only prisoners. Inmates at FCI Tallahassee are issued with an inmate identification card which must be worn at all times, and woken at 6am every day.\n\nEach prisoner shares a cell with one other person and staff may search cells at any time for contraband or stolen property. The only approved uniform is khaki pants, khaki shirt, knickers, bra, socks and authorised shoes.\n\nMaxwell will be allowed to wear a plain wedding band, “even though her marriage to former tech entrepreneur Scott Borgerson is over and they are understood to be divorcing”, said The Metro.\n\nAccording to a prison consulting firm, Zoukis Consulting Group, inmates can take part in yoga, a talent show and watch movies, while a prospectus for the facility shows detainees playing sports like softball, basketball and volleyball. They are also able to try hobbies like painting, leather-work, art and ceramics.\n\nThe list of apprenticeships available for Maxwell includes electrician, baker, horticulturist, plumber and cosmetologist, “a pursuit which may include massages”, noted the Daily Mail in reference to the way she and Epstein would exploit underage girls.\n\nThe paper said that while at the MDC, Maxwell “had already impressed other inmates by teaching them yoga and English [and] she will likely continue to do so in her new prison”.

Theranos promised patients the ability to test for conditions like cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. She attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, a board of well-known political figures, and key retail partners.\n\nBut a Wall Street Journal investigation poked holes into Theranos’ testing and technology, and the dominoes fell from there. Holmes and her former business partner, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, were charged in 2018 by the US government with multiple counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. (Both pleaded not guilty.)\n\nHere are the highlights of the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos.\n\nMarch 2004: Holmes drops out of Stanford to pursue Theranos\n\nHolmes, a Stanford University sophomore studying chemical engineering, drops out of school to pursue her startup, Theranos, which she founded in 2003 at age 19. The name is a combination of the words “therapy” and “diagnosis.”\n\nSeptember 2009: Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani joins Theranos as Holmes’ right-hand man\n\nBalwani joins as chief operating officer and president of the startup. Balwani, nearly 20 years her senior, met Holmes in 2002 on a trip to Beijing through Stanford University. The two are later revealed to be romantically involved.\n\nSeptember 2013: Holmes opens up about Theranos; announces Walgreens partnership\n\nA decade after first starting the company, Holmes takes the lid off Theranos and courts media attention the same month that Theranos and Walgreens announce they’ve struck up a long-term partnership. The first Theranos Wellness Center location opens in a Walgreens in Palo Alto where consumers can access Theranos’ blood test.\n\nThe original plan had been to make Theranos’ testing available at Walgreens locations nationwide.\n\nSeptember 2014: Holmes named one of the richest women in America by Forbes\n\nHolmes is named to the magazine’s American billionaire list with the outlet reporting she owns a 50% stake in the startup, pinning her personal wealth at $4.5 billion.\n\nElizabeth Holmes speaking onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt on September 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California.

It counts Oracle’s Larry Ellison among its investors.\n\nJuly 2015: Theranos gets FDA approval for Herpes test\n\nThe FDA clears Theranos to use of its proprietary tiny blood-collection vials to finger stick blood test for herpes simplex 1 virus – its first and only approval for a diagnostic test.\n\nOctober 2015: Theranos is the subject of a Wall Street Journal investigation; Holmes hits back\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports Theranos is using its proprietary technique on only a small number of the 240 tests it performs, and that the vast majority of its tests are done with traditional vials of blood drawn from the arm, not the “few drops” taken by a finger prick. In response, Theranos defends its testing practices, calling the Journal’s reporting “factually and scientifically erroneous.”\n\nA day later, Theranos halts the use of its blood-collection vials for all but the herpes test due to pressures from the FDA. (Later that month, the FDA released two heavily redacted reports citing 14 concerns, including calling the company’s proprietary vial an “uncleared medical device.”)\n\nOne week after the Journal report, Holmes is interviewed on-stage at the outlet’s conference in Laguna Beach. “We know what we’re doing and we’re very proud of it,” she says.\n\nHolmes speaking at a Wall Street Journal technology conference in Laguna Beach, California on October 21, 2015.

Theranos says that’s a “worst case scenario.”\n\nMay 2016: Balwani steps down; Theranos voids two years of blood tests\n\nBalwani departs. The company also adds three new board members as part of the restructuring: Fabrizio Bonanni, a former executive vice president of biotech firm Amgen, former CDC director William Foege, and former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich.\n\nTheranos voids two years of blood test results from its proprietary testing devices, correcting tens of thousands of blood-test reports, the Journal reports.\n\nJune 2016: Holmes net worth revised to $0; Theranos loses its largest retail partner\n\nForbes revises its estimate of Holmes’ net worth from $4.5 billion to $0.

In selling the device, versus operating its own clinics, Theranos seeks to effectively side-step CMS sanctions, which don’t prohibit research and development.\n\nOctober 2016: Theranos investor sues the company; Theranos downsizes\n\nTheranos investor Partner Fund Management sues the company for $96.1 million, the amount it sunk into the company in February 2014, plus damages. It accuses the company of securities fraud. Theranos and Partner Fund Management settled in May, 2017, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe company also lays off 340 employees as it closes clinical labs and wellness centers as it attempts to pivot and focus on the miniLab.\n\nNovember 2016: Walgreens sues Theranos\n\nWalgreens sues the blood testing startup for breach of contract.

Theranos agrees to pay $4.65 million back to its Arizona customers as part of a settlement deal.\n\nMarch 2018: Holmes charged with massive fraud\n\nThe SEC charges Holmes and Balwani with a “massive fraud” involving more than $700 million from investors through an “elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance.”\n\nThe SEC alleges Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos’ proprietary analyzer could perform only 12 of the 200 tests it published on its patient testing menu.\n\nTheranos and Holmes agree to resolve the claims against them, and Holmes gives up control of the company and much of her stake in it. Balwani, however, is fighting the charges, with his attorney saying he “accurately represented Theranos to investors to the best of his ability.”\n\nMay 2018: “Bad Blood”\n\nReporter John Carreyrou, who first broke open the story of Theranos for the Wall Street Journal, publishes “Bad Blood,” a definitive look at what happened inside the disgraced company.

A jury of seven men and five women is selected, with five alternatives.\n\nDecember 2021: Jury begins deliberating her fate\n\nAfter three months of testimony from 32 witnesses, the criminal fraud case of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes makes its way to the jury of eight men and four women who will decide her fate. The jury would go on to deliberate for more than 50 hours before returning a verdict.\n\nJanuary 2022: Holmes found guilty on four of 11 federal charges\n\nHolmes is found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud investors as well as three wire fraud counts tied to specific investors. She is found not guilty on three additional charges concerning defrauding patients and one charge of conspiracy to defraud patients. The jury returns no verdict on three of the charges concerning defrauding investors. Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison as well as a fine of $250,000 plus restitution for each count.\n\nMarch 2022: After Hulu miniseries debuts, Balwani’s criminal trial kicks off\n\n“The Dropout,” a scripted miniseries about Theranos produced by ABC, debuts on Hulu. Amanda Seyfried stars as Holmes and Naveen Andrews plays Balwani. Their romantic and professional relationship features prominently in the show.\n\nFollowing delays due to Holmes’ prolonged trial then a surge of Covid-19, jury selection for Balwani’s trial gets underway. On March 22, opening arguments are held and the government’s first witness, a former Theranos employee turned whistleblower, is called to the stand.\n\nJuly 2022: Balwani guilty of federal fraud\n\nAfter four full days of deliberations, a jury finds Balwani guilty of ten counts of federal wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Like Holmes, Balwani faces up to 20 years in prison as well as a fine of $250,000 plus restitution for each count of wire fraud and each conspiracy count.\n\nSeptember 2022: Holmes asks for new trial, says a key witness expressed regrets\n\nHolmes asks for a new trial after claiming that a key witness visited her house unannounced and allegedly said he “feels guilty” about his testimony.\n\nIn a court filing with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Holmes’ attorneys said Adam Rosendorff, a former Theranos lab director who was one of the government’s main witnesses, arrived at her home on August 8 asking to speak with her.

Sign up here.\n\nCNN —\n\nA Chinese billionaire and a former University of Minnesota student who accused him of rape have reached an undisclosed agreement in the US, bringing an abrupt end to a case closely watched – and now hailed as a minor victory – by women on the other side of the world.\n\nJD.com’s founder and former CEO Richard Liu reached a settlement with former student Liu Jingyao, who accused him of raping her in her Minneapolis apartment after a group dinner in 2018, ending the high-profile case less than two days before a planned civil trial in Minnesota.\n\nLawyers of the two parties – who are not related, with Liu being a common surname in China – said they had agreed to “set aside their differences” in order to “avoid further pain and suffering.”\n\n“The incident between Ms. Jingyao Liu and Mr. Richard Liu in Minnesota in 2018 resulted in a misunderstanding that has consumed substantial public attention and brought profound suffering to the parties and their families,” the parties said in a joint statement.\n\nLiu is among a handful of well-known Chinese men accused of sexual assault in recent years, and he’s the first to have faced the prospect of a public lawsuit in the US – outside of China’s opaque legal system.\n\nThe decision to settle the case out of court has been embraced by some feminists in China as a small victory for the country’s beleaguered #MeToo movement.\n\nOn Weibo, China’s highly restricted Twitter-like platform, a hashtag related to the case drew millions of views.\n\nThe reaction was divided. Many comments expressed sympathy for Liu, the tycoon, and accused Liu Jingyao of pursuing legal actions for money. Like other #MeToo accusers in China, Liu Jingyao has faced an onslaught of criticism from the Chinese internet since the case went public.\n\nLiu Jingyao’s supporters, meanwhile, have touted the outcome as a “historic moment.”\n\n“Looking back at China’s #MeToo movement in the past four years, this pre-trial settlement is of great significance – it’s the result of a four-year struggle of Jingyao and feminists,” read a comment from one of her supporters.\n\nA college student sues\n\nRichard Liu, whose Chinese name is Liu Qiangdong, launched e-commerce platform JD.com in 2004. The company has since grown to be one of China’s largest and most successful, transforming Liu into one of the country’s wealthiest online entrepreneurs.\n\nIn 2018, he was visiting the University of Minnesota as part of a doctoral business administration program that caters to high-level executives from China when he met Liu Jingyao, then 21, who later accused him of rape.\n\nThe billionaire, who was 45 at the time of the alleged incident, was arrested by Minneapolis police in August 2018 on suspicion of sexual misconduct, but denied any wrongdoing.\n\nLiu was released without charge and without having to post bail the following day and quickly returned to China. Prosecutors at the time cited “profound evidentiary problems” that would have made it hard to build a criminal case.\n\nIn April 2019, Liu Jingyao filed a civil lawsuit against the tycoon, seeking damages of over $50,000.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Liu and the other guests pressured the plaintiff to drink excessive amounts of alcohol during their meal, which was paid for with a JD.com corporate credit card. While the Chinese student requested help securing transportation home via a ride service, she was instead directed to a limo with him, she said.\n\nThe suit stated that Liu groped the woman during the car ride and tried to remove her clothes despite her repeatedly asking him to stop. He later assaulted the woman in her apartment, according to the complaint.\n\nBy the time the case was filed, Liu had relinquished day-to-day management of JD.com – and this April he stood down as CEO, one of a series of high-profile departures at China’s tech companies amid increased government scrutiny of the technology industry and policy shifts to redistribute wealth more equally in the country.\n\nBringing the #MeToo battle to court\n\nSexual assault accusations rarely get to trial in China, and even if they do, the plaintiffs often face a difficult battle as the courts give little credence to testimony and place a heavy emphasis on “smoking gun” evidence, according to legal experts.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the Liu court settlement is seen as a mark of some progress amid legal setbacks in China.\n\nIn August, a court in China rejected an appeal by Zhou Xiaoxuan, a former state television intern, against the dismissal of her long-running landmark #MeToo case accusing a star presenter of sexual harassment.\n\nZhou, better known as Xianzi in China, became the face of the country’s #MeToo movement in 2018 when she publicly accused state television host Zhu Jun of groping and forcibly kissing her in a dressing room four years earlier when she was a 21-year-old intern.\n\nZhu, who was 50 at the time of the alleged incident, denied the accusation and sued Zhou for defamation. She then countersued, sparking a years-long legal battle that coincided with a wider crackdown by the ruling Chinese Communist Party on feminist activism and online discussion of women’s rights.\n\nIn a statement posted to her WeChat account, Zhou praised Liu Jingyao for standing up against powerful figures like Richard Liu in a case she said had “changed the times.”\n\n“In these four years, she fought for feminists to give the biggest (platform) to discuss what is rape culture and what is power sexual assault,” Zhou said.\n\n“Jingyao’s resistance four years ago was an extremely rare show of courage – it is not uncommon for business bosses to prey on young girls, but she is the first person to stand up, this is the courage beyond human nature,” Zhou said.\n\n“Don’t forget that when all this happened, Jingyao was just a student. To this day, she is still dealing with JD.com’s strong public relations and well-paid lawyers,” she said.\n\n“This was the best she and her lawyers can achieve. Her courage and persistence in the past four years was already a miracle.”", "authors": ["Kathleen Magramo Shawn Deng", "Kathleen Magramo", "Shawn Deng"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/tech/daily-harvest-recall-influencers", "title": "Daily Harvest recall: Influencers recount harrowing experiences with ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nInstagram-friendly meal kit service Daily Harvest is facing a firestorm of online backlash over the voluntary recall of one of its products, after a slew of people who consumed it reported becoming ill with mysterious symptoms, including extremely elevated liver enzymes.\n\nThe direct-to-consumer brand has long utilized a network of online influencers to promote its products. Now several influencers, who say they were sickened, say the company’s lackluster handling of the crisis is putting new responsibility on the influencer community to warn the public.\n\nIt’s also exposing the swift fallout that can emerge when you aggrieve a demographic with such a wide internet reach.\n\n“This company was built on the backs of influencers,” said Cory Silverstein, who runs an organic skincare brand with his wife, and told CNN Business he received the product, called French Lentil and Leek Crumbles, as part of a PR package in mid-May.\n\n“That is what built them up to be like a billion-dollar valuation company, is all these influencers who did the marketing for them,” he added. “At this point, it’s the influencers who are alerting the public that you might end up in the hospital if you eat this product.”\n\nAfter consuming the product, Silverstein said, “I’ve never experienced pain like that — it’s the first time I felt kind of helpless.”\n\nIn response to CNN Business’ multiple requests for comment, Daily Harvest sent the latest update the company posted on their website related to the voluntary recall.\n\n“We want to make sure you have the latest update on our voluntary recall of French Lentil + Leek Crumbles. We are taking this very seriously and doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Your health and well-being are our top priority,” the blog post states, adding that it has reached out to impacted customers and is taking a number of steps to investigate the cause.\n\n“We are working with a group of experts to help us get to the bottom of this—that includes microbiologists, toxin and pathogen experts as well as allergists,” the statement from Daily Harvest adds. “All pathogen and toxicology results have come back negative so far, but we’re continuing to do extensive testing and will keep you updated.”\n\nAn image of Daily Harvest's French Lentil + Leek Crumbles meal from their website. Daily Harvest issued a voluntary recall Sunday of a lentil-based product, after receiving customer reports of gastrointestinal issues linked to its French Lentil + Leek Crumbles meal.\n\nIn an updated blog post Thursday evening, the company said it has received approximately 470 reports of illness or adverse reaction, and the investigation into the root cause remains ongoing. It added that some 28,000 units of the recalled product were distributed in the US between April 28 to June 17.\n\nOn June 17, the company first emailed people who received the product warning that “a small number of customers have reported gastrointestinal discomfort” after consuming the crumbles and urging those who still had them to throw them away. It first posted a statement warning the public not to consume the crumbles on June 19.\n\nLaunched in 2016, Daily Harvest’s emergence as a household name was linked in large part to its aggressive social media campaigns. The company has received multiple celebrity supporters, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Serena Williams (representatives for Paltrow and Williams did not immediately respond to CNN Business’ request for comment).\n\nThe meal kit company announced last November that it had secured Series D funding that valued Daily Harvest at over $1 billion.\n\nInfluencers track down a united source for mysterious symptoms\n\nSilverstein said he spent time in an urgent care center where doctors scrambled to figure out what was wrong. He tested negative for all forms of hepatitis, the initial suspect, and did a slew of blood tests that eventually indicated liver enzyme levels that were off the charts. He says that levels of important liver enzymes were elevated as much as twelve times the normal range.\n\nHe spent weeks not knowing the cause of the mysterious illness, until he said his wife saw a post from fellow influencer Luke Wesley Pearson, a content creator from Portland. Pearson was reporting shockingly similar symptoms, he said, and the two realized they had both received these crumbles from the company before they were launched on the public market.\n\nPearson told CNN Business that he underwent emergency surgery on June 12 to get his gallbladder removed after experiencing gastrointestinal issues after consuming the crumbles.\n\nVarious frozen healthy meal items (but not the crumbles that are part of the recall) are visible inside a Daily Harvest frozen meal kit box, Lafayette, California, October 14, 2021.

It was the second try, however, that sent him to the ER. After symptoms that included “excruciating” stomach pains, fever, chills, itching of the hands and feet, and jaundice, Pearson underwent testing that revealed – just like Silverstein – elevated liver enzymes, as well as high bilirubin. Doctors ultimately decided to remove Pearson’s gallbladder.\n\nFor Pearson, it was only after seeing a viral TikTok by Abby Silverman that he realized the issues could be connected to the food he ingested immediately before his issues began. Silverman, a creative director in New York, posted a video that has garnered more than 100,000 likes on TikTok detailing her own experience after eating the Daily Harvest product. She said the lentils similarly landed her in the ER, twice, with alarmingly high liver enzyme levels. While she suspected it may be from the crumbles, she said she formally connected her medical crisis with the lentils after an email from Daily Harvest on June 19 recalling the food item led her to a Reddit thread of scores of other people detailing similar symptoms. Silverman’s lawyer, Mark Apostolos, confirmed to CNN Business in a statement that medical records document her illness and symptoms.\n\n“It’s interesting because I have seen a lot of people on social media over the years try Daily Harvest, which is why I said yes to the PR package,” Silverman told CNN Business.\n\n“This whole health situation has just caused so much anxiety,” said Silverman, who has retained a lawyer, Apostolos, to deal with the fallout. “Obviously, I didn’t expect this. I made the video that I did because I feel like they weren’t doing enough to make people aware of what was going on – I figured people probably still had this in their freezer.”\n\n“We are investigating and evaluating all legal remedies for Abby, who was stricken with illness after consuming this product that was mailed to her,” said Apostolos in a statement.\n\nAnother customer who had her gallbladder removed was Candice Smith, who told CNN Business she initially thought she was having a heart attack after consuming the product. “It was the worst night of my life,” said Smith, the CEO of French Press Public Relations in Raleigh, of the night she rushed to the hospital – where she says she stayed for four days undergoing tests on her enlarged liver and elevated liver enzymes. Her gallbladder was removed on June 19.\n\nThe company declined to comment on claims that customers underwent gallbladder surgeries related to its product. All of the people who spoke to CNN Business said doctors were initially puzzled by their symptoms.\n\nSmith said she had no relevant pre-existing medical conditions before the hospital visit. “I try to be healthy. I eat plant-based, I’m trying to do all the right things,” said Smith. “What am I doing here? Why am I even here? Why am I experiencing this level of pain in my life?”\n\nCompany’s response slammed as insensitive\n\nCaroline Sweet, a freelance actor and writer in Los Angeles, said she was in the emergency room emerging from a CT scan after enduring days of being “completely doubled-over in pain” when she received an email on June 17 from Daily Harvest informing her to throw away the crumbles and offering her a $10 store credit. (The company said in a blogpost all consumers were issued a credit for the recalled product).\n\n“It was just like a huge f**k you,” Sweet said of the email. “The fact that they’re just handling it so poorly feels like such a huge slap in the face.”\n\nSarah Schacht, a consultant and property manager in Seattle, said she similarly became “violently ill” after consuming the product that she said she was initially drawn to for its organic and health-forward marketing. “Everyone who’s on the internet has been served Daily Harvest ads, right?” she said.\n\nSchacht has been vocal on Twitter about urging people to take samples to local health departments or their Food and Drug Administration offices.\n\nSilverstein, meanwhile, said he was incredibly dismayed by the Instagram post Daily Harvest used to alert customers of the recall. The post, which was published on June 19, simply used a previous promotional picture of the crumble – and directed people to click a link for an “important message,” which directed them to a blog post about the voluntary recall. At a first glance, Silverstein said most people would assume that the post was promoting the product. Daily Harvest has since removed the post he referenced from their Instagram, which was widely blasted as insensitive.\n\nThe FDA told CNN Business in a statement that it cannot confirm or deny if an investigation is occurring that is not already listed on its website. “However, the FDA takes seriously reports of possible adulteration of a food that may also cause illnesses or injury,” an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe agency added that when specific consumer guidance can be developed, the FDA and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will publish outbreak advisories communicating that guidance to the public.\n\n“I’m very angry because we are all being left in the dark without answers,” said Pearson. “I know that accidents happen all the time in the food industry, and I’ve just seen other companies who are completely transparent, speaking up and making loud and clear announcements of what’s going on and what the next steps are and what they found out so far.”\n\nSilverstein added that he feels that some of the onus has fallen on influencers to alert their followers. While the company emailed customers and posted a statement on its website, he thinks they should be doing more to make people aware on social media.\n\nWhile he and his wife have worked with Daily Harvest for some five years now, and never had any issues in the past, he said they have no choice but to “cut off our relationship with them.”", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke Jennifer Korn", "Catherine Thorbecke", "Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/28/business/ernst-and-young-sec-cheating-fine", "title": "Top accounting firm fined $100 million after employees cheated on ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nErnst & Young has been slapped with a record $100 million fine from the US government after regulators discovered that the company knew some of its auditors were cheating on exams for several years and did nothing to stop it.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that a “significant number” of the accounting firm’s auditors cheated on the ethics portion of the Certified Public Accountant test and other courses needed to maintain the licenses.

Tupperware\n\nThe brand, whose products are distributed in nearly 70 countries and made in the US and overseas, including in Mexico, Brazil and Belgium, logged annual sales of $1.6 billion in 2021.\n\nTupperware Brands CEO Miguel Fernandez said the entry into Target is part of the brand’s reinvention, which includes plans to grow the business through multiple retail channels and get its products in front of younger consumers who’ve never even heard of Tupperware parties.\n\n“Tupperware is a part of American culture. It’s an iconic and huge brand. We want to make the business as big as the brand,” said Fernandez.\n\nIt might be a goal fueled by necessity.\n\nWhile Tupperware has achieved cultural icon status – it’s even in the permanent collection at the Smithsonian – for establishing the food storage category, its decades-long market dominance has gotten chipped away by competition from a rush of players in the space that include other popular brands such as Rubbermaid, Glad, Pyrex, Oxo and Ziploc.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, the company reported an 18% drop in net sales versus a year ago.\n\nIt blamed the sales erosion on challenges such as pandemic-triggered lockdowns in key overseas markets such as China significantly hurting its direct sale business and consumers pulling back their overall spending because of inflation.\n\nTupperware’s stock is also under pressure, down 70% year-over-year.\n\nTaking over the kitchen\n\nFernandez wants Tupperware to go well beyond containers and claim the full circle of meal prep in the kitchen – from storing ingredients in its containers to cooking food using Tupperware gadgets and then putting the leftovers back into – what else – Tupperware containers.\n\nTo that end, the company, which has more than 8,500 functional design and utility patents for kitchen and home products, from storage bins for onions and garlic to a pressure cooker designed to work in a microwave, has for years been innovating and developing products other than containers that might appeal to next generation consumers.\n\nTupperware MicroPro Grill. Tupperware\n\n“One crazy product is our MicroPro Grill,” said Fernandez, which he said has been selling out in Tupperware’s direct sales channel. “Most consumers don’t know about it.”\n\nIt lets you grill in the microwave and can make grilled cheese sandwiches, burgers or even steak. “We imagine this for someone who lives in an apartment in New York City and you can’t really do outdoor grilling but you can use this,” he said.\n\nAnother idea is to collaborate with a fridge manufacturer to have a line of refrigerators that come outfitted with Tupperware storage containers inside.\n\n“In two to three years, we want to be in many more categories, from knives, cookware and containers to products for your microwave, freezer to garage storage solutions. We want to be maybe in every room in the house,” said Fernandez.\n\nHow do you make plastic sustainable?\n\nGen Z, even more than Millennials, are a sustainability-oriented generation.

Tupperware\n\nHe listed Tupperware’s partnership with TerraCycle’s circular reuse platform Loop, in the company’s effort to reduce waste. Tupperware is expanding its container offerings to include more sustainable materials like glass and stainless steel and is making some products from used mixed plastic waste that would have otherwise ended up in landfills, he said.\n\nTupperware containers, in a way, also could be helping to also reduce food waste.\n\n“About 10% of meals consumed last year in the US were leftovers,” said Fernandez. “We’d like to think those were many meals that were stored in the fridge in Tupperware products.”", "authors": ["Parija Kavilanz"], "publish_date": "2022/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/962050/snake-named-after-harrison-ford", "title": "Snake named after Harrison Ford | The Week", "text": "Harrison Ford has had a Peruvian snake species named after him.

In March, her daughter revealed that Rantzen's health had deteriorated to such an extent that she was no longer well enough to travel to a Swiss euthanasia clinic, meaning that \"Dignitas is out of the window\" for the 84-year-old, said The Telegraph.\n\nCon: losing legal protection\n\nIt is currently a criminal offence under the 1961 Suicide Act to help someone take their own life, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Assisted dying is a general term that includes euthanasia and assisted suicide. Euthanasia is when a doctor ends a patient's life, while assisted suicide is when a patient ends their own life with a doctor's help.\n\nSome people believe that legalising euthanasia would put too much power in the hands of doctors, who could abuse their position, or relatives.\n\nThe debate comes amid a \"sharp rise in cases of euthanasia to end psychological suffering\" in the Netherlands, which introduced the legislation in 2001, said The Times. The number of deaths under the legislation reached nearly 10,000 last year, which marks 5.8% of all deaths and includes a 60% increase in cases involving psychological suffering.\n\nHowever, the UK bill excludes disability and mental illness as eligibility criteria. It sets out specific requirements for who is eligible to receive assistance, including the need to have the \"mental capacity to make a choice\" and that they are \"expected to die within six months\".\n\nUnder the original proposals, a High Court judge would have had to approve each request to end a life. However, amid concerns this would place a huge burden on the courts, MPs reviewing the bill agreed that a three-person panel comprising a senior legal figure, a psychiatrist and a social worker should oversee applications instead.\n\nPro: ending 'mercy killings'\n\nAccording to Dignity in Dying, 44% of people would break the law and help a loved one to die, risking 14 years in prison.\n\nIn 2023 the Crown Prosecution Service updated its guidance on so-called mercy killings and suicide pacts to reflect that there is no public interest in prosecuting individuals who end the life of someone who has made \"a voluntary, clear, settled and informed decision that they wished for their life to end\".\n\nEncouraging or assisting suicide is a crime that currently carries a maximum penalty of 14 years but prosecutions are \"rare\", said Humanists UK. Campaigners claim that UK police are also increasingly turning a blind eye to people travelling to other countries to assist loved ones to end their life.\n\nCon: 'slippery slope'\n\nOpponents argue that normalising euthanasia would be a move towards legalised murder.\n\nThey say that even with \"watertight qualifying criteria and safeguards\" the law will be \"expanded in time and the restrictions loosened\", said The Guardian. A \"pressing concern for lawyers\" is \"successful human rights challenges\" by people who were not granted assisted dying, inevitably softening the law in a way which wasn't initially intended by MPs.\n\nJustin Welby, the then archbishop of Canterbury, warned last year that the bill would set the country in a \"dangerous\" direction, leading to a \"slippery slope\". But Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who introduced the proposed legislation as a private member's bill, has rejected this argument, saying \"we have to get it right from the start with very clear criteria, safeguards and protections\".\n\nPro: shifting opinion\n\nThere has been a significant shift in recent years among both the public and professional medical opinion regarding assisted dying for people with a terminal illness.\n\nAccording to a November YouGov poll, 73% of Britons believe \"in principle\" that assisted dying should be permitted in the UK, while 13% do not. Only a minority are opposed to it \"in principle and in practice\", while 19% say they support the principle but do not believe it is \"possible to create adequate laws to regulate it\".\n\nA 2020 survey by Dignity in Dying revealed opinion was also shifting among doctors, with 50% \"in favour of law change on assisted dying\" and 39% opposed.\n\nCon: religious concerns\n\nMany religions and religious people, especially Catholics, believe that life is the ultimate gift and that taking that away is usurping power that belongs to God only.\n\nAt his final New Year's Day Mass in the Vatican this year, the late Pope Francis called on his followers to \"respect the dignity of human life from conception to natural death\", and a \"firm commitment\" to defend \"the precious gift of life, life in the womb, the lives of children, the lives of the suffering, the poor, the elderly, the lonely and the dying\".", "authors": ["Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}]}

Nominees can vote only in categories in which they have seen all of the productions — logging this in an online portal — and Nocciolino has seen some of the productions more than once in order to cast a well-educated vote.\n\n5 lessons from the Tony Awards\n\nMeet the man who brings Broadway to town\n\nWe sat down with Nocciolino to learn his thoughts for the season and future of Broadway, both on the Great White Way and the road. While he is not allowed to reveal his votes, he divulged his predictions for who will take home the trophy on Sunday.\n\nQUESTION: You have money in some of these nominated productions. How do you remain unbiased? Or can you not be unbiased?\n\nNOCCIOLINO: That’s a fair question. We vote personally, and with the organization that I represent, the Independent Presenters Network, some of them present in multiple markets like we do. We invest in shows and sometimes we invest in multiple shows that are nominated. So, for instance, this year the IPN is in “Groundhog” and in “Dear Evan Hansen.” They’re both nominated for best new musical.\n\nEverybody will make their own decision. You try to be as fair as you possibly can. You look at the show with your own eyes. Nobody tells you how to vote. There’s no lobbying internally.\n\nBecause the shows are so expensive to produce and be capitalizing, it requires so many more people being involved in raising money, producing and investing than ever before. It’s not uncommon to have multiple producers and for those multiple producers to be involved in multiple shows. It’s just a way of life in the industry. You try to be as fair as you possibly can.\n\nQ: During the 2004 Tony Award season, “Avenue Q” produced a song to tell voters to “Vote Your Heart.” Do you get a lot of material from shows trying to sway your vote?\n\nNOCCIOLINO: [gestures around his office] Behind my desk are a pile of CDs. Every single show. It’s every day. It’s program books, it’s scripts, it’s everything. They just keep coming. Every producer is promoting their show.\n\nQ: Do you have any overall takeaways of the season. What stood out? Can you characterize the season?\n\nNOCCIOLINO: I think what stood out this season that’s really interesting is how much business the musicals are doing, as we have more musicals that are open this year than probably ever, and how it's impacted the plays. Nobody is doing the dynamic they should be doing.\n\nThere’s a dynamic happening on Broadway right now, with a lot of the big musicals doing so much business, because the price of the tickets are higher and they’re doing that fairly and smartly as a reaction to the secondary market, [what] the scalpers have done to show.\n\nQ: Like the ticket bots and all that.\n\nNOCCIOLINO: Exactly. Take “Hamilton”: You’re Lin-Manuel Miranda and you’re getting 10 percent of every $200 ticket because you created the show but [a scalper] is selling it for $2,000 and you’re not getting 10 percent of the $1,800.\n\nSo, I’m the producer and I say, “I want you to get more money, so we’re going to bang that $200 ticket up to $800. [A scalper] is not going to make that whole $1,800, so we’re going to go to $800. What happens, then, is people who are spending $800 for a “Hamilton” ticket, which is a legitimate price for a premium seat, might now see two or three other shows. So, our aggregate business, our gross sales business as an industry on Broadway, is still the same. We’re still grossing $33 to $34 million a week, but the way that it spread out is different as a result of the ticket pricing.\n\nAnd we’re all a little concerned about how that’s going to impact the plays because the plays just aren’t doing the business that they used to do. Unless, of course, you have a big name in it like Kevin Kline. That show [\"Present Laughter\"] is doing business. And “A Doll's House, Part 2,” all four of our actors, there’s only four onstage, have been nominated for Tony Awards. And we’re barely breaking even.\n\nQ: Do you have any final thoughts on the Tony Awards or this season?\n\nNOCCIOLINO: Those of us like us who present Broadway across America have been given another great season of wonderful shows that will find a way across the country. And they’re not always shows that are nominated. So, for instance, “Finding Neverland” didn’t do so well on Broadway, didn’t get great reviews, but they fixed it before it went out on the road and it’s doing huge business on the road. “Something Rotten!” is one of the best productions, didn’t recoup but it’s a fabulous show, it’s out on the road. We will see “Charlie [and the Chocolate Factory],\" we will see “Anastasia,” neither one of those were nominated [for “Best Musical”].\n\nWe will see “Comet” [\"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812\"], we will certainly see “Groundhog,” we will see “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Come From Away,” so we’ve got six musicals that are going to find their way on the road. We’ve got “Miss Saigon” that’s going to go out, we’ve got “Hello, Dolly!” that’s going to go out, we’ve got “Cats” that’s going to go out, and maybe one or two of the plays might find its way out.\n\nSo, as an industry, we’re the benefactors and the theater community, the theater-going community around the country, we’ll be the benefactors of wonderful new shows that are going out that will find their way on the road touring.\n\nSo, for me, that’s selfishly great. Because we have developed and nurtured and audience that’s really growing. We’ve had another record year on the road, as well as Broadway, so it’s good for everyone.\n\nNocciolino's Predictions\n\nBest performance by an actress in a featured role in a musical: Kate Baldwin (Hello, Dolly!\"), Stephanie J. Block (\"Falsettos\"), Jenn Colella (\"Come From Away\"), Rachel Bay Jones (\"Dear Evan Hansen\") and Mary Beth Peil (\"Anastasia\").\n\nNOCCIOLINO: I haven’t made a decision yet. I’m going back to see “Dear Evan Hansen” because I haven’t seen it since October. It’s such a long time, you know, seven or eight months. That’s why I’m going back to see it. Just to get refreshed.\n\nThis is tough. Stephanie J. Block was pretty good in “Falsettos.” Rachel Bay Jones is really great. My guess would be between Stephanie and Rachel.\n\nBest performance by an actress in a leading role in a musical: Denée Benton (\"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812\"), Christine Ebersole (\"War Paint\"), Patti LuPone (\"War Paint\"), Bette Midler (\"Hello, Dolly!\") and Eva Noblezada (\"Miss Saigon\")\n\nNOCCIOLINO: Bette Midler.\n\nBest performance by an actor in a featured role in a musical: Gavin Creel (\"Hello, Dolly!\"), Mike Faist (\"Dear Evan Hansen\"), Andrew Rannells (\"Falsettos\"), Lucas Steele (\"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812\") and Brandon Uranowitz (\"Falsettos\")\n\nNOCCIOLINO: That’s another good one. You’re giving me all the tough ones.\n\nBrandon was so good in “Falsettos.” It could be Gavin Creel in “Hello, Dolly!” That’s my prediction.\n\nBest performance by an actor in a leading role in a musical: Christian Borle (\"Falsettos\"), Josh Groban (\"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812\"), Andy Karl (\"Groundhog Day The Musical\"), David Hyde Pierce (\"Hello, Dolly!\") and Ben Platt (\"Dear Evan Hansen\")\n\nNOCCIOLINO: I think it’s Ben Platt.\n\nBest Direction of a Musical: Christopher Ashley (“Come From Away”), Rachel Chavkin (\"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812\"), Michael Grief (“Dear Evan Hansen”), Matthew Warchus (“Groundhog Day The Musical”), Jerry Zaks (“Hello, Dolly!”)\n\nI think Michael Greif will get it for “Dear Evan Hansen.” It wouldn’t surprise me if Christopher Ashley got it for “Come From Away.”\n\nBest revival of a musical: “Falsettos,” “Hello, Dolly!” and “Miss Saigon”\n\nNOCCIOLINO: I think it’s a slam dunk for “Hello, Dolly!” Whether I was involved or not involved, it’s just a magnificent production. She’s [Midler] great, the company is great, David Hyde Pierce is great, every part of it is great. It’s just beautifully produced, it’s a lot of fun. She [Midler] just brings the whole cast with her and there’s not enough superlatives to describe the evening. It was like a throwback, it was just fabulous.\n\nSo, whether I was involved or not I would be saying that, too.\n\nBest musical: “Come From Away,” “Dear Evan Hansen,” “Groundhog Day The Musical” and “Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812”\n\nNOCCIOLINO: I think it’s a horse race between “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Come From Away” and I would be completely satisfied with seeing either one win. They’re both fabulous productions.\n\nBest performance by an actress in a featured role in a play: Johanna Day (\"Sweat\"), Jayne Houdyshell (\"A Doll's House, Part 2\"), Cynthia Nixon (\"Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes\"), Condola Rashad (\"A Doll's House, Part 2\"), Michelle Wilson (\"Sweat\")\n\nNOCCIOLINO: I think Cynthia Nixon will win.\n\nBest performance by an actress in a leading role in a play: Cate Blanchett \"The Present\"), Jennifer Ehle (\"Oslo\"), Sally Field (\"The Glass Menagerie\"), Laura Linney (\"Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes\") and Laurie Metcalf (\"A Doll's House, Part 2\")\n\nNOCCIOLINO: Laurie Metcalf\n\nBest performance by an actor in a featured role in a play: Michael Aronov (\"Oslo\"), Dannt DeVito (\"Arthur Miller's The Price\"), Nathan Lane (\"The Front Page\"), Richard Thomas (\"Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes\") and Jon Douglas Thompson (\"August Wilson's Jitney\")\n\nNOCCIOLINO: Abstain. Didn't see all of the performers.\n\nBest performance by an actor in a leading role in a play: Denis Arndt (\"Heisenberg\"), Chris Cooper (\"A Doll's House, Part 2\"), Corey Hawkins (\"John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation\"), Kevin Kline (\"Present Laughter\") and Jeffreson Mays (\"Oslo\")\n\nNOCCIOLINO: It's awfully close. Kevin Kline.\n\nBest direction of a play: Sam Gold (\"A Doll's House, Part 2\"), Ruben Santiago-Hudson (\"August Wilson's Jitney\"), Bartlett Sher (\"Oslo\"), Daniel Sullivan (\"Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes\"), Rebecca Taichman (\"Indecent\")\n\nNOCCIOLINO: Bartlett Sher, \"Oslo.\"\n\nBest Revival of a Play: \"August Wilson's Jitney,\" \"John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation,\" \"Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes\" and \"Present Laughter\"\n\nI liked \"Present Laughter\" the best.\n\nBest Play: \"A Doll's House, Part 2,\" \"Indecent,\" \"Oslo\" and \"Sweat\"\n\nNOCCIOLINO: I think it's a horse race between \"Oslo\" and \"A Doll's House, Part 2.\"\n\nFollow @MaggieGilroy on Twitter\n\nComing up this season\n\nNAC Entertainment programs the touring Broadway productions at the Forum in\n\nBinghamton and the Clemens Center in Elmira.

The patient was being treated at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland, Washington, with serious respiratory issues, according to hospital spokesperson Julia Irwin.\n\nWashington man dies from coronavirus: What we know about the first US death\n\nWhile President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters in Washington, D.C., initially identified the patient as a woman, state and King County officials during a news conference hosted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention insisted that the patient was a man. Later, CDC Director Robert Redfield tweeted that the agency had mistakenly identified the patient as female when briefing the president and vice president.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who heads the new coronavirus task force, expressed his condolences to the patient's family.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said in declaring a state of emergency that it would \"allow us to get the resources we need.\"\n\nInslee said in a statement Saturday that it is a \"sad day\" and that officials will continue to strengthen preparedness and response efforts. \"We will continue to work toward a day where no one dies from this virus.\"\n\nCoronavirus updates every day: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nTrump said there are 22 patients in the U.S. who have been confirmed as having the virus. He said 15 of them are either recovered fully \"or well on their way.\"\n\nTrump did not appear to be counting Americans who had contracted the disease before re-entering the country. According to the CDC on Saturday, at least 59 people in the U.S. have been infected with the virus. Of those cases, 12 are travel-related, and three are person-to-person spread. Most of the cases are among Americans repatriated to the U.S., including three cases that originated in Wuhan, China, and 44 aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.\n\nTrump told reporters that more cases of the virus in the U.S. are “likely,” but that “healthy individuals should be able to fully recover.”\n\n“So healthy people, if you’re healthy, you will probably go through a process, and you’ll be fine,” the president said.\n\nHere's the latest on the outbreak of COVID-19:\n\nHealth official: Stop buying face masks\n\nPence on Saturday said the U.S. government has contracted with the 3M Company to produce 35 million additional face masks per month, with high-risk health workers given priority for them.\n\nThe surgeon general on Saturday urged the public to stop buying masks, warning that it takes away important resources from health care professionals and won’t help against the spread of the coronavirus\n\n“Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS!” the surgeon general, Jerome M. Adams, said in a tweet on Saturday morning. “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if health care providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!”\n\nHouse expected to take up funding package to combat coronavirus\n\nHours after officials announced coronavirus took its first life in the U.S., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to fellow Democrats Saturday, encouraging lawmakers to get their flu shots and offering an update on additional funding Congress plans to pass quickly to both combat the virus and ensure the U.S. is prepared for its possible spread.\n\nPelosi told fellow House Democrats that the House planned to take up a supplemental funding package next week. “Any emergency funding supplemental the Congress approves must be entirely new funding, not stolen from other accounts,” Pelosi said in the letter. “This package must also ensure that the President cannot use these new funds for anything other than fighting coronavirus and infectious diseases.”\n\nPelosi also said the funding package must ensure that vaccines are affordable and available to all.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has also said the Senate is similarly working on a coronavirus funding package and has stressed the need to put politics aside so those in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle can work together. He has said the package could be taken up in the next two weeks.\n\n“Bipartisan discussions are already underway among our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee,” McConnell said Thursday on the Senate floor. “I have faith the Committee will carefully consider the right sum to appropriate at this time to ensure our nation’s needs are fully funded. I hope they can work expeditiously so the full Senate would be able to take up the legislation within the next two weeks.”\n\nThe House and Senate will have to agree on a funding package before it can get to the president’s desk. White House officials expect Congress to hand them a coronavirus funding package as early as next week and hope that Trump will be able to sign the bill no later than the following week, Eric Ueland, Trump’s legislative affairs director, told reporters Friday.\n\n– Christal Hayes and Michael Collins\n\nTravel advisory for Italy, South Korea raised\n\nThe Trump administration is urging Americans to avoid travel to parts of Italy and South Korea amid growing concern about the spread of coronavirus.\n\nPence said Saturday that the U.S. has raised the travel warning to level 4 — its most severe warning — regarding travel to affected areas of Italy and South Korea.\n\nPence also said restrictions on travel to Iran have been expanded. The existing travel ban on Iran has been expanded to restrict travel for any foreign national that has visited Iran in the last 14 days, Pence said.\n\n– Morgan Hines\n\nUConn recalls 88 study abroad students from Italy\n\nThe University of Connecticut suspended its study aboard program in Italy on Saturday and notified its 88 students there to return to the U.S. immediately.\n\nUConn said on its website that it was responding to new guidance by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which issued a Warning Level 3 on Friday that recommends Americans avoid all non-essential travel to China, South Korea, Italy and Iran because of the coronavirus outbreaks..\n\nUConn said its students in Italy would be provided online and remote learning opportunities in the U.S. to allow them to complete their academic requirements.\n\nChina sees slowdown in new infections\n\nChina, where the outbreak began in December, has seen a slowdown in new infections and on Saturday morning reported 427 new cases over the past 24 hours along with 47 additional deaths. The city at the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan, accounted for the bulk of both.\n\nNew cases in mainland China have held steady at under 500 for past four days, with almost all of them in Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei province.\n\nWith the number of discharged patients now greatly exceeding those of new arrivals, Wuhan now has more than 5,000 spare beds in 16 temporary treatment centers, Ma Xiaowei, director of the National Health Commission, told a news conference in Wuhan on Friday.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak had infected more than 84,000 people and killed nearly 3,000 people globally as of Saturday morning, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSouth Korea has recorded the most cases outside of China, and Iran has seen the most deaths outside the nation.\n\nFrances bans indoor gatherings of more than 5K\n\nFrance is banning all indoor public gatherings of more than 5,000 people to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nHealth Minister Olivier Veran announced the measures following special government meetings Saturday, France 24 reported. All public gatherings in the Oise region north of Paris are being banned completely.\n\nIn addition, Sunday's Paris half-marathon will not take place as scheduled.\n\n\"These measures are provisional and we will undoubtedly have to modify them over time,\" Véran said. \"They are restrictive measures and we hope that they last for some time because that would allow us to contain the spread of the virus.\"\n\nTwo people have died in France from the virus-related illness, a 60-year-old French teacher and an 80-year-old Chinese tourist.\n\nCalifornia receives additional test kits\n\nThe California Department of Public Health said Friday that the state will receive enough kits from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to test up to 1,200 people a day for the COVID-19 virus.\n\nThe announcement followed a complaint by Gov. Gavin Newsom to federal health officials that the state had already exhausted its initial 200 test kits.\n\nIran preparing to test 'tens of thousands'\n\nIran is preparing for the possibility of “tens of thousands” of people getting tested for the virus as the number of confirmed cases spiked again Saturday, an official said, underscoring the fear both at home and abroad over the outbreak in the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe virus and the COVID-19 illness it causes have killed 43 people out of 593 confirmed cases in Iran, Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said. The new toll represents a jump of 205 cases – a 150% increase from the 388 reported the day before.\n\nBut the number of known cases versus deaths would put the virus’ death rate in Iran at over 7%, much higher than other countries.

He also partially restricted the entry of foreign nationals from seven other nations.\n\nThe restrictions are scheduled to go into effect on June 9.\n\nThe ban prohibits entry into the United States of foreign nationals from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Trump issued partial travel suspensions for foreign nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.\n\nIn videotaped remarks from the Oval Office, Trump pointed to last weekend's fiery assault on pro-Jewish demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, carried out by suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman, a native of Egypt who came to the United States on a tourist visa in late 2022 and stayed after the visa expired.\n\n\"The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstayed their visas,\" Trump said. \"We don't want them.\"\n\nEgypt is not among the countries facing new restrictions despite Trump invoking the attack, which the White House has blamed on the Biden administration's immigration policies.\n\nTrump's travel ban: A timeline look throughout his first presidency\n\nWho faces a travel ban?\n\nThe move comes after the Trump administration has worked aggressively to deport immigrants who are in the United States unlawfully, halted the government's refugee resettlement program, and on May 28 announced plans to \"aggressively\" revoke visas of Chinese students.\n\nThe ban resembles similar actions Trump took during his first term to bar the entry of foreign nationals from several predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nThe restrictions do not apply to visas that have already been granted, lawful permanent residents, certain athletes, immediate family members of current visa holders, and other classes of individuals for whom the administration granted exceptions.\n\n\"In the 21st century, we've seen one terror attack after another carried out by foreign visa overstayers from dangerous places.

The new order risks separating families, depriving students of educational opportunities and blocking patients from unique medical treatment, he said.\n\n\"President Trump's new travel ban targeting mostly Muslim and African nations and raising the specter of more vague free speech restrictions is overbroad, unnecessary and ideologically motivated,” Awad said. \"Automatically banning students, workers, tourists, and other citizens of these targeted nations from coming to the United States will not make our nation safer.\"\n\nAmy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said in a post on social media that the antisemitic attack in Boulder shouldn’t be used to justify a ban on travel from primarily Muslim-majority countries.\n\n“We’ll keep saying it: the Jewish community’s legitimate fears and concerns should not (be) exploited to undermine core democratic norms, or otherwise advance discriminatory & unconstitutional policies,” Spitalnick said. “Doing so only makes Jews – and all communities – less safe.”\n\nRep. Judy Chu, a California Democrat who introduced legislation in February that sought to prevent the Trump administration from banning travel to the United States by people of any religious group, lashed out at Trump on X.\n\n\"Just now, Trump has re-issued his disgusting, bigoted, and Islamophobic travel ban.

The president said the administration also considered a country's \"cooperation with accepting back its removable nationals.\"\n\nAt one point, the administration looked at slapping as many as 43 countries with restrictions. Egypt was not on either of the draft lists that circulated in March.\n\nThe president said in the order that Rubio and Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller provided him a list on April 9 of countries to consider.\n\nThe White House did not immediately explain why it took Trump nearly two months after he received the report to take action.

Gavin Newsom's executive order telling local officials to start cracking down harder on homeless encampments.\n\nNewsom said he wants cities to implement the kind of enforcement the U.S. Supreme Court legalized last month when it ruled in its Grants Pass decision that cities can fine and arrest homeless people for sleeping on public property, including when no shelter beds are available.\n\n“It’s been very upsetting because these efforts end up exasperating homelessness,\" said Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco. \"People are traumatized daily.\"\n\nMore than 180,000 people live without housing in California, representing nearly a third of the U.S. homeless population, and the majority live outside, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses,\" Newsom said in his announcement. “I don’t think there’s anything more urgent and more frustrating than addressing the issue of encampments in the state of California.\"\n\nWhile the legality of sleeping bans was tied up in federal courts for years, unhoused residents in the Golden State could not be arrested for sleeping outside if there was nowhere else for them to go. Police no longer have to offer assistance or help them get indoors, and police departments in San Francisco and San Marcos have updated their policies to match what's allowed under the court ruling.\n\n“They’re worse off after these operations than they were before,\" Friedenbach told USA TODAY.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department told USA TODAY that it is enforcing new guidelines released in late July that correspond with the Supreme Court's decision and that officers may enforce sleeping bans \"without first assuring that the City has made offers of available shelter.\"\n\nHomeless people living in tents along highways and under overpasses are particularly vulnerable to police sweeps, because Newsom's order has more power over state-owned land controlled by state agencies like the California Department of Transportation, also known as Caltrans.\n\n\"All this order does is cut off those areas and force people into the municipalities and jurisdictions where they are subject to yet another patchwork of enforcement strategies,\" said Shayla Myers, a lawyer who works on homeless issues with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. \"It is becoming harder and harder for people to figure out where they can go without breaking the law.\"\n\nNew encampment sweeps bring 'more worry'\n\nIn Venice, California, Dani Rodriguez lived in a tent along a highway for two years until moving into an RV.

All I know is I would be scared as hell,\" said Rodriguez, 48, speaking through tears. “Things are always life-changing in our situation, but that would be a big blunt of more worries and feeling hurt inside.”\n\nRodriguez, a transgender woman, said she and her partner feel safer in their RV, but there's still no guarantee authorities won't make them move, she said.\n\nPolice no longer have to offer shelter\n\nEven though California has spent more than $24 billion on tackling homelessness and increasing mental health services under Newsom, Friedenbach said, there still aren't enough resources to solve the crisis.\n\nOn the more pro-enforcement side, elected officials said the spending under Newsom needs to be matched with more urgent enforcement of anti-camping laws governing public places.\n\nIn a San Francisco Police Department notice July 31, the department said staff are \"encouraged\" to provide people experiencing homelessness with an information card highlighting shelters, but they're \"not required to do so.\"\n\nSacramento, San Jose say more enforcement is necessary\n\nSacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg and San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan told USA TODAY they desperately want to get people indoors and into safety, and enforcing more encampment sweeps is part of that strategy.\n\nSteinberg said treating unhoused people with compassion is the most important part of the process, and he said he's against sending homeless people to jail for sleeping outside or fining them when they have no money to pay the tickets.\n\nBut, Steinberg said, “over time there is going to be more enforcement.\"\n\n\"The way I viewed it, it's an enforcement order that also says cities and counties need to spend the resources to increase capacity and to offer people help,\" Steinberg told USA TODAY, referring to Newsom's directive.\n\nAbout 6,600 people in Sacramento experienced homelessness last year, down from more than 9,000 in 2022, according to HUD. The city's total population is about 530,000.\n\nIn San Jose, where just over 6,300 people of 1 million are experiencing homelessness, Mayor Mahan told USA TODAY he appreciated Newsom signaling that more urgency is needed to clean up city streets.\n\nAlong with increased enforcement, Mahan said, San Jose will create 1,000 new shelter spots in 2024 \"so that we have places for people to go when we clear their encampment.\"\n\nOther cities in California are considering new camping restrictions. In nearby Fresno, a city of about 550,000, elected officials proposed increasing anti-camping misdemeanor fines to $500, or up to six months in jail. The city council and mayor did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSan Marcos, a town in San Diego County, recently passed a ban on camping in public areas. The community has a homeless population of only 35, according to a local count, which represents a small portion of the county's 10,600, most of whom live in the city of San Diego. The town's city council and mayor did not respond to request for comment on the new camping ban.\n\nLos Angeles won't follow Newsom's guidelines\n\nIn Los Angeles, which has spearheaded efforts to move thousands of unhoused people from the streets into temporary hotel shelter programs, officials in recent weeks said they will prioritize getting people indoors without complying with Newsom's directive.\n\nThe city still has anti-camping bans, but officials often offer temporary housing during sweeps. Beyond temporary hotel programs, more affordable housing is desperately needed to reduce homelessness − something elected officials harp on often, Rodriguez said.\n\n“I’d really like to know, with them doing the crackdown, are they going to stand by their word and try and put us in places, or just clean up the spots and dust us along with the rest of the debris?\"\n\nBut hotel shelter programs apply only to those picked up from city-owned public property, and homelessness service providers said they're worried harsh sweeps of homeless people living along state-owned highway land will increase.\n\nEric Menjivar, the Caltrans District 7 media relations manager, told USA TODAY the department will “do things the way we do it already.\"\n\nThat could still lead to negative outcomes for homeless communities, said Myers, the Los Angeles legal aid lawyer, noting the department in 2020 had to pay $5.5 million to settle claims that it illegally removed and destroyed property belonging to hundreds of homeless people.\n\nIn an email, Caltrans' statewide public affairs chief, Edward Barrera, told USA TODAY the department \"will continue to follow its guidelines and the Governor’s Office directives regarding encampment removals on the state right-of-way that it oversees.\"\n\nRodriguez, who was laid off from her job at a bank after taking a long medical leave because of a rollover accident, said it's hard enough for people living along highways to survive.\n\n\"It would be really hard because we’d have to find another spot to move to. On top of that, there’s no guarantee we’d even be able to stay in another spot,\" she said.\n\nSan Diego moves people to sanctioned campsites\n\nThe city of San Diego had already been enforcing its Unsafe Camping Ordinance since June 2023, moving unhoused residents to sanctioned campsites where dozens of identical blue and red tents blanket hillsides in uniform rows.\n\n\"We have not seen any changes or impacts in San Diego,\" said Tony Manolatos, a spokesperson for the county's Regional Taskforce on the Homeless, referring to changes in enforcement after Newsom's order.\n\nIn San Diego County, which includes San Marcos, Jennifer Hark Dietz manages teams of outreach workers with the nonprofit People Assisting The Homeless to get services and housing offers to people living in encampments.\n\nHark Dietz said the street outreach team dedicated to San Marcos will not enforce the town's new camping ban because asking people to leave their campsite is \"completely against our model.\" Instead, she said, the team will notify people that more police may tell them to move.\n\nIn municipalities like San Marcos that don't have any shelters or sanctioned campsites, “this has given cities more opportunities to criminalize,\" Hark Dietz said.\n\nBans in towns with smaller homeless populations are particularly frustrating, Hark Dietz said, because it would take fewer resources to get housing to the relatively few people who need it. Similar to San Marcos, Grants Pass, the town that brought the camping ban case to the Supreme Court, also does not have a city-run shelter.\n\n\"It's still pretty early for many cities, but we're terrified about what's going to happen,\" Hark Dietz said. \"We notify folks that this is possible, and then the other question that comes is, 'Then where do they go?'\n\n\"And that's a question we don't have an answer to, because there's not additional services or additional beds.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/08/iran-sanctions-trump-iranian-americans-vote-election/3528381001/", "title": "Trump administration sanctions Iran again; Iranians in US are fed up", "text": "Jason Nazmiyal, a prominent Persian carpet dealer based in New York, is used to America's red tape when it comes to Iran.\n\nFor years, the Iranian American businessman has expertly navigated Washington’s sanctions and export rules to sell his pricey antique rugs – woven works of art – all over the world. But now, he says the Trump administration has so tainted any dealings with Iran that once simple business tasks have taken on a senseless and disorienting quality.\n\nNazmiyal, 60, was recently blocked from purchasing a carpet that was already in the U.S. and had not been anywhere near Iranian soil for decades.\n\n\"This is the nonsense we have to deal with,\" he said. \"It's becoming so difficult for us in the U.S. and also it's hard to see how the sanctions harm Iran's government, as opposed to its people,\" said Nazmiyal, who left Iran for the U.S. in 1978, a year before the Islamic revolution.\n\nWhile some Iranian Americans fully support President Donald Trump, Nazmiyal is among scores of Iranian Americans who have no loyalty to the repressive regime in Tehran, but who are fed up with a White House that has vilified their homeland, banned their family members from visiting the U.S., and stoked fears of a military conflict. From the Muslim ban to an endless stream of sanctions and saber-rattling, they hear about their relatives suffering in Iran and feel increased hostility in their adopted homeland.\n\nNew sanctions, maximum impact?\n\nThe human cost of the Trump administration's \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran is most visible in Iran itself. After Trump withdrew the U.S. from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers a little over two years ago, he has gradually reimposed crushing sanctions on vast swathes of Iran's economy, its diplomats and its intelligence and security entities.\n\nThe latest sanctions were unveiled Thursday by the U.S. Treasury Department targeting Iran's financial sector. They could completely sever Iran’s economy from the outside world except in extremely limited circumstances. They target 18 more banks, effectively placing Iran's entire financial sector off-limits and forcing it to rely even more on informal or illicit trade.\n\nTrump admin insists UN sanction restored on Iran: No, they're not, UN says\n\n\"Amid Covid19 pandemic, U.S. regime wants to blow up our remaining channels to pay for food & medicine,\" Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted, in reaction. \"Iranians WILL survive this latest of cruelties.\"\n\nSanctions have hit Iran's economy hard. GDP has contracted sharply. Oil exports have plummeted. The value of Iran's rial currency has been cut in half and there has been runaway inflation alongside mass unemployment and skyrocketing living costs.\n\nThe official U.S. policy is that it doesn't sanction humanitarian aid, but access to a range of critical health care drugs and products has become more difficult as imports have stalled. The sanctions have deterred many international banks from working with Iran over fears that they too could be caught up in so-called secondary U.S. sanctions.\n\nWho's going to derail the U.S. election?: The culprit may be close to home\n\n\"The Trump administration's blanket maximum pressure policy has made it so no bank in the world is going to even want to touch Iran, regardless of the reason,\" said Ali Scotten, 40, a second generation Iranian American who was born in Arizona and works as a consultant on Middle East issues.\n\nHe worries about his relatives in Iran. \"The daily cost of living has become astronomically higher,\" Scotten said, adding that Trump's punishing sanctions have soured Iranians' views toward the U.S.\n\nTrump and his advisers say their strategy is aimed at forcing Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions, curb its ballistic missile program, and end its support for militant proxy groups across the Middle East.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump have repeatedly said these actions will eventually force Iran to seek a new agreement.\n\n\"Our maximum economic pressure campaign will continue until Iran is willing to conclude a comprehensive negotiation that addresses the regime’s malign behavior,\" Pompeo said in a statement touting Thursday's sanctions. \"The United States continues to stand with the Iranian people, the longest-suffering victims of the regime’s predations.\"\n\nIran’s leaders have consistently rejected the president’s entreaties and pushed the U.S. to rejoin the existing agreement. Iran says it doesn't care whether it's Trump or his potential successor, Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, who does this.\n\nIran's nuclear material\n\nCritics say Trump's policy has failed.\n\nExperienced Iran-watchers such as Barbara Slavin, director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, D.C., point out that Iran is now enriching uranium at a higher level than at any point since the Obama administration brokered the nuclear agreement in 2015.\n\nIran may even soon have sufficient fissile missile material to produce a nuclear weapon. And it has become more, not less, aggressive in the Persian Gulf and Iraq. As U.S. and Iran tensions have spiked to dangerous levels, the U.S. policy has also deepened a divide between the U.S. and its closest allies in Europe, a point raised by Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris during her Wednesday night debate with Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nTrump's approach to Iran has been an \"embarrassing mix of economic sanctions, botched diplomacy, and harsh rhetoric,\" Slavin wrote in a recent analysis.\n\nSome critics have suggested the Trump's administration true goal in Iran is to topple the regime.\n\nSanctions part and parcel of U.S.-Iran relations\n\nThat would be just fine with Afshine Ash Emrani, a 52-year-old cardiologist in California and full-throated Trump supporter.\n\nEmrani came to the U.S. with his parents when he was 17 years old – fleeing the regime's persecution of Iranian Jews. He voted for Trump in 2016 and counts himself as an even stronger supporter of the president now, even though he doesn't like Trump's sometimes \"crass\" rhetoric.\n\nIran’s Jewish community: The largest in Mideast outside Israel; many feel safe\n\nHe views Trump's recent foreign policy victories – persuading the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalize ties with Israel – as a major step toward further isolating Iran.\n\n\"It's going to take away a lot of the regime's power... because now the entire region will be against them,\" he said. \"My hope is that it will be a stepping stone towards changing the regime in Iran\" and making the government more friendly to both Israel and America.\n\nBut for Sahand Mirzahossein, a 39-year-old Chicagoan who works in the pharmaceutical industry, Trump's election has brought nothing but anxiety and fear. When Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Iran's most powerful military leader, \"that was terrifying,\" he said. \"I was like, well, this is war.\"\n\nIran claims revenge for Qasem Soleimani killing: The US Navy is still a target\n\nMirzahossein's parents left Iran after the revolution, and he has few family ties there now.\n\n\"I feel torn about the direction America is taking because it is my home,\" he said. As a gay man, Mirzahossein said he also feels targeted by Trump's domestic policies, and he said it's \"heartbreaking\" to see the \"open hostility\" toward the LGBTQ community and people of color.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of State, there are an estimated 500,000 to one million people of Iranian descent living in the U.S., the highest number of Iranians outside Iran. The biggest Iranian-American communities are in California, followed by the New York and Washington D.C. metropolitan areas.\n\nA majority do not support Trump’s policies, according to a 2019 survey from the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans (PAAIA), a non-partisan group that represents their interests. That survey found that two-thirds (66%) of Iranian-Americans feel that Trump has handled relations between the two adversaries \"poorly.\"\n\nMore than 8 in 10 Iranian Americans said they have either directly been impacted by Trump's 2017 travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, or have friends and family who have been impacted. Iran visas have been routinely denied since the ban.\n\nBy contrast, when PAAIA's survey was conducted the year before Trump took office, in 2016, more than two-thirds (71%) of respondents rated the Obama administration's handling of U.S.-Iran relations as \"excellent\" or \"good.\"\n\nThe survey revealed the expectation that the nuclear deal could serve as a path to improved U.S.-Iran relations – soured by decades of hostility that began when the CIA helped orchestrate the ouster of Iran's democratically elected leader in 1953. By 1979, amid the birth of the Islamic Republic, 52 Americans were held hostage in the former U.S. Embassy for 444 days.\n\nEconomic sanctions have been a regular part of the U.S.-Iran story ever since.\n\nFearing discrimination\n\nBut it is not just about the inconvenience of having to apply for visa waivers that has concerned Iranian Americans under the Trump presidency.\n\nPAAIA's survey found that 71% of Iranian Americans are worried about increased discrimination and 63% have either personally experienced discrimination or know someone else who has because of their ethnicity or country of origin. A majority (62%) fear possible U.S. military strikes against Iran, where they have many friends and relatives and retain deep cultural connections.\n\nScotten, the Iranian American from Arizona, said that just a few days after Trump's election in 2016, his mother and a friend were hiking.\n\n\"They were speaking Farsi and a lady started berating them for speaking a different language,\" he said. It was the first time in her 40 years in the U.S. that she’s been harassed.\n\n\"It's a direct result of Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric\" and efforts to make Americans afraid of immigrants, he said.\n\nFor Nazmiyal, the Trump administration's Iran policy has brought a big economic hit, since 75% of his sales are in Persian rugs, and 40% of his business involves shipping these overseas. But for Iranian American and San Francisco-resident Delfarib Fanaie the prohibitions have hurt those who can least afford it: poor and vulnerable children.\n\nFanaie runs Moms Against Poverty (MAP), an organization that sends humanitarian relief to Iran for underprivileged children. MAP has an official license from the U.S. Treasury Department that permits it to legally transfer funds to Iran from its bank in the U.S., via the banking system in Canada, and then onward to a bank in Tehran.\n\nSince 2008, MAP has helped build more than 175 schools, orphanages, heath clinics and cultural centers in Iran.\n\nYet Fanaie said that while MAP itself has had little overt trouble from the U.S. Treasury Department, and in 2020 it actually saw the amount of humanitarian funds it is allowed to send under its export license to Iran increase because of the coronavirus pandemic, the problem is that the vast majority of international financial institutions are scared that if they do business with a U.S. entity sending money to Iran, they too will be sanctioned by Washington.\n\nThe result of all this, Fanaie said, is that her organization needs to be \"in constant touch\" with the U.S. Treasury Department to try to find obscure and mercurial banking channels to send MAP funds to Iran even though the U.S. government insists it has not created any barriers to these channels.\n\n\"Every day I am worried that a (bank) available to us the day before won't be there in the morning,\" she said.\n\n\"I mean, what is the point of having humanitarian permission to help underserved children in Iran and then effectively make it nearly impossible for most organizations to transfer these funds?\"\n\nSome Iranian-Americans are conflicted about the Trump presidency.\n\nDarius Massoudi, 32, a public policy advisor and lawyer for the state of Washington, said that in some respects Trump is \"the best U.S. president ever\" because he has taken such a hard line against a brutal regime. Human Rights Watch and other groups say Iran uses lethal force to crush political dissent and arbitrarily detains, tortures and kills protesters who demand freedom of expression and assembly. Iran denies this.\n\nAt the same time, Massoudi says Trump's rhetoric has made him feel unwelcome.\n\n\"There's some of us who are like, well, we live in this country and Trump is treating us like garbage,\" said Massoudi, referring to the travel bans and his belief that Trump has disparaged minority groups. Massoudi said he briefly considered emigrating to Canada, which has a growing Iranian diaspora.\n\nHow would it change in a Biden presidency?\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Iran has sought to undermine Trump ahead of the U.S. presidential election.\n\n\"Democrats are softer compared to Republicans,\" Iran's Sharq newspaper noted in a recent editorial, according the Atlantic council.\n\n“I’m really nervous about this election,” said Mirzahossein. “Four more years of Trump means … honestly who knows.\"\n\nBut it's not clear that for Iranian Americans, a Biden presidency would be a panacea, despite his pledge that if elected he would work to get back in the nuclear deal that Trump abandoned.\n\nBiden may want to re-enter the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (as the nuclear deal is known) as quickly as possible, but he may not be able to automatically lift all of the Trump administration's sanctions, as the Atlantic Council and others have pointed out. And Iran may consider that a sticking point before it restarts complying with the nuclear accord, which it stayed in while the U.S. dropped out. Iran's top diplomat Zarif also said recently that the country may insist on some form of compensation from the U.S. for its treatment by the Trump administration.\n\n\"The question mark on Biden is going to be will he have the guts to re-enter the deal in a way that Iran feels necessary,\" said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder of Bourse & Bazaar, a London based news and research group that focuses on Iran’s economy.\n\n\"Some of the folks around Biden have suggested that the U.S. might want to take advantage of the leverage that's been gained because of the Trump sanctions,\" he said.\n\nBatmanghelidj said Iran's difficulties in importing foods and life-saving medicines have been made worse by COVID-19, but he did not believe Iran would be \"coerced into new negotiations\" and let the U.S. \"dictate the terms\" of its own re-entry to the nuclear deal and that even though Iran's economy is in bad shape it will be able to \"limp along.\"\n\nScotten, the consultant on Middle East issues from Arizona, said supporting Biden is a \"no-brainer\" for him, because he has promised to return to the nuclear deal and lift the Muslim ban.\n\n\"Obviously there's 40 years of mistrust and rivalry between the U.S. and Iranian governments, so there's not going to be normalization of relations overnight,\" he said.\n\n\"(But) there's an absolute night-and-day difference between the two candidates,\" he said. \"And just like on a personal level, the Muslim ban being rescinded (would mean) my family can come visit us again,\" he added, recounting that his mother's sister was unable to attend his father's funeral in 2018 because of the ban.\n\nFor Nazmiyal, who has a collection of 4,000 antique and vintage rugs, the last few years have been about weathering frustrations, economic and political. He believes that no matter who wins the election on Nov. 3 the Iranian people will still continue to suffer. He has also devised a new strategy of sorts for dealing with the sanctions on Iran.

Nearly 80% ended up in landfills or in the natural world and 12% was incinerated the study found.\n\nWhile the fate of bottles, straws and bags generate most of the publicity, textiles are a significant part of the problem. Plastics are a major component of textile manufacturing.\n\nEPA statistics show that the amount of textiles produced in the U.S. grew from 1.76 million tons in 1960 to over 17 million tons in 2018. But only 2.5 million tons were recycled that year and 11.3 million tons ended up in landfills.\n\nMichael Joyce, CEO of PrimaLoft, which its website says supplies synthetic fabric and fibers to 900 clothing manufacturers globally, including major brands such as Nike, Under Armour and Eastern Mountain Sports, decided that while he couldn't control where the clothing and other products made using his synthetic material ended up, he could manufacture it in a way that reduced the level of harm.\n\nBack in 2014, PrimaLoft was working with a Norwegian clothing company that wanted it's product to stand up to the wear and tear of an outdoor lifestyle, but when discarded the material would break down naturally into environmentally friendly compounds.\n\nThe Norwegian company's request led to the development of a product line in 2018 that, according to testing under standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), broke down into elemental components in less than two years under lab conditions that simulated a landfill. Testing also showed that using a chemical process converted their product into virgin material that could be used to create new plastic.\n\nWhat we know: Pilgrim nuclear plant may release 1M gallons of radioactive water into bay\n\nJoyce is a 1985 graduate of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth's textile technology program, and the development of biodegradable fibers inspired him to approach officials at his alma mater about building a lab that would not only test products claiming to be biodegradable, but could investigate other ways to reduce the environmental impact of plastic.\n\n\"We (PrimaLoft) don't have testing facilities, and the one's we use don't do any research,\" Joyce, who lives in Chatham, said in recent telephone interview. He thought the UMass Dartmouth School for Marine Science and Technology (SMAST) would be a perfect place for such a lab, especially since it's waterfront location allowed for testing to expand into the marine environment.\n\nMoney donated to establish UMass Dartmouth Biodegradable Plastics Lab\n\nEarlier this month, PrimaLoft gave $350,000 to UMass Dartmouth to establish the lab. It was the most significant part of $1 million in funds, labor, and staffing from other private partners, as well as the University of Massachusetts and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. The donations triggered a $739,936 matching grant from the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative to establish the Biodegradable Plastics Lab at SMAST.\n\n\"It wouldn't have been possible without Mike Joyce and PrimaLoft,\" said Jean VanderGheynst, dean of the UMass Dartmouth School of Engineering and SMAST interim dean. \"He felt, given the strength of the engineering (program) and SMAST, that this was a good place to do it.\"\n\nRamprasad Balasubramanian, vice provost for Research and Academic Affairs at UMass Dartmouth, said the university had already been exploring building a marine lab to support research for the emerging offshore wind industry.\n\n\"This really took on a life of its own because the more people I talked to, from NOAA to the Office of Naval Research, talked about the importance of knowing what was going to happen to the things we were basically throwing into the ocean,\" Balasubramanian said.\n\nA 2015 University of Georgia report published in the online journal Science estimated that 192 countries produced 275 million metric tons of plastic waste in 2010 and that between 4.8 to 12.7 million metric tons a year enter the ocean, the equivalent of two garbage trucks of trash every minute. While the five large ocean gyres of plastic trash — large systems of rotating ocean currents — get a lot of media attention, most of the oceans' plastic is hidden in smaller particles known as microplastic that hang like a curtain in the upper ocean.\n\nPlastic is highly resistant to biodegrading and in nature it tends to break into smaller and smaller pieces over long periods of time. Microplastics are pieces smaller than a quarter inch.\n\nA 2011 Australian study published in a journal of the American Chemical Society found that 85% of the plastic found on shorelines was microfibers, the polyester and acrylic fibers used in clothing. According to data collected on the statistical modeling website Statista, worldwide plastics production has increased from 1.5 million metric tons in 1950 to 245 million metric tons in 2008 and continued a steady climb to 367 million metric tons in 2020.\n\nA 2021 Kyushu University study estimated there were 24 trillion pieces of microplastics in the world's upper oceans weighing as much as 578,000 tons. These plastics have entered the oceanic food chain and ultimately into our diet.\n\n\"This is in the forefront of everyone that is operating in the marine coastal region,\" Balasubramanian said. \"The largest pollutant in the ocean right now is microplastics.\"\n\nHow biodegradable plastic decomposes in nature\n\nVanderGheynst is an engineer focused on how plant biomass breaks down in the environment. Think of the backyard compost pile where a multitude of microorganisms working on breaking down cellulose, the chain of sugar molecules bound together by an electron-sharing mechanism that give plants structure. These chains are broken down using specialized enzymes that dissolve that bond and allow these microorganisms to digest the sugar molecules.\n\nThat decomposition extends to some textiles. A cotton T-shirt, VanderGheynst said, is actually composed of cellulose that is crystalline.\n\n\"It's just a chain of sugar,\" she said. When it's tossed into a landfill, the T-shirt is attacked by these microorganisms and their specialized enzymes begin breaking those bonds and digesting the clothing. The ultimate end-product of decomposition of plant matter is CO2 and water, VanderGheynst said, and a cotton T-shirt in a compost pile wouldn't be recognizable after six months.\n\nUnder the sea: Researchers from WHOI's submarine Alvin find an Octopus Garden\n\nBut plastics, including synthetic fibers, have long polymer chains that don't exist in nature and microorganisms don't have the specialized enzymes to dissolve the bonds between individual monomers, and reduce them into components that can be used by other organisms.\n\nA cow, for instance, has bacteria in its gut that have the enzymes to break down grass cellulose, but humans don't, and our digestive system extracts very little from grazing.\n\nThe ultraviolet rays in sunlight can break plastic polymer chains, but it takes a long time and depends on the material being exposed to light. According to research cited on the World Wildlife Fund website, a plastic bag takes 20 years, a plastic cup 30 years and diaper and a plastic toothbrush take 500 years to decompose. Most plastic doesn't decompose at all, but simply breaks into microplastics.\n\nJoyce said the biodegradable fibers in PrimaLoft Bio, made from 100% recycled plastic, are designed to degrade in marine environments and landfills. They also can be broken down chemically into virgin stock that can be made into new products.\n\nJoyce said PrimaLoft added sugars to it's plastic polymers that attract microorganisms with enzymes to dissolve the bonds between molecules until it is reduced to CO2, methane and water, with a small amount of compostable carbon left behind. According the company website, testing by independent labs under ASTM standards showed 93.8% biodegradation in 646 days in an accelerated landfill environment and 74.3% biodegradation in 889 days under an accelerated marine/ocean environment.\n\nLimits to plastic decomposition\n\nBut the PrimaLoft website also acknowledges that California does not allow products to carry labels such as biodegradable, degradable or decomposable. In 2011, California's attorney general filed a lawsuit that caused three companies to remove advertising claiming their plastic water bottles were 100% biodegradable and recyclable. California's CalRecycle website says that environmental marketing claims need to be \"substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence.\"\n\nJoyce said that California is behind the times, that it has not revisited a science that has evolved over the past decade.\n\n\"The idea of making plastics that can biodegrade has been around a long time, and there are certain plastics that can do this,\" said Margaret Sobkowicz-Kline, an associate professor in the Plastics Engineering Department at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.\n\nThe problem with widespread acceptance and use of biodegradable plastics is that their rate of decomposition depends on environmental conditions. Temperature, sunlight, oxygen, moisture, the type of microorganisms present, all critical to the natural decomposition process, can vary widely between landfills, the marine environment, and wastewater treatment plants.\n\nThat is the importance of testing facilities in recreating those conditions and in researching the materials that will biodegrade under a wide range of variables.\n\n\"It's a biology problem, but the production and design of new plastics is an engineering problem,\" Brian Howes, a chancellor and professor of estuarine and ocean science at SMAST, explaining that both the engineering and biology departments would be involved.\n\nPart of the lab's mission, Howes said, would be to certify that environmental marketing claims are scientifically valid.\n\n\"They are developing new fibers and materials all the time,\" Howes said. \"But now they have to test them. Do they work?\"\n\nComputer modeling and chemical predictions of what will happen have to be verified, he said, by testing the product in the lab under ASTM standards in vessels that mimic conditions in landfills, salt and freshwater environments and wastewater treatment plants.\n\nSMAST's location near a wastewater treatment plant and on the waterfront will provide the environmental materials for testing for those two ecosystems, and a separate instrument will grow the bacteria to simulate a landfill. Plastic samples will be placed in 140 bioreactors that vary in size from a yogurt cup to a two liter bottle.\n\nThese digestors compress the time frame for biodegradation into 60 to 90 days. Decomposition is measured using gases emitted during the process that flow past a sensor that identifies and quantifies compounds.\n\nTextile industry seems engaged in biodegradable plastic research\n\n\"Our goal is to have them (plastics) break down rather than break up (into microplastic),\" Howe said.\n\nBut, not while you're wearing it, of course. Howes said ideally the plastic fabric and fibers completely biodegrade within three years. He thinks the textile industry is engaged.\n\n\"From an industry perspective they want biodegradable stuff, (they) know that will capture people's attention,\" said Howes. He said that the UMass lab will be sharing its results with other labs in an effort to cross-check results.\n\nThe testing will not only include fibers from textile manufacturers but other plastics such as fishing line and nets that make up a large amount of plastic pollution in the ocean, Howes said. While a majority of the testing will be done on industry samples, a portion of the lab space will be used for research. The lab is on track to open in March 2022, VanderGheynst said\n\n\"The equipment is coming in and being assembled,\" Howes said, although there are some supply chain issues.\n\n\"It's pretty unusual to find a facility that can do standardized biodegradation testing, that have ASTM standards for different types of biodegradation in soil, wastewater and marine conditions,\" said Sobkowicz-Kline. \"We do a lot of work with plastic sustainability and this facility will support, complement and augment our research.\"\n\nContact Doug Fraser at dfraser@capecodonline.com.

As it turns out, some of those efforts to save the environment may have been in vain.\n\nA new study, published Thursday in the journal Food Additives and Contaminants, found evidence of “forever chemical” PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in the majority of both paper and bamboo straws tested.\n\nScientists in Belgium tested 39 brands of straws made of paper, bamboo, plastic and stainless steel found in shops, supermarkets and restaurants across the country.\n\nOf the straws tested, almost all contained some concertation of PFAS, which are often used during manufacturing to make products water resistant. Out of the total 39 tested, the chemicals were detected in 27, none of which were stainless steel.\n\nPaper straws, on the other hand, were the most likely to contain PFAS, with 18 out of 20, or 90%, of paper brands testing positive. They were also found in four out of five bamboo straws, three out of four plastic straws and two out of five glass straws.\n\nNot so eco-friendly?\n\nEighteen different PFAS were detected in total, though overall in low concentrations. The chemical most commonly found, however, was perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) which was banned globally in 2020.\n\n“These ‘eco-friendly’ plant-based straws are not necessarily a more sustainable alternative to plastic straws,” said the study’s conclusion, “because they can be considered as an additional source of PFAS exposure in humans and the environment (e.g. after degradation in landfills or through incomplete incineration).”\n\nThe study also discovered PFAS that are known to be highly water soluble, meaning they have the potential to bleed from the straw into a drink, but did not investigate this component further.\n\nThe researchers proposed that, while manufactures could intentionally be coating their plant-based straws in chemicals to make them water-repellent, the presence of PFAS could also be attributed to contaminated soil or an unintended consequence of material recycling. The authors suggested further analysis and studies be conducted to determine the primary source of contamination in the straws and how the chemicals may impact drinks and people consuming them.\n\nThis Belgian study comes on the heels of a 2021 U.S. study, which found the presence of 21 PFAS in paper and other plant-based straws versus no measurable amounts in plastic ones.\n\nWhile PFAS were present in most straws tested, the low concentration, paired with the limited extent to which people use straws, means they don’t pose an immediate risk to humans.\n\nSmall amounts of PFAS are not harmful in and of themselves, but rather their ability to build up over time, including in the human body, is what poses the most risk. Even with these findings, plant-based straws are still better for the environment than straight-up plastics.\n\nAs stainless-steel straws are reusable long-term and all tested PFAS-free, the study authors suggest the use of these straws for bother environmental and health-related reasons.\n\nPFAS found in drinking water: Dangerous levels of PFAS detected in water for 27 million. Did the EPA find it near you?\n\nWhat are PFAS?\n\nPFAS stands for “per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances,” and refers to a collection of long-lasting chemicals that take a very long time to slowly break down in the environment.\n\nAccording to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), PFAS are widely used and persist for long periods of time in the environment, meaning they are found in the blood of people and animals around the world, as well as air, water, soil and in low levels in foods, packaging and household products.\n\nWhat health risks are associated with PFAS?\n\nWhile scientists are still working to determine the extent to which PFAS impact us, animals and our environment, they are already associated with a list of health concerns.\n\nAccording to the EPA, PFAS have been linked to:\n\nReproductive effects such as decreased fertility or increased high blood pressure in pregnant women.\n\nDevelopmental effects or delays in children, including low birth weight, accelerated puberty, bone variations, or behavioral changes.\n\nIncreased risk of some cancers, including prostate, kidney, and testicular cancers.\n\nReduced ability of the body’s immune system to fight infections, including reduced vaccine response.\n\nInterference with the body’s natural hormones.\n\nIncreased cholesterol levels and/or risk of obesity.\n\nEye drop recall: 2 more eye drop products recalled after being linked to potentially deadly bacteria\n\nWhere are PFAS usually found?\n\nAccording to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), PFAS can be found in hundreds of products we use daily. In some cases, they are approved for use in limited amounts by the FDA, such as in food packaging.\n\nThey are commonly found in:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2017/11/30/university-memphis-building-2-million-3-d-metal-printing-lab/906885001/", "title": "University of Memphis building $2 million 3D metal printing lab", "text": "The University of Memphis is investing $2 million into a metal 3D printing lab that could help revolutionize manufacturing in industries like aerospace and medical devices.\n\nThe school is outfitting a lab, which should be up and running by April, with two metal printers that can create anything from a kneecap to a part for a plane.\n\nThe university already has partnerships with local companies FedEx and Medtronic to develop the science behind 3D printing in metal, as opposed to the more common plastic, and to explore its possible uses. Researchers, however, have had to send their work hundreds of miles away to be printed. Metal printing requires much higher temperatures and a larger machine than the plastic ones that have found their way into high school classrooms.\n\nThat will change with the new lab on the U of M campus, and students from several departments will be able to take advantage, top mechanical engineering researchers Ali Fatemi and Ebrahim Asadi said.\n\n\"There are several universities that are heavily investing in this, not just in terms of the research capabilities but also in terms of education,\" Fatemi said.\n\nFuture employees, he said, will have to know this technology as it becomes a key part of several industries.\n\nFatemi, chairman of the mechanical engineering department, researches ways 3D printing can help the aerospace industry.\n\nBecause of their size--a medium-sized one has a printing chamber of about one square foot — the printers can create small-scale prototypes of airplane parts that can be tested for their durability before a company would invest in creating the life-sized version.\n\nAnd in aerospace, unlike the automotive industry, planes are often older and requires parts in smaller numbers that are no longer made. FedEx could have to wait a month for a necessary part to be created. Printing in metal could change that, Fatemi said.\n\nAnother use could be on a military aircraft carrier that requires a specific part for a plane could have trouble acquiring one while at sea.\n\nAsadi's research focuses on biomedical technology, like metal implants.\n\nThe way implants are currently manufactured, he said, they come standard for every part.\n\n\"You want to have parts that match the anatomy of a specific person,\" Asadi said. \"You don’t want to have your implant, and have your surgeon have to work like a carpenter on your implant while your body is wide open.\"\n\nThe researchers are also working on developing a metal that would dissolve inside a body. Someone who breaks a bone and has to have a plate or screws implanted wouldn't require a second surgery to have them removed.\n\nAsadi said there is much still unknown about the practical uses of melting metal, but he expects it to \"revolutionize\" technology in both aerospace and the creation of medical devices — two industries that have large footprints in Memphis.\n\n\"Over the next five years, these two industries, in my opinion, will lead the way,\" he said.\n\nReach Jennifer Pignolet at jennifer.pignolet@commercialappeal.com or on Twitter @JenPignolet.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/03/microplastics-brain-body-accumulation-study/78005554007/", "title": "Microplastics found to be accumulating in human brains, study finds", "text": "The average brain may contain a spoonful of plastic, a new study suggests.\n\nThe number of tiny bits of plastic found in human brains increased dramatically between 2016 and 2024, with the highest amounts found in the brains of people who had dementia.\n\nBy 2024, the average brain studied by scientists at the University of New Mexico contained the equivalent of one plastic throw-away spoon, about 7 grams worth, said Dr. Matthew Campen, a toxicologist and professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the university and lead author of the study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\nFor reference, the average adult human brain weighs about 3 pounds, typically between 1,300 and 1,400 grams.\n\nWhile human livers and kidneys also showed increases, the concentrations in brains were seven to 30 times greater, the study found. There was also a higher concentration of micro- and nanoplastic particles in the brains of people with a documented dementia diagnosis than in those without.\n\nThe research highlights growing concerns about the level of microplastics in the environment, which are increasingly being found in the human body.\n\nThe research \"gives one pause,\" said Jason Richardson, a professor of physiology at the University of Georgia who was not involved in the research.\n\n\"They're at a much larger concentration in the body than many of us would have expected,\" he said.\n\nResearchers think the growing amount of plastic humans are exposed to could be behind the increase but say the potential implications for human health remain unclear.\n\nAs plastic breaks down over time, it degrades into smaller and smaller bits ‒ eventually small enough to slip inside the human body.\n\nMost of the plastics the scientists found in brain, kidney and liver tissue were extremely small, less than 200 nanometers.\n\n\"That's roughly the size of two COVID viruses side by side,\" said Campen. A human hair is approximately 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide and a sheet of paper is about 100,000 nanometers thick by comparison.\n\nCampen and colleagues at the University of New Mexico tested samples of liver, kidney, and brain tissues from people who had died and underwent autopsy in 2016 and in 2024. That included a total of 52 brain specimens, 28 from 2016 and 24 from 2024.\n\nThe particles were found in all of the samples.\n\nThere was not much difference between the amounts of plastic found in liver and kidney tissues between 2016 and 2024.\n\nHowever, samples from 2016, all from the part of the brain involved in thoughts, emotions, judgment and memory, had substantially higher concentrations of plastic particles.\n\nThe quality of the research was extremely good, said Gary Miller a professor of environmental health at Columbia University, who was not involved in the research. These kinds of studies, especially on human brains, are difficult and require great care to ensure that there's been no contamination of the tissue, he said.\n\n\"This was a very well-conducted study with excellent technique that clearly demonstrate these things are in people's brains,\" he said. \"It's very compelling evidence.\"\n\nGiven the difficulty of doing testing on living people's brains \"it's not a bad sample size for an initial study,\" Richardson said.\n\nHow does plastic get into the brain?\n\nThe researchers do not know how microplastics get into the brain. In general, it's believed microplastic particles enter the body when people eat, drink, or breathe them in. Such particles have been found in multiple parts of human bodies: arteries, hearts, lungs, blood, placentas, breast milk, penis and testicles, among others.\n\nFinding the particles in higher concentrations in the brain was a surprise because of the blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain against infection.\n\n\"For those of us who work in the brain, showing that the highest levels (of microplastic) were measured in that organ is profound and a bit concerning,\" Richardson said.\n\nThe researchers think one reason there are higher levels of microplastic in the brain is because the liver and kidneys are built to filter toxins from the body, said Marcus Garcia, a doctor of pharmacy at the University of New Mexico and part of the team that did the research.\n\n\"We think the liver and kidney are doing their jobs,\" he said. \"On the other hand, the brain has limited clearance systems,\" he said.\n\nAnother possibility is that brain tissue is about 60% fat, meaning the plastics might stick to it better.\n\n\"If you've ever cleaned a Tupperware bowl that had bacon grease or butter in it, you know it's hard to get fat off plastic,\" said Campen. \"It's possible the nanoparticles are hijacking their way in through lipids.\"\n\nIs the amount of plastic in the brain increasing over time?\n\nScientists who study the amount of plastic accumulating in the human body find that the amounts are increasing over time, mirroring the increase of plastic in our environment.\n\nPeople in the 1920s, before the invention of plastic, would have had none, whereas people today live in an environment where plastic is ubiquitous.\n\nThe amount of plastic in the environment is doubling about every 10 to 15 years, Campen said.\n\nThe New Mexico researchers did find that the amount of plastic in the brains of people who were older when they died was not significantly different from younger people.\n\n\"This suggests that our bodies do clear these nanoparticles, we're not just accumulating them over our lifetimes,\" Campen said.\n\nThis means that lowering the amount of environmental plastic could eventually decrease the amount of plastic building up in our bodies, he said.\n\nHow dangerous are plastic particles in the brain?\n\nAt this point, it's not definitively known whether, or if, it is dangerous to have plastic microplastic particles in the brain. It would also be extremely difficult if not impossible to avoid them, Campen said.\n\n\"They really are everywhere,\" he said. He didn't think people should make dramatic changes in their diet or lifestyle \"to avoid something that may not be avoidable.\"\n\nHis group is investigating the potential sources of microplastic in the environment, including the soil, plants and meats to hopefully get a sense of the amount in the food chain.\n\n\"Just the presence of the plastic doesn’t necessarily indicate that they’re causing negative effects,\" Richardson said. But there are concerns.\n\n“I certainly don’t feel comfortable with this much plastic in my brain, and I don’t need to wait around 30 more years to find out what happens if the concentrations quadruple,” he said in a statement.\n\nEven if the plastic particles do not leach chemicals into the body, merely their presence could have an effect, Miller said.\n\nAsbestos is a good example of something similar. It was long thought to be an inert compound that wasn't biologically reactive and couldn't cause any problems.\n\nHowever, it became clear that having tiny pieces of asbestos in the lung can trigger an immune response.\n\n\"The lung's immune cells hate it and they try to clear it out,\" Miller said. \"Then you get an inflammatory response.\"\n\nThe same could be true of micro- and nanoplastic particles.\n\n\"When you put a foreign object in the body, our immune system doesn't like it. It can set off an inflammatory cascade that goes on for years or decades – it's going to have consequences,\" Miller said.\n\nWhy would people with dementia have more plastic in their brains?\n\nThe researchers don't know why the 12 brains they tested from people who had dementia had more plastic than those that didn't and don't know if it's cause or effect. But they're leaning toward effect.\n\n\"Remember, dementia is a disease where the brain-blood barrier is impaired and the brain's clearance mechanism is impaired,\" Campen said.\n\nIn addition, as people age, and in people with dementia, the brain also loses volume.\n\n\"Is it the cause? Is it symptomatic? I don't know, but it's certainly worthy of future study,\" Miller said.\n\nChildren could be at highest risk from plastic in the brain\n\nBecause the brain is relatively protected by the blood-brain barrier, there is at least some defense by the body. However, two groups are at special risk, Richardson warned.\n\n\"In very young children, the blood-brain barrier is not fully developed,\" he said. And, as people age the processes that protect the brain are less agile.\n\nThat said, it's too soon to worry, he said.\n\n\"At this point, we don't have enough data to say this is something you should be seriously concerned about,\" he said. \"It hasn't been established whether or not these (particles) can cause adverse effects.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/amy-williams/2015/03/13/name-amy-bennett-williams-podcast/70288746/", "title": "Field Notes: What's in a name?", "text": "AMY BENNETT WILLIAMS\n\nAWILLIAMS@NEWS-PRESS.COM\n\nEvery week, The News-Press' senior writer and storyteller Amy Bennett Williams shares one of her essays with listeners of NPR affiliate WGCU and on news-press.com.\n\nI had a strange moment with Clyde Butcher once, probably a decade ago, that has haunted me ever since.\n\nFortunate enough to be along on one of the world-renowned photographer's wet walks, we'd paused in a sunlit stand of small cypress trees, their gracefully windswept branches winter-bare and reflected in the sky-mirror of water below.\n\nThis little cypress variety, I asked Clyde — pond cypress, I believe it's commonly called — what's its binomial?\n\nHe looked at me as if I'd asked him to untie the knot in my tail.\n\nTheir scientific name, I said — Taxodium something-or-other — not T. distichum like their cousins the bald cypress, but what was their species? Embarrassing, but I'd forgotten it.\n\nClyde just shook his head.\n\nScientific name? Why bother with that?\n\nI don't remember his exact words, but they were withering — something to the effect that to fret about picky little scientific details like genus and species while standing thigh-deep in the middle of the wet miracle that is the Big Cypress Swamp — well, sister, I've got other things to think about, he told me.\n\nIn the grand scheme, taxonomy and nomenclature are small indeed, he believed, and to try to capture and confine nature with words and human definitions does it a grave disservice.\n\nWell, that shut me right up, and I spent the rest of the walk fretting even harder. Was I some Prufrockian priss who needs her wild things safely pinned and wriggling on the wall of science? Was my impulse to name, dissect, experiment, categorize simply a small-minded way to keep the raw glory of the universe at a stiff-armed distance? It pained me to think so.\n\nNational Parks support group against seismic testing in Big Cypress\n\nSo I kept thinking, and thinking and thinking, and have continued to do so, circling back to his idea every so often, while at the same time realizing that some of the most thrillingly expansive thinkers I've ever known are scientists.\n\nClyde's words bubbled up again recently as I was trying to extract a turkey femur from a plastic jug of white vinegar, where it had been soaking for months. It had been easier to shove it into its acetic bath than it was proving to get it out, no matter how hard I tugged, shook the now-empty bottle or turned it over and thumped it.\n\nFinally, I managed to get a grip on the bone's head and wrenched it free with a satisfying pop. The femur wavered in my hand like steamed asparagus, to Nash's delight.\n\nMy own parents taught me this: to decalcify a bone in mild acid (vinegar), which dissolves the hard, mineral portion of the bone, leaving just the flexible collagen matrix. But a wiggly, knot-able bone was more than an icky-cool kitchen trick: For me, it was an unforgettable lesson in how we're put together with limestone caught in nets of protein, in bone physiology, in science.\n\nI understand what Clyde means — that to get snarled in picayune definitions and formulas can separate us from what truly matters.\n\nBut for me, learning about how the universe is made and what its parts are called doesn't diminish the wonder of wading in winter among bonsai pond cypress (T. ascendens, by the way) — or of shaking a jelly bone at my laughing kid after a weeknight dinner — it only deepens it.\n\nEditor's note: Amy Bennett Williams is on special assignment.

The institute is a collaboration between the University of Louisville and the Jewish Heritage Fund for Excellence.\n\nKnown for creating products as diverse as car parts and action figures, 3-D printing also is being used to create models of human bones and organs, medical devices, personalized prosthetics and now, human tissues. Williams describes the process as taking a three-dimensional structure \"and essentially cloning it, using a printer.\"\n\n\"Bioprinting is pretty much done everywhere,\" said Dr. Anthony Atala, director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in North Carolina where scientists recently won an award for innovations in bioprinting. \"Our ultimate goal is increasing the number of patients who get organs.\"\n\nEarlier this month, officials announced that a baby's life had been saved when a 3-D printed device from the University of Michigan — a specially designed splint — restored his breathing. The case was recently featured in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nHere, Williams and his colleagues recently created and implanted parts of hearts in mice as part of their heart-printing research. And University of Kentucky scientists have used the technology to grow new ulna bones in rabbits and make numerous models of human parts for teaching and surgery planning.\n\nEventually, scientists across the globe hope printing tissues and organs from patients' cells can eliminate the danger of rejection and the persistent shortage of transplant organs. Atala said that may be years away, and scientists face a number of challenges, such as replicating the complexity of blood vessels.\n\nBut Bill Gregory of the UK Center for Visualization and Virtual Environments expressed the optimism of many scientists, saying that, in the future, \"You'll be able to custom-make parts and get them when you need them.\"\n\nWork began in 1990s\n\nWhile interest in 3-D printing has \"all of a sudden exploded,\" Williams said that he and other scientists have been studying medical applications of the technology since the 1990s.\n\nIt involves taking a three-dimensional digital image of a structure, then replicating the structure by depositing material in layers. Materials can be plastic, liquid or cells in a biologically safe glue. Different researchers use different custom-made glues and printers.\n\nWilliams, who worked at the University of Arizona before coming to UofL in 2007, said his team there received money from the U.S. Department of Defense to use 3-D printing to create a lymph node — with the idea it could be implanted in the event of bioterrorism.\n\nTo create the node — which they did in 2001 — they built a 3-D printer called the BioAssembly Tool, or BAT, for about $400,000. They started with a direct-write printer, adding parts from the hardware store and from custom shops.\n\nIn 2003, Williams won an R&D 100 Award for his work on the custom printer, which has resulted in $30 million worth of bioprinting work.\n\nWilliams has brought the BioAssembly Tool here, where his main interest is creating blood vessels, cardiac structures and ultimately hearts to fight cardiovascular disease, which accounts for about 3 in 10 deaths in Kentucky.\n\n\"This was what killed my dad,\" he said. \"My dad was in congestive heart failure.\"\n\nIn 2007, the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute received a $2 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to develop the printing technology, which researchers used at the time to organize tissue grown in the lab to build networks of small blood vessels using mice and rats. Their work has continued since.\n\nTissues are created using cells derived from an individual's fat and extracted with a machine. They go into the BioAssembly Tool, and the living cells are mixed with a glue that eventually dissolves inside the body like surgical sutures.\n\nThe printer rebuilds the structure, which then can be implanted. Williams said they are still working on whether the fat-derived cells will be coaxed into becoming cardiovascular cells in the lab or inside the body.\n\nHe said building a heart involves creating five parts — valves, coronary vessels, microcirculation, contractile cells and the organ's electrical system. Six months ago, researchers created and implanted a portion of a heart and blood vessels in mice.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to extract a patient's fat through liposuction, isolate cells with a machine, mix them with the glue and \"print\" a heart — all within an hour.\n\nWilliams said the total bioficial heart could cost about $100,000 in today's dollars, not counting $150,000 or so in hospital and surgery costs. That's less than the typical heart transplant and doesn't require ongoing costs for anti-rejection drugs.\n\nIf the bioficial heart were proven and federally approved, insurance most likely would cover it if it were considered medically necessary for the patient, he said.\n\nWilliams said some of his peers laugh at his 10-year timetable, but he's not discouraged.\n\n\"I love it when they laugh,\" he said. \"It provides me with a challenge.\"\n\nBeyond Louisville\n\nScientists in Lexington also are tapping into the possibilities of 3-D printing.\n\nGregory said his UK center printed ulnas for rabbits around 2005, using \"bone-seeding\" material that coaxed new bone to grow within rabbits.\n\nA more common application of 3-D printing at UK is to create surgical models from CT or MRI images, using liquid, small beads or powder, Gregory said.\n\nModels allow surgeons to practice on a person's precise anatomy before an operation — or teach medical students or residents — using printed replicas of structures such as jaws, eye sockets or cheekbones. Gregory said doctors also develop custom implants for reconstruction.\n\nDr. Larry Cunningham, chief of oral maxillofacial surgery at the University of Kentucky, said models give doctors \"something you can hold in your hand,\" instead of trying to visualize a structure from a two-dimensional image.\n\n\"The advantage to the patient is I'm better prepared,\" Cunningham said. \"I can be faster with less down time, which is important because OR time can cost $100 a minute.\"\n\nThe cost of 3-D printers has come down. Gregory said people can buy decent \"hobby printers\" for a couple thousand dollars, and sophisticated lab versions cost around $20,000 with custom-made printers costing much more.\n\nThe increasingly accessible technology has spawned new companies and products.\n\nSan Francisco-based Bespoke Innovations creates custom prosthetics, saying on its website: \"The advent of 3-D printing has allowed us to build something based on the unique shape of a particular user, modify it with our designs, and turn it into something physical that can be worn.\"\n\nHuman parts\n\nMeanwhile, scientists across the world are working on the next step, creating an array of real human parts.\n\nIn February, doctors at Weill Cornell Medical College and biomedical engineers at Cornell University in New York announced they had used 3-D printing and injectable gels made of cells to build a facsimile of a human ear that looks and acts like a real one.\n\nAnd in the case of the baby in Michigan, university officials said the splint was created from a CT scan of the patient's trachea and bronchus, integrating a computer model with 3-D printing. The baby, who stopped breathing every day when his collapsed bronchus blocked the flow of air, was off a ventilator three weeks after the surgery, and officials say he hasn't had breathing trouble since.\n\nWake Forest scientists, like their peers in Louisville, are working on organs. Officials at Wake Forest say their scientists were the first in the world to engineer a lab-grown organ, and they hope to scale up the process by printing organs with a custom printer. Institute scientists there have also designed a bioprinter to print skin cells onto burn wounds.\n\nSo far, Williams said he knows of no instance where a tissue or organ created through 3-D printing has been implanted in a human. But he said the race is on.\n\n\"I think this will have an incredible effect on trauma patients ... on the armed forces. You can imagine printing a jaw, printing muscle cells, printing the skin,\" he said. \"Ultimately I see it being used to print replacement kidneys, to print livers, and to print hearts — and all from your own cells.\"\n\nGRAPHIC:Click here to enlarge graphic above.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/05/29"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/958144/nobel-prize-awarded-for-click-chemistry-an-environmentally-friendly", "title": "Nobel prize awarded for 'click chemistry' – an environmentally ...", "text": "Mark Lorch, professor of Science Communication and Chemistry at the University of Hull explains the fascinating science behind the pioneering click chemistry approach which allows chemicals to be joined together almost as smoothly as clicking together two blocks of Lego.\n\nThe 2022 Nobel prize in chemistry has been awarded to a trio for developing click chemistry, an environmentally friendly method for rapidly joining molecules to develop cancer treatments, create materials and illuminate the workings of cells.\n\nCarolyn R.

Often these creations have caused environmental and medical problems, two obvious examples are plastic pollution and health problems associated with “forever chemicals”.\n\nSo today chemists are acutely aware of the need to consider the environment and ethical impact of their creations. This has driven scientists to carefully consider how to innovate in a green and sustainable way, while creating new compounds and materials to tackle the world’s challenges.\n\nBuilding new molecules is hard. It often requires a multitude of sequential individual reactions, each one hampered by side reactions that reduce the purity of the sample. This increases the number and complexity of any further reaction steps, while producing harmful waste that needs careful and expensive disposal.\n\nHow it happened\n\nA solution to this problem was conceived by Barry Sharpless at the turn of the millennium. He coined the term “click chemistry”. It’s a concept in which molecules are simply, quickly, reliably and repeatedly joined together in much the same way as a seatbelt clips into its buckle. The idea was the chemical equivalent of the flat-pack wardrobe, while everyone else was building furniture from scratch.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nSharpless also stipulated that click reactions should be carried out in water, instead of harmful solvents commonly used by synthetic chemists to dissolve their reactants. This was a fabulous concept as it would allow quick, reliable and environmentally friendly molecule creation for new products.\n\nBut the challenge was making the chemical belts and buckles. The first example of click chemistry was devised by Morten Meldal in 2008 while working on a well studied reaction between two chemicals; azides and alkynes. These are frequently used to join chemicals together, however they normally produce a mucky mess of reactants. But when copper was added to the mix, the reaction produced one, incredibly stable product.\n\nThe reaction became extremely popular as it allowed chemists to rapidly change the functionality of a chemical or material. A fibre could have the chemical buckle attached during manufacturing and later extra functionality could be added. The reaction made it easy to click in anti-bacterials, UV protective compounds, or substances that conduct electricity.\n\nIn 2004, Carolyn Bertozzi took click chemistry a step further by applying the principle to a biological problem. A common technique for studying the behaviour of molecules in a cell is to attach a fluorescent, glowing label which is clearly visible under a microscope. However, connecting the label to exactly the right part of the cell is tricky.\n\nBertozzi realised that click chemistry offered a solution. Unfortunately copper, used in Meldal’s original click chemistry method, is toxic to living things so it could not be directly applied to Bertozzi’s problem. Instead she came up with a technique that works without the copper. She attached the azide “buckle” to a sugar molecule. This gets absorbed to the cell, incorporated, and presented on the cell’s surface. A modified alkalyne (the clip) connected to a green fluoresent molecule then gets added to the cell where it clicks to the azide sugar. Then the cell can be easily tracked under a microscope.\n\nBertozzi’s technique has led to insights into how tumour cells evade our immune systems and helped develop methods to track cancerous cells. It has also helped to target radiotherapies directly to cancer cells, reducing the harm to nearby healthy cells.\n\nClick chemistry is elegant and efficient. It has allowed chemicals to be joined together almost as smoothly as clicking together two blocks of Lego. Its simplicity has seen its uses spread rapidly through the field of chemistry with applications in pharmaceuticals, DNA sequencing and materials with added functionality (such as magnetic and electrical). There is little doubt the applications of the technique will expand and be applied to the world’s most pressing issues.\n\nMark Lorch, Professor of Science Communication and Chemistry, University of Hull\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

It is one that most of us are conscious of and more and more businesses are making efforts toward eco-friendly packaging. There is increased use of cardboard, which is recyclable. Most of us try to reduce our waste through recycling. But as we buy more things online and have a growing variety of things delivered to our homes, it is a struggle to receive the things we order in good condition and not end up with piles of packaging materials.\n\nPlastic packaging is the poster child of a problem substance. Enormous quantities of it end up in the world’s oceans. But this year, the prestigious Lexus Design Award was won with a new packaging material called Agar Plasticity.\n\nThe material is a mold-able plastic-like material made from agar, a jelly-like substance found in many kinds of marine algae. The winning team used red seaweed as the source of the agar and that is an abundant and easily collected material. Not only is Agar Plasticity biodegradable and sustainable, it also dissolves in boiling water leaving no residue. Any packaging made from Agar Plasticity would be completely environmentally friendly.\n\nThe team of Japanese designers believes that agar-based materials can completely replace plastic products such as shopping bags, packing materials, and more. Whereas ordinary plastic cannot be recycled indefinitely and only decomposes over very long time span, the new material would just dissolve away.\n\nIt would be wonderfully fitting if we could solve the problem of oceans full of non-degrading plastic junk by replacing the source of the material with an abundant substance taken from the ocean.\n\nNeed a break?

When it killed the turkeys, the people who had put all the money into the research wanted a payback ... so they added the yellow coloring and sold it to people to use in place of butter.\"\n\nIt claims that margarine has been around less than 100 years, and has numerous side effects including tripling the risk of coronary heart disease, increasing LDL cholesterol while lowering HDL cholesterol, increasing the risk of cancers up to five times, increasing heart disease in women 53% more than butter, lowering the quality of breast milk, decreasing immune response and decreasing insulin response.\n\nThe post, which was originally made in 2017 but was recently viral, then makes the assertion that the reason for these negative health effects is because margarine is \"one molecule away from being plastic and shares 27 ingredients with paint.\"\n\nIf left outside, the post said \"no flies, not even those pesky fruit flies will go near it (that should tell you something) and it does not rot or smell differently because it has no nutritional value; nothing will grow on it. Even those teeny weeny microorganisms will not a find a home to grow. Why? Because it is nearly plastic. Would you melt your Tupperware and spread that on your toast?\"\n\nThe social media user who made the post, Trainer Thought to the Day, did not return a request for comment.\n\nWhat's the origin story of margarine?\n\nMargarine, invented 151 years ago by French chemist Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès, was invented for people, not turkeys.\n\nFrench Emperor Louis Napoleon III had offered a prize to anyone who could come up with a cheaper substitute for butter, looking for another option for his poorer subjects and to feed the Navy, according to a 2014 article in National Geographic looking at the history of margarine.\n\nMège-Mouriès found a way to make a spread from beef tallow. He then sold the patent to a Dutch butter-making company, that would become part of Unilever, a multinational company that is still one of the leading producers of margarine.\n\nThere is no evidence of it killing turkeys.\n\nNot all margarines are equal\n\nThere's a major caveat that needs to be addressed before getting too deep into the post's health claims: Not all kinds of margarine are the same recipe, and therefore they can have different health impacts.\n\nFrom Harvard Health Publishing, there's this take: \"Today the butter-versus-margarine issue is really a false one. From the standpoint of heart disease, butter remains on the list of foods to use sparingly mostly because it is high in saturated fat. Margarines, though, aren't so easy to classify. The older stick margarines turned out to be clearly worse for you than butter. Some of the newer margarines that are low in saturated fat, high in unsaturated fat, and free of trans fats are fine as long as you don't use too much (they are still rich in calories).\"\n\nMargarine and heart disease\n\nSo taking the first claim that \"margarine triples the risk of heart disease,\" a Mayo Clinic article answering the question of whether margarine or butter is better for your heart, says \"usually margarine\" because it's now made primarily of vegetable oils — we've evolved past beef tallow in most cases — but consumers need to check the labels.\n\n\"Not all margarines are created equal — some margarines contain trans fat. In general, the more solid the margarine, the more trans fat it contains. So stick margarines usually have more trans fat than tub margarines do,\" Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D. writes in the Mayo Clinic article. \"Trans fat, like saturated fat, increases blood cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease. In addition, trans fat lowers high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or 'good,' cholesterol levels. So skip the stick and opt for soft or liquid margarine instead.\"\n\nA 1993 study did link margarine to heart disease in women, however, the recipes for margarine and modern research advocated for eating less of both the saturated fats in butter and trans fats in margarine. And in 1997, a study was published in the New England Journal that found \"replacing only 2 percent of trans-fat calories (the kind found in packaged pastries) with unsaturated fat would reduce one’s risk of heart disease by 53 percent.\"\n\nMargarine and cholesterol\n\nFor the next claim of lowering good cholesterol (HDL) and raising bad cholesterols (LDL), as stated above, it's true that trans fats found in margarine can do that. But to the not-all-margarines-are-created-equal argument, some spreads — such as Benecol and Take Control — are listed by the Harvard Health Publishing as reducing bad cholesterols.\n\nA 2012 study in Norway found that trans fat in margarine are associated with an increased risk of lung, colon, rectum, breast, endometrium and prostate cancers. A 2008 study with 25,000 women participating also found links between trans fat and breast cancer.\n\nSimilarly, a study looking at women breastfeeding found that those with diets high in trans fat pass that on in their breast milk, lowering the quality; that trans fat does increase inflammation (particularly in the arteries) and a study shows that trans fat can lead to insulin resistance.\n\nIs margarine one molecule away from plastic?\n\nDebunking a similar claim, Utah State University took on this question, finding: \"On a chemical level, both butter and margarine are made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen molecules. Plastic does not have the oxygen molecules, only long chains of carbon and hydrogen. In reality, butter and margarine are much closer in chemical structure than plastic is to either of them.\"\n\nOr, as Encyclopedia.com puts it, \"Chemically speaking, yes, margarine is almost plastic because it has all of the same molecules as plastic, except for one. But that isn’t how organic compounds work. ... Since everything is made of molecules, the molecular structure of certain things may look similar. However, that doesn’t mean the end outcome is the same.\"\n\nOur ruling: Partly false\n\nWe find this claim to be PARTY FALSE, based on our research. It is not true that margarine was invented to fatten turkeys and kill them. It is true that trans fats do present a number of the health concerns stated in the post. But the post fails to take into context that not all margarines are created equal and some have considerably fewer trans fats now. And the claim that margarine is similar to plastic is missing the context that would make it meaningful.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

An alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors, HBBF, which produced the report, has a stated mission of reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals.\n\nREAD MORE: Manufacturers allowed baby food contaminated with heavy metals to remain on shelves, lawmakers say\n\nResearchers tested 288 foods bought at stores and farmers markets across the United States – including grains, fruits, vegetables, snacks, teething foods, and family items that babies eat, such as cereals and rice cakes – for lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. Those heavy metals are among the World Health Organization’s top 10 chemicals of concern for infants and children.\n\n“Toxic metal exposure can be harmful to the developing brain. It’s been linked with problems with learning, cognition, and behavior,” according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nResearchers also pored over data from 7,000 additional food tests reported in published studies and by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nResults showed 94% of manufactured baby foods, family foods and homemade purees made from purchased raw foods contained detectable amounts of one or more heavy metals.\n\nLead was found in 90% of manufactured baby food bought by shoppers for the report and 80% of store-bought family food and homemade purees. There is no safe level of lead, according to the AAP.\n\nArsenic was found in 68% store-bought baby food and 72% of family food either purchased or prepared at home. Cadmium was found in 65% of purchased baby food and 60% of family foods, and mercury was in 7% of store-bought baby food and 10% of family foods. (The highest levels of mercury are found in seafood, which was not tested in this analysis.)\n\nREAD MORE: 95% of tested baby foods in the US contain toxic metals, report says\n\nThe new report is a follow-up to a November 2019 report in which Healthy Babies, Bright Futures tested 168 foods purchased from major baby food manufacturers. That analysis found 95% of store-bought baby food contained lead, 73% contained arsenic, 75% contained cadmium and 32% contained mercury. One-fourth of the foods tested that year contained all four heavy metals.\n\n“After that report we saw so many people saying you can get around this problem by making your own baby food at home, so we decided to check,” Houlihan said. “We suspected we’d find heavy metals in all kinds of food because they’re ubiquitous contaminants in the environment.\n\n“And that is exactly what we found – heavy metals were in foods from every section of the store,” Houlihan said. “What this says is that as the FDA is setting standards for heavy metals in baby food, they need to go beyond the baby food aisle.”\n\nWhat’s a parent or caregiver to do? Feed baby with as many different types of foods as possible, said pediatrician Dr. Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“If you spread foods out, and offer a wide variety of options, you’ll have less toxicity,” Corkins said. “And nutritionally that’s always been the right thing to do to get the most micronutrients from the food you eat.”\n\nDoes buying organic help?\n\nThe report found buying organic didn’t lower heavy metal levels either, which was “not shocking or surprising,” said Corkins, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n“It’s the soil and water that’s contaminated with arsenic and other heavy metals, so it doesn’t matter if it’s organic or traditional farming methods,” Corkins said. That would apply to locally grown crops or even backyard gardens, if the soil had not been verified to be metal-free.\n\nHowever, buying organic can help avoid other toxins the new report did not consider, such as herbicides and pesticides, said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“There are other benefits to eating organic food, including a reduction in synthetic pesticides that are known to be as bad for babies, if not even more problematic,” Trasande said.\n\nREAD MORE: Doctors should test levels of PFAS in people at high risk, report says\n\n“We’ve seen multiple studies show significant effects of synthetic pesticides on cognitive function in children as a result of prenatal exposure. We’ve seen images of the brain where certain parts are smaller that are crucial for higher order functioning after exposure,” he added. “A simple step would simply be to say eat organic because regardless of anything we’re talking about in this report, it’s good for you.”\n\nExperts agree that battling toxins in baby foods is a job for government organizations who will need to work with growers, suppliers and manufacturers to institute regulations and safeguards. In the meantime, parents can make a difference.\n\n“Making even one simple choice every day to lower a child’s exposure will make a difference, whether that’s staying away from rice-based snacks and serving a diced apple instead or choosing not to serve carrots and sweet potatoes every day,” Houlihan said.\n\n“With heavy metals and other toxins the risks add up over a lifetime,” she added. “So even if some of these foods had been served to a child up to their second birthday, starting from there to lower exposure to toxins is going to add up. Every choice matters.”\n\nLeast contaminated foods\n\nTested foods with low metal content contain one-eighth as much heavy metal contamination as foods with the highest levels, Houlihan said. These are foods that can be “eaten freely,” the report suggested.\n\nFresh bananas, with heavy metal levels of 1.8 parts per billion, were the least contaminated of foods tested for the report. That’s an “82-fold difference in average level of total heavy metals” from the most contaminated food, rice cakes, which tested at 147 parts per billion, according to the investigation.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Consider chemical hazards’ in the baby foods you sell, FDA warns manufacturers\n\nAfter bananas, the least contaminated foods were grits, manufactured baby food meats, butternut squash, lamb, apples, pork, eggs, oranges and watermelon, in that order. Other foods with lower levels of contamination included green beans, peas, cucumbers, and soft or pureed home-cooked meats, the report found.\n\nInfant formula made with lead-free tap water was recommended. Tap water that has been tested and is free of lead is always a good choice. Milk is also a good choice, but only for babies 12 months and older.\n\nSome healthy lower-metal foods, such as yogurt, unsweetened applesauce, beans, cheese, hard-boiled eggs and grapes that have been cut lengthwise, were good choices for snacks for babies, according to the report.\n\nFresh and frozen fruit – including those used in homemade purees – were options as well. But don’t use canned fruits if you can avoid it: “Tests find lead 30 times more often in canned fruit than in fresh and frozen fruit,” the report stated.\n\nParents and caregivers can also lower their baby’s exposure to heavy metals by making some smart substitutions, the report said.\n\nUsing a frozen banana for a teething baby instead of a rice-based teething biscuit or rice rusk could lower total intake of heavy metals by 95%, according to the report. Another suggested teething aid: peeled and chilled cucumber spears.\n\nAvoid or limit these foods\n\nThe most heavily contaminated foods eaten by babies were all rice-based: “Rice cakes, rice puffs, crisped rice cereals and brown rice with no cooking water removed are heavily contaminated with inorganic arsenic, which is the more toxic form of arsenic,” Houlihan said.\n\nArsenic is a natural element found in soil, water and air, and because rice is grown in water, it is especially good at absorbing inorganic arsenic. (“Inorganic” is a chemical term and has nothing to do with the method of farming.) Brown and wild rice are the worst offenders, as the bran contains the highest arsenic concentrations.\n\nREAD MORE: New FDA limits on arsenic levels in infant rice cereals don’t adequately protect children, critics say\n\nPrior research has shown that even low levels of inorganic arsenic exposure can impact a baby’s neurodevelopment. A meta-analysis of studies on the topic found a 50% increase in arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4-point decrease in the IQ of children between the ages of 5 and 15.\n\nTesting by HBBF found rice cakes were the most contaminated with inorganic arsenic, followed by crisped rice cereal, rice-based puffs and brown rice. The report recommended those foods be avoided entirely, unless the brown rice is cooked with extra water that is poured off before consumption (much like pasta). It’s best to do that with all rice, including white and wild rice, the report said, as it can reduce arsenic levels by up to 60%.\n\nRice-based teething biscuits or rusks and white rice came next on the most contaminated list, the report said. White rice is milled to remove the outer layers, but experts say arsenic levels remain high enough to be concerning, especially if rice is a daily staple.\n\n“Inorganic arsenic averaged 100 parts per billion in brown rice infant cereal and 74 parts per billion in white rice infant cereal in our tests,” Houlihan said. “Baby food companies have taken brown rice cereal off the market because of its high arsenic levels.”\n\nREAD MORE: Water- and stain-resistant products contain toxic plastics, study says. Here’s what to do\n\nParents and caregivers can help by staying away from high-arsenic varieties of white rice grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, or simply “US” and instead choosing lower-arsenic basmati rice from California, India and Pakistan, as well as sushi rice from the US, the report said.\n\nServe these foods rarely\n\nAfter rice-based foods, the analysis found the highest levels of heavy metals in raisins, non-rice teething crackers, granola bars with raisins and oat-ring cereals. But those were not the only foods of concern: Dried fruit, grape juice, arrowroot teething crackers and sunflower seed butter all contained high amounts of at least one toxic metal, according to the report.\n\n“Many foods have a kind of unique, heavy metal profile,” Houlihan explained. “For example, we saw very high levels of cadmium in things like spinach, leaf lettuce and peanut butter.”\n\nHowever, the human body doesn’t absorb cadmium as easily as other heavy metals, and for that reason “it doesn’t have as high a level of concern,” Houlihan added.\n\n“There’s also not as much evidence that cadmium is neurotoxic to babies, or at least the body of evidence isn’t there at the same levels as lead and arsenic,” she said. “Lead and arsenic damage isn’t reversible – these are permanent impacts on IQ, learning ability and behavior, so it’s a big deal.”\n\nRoot and tuber vegetables may have higher levels of heavy metals like lead and arsenic because they grow underground. In fact, the investigation found that nutritious baby favorites like carrots, sweet potatoes, squash and many types of potatoes did have concerning levels of heavy metals.\n\nREAD MORE: Dangerous chemicals found in food wrappers at major fast-food restaurants and grocery chains, report says\n\nEven the same food could have varying levels of toxic metals, according to the report. For example, a shopper in Raleigh, North Carolina, bought a sweet potato with 60.7 parts per billion of lead – 10 times more than the store-bought sweet potato puree she purchased. A Chicago shopper purchased a fresh carrot with eight times more arsenic than the premade carrot baby food she took home, the investigation found.\n\nYet shoppers in Tennessee and California found the opposite – their fresh produce had minimal levels of heavy metals compared with the manufactured baby food brands they bought.\n\n“As a parent, you don’t know what you’re picking up out of the produce bin,” Houlihan said. “Is it elevated because of the cultivar – the particular type of sweet potato or carrot? Or is it elevated because it’s grown in an area where the soil has naturally high levels of lead?\n\nAnswering these questions will be the responsibility of government regulators and industry, Houlihan said. The FDA has a Closer to Zero campaign, for example, which could take on the issue.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FDA for comment but hasn’t yet received a response.\n\n“And remember, if you’re protecting the basic ingredients that parents are using to make food at home, you’re not only protecting babies and toddlers, you’re protecting pregnant women as well. Babies in utero are particularly vulnerable to toxins while the brain is growing at such a rapid pace.”\n\nWith no way of knowing levels of toxic metals in the soil where produce is grown, parents and caregivers need to add one more step to their efforts to avoid these substances, Houlihan suggested. In addition to mixing up the variety of foods and not serving the same options each day, parents can “choose different brands or varieties of foods or shop in different stores from week to week to avoid choosing a high-metal source regularly.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}]}

The \"No King\" rallies planned for June 14 will take place in nearly 2,000 communities across the nation to oppose what organizers describe as \"corrupt, authoritarian politics.\"\n\nAhead of the demonstrations, the governors of Kentucky and Texas signed executive orders deploying National Guard troops across their respective states. In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams on Friday said thousands of officers will be out in full force to ensure protests are kept safe and nonviolent. Meanwhile, in Florida, a local sheriff speaking at a news conference gave a stark warning to people who may attack law enforcement: \"We will kill you.\"\n\nLAPD arrest nearly 50 people during protests Thursday night\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department arrested 49 people during demonstrations on Thursday, June 12, that saw officers fire non-lethal munitions and enforce a curfew in a section of downtown.\n\nMost of the arrests were for failure to disperse or curfew violations, the department said in a post on X. Three people faced more serious charges, including robbery, resisting a police officer and pointing a laser at an airship.\n\nHundreds of people have been arrested at protests across California since unrest over immigration raids broke out on Friday, June 6.\n\n4 detainees escape New Jersey migrant facility Delaney Hall\n\nAuthorities are searching for at least four people who escaped the Delaney Hall migrant facility in New Jersey where complaints over conditions fueled several days of unrest that erupted on Thursday, June 12.\n\n\"DHS has become aware of 4 detainees at the privately held Delaney Hall Detention Facility escaping,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY. \"Additional law enforcement partners have been brought in to find these escapees and a BOLO (be on the lookout bulletin) has been disseminated.\"\n\nSeveral immigration rights groups said detainees protested over insufficient food and other poor conditions at the facility. Unrest fueled a large law enforcement response on Thursday, and groups said there were reports of agents deploying tear gas and pepper spray.\n\nMissouri joins Texas, deploys National Guard ahead of 'No Kings' protests\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed an executive order activating the National Guard \"as a precautionary measure in reaction to recent instances of civil unrest across the country.\"\n\nThe move makes Kehoe the second governor to take such a step after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott earlier this week deployed National Guard troops across the state ahead of planned protests against immigration enforcement and what organizers see as Trump's power grab.\n\nBoth Republican-led states have already seen protests this week. A demonstration in Austin, Texas, began peacefully before devolving into violent clashes between police and demonstrators, ending with 13 arrests and multiple injuries to law enforcement. In St. Louis, dozens of protesters rallied peacefully on an overpass, calling for a stop to immigration raids.\n\nAmericans split over Trump's military deployment in LA protests: poll\n\nAmericans are divided on Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles in reaction to protests over his administration's immigration enforcement, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll has found.\n\nSome 48% of respondents agreed with a statement that the president should \"deploy the military to bring order to the streets\" when protests turn violent, while 41% disagreed. Republicans overwhelmingly backed the idea of calling in troops while Democrats were firmly opposed.\n\nMeanwhile, just 35% of respondents said they approved of Trump's response to the protests in Los Angeles. Some 50% of people in the poll said they disapproved of Trump's response.\n\n– Reuters\n\nLatino groups blast forced removal of US senator from Noem event\n\nThe League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and other national Latino organizations condemned the forceful removal of Democratic U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s news conference in Los Angeles on Thursday. LULAC, which is the oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization in the United States, has demanded an immediate investigation into the incident.\n\nVideos showed Padilla being forced to the ground and handcuffed after trying to ask a question during the news conference, where Noem was discussing the protests over federal immigration raids. In a video statement released Thursday night, Padilla said he had been escorted to the news conference by a National Guardsman and an FBI agent after waiting for another scheduled briefing.\n\n\"Now, I'm OK for people who are wondering how I'm doing,\" Padilla, who is from California, added. \"But the big lesson here is if they can do that to me ... what are they doing to a lot of the folks that are out there when the cameras are not on?\"\n\nIn a statement on X, Noem said she met with Padilla for 15 minutes after his removal from the news conference and added that the pair exchanged phone numbers and intend to speak further. \"I wish he would’ve acted that way in the beginning rather than creating a scene,\" she said.\n\nWalmart heiress promotes anti-Trump 'No Kings' protests in ad\n\nBillionaire Walmart heiress Christy Walton took out a full-page advertisement in the New York Times urging people to join nationwide protests against the Trump administration on Saturday, June 14, drawing swift condemnation from Trump supporters.\n\nThe advertisement, which ran on Sunday, encourages readers to take to the streets as part of the some 2,000 demonstrations planned across the country. The “No Kings Day” protests are expected to be the largest demonstrations against Trump since he took office, and also coincide with Trump’s military parade in Washington.\n\nWalmart sought to distance itself from the advertisement placed by one of the richest women in America. “The advertisements from Christy Walton are in no way connected to or endorsed by Walmart,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nUnrest at Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey, draws law enforcement response\n\nAn immigration detention facility in New Jersey, where at least two officials were arrested last month, became the site of unrest on Thursday, June 12, triggering a large law enforcement response.\n\nSeveral immigration rights groups said detainees protested over insufficient food and other poor conditions at Delaney Hall, the first immigrant detention center to open during President Donald Trump's second term. Regarding the law enforcement response, groups said there were reports of agents deploying tear gas and pepper spray.\n\nOfficials have not provided details about the incident. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a critic of the facility who was arrested in front of it on May 9, said in a statement that he is concerned about reports of what has happened at the Delaney Hall “from withholding food and poor treatment, to uprising and escaped detainees.”\n\n“This entire situation lacks sufficient oversight of every basic detail — including local zoning laws and fundamental constitutional rights,” he said on X. “We must put an end to this chaos and not allow this operation to continue unchecked.\"\n\n10 arrested in Portland as protests spread nationwide\n\nA week after protests began in Los Angeles, more anti-ICE demonstrations have sprung up in cities nationwide in solidarity with LA protesters. Protests have been reported in San Francisco, New York, Washington, Boston, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta and many more.\n\nIn Portland, authorities said overnight that 10 people were arrested for their alleged behavior during a protest outside an ICE facility the evening of June 12. The 10 arrested ranged in ages from 19 to 33 and were booked on charges that included arson, disorderly conduct and assault on an officer.\n\nTwo officers had minor injuries, the Portland Police Bureau said.\n\nWhat have courts said about federalization of the National Guard?\n\nIn its order temporarily allowing Trump to maintain his control over the National Guard, the appeals court did not issue a final ruling but delivered what's called an \"administrative stay.\" It gave the appeals judges time to consider Trump's request to block Breyer's order. The appeals court was made up of a panel of three judges, two of which were appointed by Trump and one by former President Joe Biden.\n\nA hearing was scheduled for the appeals court on Tuesday, June 17 at noon.\n\nBreyer, the federal judge who ruled Trump's deployment of the Guard was unlawful, issued just hours before the appeals court ruling a 36-page decision in which he said the president's actions were illegal and a violation of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution. Breyer was appointed in 1997 by former Democratic President Bill Clinton and is the brother of retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.\n\nBreyer wrote he was \"troubled by the implication inherent in Defendants’ argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion,\" responding to the Trump administration's justification for sending in the National Guard.\n\n\"(T)here can be no debate that most protesters demonstrated peacefully,\" the judge said.\n\nCurfew for parts of downtown Los Angeles\n\nFollowing days of protests in Los Angeles, which were mostly confined to parts of the city's downtown area, a partial curfew remained in effect for the third consecutive night. The curfew, lasting from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. PT for pockets of downtown Los Angeles, was implemented on Tuesday.\n\n“My hope is after continuing it a few more days, that people will get the message that we are serious,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said at a Thursday news conference.\n\nShortly before the curfew went into effect on Thursday night, the Los Angeles Police Department’s Central Division reported people in a crowd throwing bricks, concrete, and commercial-grade fireworks.\n\n\"Less lethal munitions have been authorized,\" LAPD said in a post on X at about 7:55 p.m. local time.\n\nPlanned 'No Kings' protests for June 14 grow\n\n\"No Kings\" Day organizers say it is more important than ever to have a \"national day of peaceful protest\" on June 14, following the decision by Trump to send 700 Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles.\n\n\"I think we will see the largest peaceful single day protests that this country has seen certainly since the first Trump term,\" said Indivisible cofounder Ezra Levin, one of the organizers.\n\nNow, about 2,000 protests and rallies named \"No Kings\" Day are planned to oppose what they see as Trump's power grab, nearly double that of the April 5 \"Hands Off\" protest that saw millions of Americans turn out in big and small cities nationwide. Organizers expect millions of Americans to turn out across the country on June 14.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/12/ice-immigration-protests-live-updates/84157140007/", "title": "Court blocks ruling requiring Trump to return control of National Guard", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects news on the growing protests against ICE raids and President Donald Trump's immigration policies from Thursday, June 12. For the latest news on the immigration protests and court rulings, follow USA TODAY's live updates for Friday, June 13.\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday temporarily halted a federal judge's order that blocked President Donald Trump's mobilization of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles and required him to return control of troops to California.\n\nThe ruling came just hours after U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer issued a temporary restraining order finding that Trump's deployment of 4,000 Guard members was unlawful. The court said it would hold a remote hearing on the matter on June 17.\n\nThe decision does not mean that the court will ultimately agree with Trump, but it means he will maintain command of the National Guard for now.\n\nThe ruling came amid rising tensions between Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom over federal military intervention in the state. Newsom had filed a motion for a temporary restraining order that would limit the activities of Guard members and 700 Marines to protecting federal buildings in a small area of downtown where most protests against federal immigration raids have taken place.\n\nBreyer's order, which was to take effect at noon PT on Friday, did not include a ruling on the deployment of the Marines. Breyer wrote in the ruling that the presence of Guard troops \"seemed to only inflame\" and worsen tensions with protesters.\n\n\"His actions were illegal – both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith,\" Breyer wrote in his 36-page ruling.\n\nIn a news conference following the ruling, Newsom said he was \"gratified by the order.\" The governor added that troops would be redeployed to their previous duties, such as border security, drug enforcement, and vegetation and forest management.\n\n“Today was really about a test of democracy and today we passed the test — we the people passed the test,” Newsom said.\n\nCalifornia AG says federal judge's ruling is an 'early success'\n\nDuring a virtual news conference on Thursday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta called the temporary restraining order an \"early success,\" but noted that \"it’s far from the end of the road.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has filed a notice of appeal and requested the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to block Breyer’s ruling.\n\nThe next hearing with Breyer in the case is scheduled for 10 a.m. PT on June 20. According to the ruling, the Trump administration must \"show cause\" for why Breyer should not issue a preliminary injunction.\n\nNewsom: Judge waiting for evidence of Marines’ deployment\n\nNewsom said he believed Breyer is waiting for evidence that the Marines have \"actually been deployed\" to Los Angeles.\n\n\"They appear not to be,\" Newsom said at Thursday’s news conference. \"They’re not coordinating with anybody on this, so he’s just waiting for that evidence.\"\n\nThe governor added that the Marines have been moved to another location for training exercises and have not been deployed to the city. The military previously said about 700 Marines will be on the streets of Los Angeles by Thursday or Friday.\n\nNewsom also criticized the Trump administration's actions, including intensifying immigration raids and the forceful removal of Democratic U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla at a news conference in Los Angeles earlier on Thursday.\n\n“The notion that the United States active duty Marines, these heroes, would be used to militarize the streets of an American city is an abomination,” Newsom said. \"The Founding Fathers did not live and die to see that happen in this country for no reason whatsoever other than vanity theater to instill fear, to incite a response.\"\n\nHegseth won't say he'll respect ruling on LA deployment\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth declined to say Thursday whether he would respect any court's ruling if it put major limitations on Guard troops and Marines deploying in Los Angeles.\n\nThe military's mission in recent days has been expanded to include the protection of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers conducting the raids prompted by Trump's directive to find immigrants living in the United States without legal status. The sweeps prompted days of protests, and demonstrations and rallies have spread across the nation.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-California, asked Hegseth at a congressional hearing Thursday to \"assure the American people\" he would respect any ruling from the Supreme Court or district courts of sending the military to crack down on protests against Trump's immigration enforcement sweeps.\n\n\"We should not have local judges determining foreign policy or national security policy for the country,\" Hegseth responded.\n\n\"You're not willing to say you would respect those decisions?\" Khanna asked.\n\n\"What I'm saying is local district judges shouldn't make foreign policy for the United States,\" Hegseth shot back.\n\nSen. Padilla removed from Homeland Security Secretary’s news conference\n\nPadilla was forcibly removed from a news conference put on by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles amid mass protests over the administration’s immigration crackdown. As Padilla started asking Noem a question, he was grabbed by security guards.\n\n“I am Senator Alex Padilla, I have questions for the secretary,” Padilla said as he was hauled from the room where Noem was speaking.\n\nAfter being dragged away, the senator was pushed to the ground and handcuffed. Noem said during the news conference that she doesn’t know Padilla and that he hadn’t requested a meeting with her.\n\n“So when I leave here I’ll have a conversation with him and visit and find out really what his concerns were,” she said. “I think everybody in America would agree that wasn’t appropriate.”\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\n'Unhinged': Democrats furious Padilla was hauled out of Noem briefing\n\nWASHINGTON – The fury radiating off of Congressional Democrats is palpable.\n\nHours after Padilla, the senior U.S. senator in California, was forcibly removed from a press briefing with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, House Democrats roamed the Capitol seeking an audience with GOP leadership. Meanwhile, their Senate counterparts gave floor speech after floor speech, condemning the action as an \"abuse of power\" and \"assault.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson called Padilla's actions \"wildly inappropriate\" and alleged he rushed at the secretary. House Democrats shouted over him, saying, \"That's a lie!\"\n\n\"Anybody that looks at that video will understand that this amounts to an assault, a felony,\" said Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-New York, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. \"The White House is unhinged and out of control.\"\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, a string of Democratic senators delivered floor speeches hammering the indignity of the episode.\n\n“I saw this happen to my colleague, and I am shocked by how far we have descended in the first 140 days of this administration . . . What is the becoming of our democracy? Are there no limits to what this administration will do?” said New Jersey Democrat Sen. Andy Kim on the Senate floor.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi and Riley Beggin\n\nTrump, Newsom joust ahead of crucial court hearing\n\nIn an interview released Thursday with \"The Daily,\" a New York Times podcast, Newsom slammed President Donald Trump and called the decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles \"theatre\" and \"unconstitutional.\"\n\nNewsom said local police are protecting the deployed National Guard troops while also handling the protests − \"just think about how perverse that is.\"\n\nTrump, in a Truth Social post Thursday, said the city was \"safe and sound\" thanks in part to the Guard.\n\n\"Our great National Guard, with a little help from the Marines, put the L.A. Police in a position to effectively do their job,\" Trump wrote Thursday. \"They all worked well together, but without the Military, Los Angeles would be a crime scene like we haven’t seen in years.\"\n\nThe LAPD did report incidents of unrest the last two nights, and arrests were made. Demonstrators late Wednesday threw \"commercial-grade fireworks and rocks\" at officers, police said.\n\nNewsom, who has repeatedly decried the military intervention as an illegal waste of resources that provoked unrest, ultimately wants the National Guard returned to state control and Trump's actions declared illegal.\n\n\"Governor Gaven NewScum had totally lost control of the situation,\" Trump wrote Thursday, mocking the governor. \"He should be saying THANK YOU for saving his ass, instead of trying to justify his mistakes and incompetence!!!\"\n\nNewsom shrugged off the recurring \"NewScum\" reference, telling \"The Daily\" it was \"what I think a seventh grader used to call me.\"\n\nHundreds arrested in LA protests as Hegseth hints at more deployments: Updates\n\nMarine share photos of training on Instagram\n\nThe U.S. Marines deploying to Los Angeles are sharing photos of their training on Instagram.\n\nPhotos shared on the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment’s page 2ndbn7thmarhistory show Marines training with riot shields and wearing what appear to be baseball catcher’s leg guards.\n\n“U.S. Marines with 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, attached to Task Force 51, rehearse non-lethal tactics in Los Angeles, June 11, 2025,” the caption reads. “U.S. Northern Command is supporting federal agencies by providing military forces to protect federal functions, personnel, and property in the greater Los Angeles area.”\n\nNorthern Command which directs the Marines said in an update Thursday that the troops \"are conducting mission orientation and familiarization today.\"\n\nTrump vows to protect farm, hotel workers in raids\n\nTrump said he plans to make changes to his administration's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration to protect migrant farmers, hotel workers and others in the leisure industry who have been among those deported. Trump promised the changes in a Truth Social post that acknowledged ICE officers have not only targeted violent criminals, who Trump officials have said are the primary focus of raids and deportations.\n\n\"Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\" Trump wrote on the social media platform he owns.

A similar situation unfolded in Tucson, Arizona, where law enforcement deployed tear gas and took several protesters into custody.\n\nThis week, hundreds of people have been arrested during protests across the country, including in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Las Vegas, New York, Chicago, and Austin, Texas.\n\nTucson protest sees multiple arrests, tear gas\n\nIn Tucson, Arizona, a group of about 300 protesters marched to the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, where the rally grew tense and erupted into clashes and arrests on June 11.\n\nSome of the protesters threw paint balls and water bottles at the office’s security guards, who responded with flash bangs and pepper spray. Soon after, protesters blocked a nearby road, onlookers said. Police in riot gear arrived to disperse them and three people were taken into custody.\n\nChristina Benitez, a local teacher and Mexican American, was at the protest with her friend. They held signs reading “ICE out of our city” and “Defend the Constitution.\"\n\n“There is no excuse to quash the public with ICE and the Marines and the National Guard,” she told the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network. “That is contrary to everything our nation was founded upon, the right of assembly.”\n\n– Sarah Lapidus, Arizona Republic\n\nProtesters in Detroit rally against immigration enforcement\n\nA small but vocal group of demonstrators rallied Wednesday, June 11, outside the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office in Detroit to oppose ongoing immigration raids and deportations.\n\nAccording to activists, five or six individuals – most of them believed to be Venezuelan – were detained after their immigration cases were dismissed in court.\n\n\"That's happening more and more. Regardless of the outcome, people have been snatched up straight out of court – and we've known people that this has happened to,\" Kate Stenvig, a local organizer, told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nNicole Conaway, a Detroit resident and local activist, believes what’s at stake goes beyond immigration policy. “If Trump can win this battle, then we're further down the road to fascism and him being a dictator,” she said.\n\n– Nour Rahal, Detroit Free Press\n\nSpokane mayor declared state of emergency amid anti-ICE protest\n\nPolice in Spokane, Washington, arrested more than 30 people and the mayor issued a state of emergency after a protest against immigration enforcement on June 11 escalated.\n\nThe protest formed after organizers heard two Venezuelan men were detained at a local U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, where one of them was slated to a check-in after he had applied for asylum, reported KREM2.\n\nProtesters tried to block the truck that was supposedly meant to take the men to an ICE facility in Tacoma, local outlets reported. The crowd outside the ICE field office began to swell and local law enforcement declared it an unlawful assembly. Officers deployed tear gas and fired pepper balls into the crowd before it dispersed.\n\nSpokane Mayor Lisa Brown declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew for a section of the downtown area from 9:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. At a news conference, Kevin Hall, chief of the Spokane Police Department, said over 30 protesters were arrested.\n\nAnti-ICE protesters rally outside NBA Finals game\n\nThe roar of cheers and chants could be heard outside Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis just before Game 3 of the NBA Finals, but it wasn't the sound of basketball fans. It was people gathered to protest ICE raids in Indiana.\n\nThe crowd swelled to more than a thousand people before it broke up, organizers said, although Indianapolis police put the count at around 500. The protest was prompted by rumors online that ICE raids had taken place in the nearby city of Lawrence. Local police said it wasn't aware of any U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions there.\n\nThe demonstration remained nonviolent, and one speaker reminded demonstrators not to antagonize the police. Protesters held signs reading \"ICE out of Indy now\" and \"Power to the workers not the billionaires.\" Some basketball fans on their way to the game responded to the protesters with chants of \"USA.\"\n\nResident Jaqueline Montez, 30, said it was important to her to protest now rather than wait for planned \"No Kings Day\" protests downtown and nationwide on June 14. “We’re being seen by the rest of the world,” Montez told the Indianapolis Star, part of the USA TODAY Network. “We’re being noticed today.”\n\n– Jade Jackson, Noe Padilla, and Matthew Cupelli, Indianapolis Star\n\nNewsom takes shot at defense secretary on social media\n\nNewsom posted a photo on X of National Guard troops sleeping on the floor and another image, posted by the official Defense Department's Rapid Response account, of a baseball game.\n\n\"Pete sent 4,700 troops here (when they weren’t needed) without adequate fuel, food, water or a place to sleep. But don’t worry, he’s at a baseball game,\" Newsom wrote.\n\nRapid Response quickly responded on X, posting a photo of a protester waving a Mexican flag as a fire burns. The post says: \"Weren't needed.\"\n\nThe military's Northern Command said in a statement Wednesday that the military has contracted for billeting, latrines, showers, food and laundry services and other items and services for the troops. The statement added that \"while awaiting fulfillment of the contract, soldiers and Marines have adequate shelter, food, and water.\"\n\nSome former military leaders siding with Newsom\n\nFormer secretaries of the Army and Navy, three retired admirals and two retired generals banded together to file an amicus brief in the Trump-Newsom litigation citing what they describe as \"critical national security risks\" inherent in Trump's deployment of military forces in Los Angeles.\n\nAmicus briefs are filed by people or organizations not directly involved in litigation but who take a position in the case. The group includes former Army Secretary Louis Caldera, a Democrat, and former Navy Secretary Sean O’Keefe, a Republican.\n\nThe brief says deploying the military for domestic law enforcement diverts them from their primary mission of national security and disaster response, that National Guard personnel and active duty Marines are not properly trained for such law enforcement operations, and that such a use of the military should be a \"last resort to avoid the politicization of the military, which inevitably erodes public trust, impacts recruitment, and undermines troop morale.\"\n\n'He's lost it': Newsom slams Trump's mental acuity, echoing president's criticism of Biden\n\nPolice say protesters throw fireworks, rocks at officers\n\nA one-square-mile of downtown Los Angeles remained under a curfew Thursday after days of demonstrations led to hundreds of arrests. The unrest continued Wednesday night, when police said demonstrators at one location threw \"commercial-grade fireworks and rocks\" at officers, resulting in a number of arrests.\n\nThe protests broke out on June 6 in response to ongoing ICE raids that have sparked fear among immigrant communities. While many protests have been relatively peaceful, some have turned into scenes of chaos as police fired \"less lethal\" munitions such as tear gas and flash-bangs to disperse crowds.\n\nWalz, Hochul, Pritzker to criticize immigration enforcement in House hearing\n\nHundreds of protests planned for June 14\n\nProtests are planned for 1,800 communities across the country on June 14, the same day Trump holds a military parade in Washington, D.C.

By that evening, more than 100 people gathered at a downtown Los Angeles federal detention center where some immigrants had been held, and demonstrations continued through Saturday and into Sunday, June 8, reaching nearby neighborhoods of Paramount and Compton.\n\nNational Guard troops, deployed by President Donald Trump, arrived in downtown Los Angeles Sunday, June 8. It's not the first time a president has exercised their control over the Guard to respond to protests and demonstrations − here's a look at when prior administrations deployed the force in cases of civil unrest and crisis.\n\nWhat is the National Guard?\n\nUnlike other branches of the military, the National Guard can be deployed by both states and the federal government, and members serve simultaneously in their state National Guards and in either the Army or Air National Guard of the U.S.\n\nNational Guard members can be deployed by the governors of their resident states and by the president of the U.S. Statewide mobilizations often are to support communities during and after natural disasters and amid protests, the Guard website says, and have recently been used to respond to the pandemic and to border security.\n\nThe president can deploy the guard to serve missions overseas, which the Council on Foreign Relations says has happened more frequently in recent years, pointing to deployments to Afghanistan, Iraq, Poland, and the Horn of Africa.\n\nWhat is the Insurrection Act? Here's what Trump has said about invoking it amid LA protests\n\nWhen have presidents called in the National Guard amid protests?\n\nWhile presidents have called on the National Guard dozens of times since the nation's inception to respond to \"civil unrest,\" it wasn't until 1967 that presidents federalized the Guard to further assist law enforcement agencies responding to protests and demonstrations.\n\nThe earliest instances of presidents sending the Guard in to quell civil unrest are in 1794 and 1799, when Presidents George Washington and John Adams called upon state militia and volunteer units to suppress the Whiskey Insurrection and Fries’ Rebellion, according to a 2020 report by the National Guard Bureau.\n\nPresidents avoided calling upon the militia in response to civil disturbances for most of the 19th century, the Bureau said, with state militias quelling \"labor riots and slave revolts\" most of the time. Following the Civil War, the modern National Guard says it played active roles in \"quelling the race riots and labor strikes throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries,\" and for 90 years between the beginning of Reconstruction and the early years of the Civil Rights era, no president federalized the force for civil disturbance operations.\n\nThe Civil Rights movement marked the beginning of a more present federalized Guard in instances of unrest like protests, demonstrations and riots. Throughout this period, Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson federalized the National Guard “to enforce the expansion of civil rights and to ensure public order,” the National Guard Bureau said.\n\nThe Guard was involved in many of the most pivotal Civil Rights-era events, such as the school desegregations and ensuing violence in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957, the University of Mississippi in 1962, and at the University of Alabama in 1963. The Alabama National Guard was also called into federal service for the Selma-Montgomery March in 1965, the National Guard Bureau said.\n\nNational Guard members were also called in during the “Detroit Rebellion” of 1967, and to respond to the protests and violence that followed Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in 1968.\n\nAfter Trump's deployment of the National Guard on Sunday, June 8, the two most recent times a president federalized the National Guard for civil disturbance operations were approximately 55 and 33 years ago, respectively.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon deployed the force in 1970 in response to the Postal Strike that was the first and largest walkout ever against the federal government. Most recently, President George H.W. Bush in 1992 called on Guard members to respond to the 1992 Rodney King riots, which broke out after the acquittal of the Los Angeles Police Department officers who beat Black motorist Rodney King. The unrest left 60 people dead and 2,300 injured, according to the Bill of Rights Institute, and thousands of members of the Guard, the U.S. Army and the Marine Corps were deployed in the city.\n\nNational Guard deployments in LA: A brief history\n\nThe National Guard has been deployed to Los Angeles several times in response to civil disorder and natural disasters, at the request of state and local officials. The Guard is an especially familiar force with large swaths of the state that have experienced historic wildfires over the past decades, greater Los Angeles included.\n\nIn 1965, nearly 14,000 Guard troops were sent to Los Angeles amid the Watts protests at the request of the California lieutenant governor, according to Stanford University’s Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute.\n\nIn 1992, former President George H.W. Bush ordered National Guards to respond to the Rodney King protests in Los Angeles, which left left more than 60 people dead and 2,300 injured, according to the Bill of Rights Institute. It was the last time the Insurrection Act was invoked by a president.\n\nIn 1994, the Guard was sent to assist with the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake. The magnitude 6.7 earthquake caused billions in damages primarily in the San Fernando Valley, 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, and killed at least 57 people.\n\nIt is the first time in decades a president has moved to deploy troops in such a manner without a governor’s consent or explicit invitation, Reuters reported, and the move has prompted California Gov. Gavin Newsom to say he plans to sue the administration over the deployment.\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY; Reuters.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

For the latest news on the LA protests, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Wednesday, June 11.\n\nLOS ANGELES − Mayor Karen Bass issued a curfew for parts of downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday following intense days of protests over immigration enforcement raids that have left crews to clean up the wreckage and seen thousands of National Guard troops sent to the city.\n\nIn a news conference, Bass said the curfew will run from 8 p.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. Wednesday, in an effort to curb ongoing vandalism and looting in downtown Los Angeles. Bass announced the curfew while many people in the city were out marching through the streets and protesting against the ICE raids.\n\nThe curfew was announced to \"stop bad actors who are taking advantage of the President's chaotic escalation,\" Bass asserted in a social media post. \"Law enforcement will arrest individuals who break the curfew, and you will be prosecuted.\"Nights of volatile protests have prompted a legal and social media standoff between California leaders and the Trump administration. The conflict centers on Trump's move to deploy Marines and the National Guard in California in response to protests that have sprung up against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit against Trump for deploying federal troops in the city. Newsom has also accused Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth of trying to use the assets to help ICE conduct raids. A judge set a hearing for the matter for Thursday.\n\nNewsom’s efforts to block federal incursion in California come after Trump doubled the National Guard presence in Los Angeles to 4,000 and deployed 700 Marines, an escalation estimated to cost about $134 million, according to a Pentagon official. Trump remained all-in on his decisions, posting on Truth Social that \"if we didn't send out the National Guard—Los Angeles would be burning right now!\"\n\nSince Friday, officers have had confrontations with protesters, leading to the use of pepper spray and flash bangs as officials announced more than 150 arrests amid flare-ups of vandalism and violence. Bass on Tuesday said damage was limited to a small area downtown, but noted that the graffiti was \"extensive\" and required a large response as the city prepares to host the 2026 World Cup.\n\nWhat to know about the curfew?\n\nThe curfew issued by Bass covers a one-square-mile area of downtown Los Angeles and will last from 8 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday local time. The mayor said she expected the curfew to last for several days.\n\nBass announced the curfew while people were marching through the streets, where protests had turned into vandalism and looting earlier in the week. Police have made over 150 arrests in response to the protests, including over 100 the night before the curfew was announced.\n\nIn a statement about the protests Monday night, Los Angeles police said that \"as demonstrators were being disbursed, agitators and miscreants within the crowd looted businesses and vandalized property.\"\n\nCalifornia officials have said that Trump’s move to send federal troops to the city has only exacerbated tensions and prompted more unrest.\n\nNewsom on Trump: 'Rule of law has increasingly given way to rule of Don'\n\nNewsom delivered a fiery speech Tuesday night, sharing details about what sparked the protests in California's biggest city and what the president’s reaction says about the state of the nation.\n\n\"This situation was winding down and concentrated in just a few square blocks downtown, but that's not what Donald Trump wanted,\" Newsom said. \"He chose escalation, he chose more force, he chose theatrics over public safety.\"\n\nNewsom said Trump did not consult with California law enforcement leaders and commandeered National Guard troops to Los Angeles streets \"illegally and for no reason.\"\n\n\"This brazen abuse of power by a sitting president inflamed a combustible situation,\" Newsom explained.\n\nNewsom said the protests were sparked by unprecedented immigration enforcement raids that saw federal agents \"jumping out of unmarked vans\" outside Home Depot to detain people. The governor added that a \"U.S. citizen nine months pregnant was arrested, a four-year-old girl taken, families separated, friends quite literally disappearing.\"\n\nTrump has said his immigration policy is meant to root out criminals and people illegally in the country, adding that deploying federal troops to Los Angeles was necessary to protect federal buildings from vandalism and keep the peace.\n\n\"California may be first, but it clearly will not end here, other states are next, democracy is next,\" Newsom said. \"This moment we have feared has arrived. The rule of law has increasingly given way to the rule of Don.\"\n\nProtesters take to the streets of Chicago, other US cities\n\nCHICAGO — Hundreds of people gathered in the city’s iconic Loop neighborhood on Tuesday to protest ICE and the immigration enforcement raids that sparked widespread demonstrations in Los Angeles.\n\nMarchers gathered at Daley Plaza near the federal courthouse, marched under the tracks of the El train and down Michigan Avenue.\n\nDemonstrators carried Mexican flags, signs reading “none of us are free unless all of us are free” and chanted a slogan in Spanish insulting immigration authorities.\n\nProtesters marched through Chicago at the same time that people took to the streets in Los Angeles.\n\nWatch the protests here.\n\n--Contributing: Reuters\n\nJudge balks at Newsom request to limit Trump use of National Guard\n\nJudge Charles Breyer balked at Newsom's request to block the Trump administration's use of the National Guard and Marines on Tuesday. Instead, Breyer ordered a briefing on Wednesday and a hearing on Thursday.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Trump administration called Newsom's motion for an emergency temporary restraining order \"legally meritless,\" in pursuit of \"an extraordinary, unprecedented, and dangerous court order,\" and claimed the court has no authority to weigh in.\n\n- Sarah Wire\n\nTrump says troops sent to LA are 'defending the republic'\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in remarks from Fort Bragg in North Carolina that service members deployed to California are \"defending the republic itself\" and helping the administration \"liberate\" the city of Los Angeles.\n\n\"They're stopping an invasion,\" Trump said, in late afternoon remarks.\n\nThe Republican president said California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats, are \"incompetent\" and suggested without evidence that \"troublemakers, agitators and insurrectionists\" were being paid to undermine federal immigration law.\n\nAsked by a reporter if he was accusing Newsom and Bass of paying demonstrators, Trump said \"somebody\" was but not necessarily the Democratic politicians. \"He was just asked by reporters about this remark and he said \"somebody\" is paying for it, without specifiying who.\n\n\"And if they're not, they're just troublemakers,\" he said. \"I believe someboyd is paying them.\"\n\nTrump said: \"As the entire world can now see, uncontrolled migration leads to chaos, dysfunction and disorder.\"\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nHas Trump overblown the threat of protests? Residents, officials say yes.\n\nTrump's deployment of thousands of troops to the nation's second-largest city has unleashed indignation and anger among residents and local officials who say the threat of immigration protests has been dramatically overblown by the White House.\n\n\"The implication is that Donald Trump is waging a war on us personally,\" said protester Charlie Knowlton, 30.\n\nImmigration agents carrying out Trump's goal of deporting 1 million undocumented immigrants annually sparked a series of sometimes-violent protests in the greater Los Angeles area.\n\nTrump has dispatched 4,000 members of the National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, arguing that local law enforcement is overwhelmed. Few of those troops are actually on the streets, however.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department alone has about 9,000 officers to serve the city of nearly 4 million people sprawling across a land area that's one-third the size of Rhode Island. The larger Los Angeles metro area has more than 18 million residents and covers an area nearly the size of Maine.\n\nLocal authorities say they have detained about 150 people in connection to the unrest that left small areas of the 5.8-square-mile downtown marred with pervasive graffiti and a few broken windows. No serious injuries have been reported.\n\n\"We all know this is a power grab,\" Knowlton said before taking a selfie in front of a line of LAPD officers in riot gear. \"What I want right now is for the city police to grow a spine and stand up to the feds.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nState asks judge to stop troops in LA from helping ICE\n\nThe motion says the state on June 9 became aware that the National Guard units in California \"would be providing support for counter-immigration operations and not only at federal buildings.\"\n\n\"Specifically, these activities—scheduled to begin today, June 10, 2025—will include 'holding a secure perimeter in communities around areas where immigration enforcement activities would take place, and securing routes over public streets where immigration enforcement officers would travel,'” the motion said.\n\nThe filing did not say how the state received word about the alleged change in operations.\n\nThe 4,000 California National Guard members called in by the president were originally tasked with protecting federal buildings and other property of the federal government. The Trump administration has not responded to the motion or Newsom's allegation's that the troops were going to used for immigration enforcement.\n\nLA Mayor: ‘We’re an experiment’\n\nMayor Karen Bass, asked why Los Angeles would be targeted, said she believes her city is “an experiment.”\n\n“If you can do this to the nation’s second largest city, maybe the administration is hoping this will be a signal to everybody everywhere to fear them—that you federal government that historically has protected you can come in and take over,” she told reporters in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nBass said she would be reaching out to President Trump. Asked what she would tell him, she said, “I want to tell him to stop the raids. I want to tell him that this is a city of immigrants. I want to tell him that if you want to devastate the economy of the City of Los Angeles, attack immigrants.”\n\n− Phaedra Trethan\n\nOver 100 arrests, 2 officers injured: LAPD\n\nThe number of arrests in connection with the demonstrations in downtown Los Angeles shot up Monday evening, according to the city’s police department.\n\nPolice reported on Tuesday that officers made at least 113 arrests. 96 were for failure to follow orders to leave the area. 14 people were arrested for looting. One person each was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon, resisting arrest and vandalism.\n\nTwo officers were brought to a hospital for their injuries and released. Several businesses were looted, police said.\n\nThe crowds of people left around 3 a.m., officials said.\n\nLAPD acknowledged the hectic night in a statement: “Unfortunately, as demonstrators were being disbursed, agitators and miscreants within the crowd looted businesses and vandalized property,” police said. “We are asking that all residents and businesses continue to report any crimes… Please document with photographs or video before clean up.”\n\nThe number of arrests was more than double what LAPD reported for Saturday and Sunday when 50 people were arrested. Most were also for failure to follow dispersal orders although among the charges was attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail and assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, according to police.\n\nLA mayor considers curfew to curb nightly violence\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she is considering a curfew to restore calm to the city.\n\n“We’re looking at things like a curfew,” she said June 10, and she planned to meet with Police Chief Jim McDonnell later in the day to discuss it.\n\nShe said a curfew wouldn’t need to be citywide, but likely focused on the downtown area.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nTeams cleaning up protesters' graffiti\n\nAuthorities have dispatched painters, cleaners, and other workers to scrub away, cover up or fade out widespread spraypaint graffiti around downtown. While the vast majority of protesters have been peaceful, a small number have defaced buildings, sidewalks and streets with anti-Trump slogans, criticism of ICE and police, and exhortations to resist fascism.\n\nFederal buildings are among the hardest hit, and there was no sign of the National Guard or Marines protecting those facilities Tuesday. On North Los Angeles Street, contractors were paying particular attention to the asphalt where five Waymo self-driving electric vehicles were burned by protesters, releasing rare Earth materials that can be hazardous.\n\nAround the corner, painter’s apprentice Tim Brevard, 53, covered up graffiti on a wall with grey paint shot from a sprayer. Under normal circumstances, Brevard’s team removes gang graffiti from the same area daily. Now it is political graffiti. City policy calls for removing it within 72 hours of being reported, and the city spends about $14 million annually on graffiti removal, according to its annual budget.\n\n“Down here it’s tough because there’s fresh graffiti every day,” Brevard said as he paused to wipe sweat from his face with a gloved hand. “There’s always gang graffiti. Every day we do this.”\n\nHow did the LA protests begin? Immigration raids spark outrage\n\nThe protests in Los Angeles County began as a reaction to a handful of immigration raids, including one outside a Home Depot and another at a clothing manufacturer in the city's garment district.\n\nThe raids and subsequent outrage came as the Trump administration stepped up its detention and deportation of immigrants including at workplaces, traffic stops and routine legal check-ins.\n\nProtests against these moves have increased, too. While most have remained peaceful, the Department of Homeland Security reported a more than 400% surge in assaults on agents.\n\nAfter small protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles on June 6, Trump took several swift actions, calling in the 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines, drawing ire – and at least one lawsuit – from California officials who accuse the president of stoking tension and escalating unrest.\n\nTrump has stood by his actions, saying the deployments were necessary to contain what he described as \"violent, instigated riots.\" About 150 people have been arrested at the protests, which have included flare-ups of unruly clashes, vandalism and looting, but have remained limited to a few blocks in the city's downtown area.\n\nAs authorities brace for another day of protests and Los Angelenos ready themselves for the increased military presence, read more about how the protests began.\n\nTrump says he’d invoke Insurrection Act 'if there’s an insurrection'\n\nTrump said he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act, which would give him more leeway to use the military for domestic purposes as he deploys troops to Los Angeles in response to violent protests.\n\n\"If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it,” Trump said Tuesday during an event in the White House. “We'll see. But I can tell you, last night was terrible. The night before that was terrible.\"\n\nTrump deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles over the objections of Newsom, sparking the lawsuit from the state. Marines also were sent to help the guard after protests erupted over federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nThe troops currently are limited to protecting federal property and law enforcement officers. The Insurrection Act would give Trump authority to use them more broadly. Trump said some areas of Los Angeles, during the protests, where \"you could have called it an insurrection. It was terrible.\"\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nHouse Speaker says Newsom should be 'tarred and feathered'\n\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, asked Tuesday whether Newsom should be arrested, said the governor should be “tarred and feathered.”\n\n“That's not my lane. I'm not gonna give you legal analysis on whether Gavin Newsom should be arrested. But he ought to be tarred and feathered,” Johnson, R-LA., said in a weekly press conference.\n\nJohnson said Newsom is keeping the administration from implementing federal law.\n\nNewsom quickly responded on social media. “Good to know we’re skipping the arrest and going straight for the 1700s style forms of punishment. A fitting threat given the (Republicans) want to bring our country back to the 18th Century.”\n\n− Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhere are LA protests happening?\n\nMost of the unrest is taking place across a few square miles in a mostly commercial area downtown. The city is sprawled across hundreds of square miles and the county covers thousands of square miles. The vast majority of the metropolitan area has been quiet, with people able to continue their daily routines.\n\nTrump has insisted that he had no choice but to increase the level of force in response to growing unrest over his immigration crackdown.\n\n700 Marines heading to LA for riot assistance; Newsom calls move 'deranged fantasy' of Trump\n\nHegseth says National Guard is 'huge component' going forward\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth told a House committee Tuesday the United States was entering a new phase in which the National Guard would \"become a critical component of how we secure that homeland.\"\n\n\"The National Guard is a huge component of how we see the future,\" he told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.\n\nBryn MacDonnell, a special assistant to the secretary of defense, said the Pentagon is spending $134 million of deploying 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines. Funding is coming from operations and maintenance accounts, he said.\n\n− Mayes-Osterman, Cybele\n\nNewsom, Trump aide spar on social media\n\nNewsom criticized Trump on X Tuesday after Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, blasted the governor on the same social media site hours earlier. Miller wrote that \"when the rioters swarmed, you handed over your streets, willingly. You still refuse to arrest and prosecute the arsonists, seditionists and insurrectionists.\"\n\nNewsom made reference to Trump's decision to pardon or commute the sentences of hundreds of people in connection with the assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"The only people defending insurrectionists are you and @realDonaldTrump,\" Newsom wrote. \"Or, are we pretending like you didn’t pardon 1500 of them?\"\n\nCivil rights groups rip Trump's show of force\n\nSeveral national civil rights groups described the Trump administration's National Guard deployment as an overreach of power that was “deeply disturbing\" and “reckless.\"\n\n\"It is not lost on us that no such show of force was deployed in advance of the January 6 insurrection at our nation’s capital despite the clear threat to democracy. The contrast is alarming,\" leaders wrote in a statement released Monday night. “Peaceful protesters in Los Angeles are met with military presence, while violent actors in Washington, D.C. were allowed to breach the heart of our government with little resistance. This inconsistency amplifies questions about how power is used and against whom.\"\n\nThe right to protest the Trump administration’s \"unjust policies targeting Black and Brown communities must be protected,\" they wrote.\n\nThe groups include the NAACP, the National Urban League, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, the National Action Network, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Leadership Conference, the National Council of Negro Women and the Legal Defense Fund.\n\nSeparately, Judith LeBlanc, executive director of Native Organizers Alliance Action Fund, called the administration’s decision to call in the National Guard and the Marines “an act of violence meant to silence organizers who are taking a righteous stand against the illegal and brutal ICE raids happening everyday.”\n\n− Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nMultiple journalists injured by nonlethal rounds\n\nMultiple members of the media have reported being caught in the crossfire or targeted by authorities using tear gas or rubber bullets.\n\nThe incidents included Australian journalist Lauren Tomasi, who was hit in the leg by a rubber bullet on camera in a video that shows an officer appearing to aim at her. A New York Post photographer, Toby Canham, also said he was shot in the forehead with a nonlethal round. British freelance photographer Nick Stern told the BBC he underwent emergency surgery after he was hit in the leg by a plastic bullet.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists has sounded the alarm over the incidents, warning against the intimidation of journalists.\n\n“Any attempt to discourage or silence media coverage by intimidating or injuring journalists should not be tolerated,” Katherine Jacobsen, program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, said in a statement. “It is incumbent upon authorities to respect the media’s role of documenting issues of public interest.”\n\nNational Press Club President Mike Balsamo warned that law enforcement \"cannot pick and choose when the First Amendment applies. Journalists in Los Angeles were not caught in the crossfire — they were targeted. \"\n\n-Jeanine Santucci\n\nMultiple journalists injured by police nonlethal rounds while covering LA protests\n\nCNN correspondent briefly detained, warned by LAPD\n\nPolice briefly detained CNN correspondent Jason Carroll while on air Monday night during the network's coverage of the protests. CNN was covering the protests live when in-studio anchors briefly lost contact with Carroll, who could be seen being led away from the protests by LAPD officers with his hands behind his back. Carroll returned to the mic, informing the anchors: \"I am being detained.\"\n\nAn officer then can be heard telling Carroll: \"We're letting you go. You can't come back. If you come back, you will be arrested.\"\n\nCNN issued a statement saying \"we are pleased the situation resolved quickly once the reporting team presented law enforcement with their CNN credentials. CNN will continue to report out the news unfolding in Los Angeles.\" Read more here.\n\n− Taijuan Moorman\n\nNational Guard lawsuit a 'test case'\n\nOn Monday, California sued the Trump administration, alleging that the president's deployment of Guard troops was unnecessary and unlawful. Newsom later indicated that he will take similar action to prevent the Marines from being deployed, describing the order as a \"blatant abuse of power.\"\n\n\"It makes me feel like our city is actually a test case,\" Bass said at a news conference. \"A test case for what happens when the federal government moves in and takes the authority away from the state or away from local government.\"\n\n'I hate it': LA residents who surveyed vandalism fear more violence in future protests\n\nDay laborers 'looking for work to survive'\n\nSome day laborers and other community members in Los Angeles County are warily watching federal troops, bracing for more raids and trying to look to the future while looking out for each other. Some are still searching for detained family members. Some say they've seen worse.\n\nJose Luis Valencia, 54, is an undocumented immigrant who was born in the Tepito neighborhood of Mexico City. This week he was looking for work outside a Home Depot in Los Angeles County.\n\n\"We're a little nervous, but we're here looking for work to survive,\" Valencia told USA TODAY. \"We need money to put food on the table and support our family.\" Read more here.\n\n− Pamela Avila and Trevor Hughes\n\nNewsom: 'Checks and balances are crumbling'\n\nThe California governor, in a post to social media blasting Trump’s decision to send the military members to California, said Marines are “not political pawns.\" Newsom said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was “illegally” deploying the Marines and argued it was a stunt so Trump could have a “talking point” at a planned parade in Washington on Saturday to celebrate the 250th birthday of the Army, also the day of Trump’s 79th birthday.\n\n\"The Courts and Congress must act. Checks and balances are crumbling,\" Newsom added.\n\n-Jeanine Santucci\n\nFederal forces present 'challenge' for police\n\nOfficials at the Los Angeles Police Department said Monday that despite violent demonstrations, local police can handle whatever protesters throw at them and that federal help is unnecessary and could become a hindrance.\n\n“The possible arrival of federal military forces in Los Angeles - absent clear coordination - presents a significant logistical and operational challenge for those of us charged with safeguarding this city,” Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement. “The Los Angeles Police Department, alongside our mutual aid partners, have decades of experience managing large-scale public demonstrations, and we remain confident in our ability to do so professionally and effectively.”\n\nLAPD said officers have fired over 600 non-lethal bullets and used tear gas on the \"hostile crowd.\" Among those hit was an Australian journalist covering the protests.\n\nAt least five officers received minor injuries, according to police. Five police horses also “were targeted and sustained minor injuries,\" police said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nDays of protests sparked by ICE raids in LA\n\nThe protests began Friday after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps near Los Angeles resulted in more than 40 arrests. The protests had largely been peaceful but flared up when heavily armed, masked agents raided Los Angeles businesses.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, defended the raids and said those arrested by ICE included a Vietnamese man convicted of second-degree murder, an Ecuadoran man convicted of possession of five kilograms of cocaine, and a Filipino man convicted of sexual offenses.\n\nOn Monday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said local immigrant rights groups had confirmed at least five ICE raids in the Los Angeles region. The mayor said officials were still working to compile more information on the raids but noted that in some cases, ICE targeted day laborers and detained people who appeared for scheduled immigration appointments.\n\n\"As you know, ICE does not tell anybody where they're going to go or when they're going to be there,\" Bass said at the Monday news conference.\n\nProtests also sprang up in at least nine other cities across the U.S. on Monday, including New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, according to Reuters.\n\nWhen does a protest become a riot?\n\nProtests in Los Angeles were relatively peaceful when they began on Friday, but escalated into scenes of chaos, with electric vehicles lit aflame, large clouds of tear gas and clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators. Trump has backed his move to send in troops, calling the protests “violent, insurrectionist mobs” and “lawless riots.” But Newsom said it was Trump who “instigated violence.”\n\nExperts say while there are legal definitions for a riot, the term has become increasingly politicized and encapsulates a wide variety of incidents. In most states including California, the key determinator lies in whether multiple people are involved and whether they are committing acts of violence, Brian Higgins, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said.\n\n\"One person is not a riot and neither is a group that is nonviolent,\" he said. \"They can even be breaking the law, like refusing to disperse. It's when you add in the factor of violence that it becomes a riot.\"\n\nThere are some gray areas, he said. Experts also said that while violence is a defining factor in a riot, such violence could be incited by law enforcement.

For the latest updates on the LA protests, visit USA TODAY's coverage for Monday, June 9.\n\nLOS ANGELES — Tensions escalated in Los Angeles late Sunday between law enforcement and protesters as California National Guard troops arrived in Southern California to quell demonstrations against President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, a move that the state's Democratic governor has called unlawful.\n\nTrump ordered the deployment of 2,000 Guard members over the objections of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said Trump wanted to create a \"spectacle.\" U.S. Northern Command said about 300 soldiers were on the ground at three locations in the greater Los Angeles area to provide \"safety and protection of federal property and personnel.\"\n\nNewsom said the Guard's deployment was \"unlawful\" and called on the Trump administration to rescind its order in a letter Sunday afternoon. The governor said the decision was a \"serious breach of state sovereignty\" and demanded that the president \"return control\" to California.\n\nMembers of the Guard were stationed around federal government buildings as local police confronted thousands of protesters in separate demonstrations in the city. Authorities declared several demonstrations on Sunday unlawful assemblies and moved in aggressively with flash-bangs and tear gas grenades, sending hundreds of people running, their eyes streaming with tears.\n\nEarlier, a large group of protesters blocked the 101 Freeway — a major thoroughfare in downtown Los Angeles. The freeway was later cleared as protesters converged on an overpass and threw objects down at police, video footage showed. As the crowds dispersed, they left behind masses of graffiti spray-painted on buildings, sidewalks, and signs, mostly criticizing federal authorities and pushing for immigrant rights.\n\nA handful of protesters who remained behind waved Mexican flags at state and local police officers controlling the intersections and streets.\n\nStories of justice and action across the country: Sign up for USA TODAY's This is America newsletter.\n\nTimeline of the events: LA protests went from small to substantial over three days. Here's what unfolded\n\nLAPD chief: 'Act of violence' will be met with 'swift and lawful action'\n\nDuring a news conference Sunday night, LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell underscored that protests across the city in recent days had been peaceful and thanked the community for \"expressing their views and their frustration in a responsible manner.\"\n\nThe police chief added that the department’s goal is to maintain order without escalating conflict and protect public safety.\n\n\"When peaceful demonstrations devolve into acts of vandalism or violence, especially violence directed at innocent people, law enforcement officers and others, we must respond firmly,\" McDonnell said. “An act of violence, whether toward officers, demonstrators or the public, will be met with swift and lawful action.\"\n\nMcDonnell noted that authorities recognize immigration enforcement operations can cause a “deep fear and anxiety, particularly in immigrant communities.” He reiterated that LAPD is not involved in ICE operations and called the recent violence amid protests \"disgusting.\"\n\nMcDonnell added that the department had resources to handle the situation and would have gone through a \"number of steps\" before requesting the Guard.\n\n“(The deployment) was done from the top down, from the president directing,” McDonnell said. \"They're working for the U.S. Army, not for the California State National Guard.\"\n\nNewsom says he plans to sue Trump over National Guard deployment\n\nNewsom announced Sunday on MSNBC that he plans to sue the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles.\n\nThe governor said he plans to file the lawsuit on Monday and has lawyers working on the brief, according to the news outlet.\n\n\"He's putting fuel on this fire ever since he announced he was taking over the National Guard in a legal act and a moral act, an unconstitutional act. And we're going to test that theory with a lawsuit tomorrow,\" Newsom told MSNBC.\n\nThe governor added that he attempted to discuss the protests with Trump on late Friday, saying the president \"never once brought up the National Guard.\"\n\nPolice declare all of downtown LA an unlawful assembly area\n\nLAPD announced Sunday night that all of downtown Los Angeles had been \"declared as an unlawful assembly.\"\n\n\"You are to leave the Downtown Area immediately,\" police warned on a post on X.\n\nShortly after the announcement, police said demonstrators had marched to the L.A. Live area, a live entertainment venue near Crypto.com Arena. Protesters were blocking all lanes of traffic on Figueroa and 11th streets, according to police.\n\nAt about 8 p.m. local time, authorities declared an unlawful assembly for a demonstration near the 101 Freeway, moving in aggressively with flash-bangs and tear gas grenades, sending hundreds of people running, their eyes streaming with tears. One man stopped to pour milk on his face to reduce the tears, and helicopters clattered overhead as protesters fled the area to honking car horns and periodic cheers.\n\nVideos shared on social media and footage from local television stations showed officers in riot gear, and the sound of flash-bangs could be heard in the background. The Los Angeles Times reported that officers could be seen pushing people with batons, and some protesters were observed climbing a fence to get away from the officers.\n\nMany protesters were waving Mexican flags or hybrid Mexican American flags as they chanted \"F--- ICE, leave LA,\" according to the Times. Protestors were also seen throwing water bottles and other objects at officers and law enforcement vehicles.\n\nA massive crowd of protesters had moved onto the 101 Freeway and stopped traffic in both directions, KABC-TV and Spectrum News 1 reported. KABC-TV said protesters created a makeshift barrier on the southbound side of the freeway and were immediately confronted by officers in riot gear.\n\nPolice officers injured after being hit by motorcyclists\n\nLAPD announced on Sunday that two people riding motorcycles \"attempted to breach a skirmish line at Alameda and Temple\" streets, hitting and injuring two police officers. Authorities said the officers were being treated at the scene by medical personnel.\n\nTwo people were detained after the incident, police said.\n\nAccording to preliminary information, police said at least 10 people have been arrested and three officers were injured during protests on Sunday. California Highway Patrol arrested 17 people on the 101 Freeway, police said. On Saturday, police arrested 29 people.\n\nAmong those arrested on Sunday was a person who allegedly threw a Molotov cocktail at an officer and another person who allegedly hit a line of officers with a motorcycle, injuring one, according to LAPD Capt. Raul Jovel.\n\nWhy did Trump deploy the Guard? What to know about the situation in LA\n\nNewsom dares federal authorities to arrest him\n\nNewsom challenged Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, to arrest him for speaking out against federal immigration enforcement that sparked violent protests in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Trump’s border czar is threatening to arrest me for speaking out. Come and get me, tough guy,\" Gavin said on social media. \"I don't give a damn. It won’t stop me from standing up for California.\"\n\nIn an interview with NBC News on Saturday, Homan said, \"I’m telling you what, we’re going to keep enforcing law every day in L.A. Every day in L.A., we’re going to enforce immigration law. I don’t care if they like it or not.\"\n\nWhen asked whether Newsom and Bass, who have criticized the deployment, could be subject to arrest if they hinder operations on the ground, Homan said: \"I’ll say it about anybody. You cross that line, it’s a felony to knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal alien. It’s a felony to impede law enforcement doing their job.\"\n\nTrump, Homan, and other federal officials have said they would charge anyone who interfered with the immigration operation. Earlier in the day, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a fiery picture on social media with the caption \"another 'mostly peaceful protest' brought to you by Gavin Newsom. DEPORT,\" Hegseth said.\n\nNewsom’s press office replied by asking whether the Marines would respond the next time the Philadelphia Eagles win the Super Bowl, next to a fiery picture.\n\nNewsom asks Trump to withdraw the National Guard\n\nIn an emailed letter released on Sunday afternoon, Newsom formally asked Hegseth to rescind Trump’s order to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles.\n\n\"We didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved,\" Newsom said in a social media post. \"This is a serious breach of state sovereignty — inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they’re actually needed.\"\n\nThe letter stated that law enforcement resources in Los Angeles County were \"sufficient to maintain order,\" adding that Guard members were deployed without appropriate training or orders, which \"risks seriously escalating the situation.\"\n\n\"In dynamic and fluid situations such as the one in Los Angeles, State and local authorities are the most appropriate ones to evaluate the need for resources to safeguard life and property,\" according to the letter.\n\nIn response to Newsom's letter, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Reuters that Trump had \"rightfully stepped in to restore law and order.\"\n\n\"It’s a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,\" Jackson said. \"Everyone saw the chaos, violence, and lawlessness - unless of course, Gavin Newsom doesn’t think any of that is a problem.\"\n\nPolice declare 'unlawful assembly' in downtown LA protest\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, LAPD said on X that it has placed officers across the city on a \"tactical alert.\" The tactical alert means that all officers can now be redistributed between divisions and must remain on shift until they are relieved by their unit commanders.\n\nThe police department later declared the protest outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles an \"unlawful assembly,\" and authorized the “use of less lethal munitions.\" The department also issued a dispersal order and said arrests were being made.\n\nAccording to the department, officers reported that people in the crowd were throwing concrete, bottles, and other objects.\n\n\"The use of less lethal munitions has been authorized by the Incident Commander,\" the department said in a separate social media post. \"Persons throwing items at officers will be detained and arrested.\"\n\nAnti-ICE protests in downtown LA: The history of National Guard deployments in Los Angeles: What to know\n\nLA mayor blames Trump administration for provoking tensions\n\nBass warned protesters on Sunday not to \"play into the administration’s hands\" and said her office was working with other officials and organizing resources in response to the immigration raids and demonstrations.\n\n\"What we're seeing in Los Angeles is chaos that is provoked by the administration,” the mayor said during an afternoon news conference on Sunday. \"When you raid Home Depot and workplaces, when you tear parents and children apart, and when you run armored caravans through our streets, you cause fear and you cause panic.\"\n\nBass called the deployment of federalized troops a \"dangerous escalation\" and said the Trump administration’s decision was not about public safety. She added that she was joining Newsom in appealing to the administration to rescind the order to federalize the Guard and allow the Guard to come back under the control of the governor.\n\n\"I want the people of Los Angeles to know that we stand with all Angelenos,\" Bass said. \"No matter where you were born, the First Amendment right gives you the ability again to protest peacefully, but it does not give you the right to be violent, to create chaos or to vandalize property, and that will not be tolerated. So I call on all Angelenos to continue expressing your right, your anger, your outrage, but to do it peacefully.”\n\nDemocratic lawmakers urge protesters to remain calm\n\nState and local leaders encouraged peaceful demonstrations on Sunday night as protests continued in downtown Los Angeles over Trump's immigration enforcement.\n\nIn a news release on Sunday, U.S. Northern Command said about 500 Marines at Twentynine Palms, about 143 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, were put on “prepare to deploy” status.\n\nNewsom was in Los Angeles meeting with officials from the LAPD and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The governor said local and state emergency officials were working to maintain public safety as they responded to protests that were \"provoked by chaos from Washington.\"\n\n\"We’re here to keep the peace — not play into Trump’s political games,\" Newsom said on X. \"Don’t take the bait. Never use violence or harm law enforcement.\"\n\nIn a post on X, Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla criticized Trump and said the president was creating \"nothing more than fear and chaos in our communities.\"\n\n\"This is the first time since 1965 National Guard troops are federalized and deployed without the request and support of the Governor or local authorities,\" Padilla said on social media. \"It’s unnecessary, counterproductive, and a misuse of our National Guard.\"\n\nUnion president detained amid protests\n\nProtests erupted on Friday after ICE operations in Los Angeles resulted in the arrests of at least 44 people on alleged immigration violations, according to Reuters. One organized labor leader, David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union of California (SEIU California), was injured and detained by ICE at one site, according to an SEIU statement.\n\nThe union said Huerta was arrested \"while exercising his First Amendment right to observe and document law enforcement activity.\" He was later released from the hospital after being treated for injuries he sustained during his arrest, but remains in custody, the union added.\n\nNo details about the nature or severity of Huerta's injury were immediately available.\n\nU.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said in a post on X on Friday that Huerta \"was arrested for interfering with federal officers and will face arraignment in federal court on Monday.\"\n\nThe next day, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for Huerta’s immediate release and warned of a “disturbing pattern of arresting and detaining American citizens for exercising their right to free speech.”\n\n'Number of people' arrested; cars set on fire near downtown LA\n\nSeveral protests were observed across Los Angeles County, with the largest in downtown Los Angeles. By 5 p.m. local time, law enforcement authorities cleared the 101 Freeway, and videos showed protestors moving onto an overpass as they chanted and waved Mexican flags.\n\nLAPD later declared an unlawful assembly in the Civic Center area and the historic Olvera Street in downtown Los Angeles. Police said demonstrators had halted and ignited several vehicles in the area.\n\nFootage from local television stations showed several driverless robotaxis from Waymo stopped on the road. At least two vehicles were set on fire as smoke was seen billowing into the sky.\n\nBy around 6:15 p.m., LAPD said \"multiple autonomous vehicles\" were on fire in the area of Los Angeles Street, North of Arcadia and South of Alameda streets. Police warned people to avoid the area due to burning lithium-ion batteries releasing toxic gases, posing risks to responders and those nearby.\n\nPolice said a “number of people have been arrested” at the Civic Center area. At around 6:20 p.m., LAPD said \"less lethal munitions\" were authorized in the area of Temple and Main streets as videos showed multiple skirmish lines on roads near City Hall.\n\nPolice said demonstrators were using chairs, garbage bins, and other items to block the street. The department urged protesters to leave the area.\n\nNational Guard deployment in Los Angeles slated for 60 days\n\nTrump’s National Guard deployment of 2,000 troops in Los Angeles is expected to last 60 days, according to a directive from California’s adjutant general.\n\nTrump's memo on June 7 invoked a section of federal code authorizing the president to call the guard into service to \"repel an invasion of the United States by a foreign nation\" or to \"suppress a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States\" or to \"execute the laws of the United States when the President is unable to do so with regular forces.\"\n\nDavid Sapp, Newsom’s legal affairs secretary, said the Guard’s directive was inconsistent with Trump’s memo, which anticipated \"coordinat(ion) with the Governors of the States.\"\n\n\"There is currently no need for the National Guard to be deployed in Los Angeles, and to do so in this unlawful manner and for such a lengthy period is a serious breach of state sovereignty,\" Sapp wrote to Hegseth.\n\nWaymo suspends service after vehicles set on fire: Report\n\nA Waymo spokesperson told NBC News that the company was suspending its service in downtown Los Angeles after multiple self-driving vehicles were reportedly set on fire during protests.\n\n\"We will not be serving any rides in the protest area until it is deemed safe,\" the spokesperson said, according to NBC News.\n\nLAPD said earlier Sunday that \"multiple autonomous vehicles\" were on fire in the area of Los Angeles Street, North of Arcadia and South of Alameda streets. Authorities warned people to avoid the area due to burning lithium-ion batteries releasing toxic gases nearby.\n\nHarris calls National Guard 'dangerous escalation'\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, who lives in Los Angeles, called the deployment of the National Guard “a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos.”\n\nHarris, the Democratic nominee who lost to Trump in 2024, said in a social media post that Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Southern California and across the country are part of a \"cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division.\"\n\n\"This Administration’s actions are not about public safety – they’re about stoking fear,\" Harris added.\n\nNewsom accuses Trump's deployment 'acts of a dictator'\n\nNewsom on Sunday accused Trump's order as \"the acts of a dictator\" for deploying National Guard troops to quell violent protests in Los Angeles.\n\nNewsom posted a video of Trump saying he would charge state and local officials federally if they interfere with immigration enforcement, which sparked the protests in Los Angeles. Newsom accused Trump of \"inciting and provoking violence\" as well as \"creating mass chaos\" and \"militarizing cities.\"\n\n\"These are the acts of a dictator, not a President,\" Newsom added.\n\nTrump says LA protests don't qualify as an insurrection yet\n\nTrump told reporters Sunday on his way to Camp David for a meeting with military leaders that he doesn’t think the protests in Los Angeles qualify as an insurrection yet, but that he would be keeping a close eye on the situation.\n\n“No,” he said when asked if an insurrection was happening. “But you’ve got violent people, and we’re not going to let them get away with it.”\n\nTrump said he was sending the National Guard to restore order. “We’re going to have troops everywhere,” Trump said. “We’re not going to let this happen to our country.”\n\nHe said the bar for sending in Marines would be “what I think it is.”\n\n“If we see danger to our country and to our citizens, we will be very, very strong in terms of law and order. It’s about law and order,” Trump said. He said he would be “watching it very closely” to see whether protests are spreading and if a larger federal response is needed.\n\n“We’re going to be watching it very closely,” Trump said. “You know they spit, that’s their new thing. They spit, and worse, you know what they throw at them, right? And when that happens, I have a little statement – they spit, we hit. And I told them, nobody’s going to spit on our police officers. No body’s going to spit on our military.”\n\nLAPD police chief confirms 'heavier deployment'\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell told USA TODAY on Sunday that his department will be \"well prepared\" should any civil unrest occur during the third day of protests across the city.\n\n\"We certainly have a heavier deployment than usual,\" said McDonnell, declining to give a specific number.\n\nThe chief said officers will be deployed outside a federal court building, the Metropolitan Detention Center, City Hall, and some parks where protests and demonstrations against the deportation raids are scheduled to take place.\n\nMcDonnell said the LAPD is still figuring out what role the National Guard will play during any protests as well.\n\n\"It’s still to be determined,\" McDonnell said. \"Some of them just got on the ground, and we’re trying to figure out how we can make this all work for everybody. For the city, the county. and beyond. Our whole focus is on public safety.\"\n\n— Terry Collins\n\nLos Angeles police chief: 'Ready to meet whatever challenges we may face'\n\nTrump directs federal agencies to 'liberate' LA from 'Migrant Invasion'\n\nTrump said on social media that Los Angeles \"has been invaded and occupied\" by undocumented immigrants and he directed the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Justice to take action to liberate the city.\n\nThe language of his post echoes his executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants accused of being members of criminal gangs he declared terrorist organizations, such as Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua.\n\n\"A once great American City, Los Angeles, has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals,\" Trump said. \"Now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking our Federal Agents to try and stop our deportation operations.”\n\nTrump directed Hegseth, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Attorney General Pam Bondi “to take all such action necessary to liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots.”\n\n“Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free,” Trump said.\n\nDemocratic governors blast 'alarming abuse of power'\n\nA group of 22 Democratic governors called Trump’s deployment of the National Guard “an alarming abuse of power” and said doing so without working with Newsom was “dangerous.”\n\n“President Trump’s move to deploy California’s National Guard is an alarming abuse of power,” the governors said in a joint statement. “Governors are the Commanders in Chief of their National Guard and the federal government activating them in their own borders without consulting or working with a state's governor is ineffective and dangerous.”\n\nThe governors also criticized the threat to send in Marines. “Further, threatening to send the U.S. Marines into American neighborhoods undermines the mission of our service members, erodes public trust, and shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement,” the governors said.\n\nDemocratic Govs. Laura Kelly of Kansas, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Tony Evers of Wisconsin, Bob Ferguson of Washington, Josh Green of Hawaii, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, Katie Hobbs of Arizona, Kathy Hochul of New York, Tina Kotek of Oregon, Ned Lamont of Connecticut, Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, Dan McKee of Rhode Island, Matt Meyer of Delaware, Janet Mills of Maine, Wes Moore of Maryland, Phil Murphy of New Jersey, Jared Polis of Colorado, J.B.

But as governor of South Dakota in February 2024, Noem sharply criticized then-President Joe Biden for considering federalizing the National Guard over Texas’ contentious razor‑wire border operations.\n\nThe Biden White House was reportedly considering the move after the Supreme Court ruled the federal government could cut through razor wire that Texas had placed along the U.S.-Mexico border − wire that similarly obstructs CBP agents’ ability to access the border and carry out their duties.\n\nThat prompted Democrats and others to call on Biden to federalize the Texas National Guard and order it to stand down. In a post on X, Noem said such a move would be a “direct attack on states’ rights.\" Ultimately, Biden never activated the Guard.\n\nAmnesty International accuses Trump of 'instilling fear'\n\nAmnesty International Executive Director Paul O’Brien called the Guard deployment \"deeply alarming.\" He accused Trump of using military force to punish those who speak out for human rights and said the deployment will exacerbate the situation rather than remedy it.\n\n“This is not about protecting communities, this is about crushing dissent and instilling fear,\" O'Brien said in a statement. \"Armed troops do not belong in our neighborhoods. This militarization of immigration enforcement and in response to people exercising their right to freedom of expression must have no place in a country that claims to value justice and human rights.\"\n\nLA County Board chairperson calls for restraint, backs right to protest\n\nSupervisor Kathryn Barger, the conservative chairperson of the powerful Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, called for calm but voiced her support for the right of protesters to express themselves.\n\n“I want to remind @CountyofLA residents that the right to protest is a fundamental constitutional freedom and I strongly support the right of individuals to express themselves peacefully,” Barger, who represents the county's northern swaths, said in a posting on X late Saturday night. “However, I urge all those who choose to protest to do so without resorting to violence or unlawful behavior.”\n\nBarger said that as chair of the political body overseeing all of Los Angeles County, including the parts where the National Guard is being deployed, she would closely monitor any developments of civil unrest. That would include “attacks against local, state, or federal law enforcement officers or any attempt to cause them harm,\" she wrote.\n\nBernie Sanders: Trump 'does not believe in the Constitution'\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders said he believes President Donald Trump is “moving this country rapidly into authoritarianism\" after Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to help quell immigration protests in Los Angeles.\n\n“This guy wants all of the power. He does not believe in the Constitution. He does not believe in the rule of law,” Sanders, a Vermont independent, told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” \"My understanding is that the governor of California, the mayor of the city of Los Angeles did not request the National Guard, but he (Trump) thinks he has a right to do anything he wants.\"\n\nThe protests were prompted by the Trump administration's push to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants. Demonstrators allege the administration's immigration enforcement violates civil and human rights.\n\nDHS: Immigrants arrested include murderers, rapists\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced that the immigrants without legal authorization to be in the country include murders and rapists.\n\nThose arrested during the Los Angeles operation that sparked violent protests include a Vietnamese man convicted of second-degree murder, an Ecuadoran man convicted of possession of five kilograms of cocaine, and a Filipino man convicted of sexual offenses.\n\n\"These rioters in Los Angeles are fighting to keep rapists, murderers and other violent criminals loose on Los Angeles streets,\" Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary of the department, said in a statement. \"Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer.\"\n\nWhat other times has the Guard been deployed to LA?\n\nThe National Guard has been deployed to Los Angeles multiple times in response to civil disorder and natural disasters. In previous years, the National Guard was sent at the request of state and local officials.\n\nIn June 2020, USA TODAY reported that Trump had considered invoking the Insurrection Act over protests in response to the murder of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a former Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck on a street corner in May 2020. Protesters clashed with police across the country, including in Los Angeles, which prompted then-Mayor Eric Garcetti to ask Newsom for members of the Guard to be sent to the city.\n\nThe last time the Insurrection Act was invoked was in 1992 by former President George H.W. Bush, when the acquittal of the Los Angeles Police Department officers who beat Rodney King sparked the Los Angeles riots. Thousands of members of the Guard, the U.S. Army, and the Marine Corps were sent in response to the riots, which left more than 60 people dead and 2,300 injured, according to the Bill of Rights Institute.\n\nRead more here.\n\nDemocrat: Trump deploying Guard to invoke martial law\n\nSen. Chris Murphy accused Trump on Sunday of unnecessarily deploying the National Guard in California to escalate the conflict between protesters and ICE agents so he can eventually invoke the Insurrection Act and impose martial law in the United States.\n\nMurphy, a frequent and outspoken critic of Trump, said in a video posted on X that the crisis in California “is of Donald Trump's making.”\n\n“Any time a protest turns violent, that's unacceptable,” said Murphy, D-Conn. “But California has made it clear that between local and state authorities, they have the means to be able to keep the peace. They don't need Donald Trump. They don't need the National Guard.”\n\nMurphy said Trump decided to send in the Guard over the objections of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, “not to solve a problem, but to create a problem, because Donald Trump has always wanted to create an excuse to impose martial law, to invoke the Insurrection Act.”\n\nMurphy accused Trump of undergoing a comprehensive campaign since he was sworn in to try to undermine the rule of law in the United States to consolidate his own power and authority.\n\nOriginally enacted in 1792, the Insurrection Act grants the president the authority to deploy the U.S. military domestically and use it against Americans under certain conditions, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law.\n\nTrump calls California Gov. Newsom 'incompetent'\n\nTrump called Newsom “incompetent,” based on cost overruns for a high-speed rail program, and said either state and local authorities would quell the violence or he would.\n\n\"You have an incompetent governor,\" Trump said. “I did call him the other night, I said, 'Look take care of this, otherwise I’m sending in the troops.'\"\n\nTrump also said state and local officials could face federal charges if they stand in the way of deportations. “If officials stand in the way of law and order, yeah, they will face federal charges,” Trump said.\n\nWhite House warns of 'zero tolerance'\n\n\"These Radical Left protests, by instigators and often paid troublemakers, will NOT BE TOLERATED,\" Trump said in a social media post Sunday. Trump and administration officials have attacked Newsom, Bass and other Democrats for failing to quell the disturbances. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump signed a memo a day earlier deploying the Guardsmen “to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester.”\n\n“The Trump administration has a zero tolerance policy for criminal behavior and violence, especially when that violence is aimed at law enforcement officers trying to do their jobs,” she said in a statement.\n\nHegseth said the Pentagon was prepared to mobilize active-duty troops \"if violence continues\" and that Marines at nearby Camp Pendleton were \"on high alert.\"\n\nProtests came after ICE sweep\n\nOn Saturday, a large protest erupted in the city of Paramount in Los Angeles County, about 15 miles south of downtown Los Angeles. It came as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducted enforcement operations in the area.\n\nMore demonstrations followed, and some protesters assaulted ICE officers, slashed tires, and defaced buildings, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which claimed it took LAPD officers two hours to respond. Police sometimes countered the unrest by firing tear gas, pepper spray and flash-bang concussion rounds toward gathering crowds.\n\n\"The violent targeting of law enforcement in Los Angeles by lawless rioters is despicable and Mayor Bass and Governor Newsom must call for it to end,\" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. \"The men and women of ICE put their lives on the line to protect and defend the lives of American citizens.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/08/la-protest-what-to-know-trump-national-guard/84102227007/", "title": "Why did Trump deploy the National Guard to LA protests?

Here’s what to know:\n\nWhy did Trump call in the National Guard?\n\nTrump ordered approximately 2,000 National Guard troops to help quell the protests in Los Angeles, where helmeted police in riot gear clashed with protesters who opposed tougher federal actions against undocumented immigrants.\n\nSome protesters hurled large chunks of broken concrete at officers, slashed tires and defaced buildings, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump signed a memo June 7 deploying the guardsmen “to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester.”\n\n“The Trump Administration has a zero tolerance policy for criminal behavior and violence, especially when that violence is aimed at law enforcement officers trying to do their jobs,” she said in a statement.\n\nWhere are the protests taking place in LA?\n\nOn June 7, a large protest erupted in the city of Paramount in Los Angeles County, about 15 miles south of downtown Los Angeles. It came as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducted enforcement operations in the area and arrested at least 44 people on alleged immigration violations.\n\nAbout 350 to 400 protesters had gathered, and some were seen throwing objects at agents.\n\nSince then, demonstrations have widened out across parts of Los Angeles. A second protest in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday night attracted approximately 60 people, who chanted slogans including \"ICE out of L.A.!\"\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said two deputies were taken to an area hospital for injuries, but they have since been released, according to multiple reports.\n\nDemonstrators have also reported injuries. One skirmish involved the arrest of a union leader, David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union of California, who said he was injured and detained by ICE.\n\nWhat has Gavin Newsom said?\n\nNewsom wrote in a post on X on June 7 that the move from the federal government to deploy National Guard troops is “purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions.”\n\n\"LA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment’s notice.

For the latest news on protests across the country, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Thursday, June 12.\n\nLOS ANGELES − Two people have been charged with throwing firebombs during five days of protests that have rocked a downtown section of the city and prompted President Trump' controversial decision to send 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines here, authorities said Wednesday.\n\nA federal complaint charges Emiliano Gardno Galvez, 23, of Paramount and Wrackkie Quiogue, 27, of Long Beach, with possession of an unregistered destructive device, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison. U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said at least nine people face federal charges related to the demonstrations.\n\nThe protests have been prompted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps spurred by President Trump's directive to find immigrants living in the United States without legal status.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said it has arrested over 385 people since the protests began, including over 200 people after a curfew was imposed Tuesday night.\n\nProtests against immigration raids and in support of demonstrators in Los Angeles have spread from coast-to-coast. Dozens of people were arrested in protests Tuesday night in cities including New York, Denver, Philadelphia and San Francisco.\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas, Gov.

Gen. Scott Sherman said earlier on Wednesday that his troops would be following federal agents: “They’re in the lead. We’re supporting them. It’s really about protecting federal facilities and federal personnel as they do their job.”\n\nMarines being deployed were trained in crowd control, de-escalation techniques and in proper use of force, according to Northern Command.\n\nThe additional troops will join 2,100 National Guard members already on the ground, officials said.\n\nHomeland Security seeks weapons, drones for LA immigration crackdown\n\nWASHINGTON —The Department of Homeland Security has asked the Pentagon for help in transporting weapons from Fort Benning in Georgia and another site in Wyoming to Los Angeles, where its immigration crackdown has become increasingly militarized.\n\nThe request from Homeland Security, confirmed by a Defense official, also seeks “drone surveillance support,” direction to troops on detaining or arresting “lawbreakers,” and graduates from an organization like the Marines’ School of Advanced Warfighting School for setting up a joint operation center.\n\nIt's unclear what type of weapons Homeland Security officials are seeking for their immigration crackdown in California. Also unclear: who would use them and who they would be used against.\n\nPentagon officials are reviewing the request, according to the official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead more here.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook\n\nNational Guard assisting ICE, can temporarily detain people\n\nSoldiers from the National Guard deployed to Los Angeles are assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in their operations and can temporarily detain people, according to Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman.\n\nThe troops are also being trained to engage on the ground, Sherman said.\n\nThe National Guard general told reporters on Wednesday that about 1,000 National Guard members deployed have been tasked with protecting federal buildings and the “protection of federal law enforcement as they conduct their mission.”\n\nNational Guard members are not authorized to make arrests but can “temporarily detain” people, according to Sherman.\n\nDetails about what National Guard members are doing in Los Angeles come as ICE officials share photos of troops with AR-15 Style rifles standing guard over federal agents handcuffing people.\n\nNational Guard spokesperson Master Sgt. Tabitha Lee said 500 troops had been trained to accompany ICE agents.\n\n“This is stuff that we do not do, and this is working with federal law enforcement,” Sherman said. “They’re in the lead. We’re supporting them. It’s really about protecting federal facilities and federal personnel as they do their job.”\n\nSherman’s confirmation of the National Guard’s role comes as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told Congress that the deployment of troops could expand beyond Los Angeles.\n\nEarly federal charges announced following LA protests\n\nGalvez is accused of hiding behind a fence and throwing the device at a sheriff’s deputy on Saturday, June 7, in Paramount, Essayli said. He is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico and has been previously deported, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.\n\nICE officers arrested him on a charge of attempted murder in the attack.\n\nQuiogue is charged with throwing a Molotov cocktail during the protest on June 8, Essayli said.\n\nMore charges are expected, Essayli said at a briefing Wednesday.\n\n“We are looking at hundreds of people. ... We’re going to take our time, we’re going to identify people,” he said. “We’re coming after all these people. So let’s be clear: This is the beginning, not the end.”\n\nOver 30 California mayors, city leaders call for ICE sweeps to end\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, joined by over 30 city leaders from across Southern California, called on the Trump administration to end the immigration sweeps that led to the recent volatile protests in Los Angeles and other cities nationwide.\n\n“All of us represent cities in this region where immigrants are key,” Bass said. “To have people live in fear like it is today is just unacceptable.”\n\nShe said the Trump administration is conducting a “national experiment to determine how far the federal government can go in reaching in and taking over power from a governor (and) power from a local jurisdiction.”\n\nBass also accused the administration of intentionally inciting fear through its raids and deployment of National Guard troops and Marines. “When you raid Home Depots and workplaces, when you tear parents and children apart, and when you run armored caravans through our streets, you’re not trying to keep anyone safe, you’re trying to cause fear and panic,” Bass said.\n\nLos Angeles families fear ICE raids at school graduation ceremonies\n\nMany Angeleno immigrants are foregoing the chance to witness their young loved ones receive diplomas or advance to the next grade at upcoming school graduation ceremonies out of fear of getting deported.\n\n\"I’ve spoken with parents who’ve told me that their daughter would be the first in their family to graduate high school and they’re not going to be there to witness it, because they have a fear of the place of graduation being targeted,” said Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, which covers the majority of the city and some surrounding areas of Los Angeles and serves more than a half of a million public school students, during a June 9 news conference. More than one-third of Angelenos are immigrants.\n\nTheir absence amid the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown is felt around Los Angeles.\n\nAt a June 10 commencement ceremony on the Westside, Palms Middle School Principal Arturo Enriquez told the public school families that community members were stationed outside of the campus \"ready to call me\" if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials showed up.\n\n\"We are a melting pot of beautiful, incredible people,\" Enriquez said to the crowd before wiping a tear from his eye. \"This incredible community, all of these students, all of these parents, guardians, friends and family, it is because of you that these young people are here ready to go on to that next step – to that high school life, to represent each of us as an incredible member of society.\"\n\nRead more about how students and families are being impacted here.\n\n-Kayla Jimenez\n\nSan Francisco protest at immigration court leads to arrests\n\nLos Angeles is not the only major city in California that has been the site of fiery protests in recent days.\n\nIn San Francisco, law enforcement arrested at least four people during a protest June 10 outside the city’s immigration court, a local NBC station reported. These arrests come after the city’s police force arrested more than 150 during a demonstration that turned violent on Sunday.\n\nOther protests have occurred in nearby Oakland.\n\nLAPD: Over 200 people arrested after curfew\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said it arrested 225 people on Tuesday night after Mayor Karen Bass’ curfew went into effect.\n\nMost of the arrests – approximately 203 – were on failure to disperse charges, while others involved curfew violations, possession of a firearm and assault on a police officer, according to a statement from the department.\n\nOfficers used non-lethal munitions to disperse the crowd and two officers were injured and received medical treatment, the department said. These arrests follow more than 160 arrests the department made during protests over the weekend and on Monday night.\n\nHegseth says deployments could expand beyond California\n\nThe federal government's deployment of National Guard troops could expand beyond Los Angeles, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at a congressional hearing Wednesday in Washington.\n\n“Part of it is getting ahead of a problem, so that if in other places, if there are other riots in places where law enforcement officers are threatened, we would have the capability to surge the national guard there if necessary,” Hegseth said.\n\nHegseth also took a shot at California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has filed suit against the Trump administration for sending in the National Guard, a move Newsom adamantly opposes.\n\n“Thankfully, in most of those states you have a governor that recognizes the need for it, supports it, mobilizes it for himself or herself,” Hegseth said. “In California, unfortunately, the governor wants to play politics with it.”\n\nNational Guard major general clarifies military role in LA\n\nNational Guard troops and Marines deployed to quell unrest in Los Angeles will not conduct arrests, but they might detain demonstrators temporarily while waiting law enforcement to arrive at the scene, National Guard Major General Scott Sherman said at a briefing Wednesday.\n\n“It’s really about protecting federal facilities and federal personnel as they do their job,” Sherman said.\n\nThe 4,000 National Guard and 700 Marines deployed by Trump are receiving two days of training on civil unrest that includes crowd control and protection of property, Sherman said. There are currently 2,000 Guard members on duty “performing operations,” he said. Another 2,000 are assembling, or “mustering,” and will be ready to begin their training Thursday, Sherman said.\n\nThe 700 Marines are at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach, but Sherman said he couldn’t say when they would be seen on the streets.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott orders National Guard to immigration protests\n\nWhite House: 'America voted for deportations'\n\nThe LAPD on Wednesday urged businesses and residents to document and report damage and vandalism as authorities braced for a sixth day of demonstrations. They have been prompted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps spurred by President Trump's directive to find immigrants living in the United States without legal status.\n\n\"The Trump administration told us they were going after violent criminals, gang members, and drug dealers,\" Mayor Karen Bass said in a social media post Wednesday. \"But they went after (day laborers outside) Home Depot. They’re going after families and children. That does not make Los Angeles more safe.\"\n\nThe White House was unyielding. Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, framed the political clash as an attempt to nullify the 2024 election.\n\n\"America voted for mass deportations,\" Miller wrote on social media. \"Violent insurrectionists, and the politicians who enable them, are trying to overthrow the results of the election.\"\n\nProtests planned across the nation on June 14\n\nAfter protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles sparked a mass military response, similar demonstrations erupted in other cities around the nation. From major metros like New York City and Chicago to smaller areas like Columbus, Ohio, and Des Moines, Iowa, here's a look at demonstrations nationwide.\n\nProtests against immigration and other Trump policies are planned in at least 1,500 communities across the country on June 14, the same day President Donald Trump holds a military parade in Washington and celebrates his birthday.\n\nThe rallies, named \"No Kings Day,\" are expected to be the largest and most widespread protests since Trump took office. Organizers say a core principle of the protests will be \"a commitment to nonviolent action\" and discouraged participants from bringing weapons to the events.\n\n\"We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events,\" organizers say on the nokings.org website.\n\n'No Kings Day' protests planned for June 14 with aim to reclaim the American flag\n\nTexas to deploy National Guard ahead of protests\n\nTexas is following President Donald Trump's lead, and will deploy the National Guard in preparation for protests planned for June 14 as demonstrations against immigration raids spread throughout the country. Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican and ally of Trump, said he would send the Guard members to locations across the state to \"ensure peace & order.\"\n\nAbbott's decision comes after protesters in Austin clashed with police June 9.\n\n\"Peaceful protest is legal. Harming a person or property is illegal & will lead to arrest,\" he said in a post to X. \"@TexasGuard will use every tool & strategy to help law enforcement maintain order.\"\n\nThe situation is markedly different from California, where the governor has opposed the use of the Guard.\n\nSan Antonio mayor says he was unaware of troop deployment\n\nSan Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg, a Democrat, told reporters he did not request the Texas National Guard and said he did not receive advanced warning about Gov. Greg Abbott’s deployment of troops to the city ahead of planned protests.\n\nNirenberg’s comments at a news conference came after Abbott announced he will deploy members of the state’s National Guard across Texas. Nirenberg and San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said they did not know how many troops would be deployed to the city.\n\n“I don’t have any information about the numbers or what they’re going to do,” McManus said.\n\nNirenberg urged protesters to exercise their right to free speech but told them to “keep it lawful and peaceful,” adding, “I am confident that San Antonio knows how to do this right.”\n\nViolence, curfew involve small area of vast city\n\nIn Los Angeles, Bass has declared a partial curfew effective daily from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time, part of the city's strategy to quell ongoing looting and vandalism linked to the protests. The curfew covers one square mile of a city sprawling across a land area one-third the size of Rhode Island. The larger Los Angeles metro area covers an area nearly the size of Maine.\n\nShortly after the curfew went into effect Tuesday, the Los Angeles Police Department announced that multiple groups had congregated in an area not far from City Hall and federal buildings where some detained immigrants have been held.\n\n\"Those groups are being addressed and mass arrests are being initiated,\" the LAPD said. \"Curfew is in effect.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump vents on Truth Social\n\nTrump called the protests “violent, insurrectionist mobs” and “lawless riots” and ordered 4,000 National Guard Troops and 700 Marines into the city. But Gov. Gavin Newsom said it was Trump who “instigated violence.”\n\nIn a public address Tuesday night, California Gov. Gavin Newsom condemned Trump's deployment of 4,000 National Guard troops and about 700 Marines, a move that state and local officials have called unnecessary, illegal, and politically motivated. Trump, according to Newsom, was not \"protecting our communities, he’s traumatizing our communities.\"\n\nTrump fired back Wednesday on social media: \"The INCOMPETENT Governor of California was unable to provide protection in a timely manner when our Ice Officers, GREAT Patriots they are, were attacked by an out of control mob of agitators, troublemakers, and/or insurrectionists. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nNew York, Chicago, Atlanta among cities with protests\n\nIn New York City, hundreds rallied near the city’s main immigration court on June 10. Tensions eventually flared and 86 people were taken into custody, with 34 people being charged and 52 issued criminal court summonses, according to the New York Police Department.\n\nIn Colorado, a demonstration at the state capitol drew hundreds of protesters who marched peacefully through the downtown area, CRP News reported. Tensions escalated between a group that splintered off from the main demonstration and law enforcement, leading to at least 17 arrests on charges including obstructing streets and assault.\n\nIn Philadelphia, more than 150 protesters gathered at the Federal Detention Center in the City Center area, local media outlets reported. The Philadelphia Police Department said protesters at one point ignored demands to disperse and grew increasingly unruly, leading to more than a dozen arrests and several injuries.\n\nNot all rallies were marred by arrests and clashes between police and demonstrators. In Ohio, between 200 to 300 people protested ICE raids in downtown Columbus, crossing in front of the local police headquarters and city hall without incident.\n\nNational Guard troops aid immigration raids\n\nReuters reported that about 2,100 National Guard troops were in the greater Los Angeles area on Tuesday, with more on the way. Meanwhile, hundreds of Marines were in a staging area near the city, awaiting deployment to specific locations, according to Reuters.\n\nThough few of those troops were actually on the streets, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement posted photos on X showing Guard troops accompanying ICE officers on an immigration raid. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted the photos, saying: \"This We’ll Defend.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has vowed to redouble immigration enforcement raids in response to the protests, which have expanded to other U.S. cities, including Chicago, New York, and Atlanta.\n\nCalifornia sued Trump and the Department of Defense on Monday, seeking to block the deployment of federal troops. Newsom has also accused Trump and Hegseth of trying to use the assets to help ICE conduct raids. A judge has set a hearing for the matter for Thursday.\n\nGavin Newsom speech last night\n\nCalifornia leaders and the Trump administration remained in a tense standoff as Newsom accused the president of \"pulling a military dragnet all across Los Angeles, well beyond his stated intent to just go after violent and serious criminals.\"\n\nThe Democratic governor has said in recent days that Trump acted like a \"dictator\" by deploying federal troops without his consent, and compared the administration to authoritarian regimes for targeting vulnerable people. Newsom reiterated Tuesday that Trump \"chose escalation.\"\n\nTrump's \"agents are arresting dishwashers, gardeners, day laborers, and seamstresses. That's just weakness. Weakness masquerading as strength,\" Newsom said.\n\nTrump has called Newsom \"grossly incompetent\" and suggested the governor should be arrested. The president has also insisted that service members deployed to California are \"defending the republic itself\" and helping the administration \"liberate\" the city of Los Angeles.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump said from the White House that he planned to respond to any protests, including against his June 14 military parade, with \"force.\"\n\nWere there riots in LA last night?\n\nProtests in Los Angeles were relatively peaceful when they began on Friday, but escalated into scenes of chaos, with electric vehicles lit aflame, large clouds of tear gas and clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators. Bass countered with the curfew, which she said she expects will last for several days.\n\nThe curfew does not apply to residents who live in the designated area, people experiencing homelessness, credentialed media, or public safety and emergency personnel, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell. The police chief noted that there has been an escalation of \"unlawful and dangerous behavior\" since Saturday.\n\nTrump has called the behavior \"riots.\"\n\nExperts say while there are legal definitions for a riot, the term has become increasingly politicized and encapsulates a wide variety of incidents. In most states including California, the key determinator lies in whether multiple people are involved and whether they are committing acts of violence, Brian Higgins, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said.\n\n\"One person is not a riot and neither is a group that is nonviolent,\" he said. \"They can even be breaking the law, like refusing to disperse. It's when you add in the factor of violence that it becomes a riot.\"\n\nThere are some gray areas, he said. Experts also said that while violence is a defining factor in a riot, such violence could be incited by law enforcement.

Young Municipal Center, and in the evening, the Association of the United States Army is throwing a formal ball.\n\nFor Detroiters old enough to remember, what's unfolding in L.A. brings up bad memories.\n\nIn 1967 and 1968, National Guard troops were mobilized in separate incidents when protests, then referred to as riots, turned deadly. In both cases, however, Michigan's governor — not the president — deployed the soldiers.\n\nMore recently, toward the end of Trump's first term as president, protesters took to the streets in multiple Michigan cities to march against racial injustice and police brutality after George Floyd, a Black man in Minnesota, was killed by a white police officer.\n\nIn Grand Rapids, the protests turned violent, with demonstrators busting windows and setting fire to cars and government offices. In Detroit, residents and police were on edge for months as the protests unfolded daily. Police and protesters clashed multiple times, and the city ended up paying out a $1 million settlement amid a lawsuit from protesters over police tactics. Police leadership denounced the move and overwhelmingly stood behind the actions of its officers.\n\nThe Detroit Police Department, when asked about current protests, said that if anything arose that required a public safety response, it would act.\n\nDerusha said his group's work and that of their partners are \"explicitly\" nonviolent and even planned to be family-friendly. His organizers in Lansing have been in touch with local and state police; there have been numerous trainings done on de-escalating protests and lots of conversation around it, given the incidents in L.A., he said.\n\nThose clashes in L.A. are meant as a scare tactic by the government, he said. The activist events are focused on coming together and building community.\n\n\"It's an attempt to give levity and redirect to joy,\" he said.\n\nOrganizations, including the No Kings website, have encouraged protesters to keep their actions out of Washington, D.C.\n\nOn Saturday, the Army's 250th birthday, the Army is holding what Trump has called a \"big beautiful parade\" in Washington, D.C., with tanks and other military vehicles set to roll along the National Mall.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Republican president said in the Oval Office that during the parade, demonstrators would be met with \"very heavy force.\" Later, at Fort Bragg in North Carolina he added \"we will liberate Los Angeles,\" describing protests there as a \"foreign invasion.\"\n\nSome politicians have characterized the parade as a display of force more associated with a dictatorship than a democracy. And some protesters pointed out Saturday is Trump's 79th birthday, raising the question whether the celebration is for America or the president.\n\nDeploying the Marines\n\nTo stop protests in California, Trump federalized 4,000 National Guard troops.\n\nAnd, in an even more unusual move, he deployed 700 Marines to Los Angeles, where television news has shown confrontations between protesters and police that have included burning cars and rubber bullets.\n\nMeanwhile, California Gov. Gavin Newsom — who has called the use of troops a presidential \"abuse of power\" and a \"step toward authoritarianism\" — is arguing in court that Trump and other federal officials are violating the Constitution.\n\nThe Democratic governor accused Trump of \"intentionally causing chaos, terrorizing communities, and endangering the principles of our great democracy\" and attempting to \"usurp state authority.\"\n\nNewsom called Trump's order unprecedented, adding that the \"military presence inflamed the very protest and violence it was supposedly meant to suppress\" and in a speech Tuesday, said \"we do not want our streets militarized by our own armed forces.\"\n\nJames Mattis, a retired four-star Marine Corps general and secretary of defense during Trump's first term, released a statement criticizing the use of the military as a \"bizarre photo op,\" adding that \"keeping the public order rests with civilian state and local leaders.\"\n\nSo far, in cities outside L.A., the protests against the president's immigration crackdown have reportedly led to some arrests. They have been described in news accounts as mostly nonviolent, but with crowds that appear to be growing.\n\n2 views of patriotism\n\nThe different perspectives of the Trump protests and the Army events that have been planned present conflicting political views and perhaps opposing concepts of what American patriotism means.\n\nThe Army events — including the Detroit ball, which is set to feature a Vietnam draftee who was awarded a Medal of Honor for saving the lives of other soldiers — are seeking to celebrate two and a half centuries of national service.\n\nThe No Kings activists, however, are attempting to recast those events as personal tributes to Trump, a leader who they say has \"authoritarian aspirations,\" and counter them with hundreds of local protests, large and small.\n\nTrump, when questioned during his first term as president in 2020 about tamping down protests, in his own words, noted the law did not allow his administration to \"call in the National Guard unless we’re requested by a governor.\"\n\nBut on Monday, Trump defended his actions, calling Newsom an \"incompetent governor.\"\n\nRetired Brig. Gen. Michael McDaniel, a Cooley Law School professor and former Pentagon official, in his own statement, said the deployment of thousands of National Guard and Marines was improper.\n\nSome have also suggested Trump's law-and-order rhetoric is inconsistent.\n\nIn January, he pardoned and commuted the sentences of those convicted of offenses related to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. He described them as \"patriots\" and called the charges against them \"a grave national injustice.\"\n\nThe No Kings protesters, however, are attempting to turn Trump's appeal to patriotism and revolution on its head, suggesting that they — not the current administration — are more like the colonists who signed up to join the Continental Army.\n\n\"They’ve defied our courts, deported Americans, disappeared people off the streets, attacked our civil rights, and slashed our services,\" the group posted on its website. \"The corruption has gone too. far. No thrones. No crowns. No kings.\"\n\nContact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 orfwitsil@freepress.com.\n\nThis story was updated to add a video and a gallery.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/07/federal-agents-protesters-clash-in-los-angeles-over-immigration/84090942007/", "title": "Trump orders troops to LA as agents, protesters clash over immigration", "text": "Trump ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to combat violent protesters opposed to immigration enforcement.\n\nConcrete-hurling protesters clashed June 6 and 7 with helmeted police in riot gear who protected federal agents.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ordered thousands of National Guard troops to help quell violent protests against immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, where helmeted police in riot gear clashed with concrete-hurling protesters who opposed tougher federal actions against undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe clash spanning June 6 and 7 marked one of the most serious confrontations yet between agents carrying out Trump’s directives on mass arrests and deportations and local officials who oppose the stricter enforcement measures.\n\nSome protesters hurled large chunks of broken concrete at officers, slashed tires and defaced buildings, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Police declared an unlawful assembly and responded by firing tear gas, pepper spray and flash-bang concussion rounds toward the crowd.\n\nTrump signed a memo June 7 deploying 2,000 National Guard members to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. The Trump administration has a zero tolerance policy for criminal behavior and violence, especially when that violence is aimed at law enforcement officers trying to do their job, she said.\n\n\"Left-wing radicals waving foreign flags are viciously attacking ICE and Border Patrol agents and obstructing official law enforcement activities in Los Angeles,\" Leavitt said in a statement. \"The mob violence will be quelled, the criminals responsible will be brought to justice, and operations to arrest illegal aliens will continue unabated.\"\n\nThe clash enflamed an ongoing feud between federal and state officials. Trump said on social media June 7 that federal authorities needed to step in because of the inaction of California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\n\"If Governor Gavin Newscum, of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can’t do their jobs, which everyone knows they can’t, then the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!\" Trump said in the post.\n\nNewsom criticized the military deployment on social media, saying local police are available at a moment’s notice.\n\n“That move is purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions,” Newsom said. “This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust.”\n\nLos Angeles protests follow ICE crackdown\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said 118 undocumented immigrants were arrested during the week in Los Angeles, including five alleged gang members and others with criminal records for smuggling, drug trafficking and assault.\n\nTodd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said agents were outnumbered for hours on June 6 as more than 1,000 rioters surrounded the federal building.\n\n“What took place in Los Angeles yesterday was appalling,” Lyons said in a statement June 7.\n\nLyons, who vowed to continue the enforcement action, accused Bass of taking “the side of chaos and lawlessness over law enforcement.”\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said city policy since 1979 has barred officers from initiating police action based solely on trying to determine a person’s immigration status. He said the department “will not assist or participate in any sort of mass deportations.”\n\n“I’m aware that these activities cause anxiety for many Angelenos, so I want to make it clear: the LAPD is not involved in civil immigration enforcement,” McDonnell said in a statement June 6.\n\nLA mayor: 'We will not stand for this'\n\nBass said she was “deeply angered” about the enforcement actions and that she would coordinate with immigrant-rights organizations.\n\n“These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city,” Bass said in a statement June 6. “We will not stand for this.”\n\n\"We will,\" FBI Director Kash Patel replied on social media June 7.\n\nBorder Patrol Chief Michael Banks highlighted on social media how a rock pierced the windshield of an agent's vehicle and injured him.\n\n\"Imagine if more had followed,\" Banks said. \"This incident is a stark reminder of the real dangers our agents face every day. Thankfully, it wasn’t worse − but it easily could’ve been.\"\n\nFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino asked for the public's help in identifying a helmeted protester who threw rocks at police cars.\n\n\"And yes, multiple arrests have already been made for obstructing our operations.

For the latest news on the LA protests, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Tuesday, June 10.\n\nLOS ANGELES − A tense standoff between California and the federal government escalated Monday, with federal officials preparing to send in 700 Marines to assist the National Guard and state officials saying they will sue the Trump administration's decision to \"trample over\" Gov. Gavin Newsom's authority.\n\nNewsom shot back at Trump over the move to send in Marines: \"U.S. Marines have served honorably across multiple wars in defense of democracy. They are heroes. They shouldn't be deployed on American soil facing their own countrymen to fulfill the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial President.\"\n\nThe addition of active-duty troops marks a significant escalation. It comes as California officials say they will sue the Trump administration, challenging the decision to federalize the National Guard and send its members onto city streets amid increasingly hostile protests over Trump's immigration policies, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Monday.\n\nIn addition to the Marines, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell announced on Monday that 2,000 National Guardsmen would be deployed to Los Angeles. The mobilization of additional troops comes after Trump authorized 2,000 guardsmen to be deployed to the city.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the Marines are being sent \"due to increased threats to federal law enforcement officers and federal buildings, approximately 700 active-duty... are being deployed to Los Angeles to restore order.\"\n\n\"We have an obligation to defend federal law enforcement officers - even if Gavin Newsom will not,\" Hegseth said.\n\nTrump said the troop deployment in Los Angeles is expected to last 60 days, according to California’s adjutant general.\n\nCalifornia governor says 'Trump wants chaos'\n\nAmid moves from the Trump administration to deploy as many as 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is firing back with all tools in his arsenal, including 800 additional officers, a lawsuit and invectives warning Trump is acting like a “dictator.”\n\n“Los Angeles: don’t take Trump’s bait. Trump wants chaos and he’s instigated violence,” Newsom said in a post on X. “Stay peaceful. Stay focused. Don’t give him the excuse he’s looking for.”\n\nNewsom’s move to rally support comes after Trump ordered National Guardsmen to Los Angeles without the governor’s consent and after the president even suggested Newsom should be arrested.\n\n“This isn’t about public safety. It’s about stroking a dangerous President’s ego,” Newsom said in another post. “This is Reckless. Pointless. And Disrespectful to our troops.\"\n\nThe California governor has called out Trump’s moves to intervene in the city while also drawing a firm line with protestors: “Foolish agitators who take advantage of Trump’s chaos will be held accountable.”\n\nTrump and Newsom have often clashed, but the showdown over Los Angeles marks a new low in their heated relationship. In a lawsuit, Newsom says the Trump administration is violating California’s sovereignty.\n\n“One of the cornerstones of our Nation and our democracy is that our people are governed by civil, not military, rule,” the lawsuit says. Trump “used a protest that local authorities had under control to make another unprecedented power grab, this time at the cost of the sovereignty of the State of California.”\n\nRead more about their feud here.\n\nMarines heading to Los Angeles\n\nA photojournalist for the Desert Sun, part of the USA TODAY Network, spotted a convoy of Marines heading for Los Angeles Monday evening.\n\nFive buses and six to 10 armed vehicles passed Park Boulevard near Joshua Tree while heading west on Highway 62 — the main route from Twentynine Palms to Los Angeles — shortly after 7 p.m. At the nearby crosswalk, about 20 protestors were gathered demonstrating against the recent immigrations raids.\n\nThe movement of troops to the city comes just hours after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced 700 Marines would be \"deployed to Los Angeles to restore order.\"\n\nCalifornia state officials have fired back that federal troops are escalating the tension between law enforcement and protestors.\n\nProtests into the night\n\nSeveral crowds of demonstrators circled downtown Los Angeles, including City Hall and several federal buildings as helicopters paced the crowds from above. By 7 p.m. local time, the crowds numbered at least several hundred, snaking its way past cars and graffiti calling for ICE to be abolished.Car horns and sirens maintained a constant background symphony as protesters walked. Police officers periodically fired tear gas or pepper balls as a crowd sometimes moved too close to a protected building or someone threw a water bottle at them.Unlike the previous evening, local authorities appeared to have the area under firm control, although no one stopped people with spray paint from defacing public buildings.There was no visible sign of federal troops.\n\nLawsuit filed, alleges 'unnecessary, unlawful' actions by Trump\n\nAt a news conference Monday, Bonta announced details of the lawsuit against the administration, calling Trump's move \"unnecessary, counterproductive and most importantly unlawful.\" Bonta said Trump's order abused the federal government's authority and \"trampled over\" Gov. Gavin Newsom's sovereignty.\n\nTrump said the guard would restore order amid mounting violent clashes between police and protesters angry at his aggressive pursuit of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. illegally. On Monday, U.S. Northern Command confirmed 700 Marines would also be sent into the city.\n\nThe president pledged in a social media post to \"liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots. Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free.\"\n\nIn a social media post, Newsom blamed Trump for the increase in unrest after three days of protests, saying \"we’re suing him.\"\n\n“Donald Trump is creating fear and terror by failing to adhere to the U.S. Constitution and overstepping his authority. This is a manufactured crisis to allow him to take over a state militia, damaging the very foundation of our republic,” Newsom said in a statement.\n\nPolice on Monday were urging businesses and residents to report any \"vandalism, damage or looting\" for documentation after some of the protests Sunday deteriorated into destructive clashes between officers and protesters. Some vehicles were set ablaze, protesters blocked the 101 Freeway, and a group of them converged on an overpass and threw objects down at police, video footage showed.\n\nAuthorities declared several of the demonstrations Sunday \"unlawful assemblies,\" sweeping in with flash-bangs and tear gas grenades to disperse hundreds of protesters. Police in riot gear were joined by hundreds of the California National Guard troops.\n\nNewsom calls in 800 police officers\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Monday that he would have an additional 800 state and local law enforcement officers deploy to Los Angeles.\n\nNewsom said the additional officers are being called in order to handle the protests stemming from the face-offs between protestors and national guardsmen that were sent in “illegally,” according to the governor’s office.\n\n“Chaos is exactly what Trump wanted, now we are sending in hundreds more law enforcement to pick up the pieces,” Newsom said. “State and local leaders stand together, coordinated and resolute to ensure the safety of the Los Angeles region.”\n\nKaren Bass, LA’s mayor, backed Newsom: “While Washington choreographed these chaotic events, the LAPD and local law enforcement continue to effectively respond.”\n\n700 Marines sent to LA\n\nThe Pentagon is sending 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration sweeps by the Trump administration, according to U.S. Northern Command spokesperson Col Kelly Frushour.\n\nFrushour said the troops belong to the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment and are based at Twentynine Palms, about 140 miles east of Los Angeles. The California-based Marines will join the 2,100 federalized National Guard troops \"protecting federal personnel and federal property in the greater Los Angeles area,\" Frushour added.\n\nMarines heading to Los Angeles are from an infantry battalion whose typical mission is close combat with enemy forces. But for this mission, Frushour said, the activated Marines and Guardsmen \"have been trained in de-escalation, crowd control, and standing rules for the use of force.\"\n\nThe Marines will be moving out within hours, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe Marines had been on standby since Saturday, according to U.S. Northern Command, which is in charge of the operation that also includes California National Guardsmen. Like the Guard troops, the Marines will be used to protect federal property.\n\nThe addition of active-duty troops is a significant escalation in the administration’s ongoing efforts to round up those who have violated immigration laws. There are thousands of active-duty troops assisting at the southern border but none inside a major U.S. city.\n\nRead more here.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook, Davis Winkie\n\nGov. Newsom files lawsuit against Trump over California ‘sovereignty’\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit on Monday against President Donald Trump over the president’s move to deploy members of the California National Guard without Newsom’s consent. The process is called federalizing the National Guard.\n\nThe Office of the California Attorney General shared a copy of the lawsuit with USA TODAY late Monday afternoon local time.\n\n“One of the cornerstones of our Nation and our democracy is that our people are governed by civil, not military, rule,” the lawsuit says. Trump “used a protest that local authorities had under control to make another unprecedented power grab, this time at the cost of the sovereignty of the State of California.”\n\nTrump authorized 2,000 National Guardsmen on June 7 to deploy to Los Angeles and on June 9 Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered another 2,000 to the city, according to the lawsuit.\n\n50 arrests, 600 non-lethal bullets fired: LAPD\n\nOfficials at the Los Angeles Police Department announced that they had arrested 50 people over Saturday and Sunday in downtown areas that “escalated into significant acts of violence, vandalism, and looting.”\n\nLAPD said 29 people were arrested Saturday evening for failing to follow orders to disperse. 21 people were arrested Sunday on charges from attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail to assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, LAPD said.\n\nAuthorities said officers used tear gas on the “hostile crowd” as well as over 600 rounds of non-lethal bullets. Among those hit was an Australian journalist covering the protests.\n\nAt least five officers received minor injuries, according to LAPD. Five police horses also “were targeted and sustained minor injuries.”\n\nPolice said protest groups used handheld radios “to coordinate and evade law enforcement.”\n\nLAPD said its Professional Standards Bureau will investigate excessive use of force allegations.\n\nWatch officer fires non-lethal bullet at journalist\n\nAn Australian journalist was shot with a rubber bullet by an officer while covering protests in Los Angeles over the weekend, according to her media outlet.\n\nLauren Tomasi, a U.S. national correspondent for Australia's 9News, was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet while reporting on the immigration raids and ensuing protests in Los Angeles on Sunday, June 8, the network reported.\n\nVideo captured by 9News shows a nearby armed police officer aiming a weapon at Tomasi before firing, striking the back of her left leg. Tomasi is heard yelling out in pain as the camera pans away.\n\nTomasi is sore but otherwise unharmed from the incident, 9News reported.\n\n- Greta Cross\n\nWhy burning EVs like Waymos isn't a good idea\n\nMultiple Waymo self-driving robotaxis were set on fire in Los Angeles during the protests. Other cars were also put to the torch but the Waymos have garnered special interest, partially because they're something new on the scene and partially because as electric vehicles, they raise different and specific concerns if their batteries burn.\n\nElectric vehicle fires can burn hotter and more intensely than gasoline-fueled cars, if their batteries catch fire.\n\nThe fires also release different emissions than traditional gasoline-powered vehicle fires, including gases such as hydrogen fluoride, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and metal-based particulates.\n\nEV fires are also more difficult to put out than ones in gasoline-powered cars and require different firefighting techniques, which firefighters are trained on.\n\n- Elizabeth Weise\n\nGlendale scraps deal with ICE\n\nThe City of Glendale, about 9 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, announced it would be terminating its contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold federal immigration detainees at the local police facility, city officials said in a news release Sunday night. ICE’s agreement with Glendale had been in place since 2007, according to the release.\n\n“(The) City recognizes that public perception of the ICE contract—no matter how limited or carefully managed, no matter the good—has become divisive,” the statement said.\n\nOn Monday, the Department of Homeland Security responded to the announcement on X, saying ”Glendale’s politicians stand with criminal illegal aliens, including gang members, rapists, and murderers over American citizens.”\n\n“It is deeply disturbing that sanctuary politicians in Glendale, California, would terminate an agreement to hold ICE detainees and violent criminals — which the city has had with DHS for more than 15 years — just as violent rioters are looting and defacing Los Angeles and assaulting federal law enforcement,” DHS said.\n\n- Victoria Valenzuela\n\nCelebs speak out on LA protests\n\nSeveral stars have taken to social media to share information and resources, and to criticize the federal response to what they called peaceful demonstrations in Los Angeles.\n\nOn June 8, Billie Eilish's brother and collaborator, Finneas, posted on his Instagram story about the protests, cursing at ICE and sharing that he attended a protest and was immediately met with force.\n\n\"Tear gassed almost immediately at the very peaceful protest downtown ‒ they're inciting this,\" wrote the songwriter, an LA native.\n\n-Taijuan Moorman\n\nCalifornia to sue Trump administration over National Guard deployment\n\nBonta, the California attorney general, confirmed June 9 that the state plans to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its \"unlawful\" decision to deploy National Guard troops in Los Angeles against Newsom's wishes.\n\nBonta said that by the time the first few hundred troops arrived in Los Angles \"the protests had mostly dissipated and streets were mostly quiet and calm.\" After the troops were deployed, Bonta said the situation escalated and unrest grew, \"causing highways to close and putting people in danger.\"\n\nThe order violated the 10th Amendment and failed to meet the criteria required to invoke the law, according to the attorney general. Bonta said the move marks the first time a president has invoked this statute since President Richard Nixon ordered the National Guard to deliver mail during the 1970 Postal Service Strike.\n\n\"They unlawfully invoked a law that's intended to prevent an invasion by a foreign nation or a rebellion or local and state law enforcement make it so that the laws of the United States cannot be executed,\" Bonta said. \"Those are the only three triggers that would provide for the invocation of the National Guard, and none of them were present here.\"\n\nWhen asked about Trump's suggestion that Newsom should be arrested, Bonta defended the governor's actions and downplayed the possibility.\n\n\"It is the president and the Trump administration that is consistently and frequently, blatantly and brazenly violating the law, not Governor Newsom,\" Bonta said. \"So it's a seems to be more of bluster and threat.\"\n\nSan Francisco joins in protests\n\nIn San Francisco, three separate protests against immigration arrests were scheduled for Monday, June 9.\n\nThe first took place at noon at the California State Building, a few blocks from City Hall. It was called by the Service Employees International Union, whose California president, David Huerta, was arrested Friday in the Los Angeles protests. Attendees were urged to wear their union colors.\n\nA second protest was scheduled to be held at San Francisco City Hall at 4 p.m. local time and was organized by multiple local progressive groups.\n\nFinally, at 6 p.m. a protest was scheduled to be held at the 24th street BART subway plaza in San Francisco’s Mission District, which is the heart of the city’s Hispanic community.\n\nThe protests in San Francisco come as several Waymo self-driving taxis were attacked and burned in Los Angeles during protests on Saturday, June 7. The city in Northern California is home to the largest number of the self-driving cars, where they are a common sight on roadways.\n\nWaymo told USA TODAY while the company was still operating and serving riders in San Francisco, out of an abundance of caution it was limiting trips in certain areas where protesters may be gathering.\n\n- Elizabeth Weise\n\nLA day laborers don't fear ICE raids\n\nWhile national attention focused on Los Angeles, it was business as usual for virtually everyone in the city.\n\nOutside the Home Depot in the Paramount neighborhood, a small group of day laborers in paint-stained pants sat on buckets waiting for work. Several said ICE had detained people across Alondra Boulevard on June 7, sparking unrest.\n\nThey said that although they lacked papers to remain legally in the United States, they weren’t worried about being deported if ICE agents returned. Mexican-born Jose Luis Valencia, 54, said if it’s his time to go back to his home country, he’ll go.\n\n“We’re not thieves,” he said. “We’re just looking for jobs.”\n\nLA resident says city is still 'very peaceful' amid protests\n\nLongtime LA resident Ira Long, 67, said the reporting of the unrest has been overblown. Long, a pastor at the Alondra Church of Christ in Compton, said he still remembers when the National Guard was called out in the wake of the 1992 Rodney King riots.\n\n“That was a really, really terrible time. Right now I don’t feel any of that tension or anxiety,” said Long, a retired special education teacher. “But people are uneasy, and there’s a real sense of loss because we have lost people who were a part of this community.”\n\nSpeaking as church volunteers prepared to distribute food to community members about a half mile from where weekend protests erupted, Long said he wants the rest of the country to know Los Angeles is a good, safe city.\n\n“This is a very loving community,” he said. “It’s never been totally out of control. It has its challenges, its issues. But there are also amazing and fantastic families who make this a great place to live. It’s very peaceful. And right now it’s pretty cool.”\n\nImmigration enforcement protesters rally outside Justice Department\n\nDozens of protesters rallied outside the Justice Department’s headquarters in Washington to criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Los Angeles, where Trump deployed the National Guard.\n\n“Enough of these mass ICE raids who are sweeping up innocent people,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said June 9. “Enough of the undermining of due process.”\n\nThe Service Employees International Union organized the protest after the union’s California president, David Huerta, was arrested in the Los Angeles protests. Bill Essayli, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, told KNBC, Huerta allegedly obstructed law enforcement vehicles from getting into a facility where they were conducting a search warrant, citing video of the arrest.\n\n“They tried to move him and then he got into a physical altercation with one of our agents and he resisted and he had to be pepper sprayed and subdued,” Essayli said.\n\nParticipants at the Justice Department protest held signs that said, “Free David. End ICE Raids” and “Justice for David Huerta Now.”\n\nThe rally was one of more than a dozen scheduled in cities across the U.S. to demand Huerta’s release and an end to workplace immigration raids, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\n'I would': Trump says he'd arrest Newsom\n\nAmid the mounting legal clash between the federal government and the state of California, Trump suggested that his border czar Tom Homan should arrest Newsom.\n\n“I would do it … I think it’s great,” Trump said when asked if Homan should arrest the governor, who has challenged the administration’s mobilization of National Guard troops to crack down on violent protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles.\n\nArresting Newsom, who responded to Homan’s threat by daring the feds to arrest him in a June 8 social media post, would represent a major escalation of the state’s widening rift with the Trump administration.\n\n− Davis Winkie\n\nNewsom warns that Trump could try federalizing Guard 'in any state'\n\nLAPD Chief Jim McDonnell called the outbreak of violence \"disgusting\" and said it had grown worse Saturday. He said he does not believe the same people who were genuinely protesting immigration policy were involved in the violence.\n\nNewsom warned that violent protesters would be arrested and prosecuted. He also kept up his social media attack on Trump, saying California \"didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved\" and that unrest is \"exactly\" what Trump wanted.\n\n\"Let’s get this straight: 1) Local law enforcement didn’t need help. 2) Trump sent troops anyway — to manufacture chaos and violence. 3) Trump succeeded,\" Newsom wrote. \"4) Now things are destabilized and we need to send in more law enforcement just to clean up Trump’s mess.\"\n\nFamilies of detainees plead for release of loved ones\n\nFamily members of several people detained last week in an ICE sweep pleaded for the release of their loved ones at a press conference Monday. Elaina Jung Hee Vermeulen, with the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, said she attempted on Sunday to meet with some of the detained warehouse workers.\n\n\"Instead of allowing me to meet with community members, they jumped onto trucks in riot gear,\" she said. Vermeulen urged local leaders to protect the rights of working class immigrants and said ICE must be banned from entering workplaces.\n\n\"Every single person who is here, who is figintg for a better life for their family, deserves to have their rights protected,\" she said.\n\nNoem explains reversal on federalizing National Guard\n\nAs South Dakota governor in February 2024, Kristi Noem threatened then-President Joe Biden when Democrats said he should federalize the National Guard in Texas to disrupt that state governor's anti-immigration efforts.\n\nIf he did, Noem warned, Biden would be mounting a “direct attack on states’ rights,” and sparking a “war” between Washington and Republican-led state governments, she said in a Feb. 6, 2024 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\nOn June 8, Noem − now Trump's Homeland Security secretary − cheered Trump for doing the same thing to the Democratic governor of the state of California.\n\nOn CBS News' Face the Nation Sunday, Noem explained her reversal by saying, \"Governor Newsom has proven that he makes bad decisions.\" Read more here.\n\n− Josh Meyer\n\n‘Trump didn’t start’ riots: California sheriff rips Harris’ comments\n\nA California sheriff running for governor isn’t pleased with former Vice President Kamala Harris’ reaction to the explosive protests. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said in a June 8 post on X that Trump is \"not out there lighting cars on fire, hurling projectiles at law enforcement or blocking freeways.”\n\nThe sheriff, whose county is just north of San Diego and the fourth-most populous county in the state, was responding to Harris’ earlier statement where she said the deployment of the National Guard was \"meant to provoke chaos.”\n\nHarris, who is mulling a bid for California governor next year, put much of the blame on the Trump administration’s ICE raids and a \"cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division.\"\n\nBianco, who is also running for governor in 2026, is a long-standing Trump supporter who gained a bit of attention in 2021 for vowing not to enforce COVID-19 vaccine mandates in his office.\n\nHe said Sunday the former VP’s comments were “an embarrassment.\"\n\n“The Democrats and their ‘leaders’ own this,” Bianco added.\n\n− Phillip M. Bailey\n\nLatinas for Trump co-founder blasts Trump immigration policy\n\nFlorida state Sen. Ileana Garcia, who co-founded the group Latinas for Trump, criticized his administration's recent immigration enforcement actions as “unacceptable and inhumane” in a post on X.\n\nHer remarks come as federal agents have arrested immigrants in courthouses across the U.S., including Florida, stripping them of due process protections, as NBC News reported.\n\n“I understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings − in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims − all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal,” she wrote in her post, referring to White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.\n\nShe said she stands with Florida Republican Rep. María Elvira Salazar, who wrote in a statement June 6 that “anyone with a pending asylum case, status-adjustment petition, or similar claim deserves to go through the legal process.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBorder czar denies threatening to arrest Newsom\n\nTrump border czar Tom Homan on Monday denied ever calling for the arrest of Newsom. Homan told Fox News that he was asked if Newsom or Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass could be arrested and Homan responded that, if they commit a crime, they could be arrested.\n\n“There was no discussion about arresting Newsom,” Homan said.\n\nNewsom had addressed the issue on social media, saying that \"Trump’s border czar is threatening to arrest me for speaking out. Come and get me, tough guy. I don't give a damn. It won’t stop me from standing up for California.\"\n\nProtesters flee tear gas grenades\n\nAt 8 p.m. local time on Sunday, authorities declared the protest to be an unlawful assembly and moved in aggressively with flash-bangs and tear gas grenades.\n\nThat sent hundreds of people running, their eyes streaming with tears. Helicopters clattered overhead as protesters fled the area to the honking of car horns and periodic cheers.\n\nAccording to preliminary information, police said at least 10 people have been arrested and three officers were injured during protests on Sunday. California Highway Patrol arrested 17 people on the 101 Freeway, police said. On Saturday, police arrested 29 people.\n\nRecent ICE sweeps sparked protests in Los Angeles\n\nThe protests began Friday after Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps in the area resulted in more than 40 arrests. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, defended the raids and said those arrested by ICE included a Vietnamese man convicted of second-degree murder, an Ecuadoran man convicted of possession of five kilograms of cocaine, and a Filipino man convicted of sexual offenses.\n\n\"These rioters in Los Angeles are fighting to keep rapists, murderers and other violent criminals loose on Los Angeles streets,\" McLaughlin said in a statement. \"Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer.\"\n\n60 arrested after San Francisco protest\n\nProtests against immigration enforcement policies were not limited to the Los Angeles area. In San Francisco, a demonstration that drew hundreds ended with violence and about 60 arrests, police said.\n\n\"Individuals in the group became violent and began to commit crimes ranging from assault to felony vandalism and causing property damage,\" San Francisco police said in a statement. An unlawful assembly was declared and many left the scene while others vandalized buildings and police cars. Two officers suffered non-life-threatening injuries.\n\n\"Individuals are always free to exercise their First Amendment rights in San Francisco but violence especially against SFPD officers - will never be tolerated,\" the statement said.\n\nVideos show Waymo cars on fire amid LA protests; service reportedly suspended\n\nLos Angeles protesters set fire to Waymo self-driving cars\n\nPhotos and videos show several Waymo self-driving cars being torched during the protests. The LAPD said one street had been closed indefinitely after \"multiple autonomous vehicles\" had been set on fire.\n\nFootage shared on social media captured several of Waymo driverless taxis engulfed in flames in the June 8 protests.

The 11-year-old Boeing 787 was carrying 220 passengers and 12 crew and was bound for Gatwick Airport in London.\n\nIndian authorities did not immediately release details about casualties, but a video in local media showed people being carried away from the wreckage on stretchers.\n\nWhat happened to the Air India flight?\n\nIt’s too soon to know what caused the crash. Investigations into major aviation incidents often take weeks or months to release initial findings, and a final analysis can take a year or more.\n\nBecause the incident happened on Indian soil and involved an Indian airline, local authorities in India will lead the investigation. However, representatives from Boeing and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board will likely be party to the inquiry because the Boeing aircraft involved was manufactured in the U.S.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nStill, all official updates as the investigation unfolds will likely come from Indian authorities.\n\nWere there survivors in the Air India crash?\n\nVishwash Kumar Ramesh, a 40-year-old British national, appears to be the sole survivor.\n\nG.S. Malik, Ahmedabad's police chief, told Indian news media that Ramesh may have survived what no one else did. However, local officials have not yet definitively concluded that everyone aboard the jet was killed.\n\nMalik told Reuters that 204 bodies had been recovered from the crash site. He said the bodies recovered could include both passengers and people killed on the ground.\n\nRelatives had been asked to give DNA samples to identify the dead, state health secretary Dhananjay Dwivedi said.\n\nA source told Reuters that the passengers included 217 adults, 11 children, and two infants. Of them, 169 were Indian nationals, 53 were Britons, seven were Portuguese, and one was Canadian, Air India said.\n\nIs flying safe?\n\nYes. Flying remains the safest way to travel.\n\nThursday’s incident is the first ever hull loss of a Boeing 787 since the plane type entered service in 2011.\n\nWhile images of aviation disasters are harrowing, statistically speaking, major fatal airline accidents are extremely rare and the industry prioritizes learning from each one to make flying ever safer.\n\nNervous flyers can book a call with Dial A Pilot to \"partner with a real airline pilot to learn the truth behind how safe aviation really is.\"\n\nAre pilot standards different abroad than those in the US?\n\nYes. Countries have some leeway to set their own pilot training standards, and the U.S. has the highest threshold for minimum flight hours in the world.\n\nThat said, India is a huge market for aviation and is generally regarded as a safe country for flying.\n\nThe flight was helmed by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, who reportedly had over 8,000 hours of flying experience. The co-pilot had over 1,100 hours logged flying time, according to CNN.\n\nWhat type of plane crashed in India?\n\nIt was a Boeing 787-8 widebody aircraft.\n\nIs it another Boeing crash?\n\nWhile a Boeing aircraft was involved in the Air India crash on Thursday, it's not clear what role, if any, the plane type played in the incident.

Of course, accident investigators will consider every possibility, he added.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIn case you missed it: Boeing reaches settlement with Department of Justice over 737 Max crashes\n\nWith public perception of Boeing still on shaky ground, it will fall to Boeing executives to address. Ortberg has been trying to move the company past a series of regulatory and safety crises, and was heading into the Paris Air Show, which runs June 16-22, after a busy month that included more than 300 new orders and a ramp-up in 737 production.\n\n\"Previous production issues at Boeing will be very much on people’s minds at the moment and the relatively new leadership at Boeing needs to be visible in the days to come,\" said Paul Charles, CEO of the PC Agency, a London-based luxury travel consultancy.\n\nBoeing shares fell about 4.2% on Thursday.\n\nIn a statement, Ortberg said a Boeing team was ready to support the investigation.\n\nBoeing was deemed responsible for three high-profile accidents involving 737 MAX aircraft in recent years, including two fatal crashes. A January 2024 incident, when a door plug blew off a new plane mid-flight, damaged its reputation and led to the departure of then-CEO Dave Calhoun, as well as head of commercial planes and its board chair.\n\nThe Air India plane that crashed in the city of Ahmedabad is more than a decade old. It first flew in late 2013 and was delivered to Air India in January 2014. Since then, it accumulated more than 41,000 flight hours, including 420 hours during 58 flights in May and 165 hours during 21 flights in June, according to Cirium, an aviation data analytics firm, and FlightRadar24, a flight tracking website.\n\nBefore the crash, airline executives had voiced greater confidence in Boeing's rebound in deliveries and in Ortberg's leadership after years of reputational damage for the planemaker. The public has not yet caught on, however. Last month, the Axios Harris poll of 100 recognizable corporate brands by reputation put Boeing at 88th, same as in 2024.\n\nThe widebody 787 planes, one of the most modern passenger aircraft in service, have never had a fatal crash until the Air India incident. They were grounded in 2013 due to battery issues, but no one was reported injured.\n\nBoeing's narrowbody 737 MAX jets were grounded for years following two fatal crashes and have faced years of scrutiny and production delays.\n\n\"Due to the crash, there could be enhanced scrutiny on manufacturing and quality procedures. However, at this time, we do not feel there will be a long-term impact to production,\" said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.\n\nShares of Spirit AeroSystems SPR.N, a key supplier, and GE Aerospace GE.N, which makes engines for the jet, also fell about 2% each.\n\nBoeing's outstanding debt also sold off modestly after the crash.\n\nReporting by Dan Catchpole in Seattle; additional reporting by Joanna Plucinska in London, Shashwat Chauhan, Nathan Gomes and Purvi Agarwal in Bengaluru and Shankar Ramakrishnan in New York; Editing by David Gaffen, Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Arun Koyyur and Marguerita Choy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/06/12/air-india-crash-survivor-vishwash-kumar-ramesh/84166192007/", "title": "Briton in seat 11A sole may be only survivor of Air India plane crash", "text": "LONDON − A near-miracle in seat 11A.\n\nThere may be no other way to characterize the fate of Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, a 40-year-old British national who appears to be the sole survivor of Air India flight 171, which crashed on June 12 with 242 passengers and crew aboard.\n\nThe London-bound commercial passenger plane went down shortly after a midday take-off in Ahmedabad, in western India.\n\nG.S.

The chopper was operated by New York Helicopter Charter Inc. and was owned by Meridian Helicopters LLC, based in Louisiana.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has begun an investigation into the cause of the crash. In a news conference, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told reporters that dive teams were still searching the waters of the Hudson to locate additional pieces of the helicopter.\n\nHomendy urged witnesses to send video and photos of the crash and asked for patience as investigators identify what led to chopper to tumble out of the sky. \"We do not speculate, we need to confirm information,\" she said. \"That is a process that takes time.\"\n\nInvestigators probe reports of birds in the area\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference that the agency is investigating reports that there was a large flock of birds in the area at the time of the crash.\n\nHomendy said the reports about the birds is \"something we will be looking into.\"\n\nPilot had hundreds of hours of flight experience, NTSB chair says\n\nJohnson, the pilot of the aircraft, had accumulated hundreds of hours of flight time, Homendy said at a news conference.\n\nHe held a commercial pilot certificate, and as of March had 788 hours of total flight time, she said.\n\nOfficials do not yet know how much experience he had aboard the Bell helicopter, which is the model that tumbled into the Hudson River on April 11.\n\nThe 36-year-old moved to the city recently, according to a Facebook profile.\n\nJohnson’s profile photo dated to March 28 shows him flying by One World Trade Center and the public page shows photos of him flying by the Willis Tower in his native Chicago.\n\nThe helicopter pilot was a Navy veteran, according to his profile.\n\nDivers still looking for pieces of helicopter\n\nHomendy said an NTSB team has began pulling components - including the engine - off the wreckage to begin a comprehensive analysis.\n\nShe said NYPD divers are still searching for pieces of the helicopter, including its roof and tail structures and the main rotor. She said the NTSB has not identified a preliminary cause of the crash.\n\nSee the moment the helicopter crashed\n\nVideo taken by eyewitnesses shows the moment the helicopter fell to the water, appearing to twist rapidly on its descent.

They generate $78 million for the city annually and 30,000 flights leave every year from the downtown heliport alone, Jennifer Sun of the city’s Economic Development Corporation told City Council last year.\n\nBut the flights have also been subject to scrutiny over safety concerns – at least 38 people have died in helicopter crashes in the city since 1977 – as well as noise complaints.\n\nIn fact the council meeting last year where Sun shared flight data was called in response to a 2,000% jump in helicopter noise complaints over five years, Council Member Amanda Farías said at the meeting.\n\nResidents and legislators have called for an outright ban of nonessential flights, including sightseeing choppers and commuter flights, which vastly outnumber flights piloted by emergency personnel or media.\n\nTourists opt viewing NYC skyline from the plane or a skyscraper\n\nSightseeing helicopter rides have become a popular part of any New York City tour but the crash on Thursday left many visitors inclined to find another way to view the iconic skyline.\n\nOn a rainy Friday, Maureen Standing said she and her boyfriend, Sean Maurath could “view it from the airplane.” The couple from Cleveland arrived last night into LaGuardia Airport, in Queens, said Standing, 46.\n\n“We got a solid view of it all lit up,” Standing, a teacher, said, as the pair exited the subway by the Empire State Building for a nearby museum. \"I'm apprehensive about flying these days anyway.\"\n\nThe Weiß family from Germany was staying at a hotel in Jersey City, just a few hundred yards from where the chopper plunged into the Hudson River.\n\nBroder Weiß said the family had no plans of going on a helicopter ride. The 17-year-old had heard about the skyline tours from friends but his mother is afraid of heights.\n\n“So that kind of stands in the way of that,” said the teenager.\n\nHis mother's fear didn’t stop the Weiß family on Thursday from ascending One World Trade Center, the tallest building in North America.\n\n“I think that’s enough view from above,” Weiß said.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY\n\nWhat might have happened to the helicopter\n\nIt's too early to say what happened to the sightseeing helicopter, but video of the aircraft careening into the river makes it clear there was some kind of catastrophic failure of the rotor, said Jim Brauchle, an aviation attorney with Motley Rice LLC who has represented families of crashes and a former Air Force navigator. Video shows what appears to be a detached rotor falling moments after the helicopter hit the water.\n\n\"When you see the rotor detaching, two things come to mind. One is there was some type of mechanical or structural failure that made it separate. Second is this phenomenon called 'mast bumping,'\" Brauchle told USA TODAY.\n\nMast bumping happens when the rotor blade of the helicopter tilts too far down and strikes the helicopter, which can cut the tail of the helicopter off and appears to be what happened to this craft, he said. It can happen when a pilot makes too abrupt of a maneuver such as a quick dive or climb. It's not a terribly common phenomenon, but it's happened before, particularly in smaller helicopters that have two rotor blades, Brauchle said. That's common for sightseeing helicopters.\n\n“I haven’t seen anything like that in my 30 years being in business, in the helicopter business,” New York Helicopter Tours CEO Michael Roth told the New York Post. “The only thing I could guess – I got no clue – is that it either had a bird strike or the main rotor blades failed. I have no clue. I don’t know.”\n\n“This is horrific,” Roth said. “But you gotta remember something, these are machines and they break.”\n\nA mechanical failure is also possible, Brauchle said. Metal fatigue can set in with the rotors after they're used for a long time. Brauchle said tourism helicopters are among the most used because they're out flying for hours every day, sometimes in harsh weather. Regular maintenance is important to prevent disasters, but some parts failures might not be detectible in an inspection, he said.\n\nBrauchle said he helped represent the families of victims of a 2009 disaster involving a sightseeing helicopter that collided with a private plane over the Hudson River.\n\n\"It was this same kind of thing where parents and children got killed, and I just remember the devastation of those families. So really, my heart goes out to the relatives of the people that got killed, because it's just an unbearable loss,\" he said.\n\nHelicopter group says industry is 'devastated'\n\nThe chairman of a helicopter industry group said the crash has \"devastated\" the community.\n\n\"All of our thoughts – and the thoughts of a nation - are with the families and loved ones of the victims during this unimaginable time,\" said Jeff Smith, the chairman of the Eastern Region Helicopter Council.\n\nSmith said the helicopter community would cooperate and assist in the investigation to ensure nothing like this happens again.\n\n\"Safety is the cornerstone of our industry, and any loss of life is a profound tragedy that reminds us of the heavy responsibility we bear every day,\" he said.\n\nStart your day smart: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.\n\nInvestigation into cause of crash continues\n\nThe family was on a sightseeing helicopter tour with the company New York Helicopter, which charges hundreds of dollars per person for aerial tours of various landmarks in the city, according to its website.\n\nAuthorities are still investigating the cause of the crash, but said they believe the helicopter fell into the water \"inverted.\" Video of the crash appears to show the helicopter plummeting into the water followed by a detached helicopter blade seconds later. The helicopter's landing gear could be seen emerging from the water as rescue crews swarmed the area afterward.\n\nAccuWeather said the skies were cloudy with a southeast wind at 10 to 15 mph at the time of the crash.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the New York Police Department, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration for more information into the investigation.\n\nContributing: Donovan Slack, Trevor Hughes, Eduardo Cuevas and Krystal Nurse, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/12/boca-raton-plane-crash-victims-identified/83058434007/", "title": "Boca Raton plane crash: 3 victims identified", "text": "The three people killed when a small plane lost control and crashed onto a busy street in Boca Raton, Florida, were identified by authorities.\n\nPolice received a report about a plane \"in trouble\" and having mechanical issues shortly after taking off from the Boca Raton Airport the morning of April 11.

So far, officials have blamed heavy fog for the aircraft's crash into a rice paddy field where it burst into flames. Two died and 11 were injured, including four foreigners.\n\nThe Fokker 100 jet was 21 years old but passed inspections at annual renewals of its air worthiness certificate, the officials said. On Tuesday, it was carrying 71 people, including 48 foreigners, from the city of Rangoon via Mandalay to Heho airport, which is the gateway to the popular tourist destination Inle Lake.\n\n\"We felt the first bump, then a few big bumps and then (started) sliding very fast,\" said 31-year-old Australian advertising executive Anna Bartsch. Her boyfriend, Stuart Benson, described the landing like \"a roller coaster\" ride.\n\nThe plane came to a stop and they felt relief — then panic.\n\n\"In my window I saw the flames, and it was hot and we knew straight away we didn't have much time to get out,\" Bartsch said during an interview at a Rangoon hotel where the airline lodged passengers after evacuating them from the scene.\n\nPassengers rushed up the aisle to the front door, which was initially stuck shut, she said.\n\n\"We didn't know then that the wings had come off,\" Bartsch said.\n\nThe door was quickly forced open and passengers raced from the plane, some in shock and some suffering smoke inhalation, she said. Once on safe ground, Bartsch said she saw the pilot and co-pilot with bloodied faces and other people with serious burns.\n\n\"It's amazing that the injuries were not more serious,\" she said. \"It could have been much worse.\"\n\nA flight attendant told reporters Wednesday that the crew realized something was wrong only when the plane hit the ground.\n\n\"We shouted, 'This is an emergency',\" said flight attendant Khaing Su Naing, adding that despite one of the two doors initially getting stuck the crew evacuated the plane 90 seconds after it stopped moving.\n\nThe accident has raised concerns about the safety standards of overburdened airlines in Burma, also known as Myanmar, as foreign visitors have flocked to the Southeast Asian country which is emerging from a half-century of military rule.\n\nAir Bagan is one of a half dozen private airlines that fly domestic routes in Burma. After one plane was destroyed in Tuesday's crash its fleet now consists of five planes, including four ATR turboprops and another Fokker 100, which is no longer made.\n\n\"We deeply apologize to all our passengers and to their family members,\" the airline's managing director Htoo Thet Htwe told the news conference. All passengers were paid $2,300, he said.\n\n\"This is the most serious accident Air Bagan has ever had,\" he said. In 2008, one of its planes overshot a provincial airport's runway, spun out of control and crashed, causing the wings and tail to snap off. Many passengers were injured but none died.\n\nAir Bagan has said \"the plane hit electrical cables about a mile from Heho airport as it descended and landed in rice fields.\"\n\nThe Information Ministry said the pilot mistook a road near the airport for the runway before stopping in a nearby rice paddy. It was unclear if the plane made its crash landing on the road or the rice field.\n\nAll fatalities were Burma citizens, including a man riding a motorcycle where the plane came down and a tour guide aboard the plane.

He also began donating a least 10% of his horses' earnings to charities that support injured troops and their families, giving more than $160,000 so far to such nonprofit organizations such as Retrieving Freedom, the Wounded Warrior Project and the Navy SEAL Foundation.\n\nOn Saturday, for the 140th running of the Derby, McEwen will host a soldier who lost both legs in Afghanistan and a family whose son was killed in Iraq.\n\n\"When we realized we had something special with Uncle Sigh, I knew that if he made it to the Kentucky Derby, I had to bring some families so they could watch the greatest two minutes in sports,\" McEwen said.\n\nHe asked Keith David, the managing director of the Task Force Dagger Foundation, for help in finding two families to invite to the Derby. David, whose organization helps wounded or ill special-operations soldiers and their families, immediately knew who to He invited Army Chief Warrant Officer Scott Schroeder of Clarksville, Tenn., and Randy and Cindy Whiting of Hancock, N.Y.\n\nPrepping for the Kentucky Derby\n\nSchroeder was injured in 2010 when a pressure plate detonated a bomb beneath his vehicle. Both of his legs had to be amputated above the knee, and his right arm was mangled by fractures and shrapnel. He's had more than 40 surgeries and has been walking on prosthetic legs for the last three years, said his wife, Laura.\n\nThe Whitings lost their son, Army Sgt. Justin Whiting, when a roadside bomb struck the vehicle the special forces medical unit member was riding in six years ago.\n\nThe family has two other sons, a daughter and a son-in-law, who also serve in the special forces, in addition to a son who is a civilian.\n\n\"I don't think either family believed me when I first told them,\" said David, who will also attend the Derby as McEwen's guest. \"They were so excited.\"\n\nThe Schroeders and Whitings will watch the race from a third-floor box donated by Mike Penna, president of the Lexington-based Horse Racing Radio Network, which has the national radio broadcast rights for the Triple Crown.\n\n\"A few months back, I had Chip on the radio show and he told me what he wanted to do and it really touched my heart,\" said Penna, whose best friend has been deployed three times.\n\nMcEwen said owners receive six box tickets and the opportunity to purchase a dozen more. With 48 friends and family members to find seats for, he was running out of time when Penna offered his box. \"I almost started crying,\" McEwen said. \"I was so worried because I just want to get everyone to Louisville and for them to have a great time.\"\n\nLaura Schroeder and Cindy Whiting said Sunday that they look forward to meeting with McEwen and Uncle Sigh, whose winnings already have generated nearly $40,000 for an organization dear to them. \"It's an honor, especially since we have such a strong connection to one of the horses,\" Schroeder said. \"A lot of people don't realize how difficult it is for a family when their loved one is hurt in war. It wasn't just Scott who was injured — it was all of us.\"\n\n\"When you go through a traumatic experience, you can either wallow around or try to make the best of it. That is what we are trying to do.\"\n\nWhiting said being invited to the Derby is bittersweet. \"We were chosen because we lost our soldier, but this is also such a privilege because we will get to go to such a nice event and keep his memory alive,\" she said.\n\n\"It lifts you up, especially on the days when the world is a little heavier — it's things like this that bring a smile to your face.\"\n\nMcEwen said he can't think of a better horse to make the families smile than Uncle Sigh, who is named for Uncle Si Robertson of A&E's Duck Dynasty. \"He is the neatest horse, nothing bothers him,\" McEwen said. \"There isn't a mean bone in his body.\"\n\nUncle Sigh's trainer, Gary Contessa, said hosting the veterans and their families will be a special feeling.\n\n\"We don't treat our war wounded and war veterans the way we should as a country; a lot of times they come home and they are forgotten,\" Contessa said, as tears welled in his eyes. \"We can't do enough for these guys and their families; it will be really special to have them be part of this day with us.\"\n\nKonz writes for the (Louisville) Courier-Journal", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/03/philadelphia-plane-crash-updates-black-box/78176067007/", "title": "Philadelphia plane crash probe gains momentum with discovery of ...", "text": "PHILADELPHIA − Four people injured when an air ambulance plummeted into a neighborhood here last week remained hospitalized Monday, and the investigation into the tragedy remains \"fluid and active,\" Mayor Cherelle Parker said.\n\nAll six people on the plane and one person in a car on the ground were killed in Friday's crash.

Vance, R-Ohio, were formally selected on Monday as the GOP's 2024 presidential and vice presidential nominees.\n\nTrump announced that he was tapping Vance as his running mate in the afternoon, ending months of speculation with a pick that seeks to capitalize on the 39-year-old Ohio senator's youth and celebrity status among conservatives and who skyrocketed to fame as the author of “Hillbilly Elegy.”\n\nWhile Republicans celebrated as they formally nominated Trump and Vance, the moment came just days after an assassination attempt against the former president.\n\nOne man was killed in the attack at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania over the weekend, and two were seriously injured. A slate of Republican speakers on the convention stage Monday night called on Americans across the country to unite in the wake of the shooting.\n\nGOP lawmakers and other officials also made their conservative pitch to voters and criticized President Joe Biden over the issues facing the nation, with a particular focus on his handling of the economy.\n\nCatch up with live updates from the USA TODAY Network.\n\nTeamsters President: 'We are not beholden to anyone or any party'\n\nSean O’Brien, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, on Monday evening said it was an “honor” to be the first-ever president in the union’s history to address a Republican National Convention.\n\n“Today, the Teamsters are here to say we are not beholden to anyone or any party,” O’Brien said. “I don’t care about getting criticized, it’s an honor to be the first Teamster in our 121-year history to address the Republican National Convention.”\n\nTeamsters, America’s largest, most diverse union, represents workers in both the public and private sector, including public defenders, vegetable workers, construction workers and health care workers.\n\nThe Teamsters union has yet to throw their support for any presidential candidate in 2024.

They respond to vision. For the past four years, they've seen the vision of the Biden Harris regime. That vision is you'll own nothing and be happy,” he saidin his remarks.\n\n“Donald Trump refuses to accept this fake pathetic, mutilated version of the American dream,” he later added. “When he was president, young people were richer than ever before and he will do it again.”\n\nNumerous polls have shown that Biden has lost some steam with young voters over issues such as the economy and his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\n“To all the Gen Zers watching this convention on TikTok right now, I have a message just for you. You don't have to stay poor,” Kirk said. “You don't have to accept being worse off than your parents did. You don't have to feel aimless and unhappy.

She bought our family together after my dad lost his job. At 15 washing dishes and flipping eggs. I learned that there is dignity in work.”\n\nVirginia has been a state in play for this year’s elections, especially as Youngkin, a businessman, defeated his Democratic opponent Terry McAuliffe in the 2021 gubernatorial race marking the first time a Republican has won the state’s governor’s office since 2009.\n\n“I believe this year, Virginia will elect another Republican (outsider) businessman as President of the United States,” he said.

Now our lives are that much more difficult.”\n\nIt was the first high-profile moment for Britt since her rebuttal to Biden's State of the Union address earlier this year.

The firebrand conservative called the day a celebration, hours after Trump became the official Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“The American spirit is alive and well,” Greene said.\n\n“Unfortunately,” she continued, “this is also a somber moment for our nation. Two days ago, evil came for the man we admire and love so much. I thank God that His hand was on President Trump.”\n\nGreene also acknowledged Corey Comperatore, who died while attending Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania Saturday.\n\n“We will honor Corey’s memory by building the country he wanted,” Greene said, adding, “For far too long the establishment in Washington has sold us out. They promised unity and delivered division.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nChairman of RNC calls for unity in convention remarks\n\nMichael Whatley, chair of the Republican National Committee, called for unity in both the GOP and as a nation in his remarks to convention attendees following the attempted assassination against Trump over the weekend.\n\n“We must unite as a party and we must unite as a nation.

Kennedy Jr. met with Trump in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this morning, his campaign confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\n“Mr. Kennedy met with President Trump today to discuss national unity, and he hopes to meet with leaders of the Democratic Party as well. And no he is not dropping out of the race. He is the only pro-environment, pro-choice, anti-war candidate who beats Donald Trump in head-to-head polls,” said Kennedy Campaign Press Secretary Stefanie Spear in a statement.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nJD Vance would be second Catholic VP in history if elected\n\nIf elected, Vance would be the second Catholic vice president in U.S. history, following President Joe Biden’s tenure in the position during Barack Obama’s presidency, the National Catholic Register reported.\n\nVance was at one point a Trump critic. In a 2016 column he penned for USA TODAY, he differentiated the religiosity of Trump’s voters and those of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, saying the former candidate’s voters had largely “abandoned the faith of their forefathers and myriad social benefits that come with it.”\n\n– BrieAnna Frank\n\nDoug Burgum says JD Vance’s 'small town roots' make him strong voice as running mate\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said on X, formerly Twitter, that Vance’s “small town roots and service to country make him a powerful voice for the America First Agenda.”\n\nBurgum, who ran against the former president in the Republican primaries and later dropped out of the race, was one of the candidates on Trump’s vice presidential shortlist.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVance's stance on abortion\n\nWhere does J.D. Vance stand on abortion rights – and enacting a nation abortion ban vs. allowing states to set their own restrictions?\n\nShortly after Ohio voters enshrined the right to abortion in its constitution in 2023, Vance told reporters, \"We can’t give in to the idea that the federal Congress has no role in this matter because if it doesn’t, then the pro-life movement is basically not going to exist, I think, for the next couple of years.\"\n\nBut earlier in July, he called Trump a \"pragmatic leader\" for his stance that abortion rights should be a topic left up to the states. During his 2022 Senate campaign, Vance has said a national abortion minimum was \"totally fine\" with him.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nGlenn Youngkin applauds J.D. Vance for new role\n\nVirginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin on X, formerly Twitter, congratulated Vance for being chosen as running mate for Trump.\n\n“His passion for America's prosperity, service as a U.S. Marine, and commitment to our commonsense conservative values are what we need for a stronger America,” he wrote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden campaign slams JD Vance as an enabler of Trump’s ‘extreme MAGA agenda’\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s reelection campaign immediately slammed Donald Trump’s selection of Sen. J.D. Vance as his vice presidential running-mate, calling the Ohio senator an enabler of Trump’s “extreme MAGA agenda.”\n\n“Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,” Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said a statement.\n\nShe said Vance “will make it his mission” to enact policies outlined in Project 2025, the legislative roadmap of the Trump-aligned Heritage Foundation. O’Malley Dillon also pointed to Vance’s opposition to abortion access and the Affordable Care Act and his past comments that he wouldn’t have certified the 2020 election results.\n\n“Over the next three and a half months, we will spend every single day making the case between the two starkly contrasting visions Americans will choose between at the ballot box this November,” O’Malley Dillon said.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n'He's going to learn from Trump'\n\nAl Couillard, 65, of Florida said Vance will bring youth to the ticket.\n\n\"He's gonna make a great 48th president. He's going to learn from Trump for four years and be president,\" he said.\n\nCouillard said Vance has a lot to learn and there's no better place than by Trump's side.\n\n\"He's in a perfect position to learn it all under Trump and his administration\" he said. \"That's better than MIT or Harvard or Yale.\"\n\n– Sarah Wire\n\nMitch McConnell gets booed during convention\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was booed by convention attendees as he cast Kentucky’s votes for Trump.\n\nAfter he finished casting his votes, he smiled and held up a thumbs up as the boos continued.\n\nThough McConnell endorsed Trump, their relationship remains icy as McConnell had condemned the Jan. 6 attack and the two have butted heads frequently. Trump and McConnell met for the first time face to face in June after not speaking to each other since December 2020.\n\n--Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump officially clinches GOP nomination\n\nIt's official: Donald Trump is the Republican nominee .... In the least surprisingly development of the week, the Republican convention has formally nominated Trump for another term as president. Up soon: A vote to nominate J.D. Vance for vice president.\n\nEric Trump delivered the delegates that formally put Trump over the top.\n\n“On behalf of our entire family and on behalf of the 125 delegates in the unbelievable state of Florida, we hereby nominate every single one of them for the greatest president that’s ever lived, and that’s Donald J. Trump, hereby declaring him the Republican nominee for president of the united states of America,” he said.\n\n– David Jackson and Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nInfluential think tank president backs Vance\n\nHeritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts was speaking with reporters at a nearby venue when the news about Sen. JD Vance came out. A grin broke across his face; he is close with the senator.“He understands the moment we’re in in this country, which is that we have a limited amount of time to implement great policy on behalf of forgotten Americans, someone JD Vance personifies,” Roberts said. “At Heritage, we could not be happier.”\n\nThe Heritage Foundation is the right-wing think tank that created the controversial \"Project 2025\" blueprint for a potential Trump second term.\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nTrump Jr. calls Vance an “incredible” pick\n\nDonald Trump Jr., told CNN on the floor of the convention he believes Vance will be an “incredible” running mate for his father.\n\n“I see him on TV. I see him prosecute the case against the Democrats. I think no one’s more articulate than that,” Trump Jr., said. “And I think his story, his background really helps us in a lot of the places that you’re going to need from the electoral college standpoint.”\n\nVance is a graduate of Yale law school. His memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" a narrative of his blue-collar roots in Ohio, powered his rise to fame.\n\nThe former president’s eldest son, who was reportedly advocating for the Ohio senator, said he learned of the official decision as it was made public Monday afternoon.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nResidency issue doomed Rubio’s VP bid\n\nThe fact that U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and former President Donald Trump live in the same state ultimately doomed his chance of being the GOP vice presidential pick this year.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution doesn’t prevent both members of a party’s ticket from living in the same state, but the delegates from that state can only vote for one of them.\n\nRubio’s team had multiple conversation with Trump’s campaign over the last 10 days about the residency issue, wanting to make sure that there wouldn’t be any legal complications if the Florida senator was selected as the GOP vice presidential nominee, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Ultimately, they weren’t 100% certain there wouldn’t be a problem.\n\nIt’s not clear if Rubio would have been the pick if he lived elsewhere, but his residency ultimately was a deal breaker. It creates a big complication that the Trump campaign wasn’t able to get past, one that Trump commented on publicly.\n\nTrump told Fox News Radio last week that he and Rubio living in the state “does make it more complicated.”\n\n“You do that and it makes it more complicated, there are people that don’t have that complication,” Trump said.\n\n-Zac Anderson\n\nTrump chooses Vance\n\nTrump’s decision ends months of speculation over who would join the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s ticket as he seeks his political comeback in a November rematch with President Joe Biden.\n\n\"After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio,\" Trump shared in a post on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nVance was once a fierce critic of Trump, at times comparing him to an opioid and saying he could be “America’s Hitler.” But Vance changed his tune ahead of the 2022 Senate race, deleted controversial tweets and secured Trump’s support in Ohio’s nasty GOP primary.\n\n-Haley BeMiller\n\nThe VP pick is in\n\nThe first time we will see the VP nominee in-person will be 4:37pm ET/3:37pm CT, at the beginning of the VP nomination process.\n\nA source confirmed that two finalists - Florida Sen.

The first convention session that will run until 4:45 p.m. A second official session will follow at 5:45 p.m. and will last until 10 p.m.\n\n-Elizabeth Beyer\n\nTrump seeks dismissal of all his cases, may not get it\n\nFlush with a big legal victory - dismissal of his criminal case for retaining classified documents after leaving office - Donald Trump is also seeking dismissal of two other pending cases, in part because of the assassination attempt.\n\n\"As we move forward in Uniting our Nation after the horrific events on Saturday, this dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.\n\nThe government is likely to appeal a federal judge's dismissal of the case in which Trump was accused of mishandling classified documents.\n\nThere are no plans to dismiss pending cases in Washington, D.C., and in Georgia that charge Trump with a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has already been convicted in the New York hush money case, and is awaiting sentencing.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump claimed that all of the cases against him are politically motivated. He said: \"Let us come together to END all Weaponization of our Justice System, and Make America Great Again!\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTrump likely to announce running mate today\n\nWe will likely get a Trump running mate today.\n\nSources said the schedule calls for a vice presidential nomination shortly after 3:30 p.m., local time; Trump may make an announcement before then.\n\nFox News anchor Bret Baier said Trump told him he would announce his selection today.\n\nStay tuned.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nWhat will security at the RNC look like?\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service has “reviewed and strengthened” security measures for the RNC in light of Saturday’s assassination attempt, its director Kimberly Cheatle said on Monday.\n\nCheatle said the agency “continuously adapt” its operations during the RNC “to ensure the highest level of safety and security for convention attendees, volunteers and the City of Milwaukee.”\n\nSince the incident on Saturday, she said the Secret Service has also implemented changes to Trump’s detail to ensure his protection through the end of the campaign.\n\n−Rebecca Morin and Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump classified documents case is dismissed - for now\n\nRepublicans open their convention Monday after some extraordinary legal news: A dismissal of the classified documents case against Trump, a decision that will likely be appealed.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon ruled that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith was unconstitutional.\n\nThe government will almost certainly appeal the decision - though Trump could have the entire case dismissed if he regains the presidency.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTrump expected to announce VP pick on Monday\n\nDonald Trump has yet to announce his vice presidential running mate, and he could do so as soon as Monday.\n\nThe former president teased his plans to name his VP last week in an interview saying that he’d “love to do it during the convention” or “just slightly before the convention, like Monday.”\n\nTrump’s VP short list includes GOP Sens. J.D. Vance from Ohio, Marco Rubio from Florida and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nWhen does Donald Trump speak at the Republican National Convention?\n\nThe presidential nominee traditionally speaks on the last night of the convention, and the vice presidential nominee speaks on the second-to-last night.\n\nTrump may make an appearance and even speak on opening night, on Monday.- Holly Rosenkrantz\n\nTrump says he will tone down acceptance speech after shooting\n\nHaving survived an assassination attempt, Trump and his aides are telling people he will go for a softer tone in his nomination acceptance speech on Thursday night.\n\n\"Had this not happened, we had a speech that was pretty well set that was extremely tough,\" Trump told the Washington Examiner. Now, we have a speech that is more unifying.”\n\nBefore Saturday's shooting, Trump said, “I basically had a speech that was an unbelievable rip-roarer. It was brutal — really good, really tough.\"\n\nBut he threw out that version, Trump told the Examiner: \"I think it would be very bad if I got up and started going wild about how horrible everybody is and how corrupt and crooked, even if it’s true.\"\n\nDavid Jackson\n\nWho is speaking at the Republican National convention?\n\nA list of speakers were released on Saturday afternoon that in illustrated the way Donald Trump has completely remade the GOP as the Trump Make America Great Again MAGA party.\n\nOn the list of speakers: Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump Jr., Amber Rose, the University Of North Carolina's frat brothers who held up an American flag during a Gaza protest, UFC's Dana White were all on the list.Old guard GOP politicos like Mitt Romney, George W. Bush. John Thune, were not.Of course, new speakers may be added as the convention is reshaped in light of the weekend assassination attempt. For example, Nikki Haley, on the outs with team Trump after the brutal GOP primary, is now speaking.\n\n-- David Jackson and Holly Rosenkrantz\n\nWhen is the 2024 RNC? How to watch\n\nThe RNC is scheduled to run from July 15-18.\n\nTrump is expected to be officially nominated by the party for president at the convention and announce his vice president. He is currently scheduled to address delegates on Thursday evening, the last day of the convention.\n\nThe four-day Republican convention begins just days after shots were fired in Trump's direction at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, killing a rally attendee and wounding two others. The gunman, identified as Thomas Crooks, 20, was killed by Secret Service agents moments later.\n\n-- Gabe Hauri", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/joe-biden/2024/07/21/president-joe-biden-suspends-bid-for-re-election/74292559007/", "title": "President Joe Biden suspends bid for reelection", "text": "Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., the 46th president of the United States and highest U.S. political office holder in Delaware history, announced Sunday that he will withdraw his bid for reelection.\n\nThe announcement comes after a growing chorus of calls for the president to step down as he otherwise remained resolute about staying in the race, as well as three weeks after a debate that left allies, donors and Americans unsure about the president's fitness for another term.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a written statement. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nHe quickly threw his endorsement behind Vice President Kamala Harris in a separate announcement shortly after the publication of his full letter on X.\n\nThe winding political ascent of Delaware’s best-known and adopted political son to the Oval Office started with a New Castle County Council win in 1970, a rare Democrat win that year, which took only 10,573 votes to secure.\n\nIn 2020, he earned more than 76 million votes nationwide to defeat Donald Trump to win the presidency, the most ever in American history. He is also the oldest president in the nation's history.\n\nAn influential U.S. senator for 36 years before serving two terms as vice president beside Barack Obama, the country’s first Black president, he twice ran for president and failed before he finally found success against Trump.\n\nIt was fitting that the 2020 election, reshaped by COVID-19, forced the Biden campaign to headquarter in Delaware, nearly making the state an unofficial running mate.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris's official unveiling was at A.I. du Pont High School in Greenville, Biden met with community and religious leaders in the wake of George Floyd's killing at Wilmington's Bethel AME Church, and the Democratic National Convention abandoned Milwaukee for the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. In between were Wilmington campaign events at The Queen, Delaware Museum of Natural History, William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center and the Hotel du Pont.\n\nTen years earlier, Wilmington was also where then-President-elect Obama picked up Biden on a whistle-stop train tour in 2009, en route to the inauguration in Washington.\n\nIt was as vice president alongside Obama when Biden and his oversized personality first found widespread fame outside of the world of politics.\n\nPart of Biden's charm is his Everyman demeanor and not just because of his glad-handing or gift of gab.\n\nIt is also for decisions like having the U.S. Secret Service hang back when he made his rounds at hometown spots like a Capriotti’s sandwich shop, Happy Harry’s pharmacy, Brew HaHa! coffeehouse or University of Delaware football games as vice president, so as not to make them an “embarrassing” event.\n\nBiden (finally) wins the White House\n\nWhen Biden lifted his right hand for the oath of office and said, \"I do solemnly swear,\" he was also marking his sixth decade in politics.\n\nAt 78, he was the oldest person ever to be sworn in and arguably the most prepared, given his experience.\n\nAfter eight years as Obama’s No. 2 and “the last guy in the room” for every major decision Obama made, he finally shook Obama's long shadow when he became the man to beat Trump.\n\nIt started with him beating out nearly 30 fellow Democratic candidates in the primary, the largest field in decades, after jumping into the race late, declaring in March 2019. In the end, Biden became the presumptive nominee when Sen. Bernie Sanders, the last candidate in the race, suspended his campaign in April 2020.\n\nThe key to Biden's win came in South Carolina where he won nearly 50% of the vote, buoyed by the endorsement of Rep. Jim Clyburn. Even though Biden had won the Iowa caucus, his South Carolina win came after Sanders won both New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\nBy June, Biden passed the threshold of 1,991 delegates to win his party's nomination and made Delaware history as the first Delawarean to be nominated for president.\n\nIn the general election, Biden never trailed Trump, breaking open a double-digit lead nationally down the stretch after Trump's heckling performance in the first debate.\n\nWhile the election was not called on election night due to tight races, Biden passed 270 electoral votes four days later, setting off celebrations nationwide and across Delaware. Backyard fireworks were blasting in the city at the same time as fireworks and a drone-assisted light show lit up the Riverfront as Biden, Harris and their families basked in victory.\n\nBiden's busy term\n\nWhen Biden was sworn in at the U.S. Capitol, it was 14 days after the Jan. 6 insurrection when thousands of Trump supporters stormed the seat of the nation's legislative branch, assaulted police officers and caused lawmakers to flee. While the attack delayed the joint session of Congress to officially certify the election, legislators reconvened that night to finish the job.\n\nBiden's time in office began with a flurry of executive orders, many of which reversed Trump-era orders with the United States rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization.\n\nHe marked the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 by signing his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act into law, the economic stimulus relief package that included direct payments to Americans, as well as an extension of increased unemployment benefits.\n\nFive months later, the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill became law with his signature, and in August 2022, the $750 billion Inflation Reduction Act did the same – a smaller version of Biden's proposed $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act.\n\nEarly in his term, Biden's popularity hit a high of nearly 55%, but the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 hastened his already-slow decline in popularity. Televised scenes showed Afghans running alongside American planes transporting some of the more than 120,000 Americans and Afghans from the Kabul airport to safety as the country quickly fell into Taliban hands.\n\nA suicide bombing at the airport during the \"messy\" withdrawal, as Biden himself called it, killed 13 American service members and about 170 Afghans, sparking criticism from nearly all quarters.\n\nThat's when his approval numbers went underwater, hitting a low of 57% disapproval by July 2022 as the country struggled with high inflation and fuel prices as global supply chain problems due to the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine both hindered U.S. economic recovery.\n\nAmong the highlights of his first term so far was uniting NATO and other nations against Russia's war, the confirmation of U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson following Stephen Breyer's retirement and the successful targeting and killing of Al-Qaida leader and Sept. 11 attack planner Ayman al-Zawahir and ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi in separate strikes.\n\nControversies, dissent\n\nThe final year of Biden's term has been rife with growing dissent across the country, with protests surging in reaction to the president's responses – and nonresponses – to wars overseas.\n\nMany have criticized his support of Israel in the midst of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, sparking a wave of protests at college campuses across the country in the spring. Biden announced a cease-fire proposal supported by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June, calling for a truce between Israel and Hamas after nine months of fighting.\n\nThe conflict in Palestine was not the only war to characterize Biden's presidency. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the president and his administration have been staunch supporters of Ukraine, approving billions of dollars in aid. The continued support has drawn criticism from some, who argue that the U.S. should not be investing as much in an outside war.\n\nCritical attention has also come to Biden and his family closer to their home in Delaware, as the president's son Hunter Biden became the first child of a sitting president tried for a crime. A jury of Delawareans determined on June 11 that Hunter Biden committed three felonies when he purchased a gun while actively using drugs. He faces a maximum of 25 years in prison.\n\nWhile the president himself was not involved in the crimes or the trial, many of those opposed to him linked the guilty verdict to him and his administration. Biden said he supported his son in his recovery, but said following the verdict that he would not pardon or commute any sentence given to Hunter Biden.\n\nThroughout his time in the White House, Biden has never been far from home after famously riding Amtrak home from Washington nightly as a U.S. senator. He often vacations at his Henlopen Acres summer house near Rehoboth Beach and comes home often to Greenville where he has been seen taking in a grandchild's game at Sanford School, grabbing a cup of coffee at Brew HaHa! or attending church at St. Joseph on the Brandywine. And whether in Greenville or at the beaches, the Bidens are often seen enjoying their favorite restaurants.\n\nThe temporary traffic backups caused by his motorcade during home state visits have earned a shorthand nickname from many Delawareans, \"Joe jams.\"\n\nHeartbreak in '72\n\nBiden's adult life has been book-ended by family tragedy, starting with the unthinkable in 1972 when his wife of six years, Neilia, and 13-month-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car crash that also injured sons Hunter and Beau.\n\nThe accident came a little more than a month after Biden, then 29, scored a major upset against Republican incumbent Sen. J. Caleb Boggs, a statewide officeholder for 26 years. Biden had become the fifth-youngest U.S. senator in history.\n\nIt was Dec. 18, 1972 – seven days before Christmas – when the family’s Chevrolet station wagon collided with a tractor-trailer loaded with corncobs at Limestone and Valley roads in Hockessin, not far from where the Hockessin Athletic Club now stands.\n\nHeartbreaking photos by News Journal photographer Fred Comegys from the accident scene showed the devastation.\n\nBiden was interviewing possible staffers in Washington when the crash occurred. Neilia was supposed to join him in the nation’s capital the next day to finalize the purchase of a home there. He immediately flew home on a rented plane and went straight to the hospital.\n\nShe was 30. Biden had celebrated his own 30th birthday a month prior.\n\nWith his sons hospitalized, Biden wasn’t expected at the memorial service for Neilia and little Naomi. But he attended, staring down unspeakable grief as he stood beside the colorful stained-glass windows of St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church on Concord Pike in Talleyville.\n\nIn front of a crowd of 650, he spoke candidly about his “two girls.”\n\nOnly 18 days after the accident, Biden became a U.S. senator.\n\nInstead of the hallowed halls of the U.S. Capitol, Biden placed his left hand on a Bible held by Neilia’s father, Robert Hunter, and raised his right in the chapel of Wilmington Hospital, then called Delaware Division.\n\nIt was after that devastation that Biden decided to remain home in Wilmington and commute daily to Washington on Amtrak, which he continued to do until he joined Obama in D.C. in 2009. That’s when he moved into the official vice-presidential residence at Number One Observatory Circle, still visiting his home state regularly as vice president.\n\nIn his 2008 book, “Promises to Keep,” he detailed the harrowing time, saying he could understand how deep despair could lead some to “just cash it in” and how “suicide wasn’t just an option, but a rational option.”\n\nHe remarried in 1977 to Jill Jacobs, and the couple had one child, Ashley, in 1981.\n\nAnother familial heartbreak\n\nForty-two years after the death of Neilia and Naomi, Delaware would once again grieve alongside Biden when Beau, then 46, succumbed to an aggressive brain tumor.\n\nThe May 2015 death of the Delaware Army National Guard major and former state attorney general who had announced he was going to run to be Delaware’s 74th governor dealt Biden another tragedy to overcome with the world watching.\n\nBiden himself had a pair of cranial aneurysms in 1988, the first of which was near-fatal. He underwent a pair of surgeries that year to repair the damage.\n\nBeau was 46 when he died. And when Biden's win made him the 46th president, noting the coincidence was unavoidable.\n\nBiden rises in the Senate, joins Obama\n\nIn the years between his twin family tragedies, Biden rose to become one of the most influential senators on Capitol Hill, chairing a pair of powerful committees, including the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (2001–2003 and 2007–2009) and the Senate Judiciary Committee (1987–1995).\n\nDuring that time, he pushed for NATO intervention in the Bosnian War in the mid-1990s, which was marked by ethnic cleansing and genocide. The intervention led to a 1995 peace agreement and the prosecution of war crimes.\n\nIn 1994, he also pushed the passage of both the largest crime bill in U.S. history and the $1.6 billion Violence Against Women Act, which he had drafted. In 1997, he helped negotiate a chemical weapons ban.\n\nThose years left Biden on a first-name basis with every American politician of note, along with nearly every world leader, eventually placing the self-described “workhorse, not a show horse” in prime position to be picked by the much more inexperienced Obama.\n\nHe was a foreign policy wonk.\n\nOn Aug. 23, 2008, Biden was announced officially as Obama’s running mate as national media camped outside his Greenville home on Barley Mill Road. It was a momentous moment of redemption for the two-time presidential election loser, but also a gleaming moment of pride for Delaware with both state Democrats and Republicans cheering his pick.\n\nBiden’s years of watching Washington from the inside, combined with his blue-collar appeal and sturdy campaign skills, helped Obama make history with Biden’s \"white hair waving like a flag of experience,\" The News Journal wrote at the time.\n\nThe workhorse was in full stride during the campaign against Sen. John McCain and Alaskan Gov. Sarah Palin in the 74 days between his selection and Election Day.\n\nHe led about 90 rallies and fundraisers as he crisscrossed the country stumping everywhere from ice cream stands and burger joints to college gymnasiums and retirement villages, visiting more than 20 states and doing more than 200 media interviews.\n\nDuring his time representing the First State, he never faced a serious threat of being voted out. Not in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002 or 2008. He garnered between 58% to 63% of the vote in each reelection race, a testament to his durable statewide support.\n\nAs Biden campaigned with Obama in 2008, Carol E. Hoffecker, a Delaware historian and author of “Democracy in Delaware,” placed Biden’s position in state history thusly: “No one else except Caesar Rodney, who was there at the founding of the nation, is historically more significant than Joe Biden.”\n\nWith his election as president of the United States, Biden's place atop Delaware history was unofficially enshrined.\n\nVice President Biden as 'last one in the room'\n\nAfter the pair defeated McCain and Palin on Nov. 5, 2008, Obama’s East Coast whistle-stop tour in a 1930 Pullman car en route to the inauguration in Washington pulled into Wilmington Train Station. Two years later, it would be renamed the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Railroad Station.\n\nThousands swarmed the train on that 19-degree day to send off the state’s most favored son, along with the president-elect.\n\nBiden repeated his well-known line, “When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart,” to the cheering crowd.\n\nThree days later, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens was swearing in Biden as 1.8 million people, the largest inauguration crowd in American history, looked on in freezing temperatures.\n\nBiden reveled in his active role in the administration. He oversaw the 2009 economic stimulus and the draw-down of troops in Iraq in 2010 while also negotiating down-to-the-wire fiscal agreements.\n\nSome historians rank Biden among the most active American vice presidents. In 2012, The Atlantic magazine published a story headlined: \"Joe Biden: The Most Influential Vice President in History?\"\n\nBiden’s policy choices have subjected him to criticism. In particular, some hawkish foreign policy leaders criticized what they saw as Biden’s lack of faith in the military. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote Biden had been wrong about “nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”\n\nBiden argued against the now-legendary raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. He opposed the military’s call for a surge of new troops in Iraq in 2007, as well as a similar surge in Afghanistan in 2012.\n\nIn Biden’s final days as vice president, Obama shocked the 36-year public servant in the White House’s State Dining Room with the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n\"For your faith in your fellow Americans, for your love of country and for your lifetime of service that will endure through the generations, I'd like to ask the military aide to join us on stage,\" Obama said, revealing the surprise honor.\n\nWith swollen eyes, Biden accepted, turning his back to the crowd to regain his composure while wiping away tears: “I don't deserve this, but I know it came from the president's heart.”\n\nA month prior, Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Senate paid tribute to him on the Senate floor as an emotional Biden looked on from the presiding officer's chair. The tributes were scheduled to last an hour, but it went on for more than two.\n\n\"There's a reason 'Get Joe on the phone' is shorthand for 'time to get serious' in my office,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said.\n\nBiden's stumbles\n\nFor all his accomplishments and honors, Biden has not been without faults and missteps.\n\nHis failed 1988 presidential campaign was torpedoed by plagiarism accusations after he failed to credit a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock at an August Democratic debate at the Iowa State Fair. (He had cited Kinnock in previous speeches.)\n\nThree years later, when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas, he presided over Anita Hill’s testimony detailing her accusations of sexual harassment against the judge.\n\nCritics, especially in later years and even more so in the wake of the #MeToo movement, blamed him for the accusatory and suspicious tone of Hill’s questioning by the panel of 14 male senators. Biden has since said he owed Hill an apology, adding that he believed her.\n\nNearly 30 years later, Hill would support Biden's candidacy against Trump \"notwithstanding all of his limitations in the past, and the mistakes that he made in the past.\"\n\nThat same famously loose mouth, which political opponents used to paint him as a buffoon, also could be used to his advantage.\n\nLike in 2007, at a Democratic debate, when he said Republican presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani only mentions three things in a sentence: “a noun, a verb and 9/11.\"\n\nLike in 1988, he lost the 2008 presidential primary as well. It was won by his future boss, Obama.\n\nAfter 2½ months of campaigning in Iowa to meet a presumably attainable goal of a third or fourth-place finish against a field of six, he was trounced.\n\nBiden finished fifth with less than 1% of the vote behind Obama, former vice presidential candidate John Edwards, Clinton and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson.\n\nIt was a devastating blow, and it was written on the faces of his family who stood behind him teary-eyed as he announced the end of his campaign that night.\n\nSeveral months later, at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver after Obama selected him as running mate, he said, \"Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable.\"\n\nFrom Scranton to Claymont\n\nBiden was born in 1942 in the industrial Scranton, the first of four children for Jean and Joe Biden, a car dealership manager. Biden was 11 when the family moved 135 miles south to Claymont, another blue-collar town just over the state line.\n\nAfter living in an apartment in the Brookview neighborhood off Philadelphia Pike, the family moved to a spilt-level home in Brandywine Hundred. It was there that he overcame the stutter that earned him the callous nickname of “Joe Impedimenta,” as he wrote in “Promises to Keep.”\n\n“I was going to beat the stutter. And I went at it the only way I knew how: I worked like hell. Practice, practice, practice. I would memorize long passages of Yeats and Emerson, then stand in front of the mirror in my room on Wilson Road and talk, talk, talk,” wrote Biden, whose encouraging father called him “Champ.”\n\nAfter graduating from Archmere Academy in Claymont, Biden became a true Blue Hen, earning a bachelor’s degree at the University of Delaware, double majoring in history and political science.\n\nAfter meeting Neilia while on spring break in the Bahamas in 1964, the two began dating. She attended Syracuse University and that is where he would go to get his law degree, graduating in 1968, two years after they married in upstate New York.\n\nThe Bidens returned to Delaware, where he worked as a law clerk and public defender before starting his own firm, originally called Biden and Walsh.\n\nBiden the underdog\n\nBut law was not for the 6-foot former UD football halfback.\n\nBy 1969, he was running as a Democrat for a seat on New Castle County Council, winning the seat in a Republican-leaning district. He served for two years before taking on Boggs and the political machine the incumbent had built up over the years as a U.S. representative and two-term Delaware governor.\n\nThe underdog campaign lacked the funds and experience to win, most thought. Managed by Biden’s sister, Valerie, who would later manage more campaigns and grow into a political confidant, he overcame poor early polls and upended Boggs by 3,000 votes.\n\nA month later, the station wagon holding his family was struck and his Senate career officially began in that Wilmington hospital chapel cramped with media with Senate Secretary Frank Valeo traveling to Delaware from Washington for the swearing-in ceremony.\n\nPale, but smiling, he became the first U.S. senator in decades to take the oath of office away from the Senate chamber. But he made clear that his surviving family was his priority – a priority that led him to forgo a presidential run in 2016.\n\n“I make this one promise,” he said to the media after the sterile swearing-in. “If in six months or so, there’s a conflict between me being a good father and a good senator … I promise you I will contact [the governor] … and tell him to get another senator.\n\n“[The boys] can’t get another father.”\n\nIn the end, he pushed onward, using the advice his own father regularly gave him as a child: “Champ, when you get knocked down, get up.”\n\nBiden captured and recaptured the soul of Delaware every time he got back up, especially when he did it five years after Beau's death to finally win the presidency.\n\nThis story includes information and reports from The News Journal archives.

Over in Nebraska, a race that hasn't gotten much national attention features a populist independent shaking up a reliably Republican state.\n\nIn Florida, a Spanish-speaking former congresswoman is running against one of Donald Trump's most loyal allies on Capitol Hill. And in Democrat-leaning Maryland, an anti-Trump Republican is trying to carve out a spot in the center.\n\nWhile a large chunk of the national attention in the 2024 battle for control of the U.S. Senate rests in the same presidential battlegrounds - think Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada - several other states that are likely slam dunks for Kamala Harris or Trump also have potentially competitive contests too.\n\nIt's a long shot that the challengers in any of these races will be able to unseat the likely favorites. But with three weeks to go and mail-in voting already underway, the candidates are duking it out on debate stages and in television ads while spending tens of millions of dollars to get their messages out before Election Day.\n\nThe victor in these states could determine which party controls the Senate as each side seeks a foothold in an almost evenly-divided electoral landscape.\n\nWithout a Senate controlled by their own party, the next president will likely struggle to pass the most ambitious parts of their campaign platform. The Senate is also solely responsible for confirming a president's Cabinet officials and judges, from federal district courts up to the U.S. Supreme Court, where four of the nine justices will soon be in their 70s.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nTexas\n\nThe Lone Star state has emerged as one of the Democrats' best chances of flipping a Senate seat in this election. The position is currently held by Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who served in the George W. Bush administration and as Texas solicitor general before being elected to the Senate in 2012.\n\nCruz narrowly won his last race six years ago when former Rep. Beto O'Rourke came within three percentage points of toppling him in the traditionally deep-red state. Democrats reference that race as reason for them to think that a win in Texas in 2024 is possible.\n\nThis year, they've drafted former NFL linebacker and current U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, who grew up in Dallas and played for the Tennessee Titans for five seasons before going to work in the Obama administration. Allred has served in the House since 2019. If he won, he would be Texas' first Black senator.\n\nAllred is running to the center, campaigning on Democratic mainstays like abortion rights while he distances himself from party leaders and pledges to be tough on border security. Cruz is also arguing he's transformed from a partisan bomb-thrower to a bipartisan dealmaker in the Senate and is attacking Allred on immigration, the economy and transgender policies. Despite challenging Trump in a bitter fight for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, Cruz has since been a supporter of the former president.\n\nCruz and Allred duked it out in a tense debate Tuesday night, where both candidates aimed to paint the other as extreme. In one notable moment, Allred slammed Cruz as \"a threat to democracy\" and said Cruz was \"hiding in a supply closet\" when a mob of Trump supporters came to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 after the senator objected to the certification of Arizona's election results.\n\nRecent polls indicate Cruz has around a four percentage point lead on Allred, a split that has narrowed slightly as Election Day approaches.\n\nTexas voters don't register by party, but recent election turnout data indicate Republicans still have the advantage: In the 2022 gubernatorial primaries, almost 2 million Republicans voted in the state while just over 1 million Democrats did. In the 2020 presidential primary – when Trump faced no serious primary challenger and there were multiple candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, giving Democrats more of a reason to show up – Republicans and Democrats still turned out in nearly equal numbers to vote.\n\nDemocrats haven't won a statewide office in Texas for 30 years. But as Montana increasingly appears out of reach, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced it would put millions more into the race to boost Allred, who has already out-spent Cruz.\n\nIt's now ranked one of the most expensive Senate races in the country, according to OpenSecrets. Cruz's campaign and affiliated PACs have raised $90 million this election cycle, according to campaign finance filings, while Allred and his affiliated PAC have raised $76.3 million.\n\nElection Day is weeks away. Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter to stay updated.\n\nFlorida\n\nDemocrats in Florida are hoping two state referendums – one to protect abortion rights and one to legalize recreational marijuana – will help drive enough liberal voters to the polls to help them flip this seat in a state that is increasingly voting Republican.\n\nIncumbent GOP Sen. Rick Scott is defending the seat against former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who immigrated to the U.S. from Ecuador as a teenager and worked for non-profits before serving in the House from 2019 to 2021. If she won, Mucarsel-Powell would be the first Hispanic woman to represent Florida in the U.S. Senate.\n\nScott, who served as Florida's governor before being elected to the Senate in 2018, benefits from statewide name recognition. He's also a former CEO of a major for-profit health care provider who poured at least $8 million of his own money into the race and has massively outspent Mucarsel-Powell.\n\nScott's campaign committee and affiliated PACs have raised $41.4 million to support him so far this cycle, according to campaign finance filings, while Mucarsel-Powell has raised $27.2 million. Like Texas, national Democrats made a last-minute cash dump into the Florida race as their chances in Montana began to slip.\n\nTrump has long had Scott's support. The senator endorsed Trump in 2016 when many Republicans were still hesitant to embrace the rookie presidential candidate, and Scott has remained a steadfast ally. In the Senate, Scott has become a leader of a group of the chamber's most right-wing senators and unsuccessfully challenged Mitch McConnell, R-K.Y., for the role of Senate GOP leader in 2022. Now that McConnell is stepping down from leadership, Scott is running to replace him against Sens. John Thune, R-S.D. and John Cornyn, R-Texas, both McConnell allies.\n\nThe Florida Senate race has been made more complicated by recent hurricanes Helene and Milton that flattened some communities and put federal support for victims in the spotlight. Both candidates have taken out ads related to the disaster and its aftermath.\n\nRegistered Republicans in Florida outnumber registered Democrats by more than 1 million, according to the Florida secretary of state. Another 3.6 million voters remain unaffiliated. Scott has consistently polled ahead of Mucarsel-Powell, though recent polls indicate that lead may be narrowing.\n\nNebraska\n\nDeep-red Nebraska was thought to be an easy win for Republicans this cycle. But independent candidate Dan Osborn is throwing that into question with a populist campaign message that may bring him within striking distance of two-term incumbent GOP Sen. Deb Fischer.\n\nOsborn is an industrial mechanic and a union leader who led the 2021 strike at the Kellogg's plant in Omaha. He hasn't said whether he would caucus with Republicans or Democrats if elected to the Senate and distanced himself from the state's Democratic Party. However, liberal outside groups have spent money to support him and attack Fischer.\n\nFischer is a cattle rancher who served in the state legislature for eight years before running for Senate in 2012. She won her last two Senate elections by 16 and 19 percentage points. She has been touting her endorsement from Trump and criticizing Osborn for not saying who he supports for president.\n\nAs of this month, almost 50% of registered voters in Nebraska are Republicans, compared with only 27% registering as Democrats. However, another 22% are registered as nonpartisan.\n\nOutside spending from national political groups has picked up in recent weeks, and both campaigns plan to ramp up their spending in the final stretch. Osborn's campaign has raised $4.9 million so far this cycle, according to campaign finance filings, while Fischer reported raising $7.8 million across her campaign committee and affiliated PAC, though another GOP super PAC recently bought $2 million in TV ads to attack Osborn.\n\nPolitical analysts say Fischer remains the favorite in the race. But the two candidates have both released recent internal polls showing themselves ahead by a modest margin, so it may be tighter than expected.\n\nMaryland\n\nReliably blue Maryland was on a glide path to filling their soon-to-be open Senate seat with another Democrat. Then former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan stepped into the race, immediately making the race with Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks competitive.\n\nHogan aims to convince some of the state's Democratic voters to split their ticket and choose him as well as Harris by distancing himself from Trump and pledging to protect abortion rights if he's elected. Hogan has long been critical of the former president, saying he has led Republicans in the wrong direction. He has also said he would have voted in the Senate to convict Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nHogan's name recognition – and tendency to clash with his own party – has some history behind it. Hogan's father, Lawrence Hogan, was the only Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee to vote for all three articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon in the wake of the Watergate scandal.\n\nAlsobrooks has worked to communicate to voters that Hogan would still be a Republican in the upper chamber – which could determine who controls the Senate and its agenda, regardless of how he votes on issues. She's pitched herself as a defender of abortion rights and economic opportunity. If she wins, she would be the first Black senator from Maryland.\n\nAlsobrooks has a significant edge in the polls. More than 52% of registered voters in Maryland are Democrats, while only 24% are Republicans. Another 24% are unaffiliated or align with a third party.\n\nStill, the race has become another one of the most expensive in the nation as the campaigns and outside groups spend millions for the opposing candidates.\n\nSo far this cycle, Alsobrooks' campaign committee and affiliated PAC raised $32.6 million, according to campaign finance filings. Hogan's campaign committee and affiliated PAC raised $22.2 million, but he is also benefitting from an independent PAC called Maryland's Future that raised $27 million through September and spent almost $11 million.\n\nLonger longshots\n\nSeveral other races are even more off the radar of national political groups that are busy going after easier targets. But campaigns in North Dakota, New Jersey, Missouri and Minnesota say they have a shot at taking out their statistically-favored opponents.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez's resignation after being convicted in a federal corruption trial left an open seat in the Garden state, where voters have skewed Democratic for decades. U.S. Rep. Andy Kim, D-N.J., won the competitive Democratic primary. He faces hotelier Curtis Bashaw, who beat a Trump-endorsed candidate in the primary and is running as a moderate. Polling from earlier this year puts Kim at an advantage.\n\nMissouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a first-term Republican, is being challenged by Democratic candidate Lucas Kunce, a Marine veteran who previously ran for Senate unsuccessfully in 2022. Internal polls from Kunce's campaign indicated he may be just 4 percentage points behind Hawley in the Republican-leaning state. However, independent polling puts Hawley at a safer distance.\n\nIn North Dakota, engineering professor and Democrat Katrina Christiansen is challenging Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer. Her campaign says she has outraised Cramer and has narrowed their polling gap significantly, according to a campaign-sponsored poll. However recent independent polling from the North Dakota News Cooperative shows Cramer with a safe lead.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., is defending her seat in a long-Democratic state that Republicans have hoped might lean their way this election cycle. She's running against Royce White, a former NBA player who has a history of controversial remarks that have left him without the support of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Recent polls put her at an 8 percentage point advantage over White.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-trump-biden-election-live-updates/74492596007/", "title": "Election updates: Harris raises $81 million since launching bid", "text": "WASHINGTON ― Americans woke up Monday to an upended presidential campaign after President Joe Biden dropped his troubled reelection bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor in the Democratic Party's race to stop Donald Trump from regaining the White House.\n\nBiden, 81, who faced a wellspring of pressure to leave the race after he appeared disoriented at a televised debate with Trump last month, passed the torch to Harris, 59, who soon announced her bid for the party's nomination. Behind the scenes, the Biden campaign machine switched gears to benefit the vice president.\n\nTrump, 78, reckoned with a new November opponent, one almost 20 years his junior, as some Democratic donors celebrated what one called the \"shot of adrenaline\" Harris could bring to the pivotal race.\n\n\"Now we have to start all over again,\" Trump complained in a Truth Social post Sunday evening.\n\nFollow along with USA TODAY's updates.\n\nSenate fundraising arm triples individual donations\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee tripled its fundraising record for the cycle in “individual grassroots” donations in a single day on Sunday, a DSCC aide told USA TODAY, though they did not provide exact fundraising numbers.\n\nOther major fundraising arms, including the House’s Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, are reporting big fundraising hauls the day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nDifferent biographies\n\nTo make her case against former President Donald Trump, Harris, in a visit to her new campaign headquarters, sought to highlight their sharp biographical differences.\n\n\"As a young prosecutor, when I was in the Alameda County District Attorney's office in California, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse,” said Harris, a former prosecutor. \"Donald Trump was found liable by a jury for committing sexual abuse.”\n\nHarris continued: “As attorney General of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges and put it out of business. Donald Trump ran a for-profit college, Trump University, that was forced to pay $25 million to the students it scammed.\"\n\nSimilar to Biden’s agenda, Harris vowed to fight for “reproductive freedom” if elected, take action to ban assault weapons and work to pass the John Lewis voting rights bill, among other policies.\n\n“Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. We here know when our middle class is strong, America is strong. And we know that's not the future Donald Trump is fighting for,” Harris said.\n\nShe ended her remarks saying, \"God bless you all and God bless the United States of America -- and Joe Biden.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\n‘I’m watching you, kid,’ Biden tells Harris as she takes over campaign\n\nPresident Joe Biden dropped in by conference call as Vice President Kamala Harris met with her full campaign staff Monday evening for the first time since taking the torch from Biden as the likely Democratic presidential nominee\n\n“I watching you, kid. I’m watching you, kid. I love ya,” Biden, 81, told 59-year-old Harris before she delivered remarks to her campaign staff – which was previously Biden’s campaign staff – at the campaign’s headquarters in Wilmington. Del.\n\nIn remarks that lasted about 20 minutes, Harris praised Biden’s accomplishments as “unmatched in modern history.”\n\n“I know it's been a rollercoaster, and we're all filled with so many mixed emotions about this,” Harris said. “I just have to say: I love Joe Biden. I love Joe Biden.”\n\nHarris announced that she retained Jen O’Malley Dillon, who served as chair of the Biden campaign, to lead her presidential campaign. She said Biden’s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, will remain in her role as well.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nHarris trails Biden in battleground states\n\nLess than a day after President Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement, the national political landscape has dramatically shifted. While Biden had been slipping in the polls, particularly after his disastrous debate performance, a new national poll indicated that Harris could secure a victory against the Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, in all seven battleground states that are likely to decide the election's outcome, Trump has maintained a slight lead over his Democratic rivals.\n\nHere’s how Harris would fare against Trump in the seven key swing states, according to the most recent polls.\n\nArizona: Polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released. In a Biden-Trump race, an InsiderAdvantage poll showed 9% supported Trump, 44% favored Biden, 4% chose a third-party candidate, and 3% undecided.\n\nGeorgia: An exclusive poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution released hours after President Joe Biden announced his departure from the ticket showed former President Donald Trump with a slight lead over Harris, with a 51% to 46% rating respectively, and a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nMichigan: Recent polling from the Clean and Prosperous America PAC, a left-leaning environmental advocacy group, showed that voters preferred Trump to Harris, with 46% voting for him and 41% choosing the Vice President.\n\nNevada: Polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released. In a Trump-Biden poll that offered a hypothetical matchup against Harris, Trump received 50% of the vote compared to Harris’ 40%\n\nNorth Carolina: There are currently no polls pitting Harris against Trump.\n\nPennsylvania: No current polls show Harris-Trump results but before Biden announced his departure from the race, figures from Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling showed that voters were more enthusiastic about Harris than they were for Biden, putting her only two points behind Trump.\n\nWisconsin: A Civiqs survey of 514 voters in Wisconsin showed Trump and Harris tied at 48%, with a 4.8% margin of error.\n\n-Maya Homan\n\nHarris fundraising boom continues, campaign says\n\nThe Harris campaign announced $81 million in donations in the 24 hours since the vice president announced her bid Sunday.\n\nThis number includes money raised through the campaign, the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees.\n\n“The historic outpouring of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections,” Kevin Munoz, campaign spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nAlong with Democratic lawmakers, major donors had raised concerns about Biden following his debate performance and threatened to withhold their financial support if the president continued toward the nomination.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nSenate Republican campaign arm hits Harris\n\nThe National Republican Senate Committee, the fundraising arm for Senate Republicans, released a messaging memo to candidates Monday titled: \"Harris creates strong down-ballot opportunity.\"\n\nThe group argues that the case against Biden − that he was \"mentally unfit to hold office\" − didn't work well against down-ballot Democrats. But Harris \"owns the Biden Administration's baggage,\" they write, making her \"arguably a bigger threat to Democrats' Senate majority than Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe memo details Harris' policy positions and concludes with a section titled \"weird,\" including noting that she laughs at \"inappropriate moments\" and loves Venn diagrams.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nKamala Harris quickly securing votes to become Democratic nominee\n\nA USA TODAY count of delegates shows the 59-year old Harris is more than 40% of the way to the 1,968 delegates needed to become the party's nominee in the first round of voting. There are 3,936 Democratic delegates in total, including former presidents, state and local party leaders, members of Congress and governors.\n\nAfter announcing Sunday afternoon that he no longer sought the nomination, the 81-year-old Biden endorsed Harris, a move that likely inspired delegates pledged to him to endorse her.\n\nIt will ultimately be up to the delegates to pick the nominee, but it remains unclear whether that decision will come by a remote roll call vote early next month as was originally planned by the party or at the Democratic National Convention that's scheduled to run August 19-22 in Chicago.\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSchumer, Jeffries praise Harris in statement, stop short of endorsing\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries released a joint statement Monday saying that Harris is \"off to a great start\" with her pledge to pursue the nomination \"in a manner consistent with the grassroots and transparent process\" set forth by the DNC.\n\nHarris is \"rapidly\" gaining support from delegates, they said, but stopped short of endorsing her for president themselves.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nVance mocks Harris over debate\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance is already taking more than a few shots at Harris, including her debate skills.\n\n\"I was told I was gonna get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump's gonna get to debate her?!\" Vance said during a homecoming speech in Ohio.\n\nHe added: \"I'm kind of pissed off about that if I'm being honest with you.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nJeffries, Schumer to meet with Harris\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris \"shortly,\" Jeffries told reporters Monday.\n\nThere's no exact time for that meeting yet, he said, but they're waiting for Schumer to get back into town. The Senate doesn't return until Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm excited for that meeting,\" Jeffries said when asked why he has not yet endorsed Harris for president, as many of his high-profile Democratic colleagues have. Harris \"has excited the community, she's excited the House Democratic Caucus, and she's exciting the country.\"\n\nHe said he and Schumer will have more to say about \"the path forward\" once that meeting is over.\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nPelosi backs Harris as the vice president locks up congressional support\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., endorsed Kamala Harris on Monday as she continues to pick up key support from Democratic lawmakers.\n\n“Today, it is with immense pride and limitless optimism for our country’s future that I endorse Vice President Kamala Harris,” Pelosi said in a statement. “My enthusiastic support for Kamala Harris for president is official, personal and political.”\n\nPelosi played a key role in Biden’s eventual exit from the race. The former speaker served as a sounding board for Democratic lawmakers who were concerned with Biden’s campaign. Her comments on Biden that were hardly enthusiastic endorsements of Biden over the past weeks gave the green light to Democrats to publicly come out against the president.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n'You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?' Kamala Harris meme resurfaces after Biden drops out\n\n\"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\"\n\nNo, that isn't a quote from an ancient philosopher or a classic author. It's from Kamala Harris.\n\nAs rumors swirled in recent weeks over Joe Biden's ability to win and complete a second term in office, and following the recent news of him stepping down as the Democratic nominee, Harris (as well as the internet-famous coconut tree) has drawn increased interest in the political sphere as voters look to her as Biden's potential replacement on the Democratic side of the ticket.\n\n− Emily DeLetter\n\nHarris celebrates student athletes at the White House\n\nHarris on Monday spoke at an event celebrating college athletes, her first public appearance since Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nNCAA Sports Day brings championship teams from the National Collegiate Athletic Association to the White House.

You remind all of us what can be achieved with hard work and ambition,\" she added.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIn first remarks since launching campaign, Kamala Harris pays tribute to Joe Biden, Beau Biden\n\nIn her first public remarks since she became the de facto presumptive Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris payed tribute to Joe Biden and his son, Beau Biden.\n\n\"Joe Biden's legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern history. In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office,\" Harris said during an NCAA event at the White House.\n\nSaid she first met Joe Biden through his son Beau Biden. Beau Biden was the attorney general of Delaware while Harris served in the same role in California. Beau Biden died from brain cancer in 2015.\n\n\"Back then, Beau would often tell me stories about his dad. He would talk about the kind of father and the kind of man that Joe Biden is,\" Harris said. \"The qualities that Beau revered in his father are the same qualities that I have seen every day in our president. His honesty, his integrity, his commitment to his faith and his family.

Tom Carper.\n\nHarris is expected to arrive in New Castle County Monday afternoon, where she will meet with members of the Delaware delegation and go to Biden's campaign headquarters in Wilmington, which is expected to transition to hers as she mounts her presidential campaign.\n\nIt's unclear whether the president will be joining the meeting, as today is Day 5 of COVID isolation after he tested positive Thursday. He's been in Rehoboth Beach battling his latest round of COVID and is expected to address the nation later this week regarding his decision to bow out of the presidential race.\n\n– Isabel Hughes and Esteban Parra\n\nTrump's strategy (so far): Link Harris to Biden\n\nThe Trump campaign is making its opening bid in the new campaign against Harris: Linking her to Biden.\n\n\"Harris will be even WORSE for the people of our Nation than Joe Biden,\" said a memo from Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, describing the vice president as an \"enabler\" for Biden.\n\n\"They own each other’s records, and there is no distance between the two.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nInside KamalaHQ: How Harris quickly began plotting campaign after Biden's shocking exit\n\nKamala Harris was at the vice president’s residence when she got the call from POTUS. President Joe Biden was ending his reelection campaign. And he was endorsing her.\n\nHarris got to work immediately. Still in her Howard University hoodie, workout sweats and sneakers, she whipped up a statement. She placed calls to lawmakers, governors, civil rights leaders and union bosses.\n\n– Francesca Chambers and Rebecca Morin\n\nHow to pronounce Kamala Harris\n\nDespite decades in the public spotlight, mispronunciations of the vice president's name have not gone away. Several of her political opponents at the Republican National Convention last week called her \"Camel-a,\" \"Kuh-MAHL-a,\" or \"Kuh-MEL-a\" – none of which are correct.\n\nIt's \"COM-mah-la,\" with emphasis on the first syllable. When pronounced correctly, the vice president's name sounds like comma-la.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nUAW thanks Biden, says Trump did nothing as workers were 'left for dead'\n\nThe United Auto Workers issued a statement Sunday reacting to Joe Biden's announcement he would drop his reelection bid. The UAW, behind President Shawn Fain, endorsed Biden in the race, though Fain earlier this month expressed concern about Biden's ability to defeat Donald Trump.\n\n\"Today, the United Auto Workers thanks President Joe Biden for his incredible term of service, and the leadership he has shown in putting country before self, once again, in passing the torch to a new generation,\" the organization based in Detroit, Michigan, said in a statement.\n\n– Detroit Free Press Staff\n\nMike Pence says Biden made right decision for country\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden made the “right decision” for the country in dropping out and thanked him for “putting the interests of our Nation ahead of his own.”\n\n“After the assassination attempt on President Trump and President Biden’s decision to end his campaign, now is a time for leaders in both parties to project calm and send a message of strength and resolve to America’s friends and enemies alike that, whatever the state of our politics, the American people are strong and our American military stands ready to defend our freedom and our vital national interests anywhere in the world,” he added.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMinnesota governor backs Harris nomination\n\nMinnesota Gov.

Wes Moore is among the latest to back Kamala Harris.\n\n“Vice President Harris has the experience, record, vision, and wisdom to unify the country,” Moore said in a statement Monday. “She will have the unique ability to energize the Democratic Party base and mobilize a unique coalition, and we must rally around her and elect her to serve as the next President of the United States.”\n\nMoore, a rising star in the party since winning election in 2022, told CBS last month he would not seek the presidential nomination himself. On the rumored list for Harris’ running mate, Moore said he had “lengthy conversations” with both her and Biden Sunday.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nHouse Democratic campaign chair endorses Harris\n\nRep.

He quit his law practice in 2020 to take on the responsibilities of his new role as second gentleman.\n\nEmhoff and Harris met on a blind date in 2013 after being set up by a friend and married the following year. Harris became “Momala” to his two children, Cole, 26, and Ella, 21, from his first marriage.\n\nEmhoff traveled to key battleground states to campaign for Biden and Harris before the president dropped out of the race. He's also the first Jewish spouse of a vice president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat’s next for the upcoming presidential debate?\n\nJoe Biden’s announcement that he will not seek another term has cast uncertainty on yet another facet of the election year: The upcoming presidential debate.\n\nBack in May, ABC News announced that a debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden was scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. ET. But with Biden exiting the race Sunday and endorsing Kamala Harris, the debate schedule may not go on as planned.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Sunday evening, Trump called for Fox News to host the debate, rather than “Fake News ABC.”\n\n“Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,” he wrote.\n\nABC News has not issued an update on the debate schedule.\n\n– Maya Homan\n\nAs Biden leaves 2024 election, Trump and Democrats need to court these 10 voter groups\n\nPresident Joe Biden's announcement Sunday that he's dropping out and backing Vice President Kamala Harris shakes up the 2024 presidential election in many ways. Perhaps most significantly: Biden's decision could bring millions more voters to the polls, according to a new analysis of the U.S. electorate.\n\nResonate, a consumer data and intelligence company, released exclusively to USA TODAY a new set of 10 distinct voter groups. From its database of 250 million Americans, the 10 groups emerged as company's AI data engine culled and matched thousands of U.S. voter attributes.\n\nEricka McCoy, chief marketing officer for Resonate, predicted Friday that a new Democratic nominee would likely reenergize Gen-Z Zealots, based on insights from these groups. They're the largest of the 10 groups, which include younger, independent voters who advocate for environmental regulations and LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n– Jim Sergent and Veronica Bravo\n\nUS allies react to Joe Biden dropping out of 2024 election race\n\nPraise, acknowledgment it was a difficult decision, maybe a little relief.\n\nThese were some of the reactions from world leaders and officials to Joe Biden's Sunday announcement that he was dropping out of the presidential race. Biden had been under intense pressure to step aside after a poor performance in a June debate against former President Donald Trump that highlighted concerns about his age.\n\nWhile diplomatic protocol tends to limit what American allies will say in public about an active U.S. election, many international officials applauded what Biden had, in their view, done to give new energy to the NATO military alliance, his administration's support for Ukraine and for democratic principles around the world.\n\n− Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nBiden news leaves some voters feeling panicked. If you're stressed, read this.\n\nAfter weeks of speculation, President Joe Biden ended his bid for reelection. It's a move many voters have called for on social media and around their dinner tables. Yet, the news that Biden was dropping out had many expressing anxiety and nerves, rather than relief.\n\n\"I'm so nervous now,\" one commenter wrote Sunday beneath an @UnderTheDeskNews summary of day's events. \"Very scary times. I have no words. I'm shaking,\" another added.\n\nExperts say the ups and downs of the political world can cause serious stress for people who feel like all they can do is watch helplessly. \"We're in a state of flux, and brains really don't like ambiguity,\" psychotherapist Stephanie Sarkis says. \"They like knowing what to expect, and so this one more thing that's changed. For a lot of people, it triggers a lot of turmoil.\"\n\n− Charles Trepany\n\nHow old is Joe Biden?\n\nJoe Biden is 81 years old. He was the oldest candidate to run for president before he ended his campaign on Sunday.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho is Wes Moore?\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore has yet to publicly throw his support behind Harris, though his name has been floated as a potential VP pick.\n\nMoore, 45, told CBS last month he would not pursue the nomination himself.\n\nMoore became Maryland’s first ever Black governor after being elected in 2022. He's only the third Black person to be elected governor in the country.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho is Mark Kelly?\n\nArizona’s junior senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly quickly cast his support for Harris as nominee Sunday, fueling speculation that he could be tapped to become her running mate.\n\nKelly, 60, has been in Congress since 2020. He is married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who was shot and severely injured at a public event in 2011.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump knocks Biden on Truth Social\n\nWhile the rest of the political world tries to figure out the new realities, Trump took to social media to mock Biden for pulling out of the presidential race.\n\n\"He loses the Debate badly, then panics, and makes mistake after mistake, is told he can’t win, and decide they will pick another candidate, probably Harris,\" Trump said in a series of Truth Social posts. \"They stole the race from Biden after he won it in the primaries - A First!\"\n\nQuestions surrounding Biden's candidacy spiked after his disastrous debate performance against Trump last month. He did win Democratic primaries across the country earlier this year.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nTop Democratic leaders come out for Harris\n\nHouse Democratic Whip Katherine Clark D-Mass., and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the No. 2 and No. 3 ranking House Democrats, respectively, endorsed Harris on Monday morning.\n\n“While Donald Trump campaigns on dividing the American people and rigging the system for the rich, Kamala Harris will grow the economy by growing the middle class and defend our core principles of democracy and justice for all,” Clark said in a statement.\n\nAguilar said in a statement he will “do everything I can to elect Kamala Harris the 47th President of the United States.”\n\nHarris is quickly locking up support from congressional Democrats for her campaign. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has yet to weigh in though.– Ken Tran\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear endorses Harris\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear suggested Monday he would be open to joining the Democratic presidential ticket as Harris’ running mate.\n\n“If somebody calls you on that, what you do is at least listen,” Beshear said during an interview on MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe.\"\n\nBeshear, often mentioned as a potential candidate for president or vice president, endorsed Harris for president and pledged to do everything he can to support her. Harris “is smart and strong, which will make her a good president,” he said, “but she's also kind and has empathy, which can make her a great president. The contrast between her and those running on the other side couldn't be clearer.”\n\nBeshear, who is in second term as Kentucky governor, said while it’s flattering to be mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate, “the only way I would consider something other than this current job is if I believed I could further help my people and to help this country.”\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nHunter Biden shares emotional post on his father\n\nHunter Biden, son of Joe Biden, gave an emotional tribute to his father after he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race Sunday.\n\n“For my entire life, I've looked at my dad in awe. How could he suffer so much heartache and yet give so much of whatever remained of his heart to others?” Hunter Biden wrote. “Not only in the policies he passed, but in the individual lives he's touched.”\n\nHe said that over a lifetime, he’s seen his father “absorb the pain of countless everyday Americans who he's given his personal phone number to, because he wanted them to call him when they were hurting.”\n\n“That unconditional love has been his North Star as a President, and as a parent. He is unique in public life today in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years,” Hunter Biden wrote. “I'm so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho is Gavin Newsom?\n\nGavin Newsom has served as California governor since 2019.\n\nNewsom had been seen as a potential presidential candidate to replace Biden, until the 56-year-old came out in support of Harris Sunday evening. Now, he’s on the rumored list for running mate and is expected to play a major role in rallying Democratic voters around the vice president.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nIs Michelle Obama running for president?\n\nNo, former first lady Michelle Obama is not running.\n\nShe’s said previously that she’s not interested in running for the position. In a statement to NBC News in March, before Biden dropped out, her office said that, “As former First Lady Michelle Obama has expressed several times over the years, she will not be running for president. Mrs. Obama supports President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ re-election campaign.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRead President Joe Biden's full statement as he drops out of 2024 presidential race\n\nYou can read Joe Biden's statement on dropping out in full here.\n\n−James Powel\n\nWho is Josh Shapiro?\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro took office January 2023, after serving as Pennsylvania’s attorney general and as a state representative.\n\nThe 51-year-old has been floated as a possible running mate for Harris given his appeal in a battleground state – counter to Trump’s VP and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow old is Donald Trump?\n\nTrump is 78 years old. He is currently the oldest candidate running for president, after Biden dropped out of the race. He formally received the GOP nomination last week at the Republican convention.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is the next presidential debate?\n\nThat's complicated. Before Joe Biden's decision to step down, he and Donald Trump agreed to debate on Tuesday, September 10.\n\nHowever, that date could change with Biden's exit from the 2024 election and Harris launching her campaign.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is Kamala Harris' approval rating?\n\nAccording to a 538 average of polls, Kamala Harris has a disapproval rating of 50.4% and an approval rating of 38.6%. Still, those numbers are based on Americans' attitude toward Harris before she launched her second presidential bid, so they could change in the coming weeks and months.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nIs Biden's exit the latest episode of the 'worst reality TV show in the world'?\n\nIn Oakland, Calfornia, grocery store checker Erica Guthrie burst into tears when she heard the news. In Philadelphia, the Rev. Carl Day says we're living in \"the worst reality TV show in the world right now.\"\n\nAnd in Colorado, stormchaser Jen Walton wants a vacation \"from unprecedented times.\"\n\nAfter months of a seemingly inevitable clash between two long-known and well-understood presidential candidates, President Joe Biden's Sunday decision to halt his reelection effort upended both the campaign and the day-to-day lives of Americans still reeling from the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump the weekend before.\n\nIt all comes atop years of nonstop political turmoil, and many Americans say they're exhausted, excited, anxious and baffled, sometimes all at once.\n\n− Trevor Hughes, Terry Collins and Lauren Villagran\n\nJoe Manchin says he won’t run for president\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin says he won’t seek the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nManchin, an independent who left the Democratic Party in May, reportedly had considered registering again as a Democrat and seeking the party’s presidential nomination after Biden announce he won’t run for a second term.\n\nBut Manchin told CBS News on Monday he’s not running. “I’m not going to be a candidate for president…,” he said. “I don’t need that in my life.”\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nIs Kamala Harris eligible to run for president?\n\nYes, Harris is eligible to run for president.\n\nShe fulfills all the requirements needed to run for president, which is that a candidate must be 35 years or older, a natural born U.S. citizen and a resident of the U.S. for 14 years. Harris is 59 years old and she was born in California.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow does Harris fare against Trump in the polls?\n\nSome polls show Harris beating Trump by one or two points and others showing her almost neck in neck with the former president.\n\nA Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted between July 5 and July 9, found that 49% of registered voters would choose Harris while 47% would choose Trump.\n\nBut an NBC News poll conducted after the debate found Trump leading Harris 47% to 45% among registered voters. Likewise, a Fox News poll conducted between July 7 and July 10 found that 48% of registered voters would choose Harris if the election were held today compared to 49% for Trump.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden Cabinet members praise his leadership\n\nTwo of President Biden’s Cabinet secretaries – Attorney General Merrick Garland and Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of Homeland Secretary – praised his leadership for following the rule of law and protecting the country.\n\nThe praise contrasted with years of Republican attacks against Biden and his administration. Republicans have investigated the president’s son, Hunter Biden, who was convicted of gun charges and who still faces tax charges. Biden didn’t block the prosecutions.\n\nBiden sat for an interview with a special counsel for investigated how classified documents were found at his home and former office. Republicans are fighting for the recording of the interview, despite the Justice Department releasing the transcript.\n\n“From the beginning of his tenure, President Biden has made clear in both word and deed that he stands for the rule of law and for the Justice Department’s critical mission to protect the safety and the civil rights of everyone in our country,” said Garland, who was held in contempt by the House after refusing to release the recording.\n\nRepublicans have also accused the administration of weakening border security, allowing unprecedented waves of undocumented immigrants to enter. But Mayorkas said the country and world are better for Biden’s leadership in protecting the American people.\n\n“When it comes to homeland security, he has taken and directed bold, innovative, and decisive actions to help safeguard our communities, secure our borders, harness the power of artificial intelligence, advance our cybersecurity, eradicate the scourge of fentanyl, and more – all while standing up for our nation’s values,” said Mayorkas, who was impeached by the House over border security. “It is a privilege to advance his vision of and for a strong, secure, and prosperous America.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nHarris is frontrunner to become Democratic nominee\n\nThe Democratic Party won’t officially name its presidential nominee until its convention in August, but Harris is the immediate frontrunner.\n\nBiden, who chosen Harris as his vice presidential running mate four years ago, emphatically endorsed her to be the party’s nominee in a social media post Sunday shortly after announcing his decision to step out of the 2024 race.\n\nSome other prominent Democrats also endorsed her, including Bill and Hillary Clinton. Others, including Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued statements lauding Biden but without explicitly endorsing Harris to succeed him.\n\nHarris, however, has several advantages. She has already been vetted for national office during her tenure as Biden’s second-in-command. She has also been a part of Biden’s reelection apparatus for months.\n\n–Karissa Waddick and Michael Collins\n\nDelegates will pick Democratic nominee\n\nBiden endorsed Harris to become the Democratic nominee for president, but it’s the party’s 3,896 delegates who will pick their candidate.\n\nDelegates can vote for someone other than Biden even if he won their states’ primaries earlier this year.\n\nThat's possible because of a section in the DNC rules referred to as the \"good conscience\" clause, which states delegates shall \"in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\" The word “sentiment” is where much of the delegates' support will hinge and opens the door to interpretation.\n\nSo delegates could vote for Biden, Harris or someone else. There is no system to automatically transfer the delegates from Biden to Harris.\n\n–Kathryn Palmer and Michael Collins\n\nSecond gentleman Douglas Emhoff: Biden 'a true patriot'\n\nHarris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, has offered his thoughts on Biden’s withdrawal from the race.\n\n“I am deeply grateful to @POTUS and @FLOTUS for their years of friendship and support,” the second gentleman wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “President Biden is a true patriot who leads our nation with honesty, decency, and integrity.

Here's what to know about 2024 convention after Biden drops out of race\n\nOn the heels of Biden's decision to end his bid for reelection amid intense pressure from scores of his own party leaders, all eyes are now on Chicago, where the Democratic National Convention is set to kick off next month.\n\nThe DNC is slated to take place Aug. 19 through Aug. 22.\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/20/kamala-harris-biden-bio-america-ready/74471651007/", "title": "Is America prepared to support Kamala Harris as president?", "text": "Kamala Harris has been on a yo-yo string with Democratic Party bigwigs since that cataclysmic debate performance catapulted her boss out of a sure 2024 nomination.\n\nWeeks before President Joe Biden stepped aside – and swiftly endorsed Harris to be the 2024 nominee – the vice president had emerged as the most logical replacement to top the ticket after Biden wore his frailty on national TV.\n\nAllies disseminated a logic about why Harris would be the natural successor: She could seamlessly inherit the campaign's massive warchest; her law enforcement background is best suited to prosecute the political case against Republican Donald Trump; polling shows she can win; and having been the nation's first multiracial and woman VP could galvanize a new generation of younger progressives.\n\nBut from the start, there has been a hesitancy to fully embrace the country’s second-in-command, with some Democrats openly overlooking her. When a group of 24 former House Democrats sent Biden a letter last week lobbying for an open convention in August, it made no mention of Harris.\n\nThe day after Biden found himself fighting for his future in an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, Harris was asked to assure Black women, the party’s backbone, that the U.S. wouldn’t take a step backward in this election on issues they care about, including economic and reproductive freedom. Her message was far from reassuring.\n\n“Here’s the thing about elections,” Harris told a moderator at Essence Festival of Culture in New Orleans on July 6, during a discussion entitled “Chief to Chief.” “The people who make decisions at that level often will pay attention to either who’s writing the checks or who votes. That’s a cold, hard reality.”\n\nRecent history: Kamala Harris on standby as Democrats plunge into panic mode\n\nThe 59-year-old Harris may seem the obvious strategic page turn for the party as well as a generational shift. Her life has been an acrobatic twist and turn, filled with personal challenges and accomplishments, including political tests in her home state of California similar to what she and the country face now.\n\nBut some wonder whether a country bitterly divided by cultural issues around race, gender and family – already seemingly poised to return Donald Trump to power – is ready for a woman of color to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n“Black women are judged more harshly by the right, by the left – by everyone,” said Aimy Steele, founder and CEO of The New North Carolina Project, which is dedicated to expanding voter engagement and access in the Tar Heel State.\n\nSteele said beyond race and gender, there are other parts of Harris’ life that she believes liberal allies will fail to accept or defend, including that she is a professional woman who went unmarried most of her life and put her career first without having biological children.\n\n“I think we’re kidding ourselves to really believe that we are, even on the progressive side, in a post-racial democracy or a place where these types of things don’t matter,” said Steele, who unsuccessfully ran for the North Carolina legislature in 2020.\n\nHalie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, told USA TODAY that’s “all the more reason to make sure that we stand with her. We need to stand for something.”\n\n“Misogyny, racism and other forms of bigotry are going to exist in this country, and yes, they may even be exacerbated by having a woman of color at the top of the ticket,” said Soifer, who served as a national security adviser to Harris in the Senate.\n\n“But that is absolutely not a reason to cower or to allow the fear of that hate to impede progress in this country, and that’s actually been driving Kamala Harris her whole career.”\n\nOther progressives still bruised by the political backlashes from the Barack Obama years emphasize that they concur: Harris is the face of the country’s future. The U.S. is projected to be majority people of color by 2045.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have long been aware of the possible ticket switch, and have derided Harris as incompetent, socially awkward and responsible for chief failures in the Biden administration. GOP officials suggest that’s only the beginning.\n\n“We’ve not really gone into depths with the record of Kamala Harris,” Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said in a Fox News Sunday appearance this month.\n\nAt the Republican National Convention last week, former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley reminded delegates she had predicted Democrats would look to pass the baton to Harris in the middle of the 2024 contest.\n\n“For more than a year, I said a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for President Kamala Harris,” she said. \"After seeing the debate, everyone knows it’s true. If we have four more years of Biden or a single day of Harris, our country will be badly worse off.\"\n\nDems not fully sold on Harris either\n\nHarris’ opposition is not only coming from the other side of the aisle, as Democratic skeptics worry about her viability.\n\nA former Harris staffer wrote in The Atlantic this month “an automatic coronation of Harris would be a grave mistake.” She argued for a process to battle-test her against others vs. Trump; and said supporters are too quick to write off viability concerns as “racist and sexist.”\n\nA new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey released this past week found 58% of Democrats believe Harris would make a good president. But the poll shows 22% of Democrats don't think she would versus 20% who said they don’t know enough about her.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., warned in a Instagram live Thursday it would be incorrect to think there is a consensus among Democrats that Harris will get the support of people who wanted Biden to leave.\n\nThose individuals, she said, “are interested in removing the whole ticket.”\n\nOther progressives, however, warn that backing away from Harris could be disastrous for the party. Democratic strategist Bakari Sellers summed it up in a post on X: “Skip over Kamala Harris at your own peril.”\n\nA child of immigrants with a fierce, ‘extraordinary’ mother\n\nHarris was born in Oakland, Calif. in 1964 amid the Civil Rights Movement to immigrant parents – her father Donald Harris, was an economist born in Jamaica and Shyamala Gopalan, was a cancer researcher from India.\n\nIn her 2019 memoir, she briefly describes her parents’ marriage falling apart when she was five, leading to divorce. She only saw her father during summers in Palo Alto when he taught at Stanford, and acknowledges she was shaped by her 5’1” mother, whom she calls “extraordinary.”\n\nHer mother took a teaching job at McGill University when Harris was 12, moving her and her sister to Montreal from 1976 until she graduated from high school in 1981.\n\nIt was in Canada where Harris first developed an affinity for lawyers who broke barriers such as Thurgood Marshall, Charles Hamilton Houston, Constance Baker Motley – giants of the civil rights movement, she wrote.\n\nHarris returned to the states to attend Howard University where she flourished in the environment where “everyone was young, gifted and Black.” She pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., the second founded of the historic “divine nine” Greek-lettered organizations among African Americans. She interned at the Federal Trade Commission; researched at the National Archives and was a tour guide at the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing.\n\nShe first entered politics as a staffer for Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston, of California, and then returned home to Oakland to U.C. Hastings College of Law and graduated in 1989.\n\nHarris revealed in her book she took the California bar exam that July and “to my utter devastation, I had failed,” an acknowledged setback for a self-described perfectionist. She passed in February 1990 and began work at the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office.\n\nHer political star began to rise in 1994 with her relationship with Willie Brown, the legendary California politician who at the time was the statehouse speaker, married – although long separated – and 30 years older than Harris.\n\nCalifornia entrepreneur Trevor Traina, a longtime Harris friend and former U.S. ambassador to Austria, said that relationship was a politically formative one.\n\n\"Kamala’s a warm person who has a lot of charm and charisma. And she is the protégé of Willie Brown, who is the king of charm,” Traina said in an interview with USA TODAY. “And I think she learned well from him.”\n\nInfluential San Francisco Chronicle gossip columnist Herb Caen first put her name in print that March as Brown and Harris were spotted around town.\n\nTheir romance continued to raise eyebrows that November when Brown named Harris to a state medical board, along with a hefty salary. The affair ended in 1996, but the pair would be linked for decades and the subject of character assaults into the 2020 campaign.\n\nKristin Powell, principal of Black to the Future Action Fund, a national political advocacy group, said women in politics typically have their dating and sex lives dragged out in public as disqualifiers for higher office.\n\n“The threats against her, in my opinion, will be astronomically higher than the ones against Obama because she’s a woman, not just a Black person, but a Black woman,” she said.\n\nPowell said that same standard isn’t applied to men, noting that for years Trump has been accused of having extra-martial affairs and of sexual assault (which the former president vehemently denies).\n\nBy 2000, Harris moved to City Hall and quickly set her eyes on the city’s top prosecutor job, challenging incumbent Terence Hallinan in 2003. An archived radio debate from that election previewed the sharp-elbowed Harris in her first political battle focused on a backlog of 40 homicide cases.\n\n“We are seeing an erosion of the criminal justice system, an absolute neglect of cases and they’re prioritizing politics over professionalism,” Harris said in the testy segment.\n\nHarris’ campaign sent out mailers featuring the ten faces of previous San Francisco DAs stretching back to 1900. All male, all white. “It’s time for a change,” it read in block red letters.\n\nShe has continued to underscore the importance of U.S. leadership looking like the increasingly diverse country, including earlier this month at the Essence Festival of Culture, an annual mecca for Black women.\n\n“Let us always celebrate the diversity, the depth and the beauty of our culture,” she said.\n\nIf the vice president were to become the first name on a Democratic ticket, political activists such as Powell believe it would be a game-changer in 2024.\n\n“There would be a lot of excitement, not just for her, but when a Black woman gets to the White House, her or someone else, it will be a lot of excitement for women in this country because we deserve to have female leadership,” she said.\n\nYet, recent polling shows Harris doesn’t necessarily outpace Biden in terms of Black voter enthusiasm, which may indicate she is in a weaker position than some supporters assume.\n\nQuentin James, founder and president of Collective PAC, which is aimed at building Black political power, said the vice president’s identity is a chief engine of her popularity with racially diverse constituents, but that more sophisticated minority voters have a sharper grading curve.\n\n“I definitely think that representation alone is not enough,” he said. “People are looking for the meat and substance, and not solely the identity.”\n\nPowell concurs that excitement over a non-white, non-male candidate comes second to certain policy commitments, especially among those who’ve lived through the Obama era.\n\n“We would applaud having a Black woman in the White House,” Powell said. “But before we get excited about whether that's Kamala Harris, we need to understand what she’s going to give us.”\n\nHarris was California’s top cop\n\nA decade before being elevated to the vice presidency, Harris demonstrated an uncanny ability to beat the political odds in a political landscape that, much like today’s national terrain, was dominated by aging white men.\n\nTraina said more than any other time period, he believes Harris’ time as San Francisco’s district attorney is an instructive window into her leadership. He said the city is cosmopolitan and international, but also notoriously left-leaning ranging from mainstream Democrats to socialists.\n\n“There's a tension between the center left and the far left, which I think mirrors the national scene right now for the Democratic Party,” Traina said. “And you have politicians who need to be elected and who need to be able to speak to the center, who understand how to navigate that environment, and Kamala is one of those people.”\n\nShe took aim at the California Attorney General’s office in 2010 after the incumbent, Democrat Jerry Brown, ran for governor to replace term-limited Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was up to Harris to retain the seat for the Democrats, and that election season was an extraordinary one as well. It would become the nationwide sweep known as the “red wave.”\n\nPolitical attacks on Harris included her decision as San Francisco DA to not seek the death penalty for a gang member who shot and killed a police officer.\n\nOn Election Day in 2010, the red wave broke. Republicans regained control of the U.S. House and reclaimed governor’s seats and statehouses nationwide. In the Harris-Cooley race, however, the vote turned out to be one of the closest in California history. Ballot counting took more than three weeks.\n\nAce Smith, Harris’ political consultant at the time, recalls how the San Francisco Chronicle initially declared Cooley the victor.\n\nIt was a “Dewey defeats Truman” moment. In the end, Cooley had to concede.\n\nAuthor Dan Morain, a Harris biographer, points to the win as a formative episode, where national politicians took notice of the upstart from California. The red wave, he said, “stopped at the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada.”\n\nSmith called Harris a “supremely talented, charismatic person” who attracted voters despite being outspent. In an oral history with Capitol Weekly last year, he suggested the race turned on a debate stage where Cooley defended taking both a pension and a salary after retiring.\n\nHarris’ tenure as California attorney general drew accolades from Obama, who cast her as a “brilliant” and “dedicated” campaigner.\n\n“(S)he is tough, and she is exactly what you’d want in anybody who is administering the law, and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake,\" Obama said at a 2013 fundraiser that is best remembered for the president’s commentary on her attractiveness. (He quickly apologized.)\n\nAfter becoming attorney general, it was clear to many observers Harris was aiming for even higher office, taking cautious positions on hot-button issues – or no position at all.\n\nThat would become the basis of Morain’s book, “Kamala’s Way,” about her ascent to the U.S. Senate and ultimately the vice presidency.\n\n“It’s about her way of operating, and it’s her path to getting to where she is,” Morain said. “She can be very tough, she can be empathetic, she can be cautious, she can be unsure of herself, but she’s very smart and quick on her feet.”\n\nIt’s in this period that a friend introduced Harris to an entertainment lawyer in L.A. who would become her husband. Doug Emhoff would become the first second gentleman and first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president. After they wed in 2014, Emhoff’s children Cole and Ella didn’t want to call Harris a stepmom and coined the phrase: “Momala.”\n\nBy January 2015 a new lane had opened. Longtime Sen. Barbara Boxer announced she would not seek reelection in 2016. That left two of Smith’s clients, Harris and then-California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, to hash out their political futures – which Smith has said was less dramatic than some have reported.\n\n“That’s stuff of legends and myths, but not true,” Smith said in 2023. “And at the end of the day, (Newsom) wanted to be governor more than he wanted to be senator. She wanted to be senator… The good news was it was folks who knew each other well.”\n\nIn California’s primary system, where the top two vote-getters advance, Harris emerged as the winner to run against fellow Democrat Loretta Sanchez, an almost 10-year veteran of the House of Representatives. She sailed to a more than 20-point victory over Sanchez in the general election in 2016, with the support of Obama and his vice president – Joe Biden.\n\nA combative prosecutor on Capitol Hill\n\nHarris became only the second Black woman to serve in the Senate in history following Illinois’s Carol Moseley Braun, a victory that came amid a new kind of red wave: That same night, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.\n\nHarris arrived at the Senate primed for the conflict. Her maiden speech on the Senate floor laced into Trump’s nominee for education secretary and future Cabinet member Betsy DeVos.\n\nShe landed initial appointments to the Homeland Security and Intelligence committees, in addition to the Environment and Budget panels. A year into office, Harris’ legal background helped her secure a spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which gave her a platform to grill Trump’s judicial nominees.\n\nShe leaned into questions about special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and pressed future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on abortion rights.\n\n“Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?” she asked Kavanaugh during the exchange.\n\nKavanaugh replied, “I’m not thinking of any right now, senator.”\n\nThe clip went viral.\n\nSoifer, the former national security adviser, said those examples in the Senate underscore how Harris is uniquely positioned to be the Democratic nominee. Harris would be the most stark contrast with Trump at a time when women’s rights, particularly reproductive healthcare, is at the forefront.\n\n“She’s a force to be reckoned with, and I would love to see her debate Donald Trump,” Soifer said. “She would eviscerate him.”\n\nSeveral months after the Kavanaugh hearings, Harris announced she’d run for president. She had served in the Senate just two years. She had not yet written a single piece of legislation that became law.\n\nBut she also had never lost an election.\n\nSizzling debate performance, then presidential hopes implode\n\nNaysayers are quick to point at Harris’ failed 2020 presidential bid, which closed up shop before the first ballots were even cast.\n\nHarris declared in her birthplace of Oakland, near the hospital where she was born; the University of California, Berkeley, where her parents met; and a stone’s throw from where she had worked as a young district attorney.\n\nShe was running to protect America’s democratic institutions and healthcare access for all, she said, to check the white supremacists who descended on Charlottesville and to keep children out of cages at the southern border.\n\n“People in power are trying to convince us that the villain in our American story is each other. But that is not our story. That is not who we are. That’s not our America,” she said as she stood in front of Oakland City Hall.\n\nHarris caught the country’s attention when she went after Biden at the first Democratic debate that summer. She criticized the former vice president for comments he’d made about pro-segregationists he served with and shared with him what it was like to be bused to an all-white school.\n\n“You also worked with them to oppose busing,” she said. “And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.”\n\nHarris shot up in the rankings: she was in a tight race for second place.\n\nBut the momentum did not hold. Less than three months after the breakout moment, Harris’ campaign was sinking. She was down in the polls, and running out of cash. She’d burned through a $35 million war chest and her campaign was rife with infighting.\n\nHarris made one of the most difficult decisions of her political career. With two months to go until the Iowa Caucus, she quit the race.\n\nSmith, the political consultant who engineered Harris’ 2010 win in the face of the red wave, said bowing out of the presidential race in 2020 was the right call and led to her vice presidential nod, contrasted with Elizabeth Warren’s bid that dragged on.\n\n“Sometimes,” Smith said in 2023, “the wisest political decision you can make is actually to realize when you're not being successful and get out.”\n\nThe calculus paid off: When Biden secured the nomination, thanks largely to African American voters, he chose her as his running mate.\n\nHarris’ sharp debate skills served her well on Biden’s ticket. As then-Vice President Mike Pence tried to interrupt her, Harris delivered one of the most memorable lines of her political career that turned into an online sensation.\n\n“Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking,” she told Pence.\n\n“She’s a remarkable leader who inspires certainly all of those who have worked with her closely, but also now the American people, especially women and young women who look to her as someone who gives them a sense of empowerment,” Soifer said. “She’s a fighter.”\n\nSome wonder: What has Kamala Harris done as vice president?\n\nHarris' election to vice president as the first woman, Black person and Asian American to serve in the role was met with celebration.\n\nThat enthusiasm waned over the years as Harris fumbled early assignments, which supporters claim she was unfairly saddled with in the early days of the Biden administration.\n\nThe president tasked her with addressing the “root causes” of mass migration to the southern border – an area she had little to no expertise on as a senator or attorney general. Harris’ team had to bring in outside experts from nonprofit organizations that do work in the region to brief her.\n\nOn a trip to Guatemala that June, Harris came under heavy scrutiny for telling NBC’s Lester Holt she’d been to the U.S.-Mexico border. Neither she nor Biden had at that point. The White House stressed that was not her assignment – it was to work with Northern Triangle countries. Harris soon caved to political pressure. Within weeks, she visited El Paso, Texas, where she scolded Congress to “stop the rhetoric and the finger pointing” and pass immigration legislation.\n\nThe pandemic and the efforts the White House took to protect the president and vice president from getting COVID left Harris isolated and unable to travel frequently her first year in office. The problem was compounded as Biden and his advisers struggled with how to utilize her.\n\nThose episodes were brought up regularly during the GOP convention in Milwaukee last week as Republicans prepared for a scenario in which Harris could be the Democratic candidate.\n\n“When Joe Biden and Kamala Harris refused to even come to Texas and see the border crisis that they created, I took the border crisis to them,” Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said on the convention stage.\n\nOther Republicans, such as Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., accused the VP of enabling “criminals and rioters” during the protests following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nBiden had served in the Senate for more than three decades before he became vice president. There was no existing schema for someone like Harris. She was a trained lawyer, who did a short stint as a senator.\n\n“Most of that stuff is not transferable to the job of the vice president,” said Harris’ first communications director as vice president, Ashley Etienne. “So she figured out what are her strengths. And she’s over indexed on them.”\n\nHarris finds her footing on reproductive rights, other liberal causes\n\nIt took the leak of a Supreme Court decision reversing Roe v. Wade for Harris to cut her own path. She’d worked closely with abortion rights advocates in California. She was in her element.\n\nIn a fiery speech the next day at an abortion rights gala, Harris reminded activists of her exchange with Kavanaugh.\n\n“Those who attack Roe have been clear. They want to ban abortion in every state. They want to bully anyone who seeks or provides reproductive healthcare. And they want to criminalize and punish women for making these decisions,” she said.\n\nJason Williams, a professor of justice studies at Montclair State University in New Jersey, said Harris’ stepped-up presence in the wake of the Dobbs decision changed the perception of her role.\n\n“That’s when we’ve seen in a very public way the power that she brings to this team,’’ Williams said. “Obviously when she's talking about anything in the judicial system that’s her own thing. That’s what she went to school for. That’s what she has worked (for) as… a prosecutor for so many years.”\n\nHarris traveled the country, sounding the alarm. Democrats lost the House in the midterm elections but kept the Senate with her assistance.\n\nThe election-year victories finally offered Harris an issue area she could own. She reoriented her agenda around cultural issues such as gun rights and book bans. Her team launched a tightly controlled national college tour that was designed to amplify her message. Celebrity moderators appeared on stage with Harris as the VP fielded pre-approved questions.\n\nBiden tapped her for bigger and better opportunities to represent the U.S. at overseas summits.\n\nAfter Hamas launched a brutal, surprise attack against Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, Harris sat in on Biden’s calls with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden then sent Harris to Dubai to discuss the governance of Gaza after the war with Middle Eastern leaders.\n\nThere she delivered a searing statement about how Israel was conducting itself in the war.\n\n“The United States is unequivocal: International humanitarian law must be respected,” Harris said. “Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating.”\n\nIn March, she called for an immediate cease fire – remarks that were among the most pointed at that time from a member of the Biden administration.\n\n'Already on the job:' VP role gives Harris an edge\n\nThe balance Harris would have to achieve as a presidential candidate is differentiating herself on these issues, while also taking credit for some of the administration’s accomplishments, such as student debt forgiveness and job creation.\n\nShe will have to sell herself – quickly.\n\n“This would be the challenge: Can she communicate how much of a role she played in those kinds of outcomes?’’ said Ange-Marie Hancock, executive director of the Kirwan Institute at The Ohio State University and curator of the Kamala Harris Project, a consortium of scholars from the country studying the vice president.\n\nElaine Kamarck, a longtime Democratic National Committee member and expert on the party’s rules, told a group of Democratic activists during a Friday call that Harris has two major advantages: she’s already been vetted and she’s already on the job.\n\n“We’re not going to, likely, have some surprise,” Kamarck said on the call organized by the group Delegates are Democracy. “None of the other candidates, great as they are – and some of them, I like very much, I might even like them more than the vice president – none of them have been vetted on a national stage.”\n\nAs a former prosecutor, many believe Harris also would not be intimidated by Trump, which could come with its own backlash.\n\n“As a woman and as a woman of color, how aggressive can she be before people start having the reaction that she’s too aggressive,’’ said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. “Is that trope of the angry Black woman going to be thrown at her?”\n\nWhile racist and sexist attacks aren’t new, Walsh is among those who expect them to ratchet up if Harris runs for president, alongside persistent questioning about ability and qualifications.\n\n“It’s not going to be a walk in the park,’’ Walsh said. “We are not post-racism. We are not post-sexism. We’re still there.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/17/rnc-day-3-live-updates-2024-election/74403111007/", "title": "RNC replay: JD Vance officially accepts VP nomination at ...", "text": "Sen.

We intervened in other countries' affairs and signed treaties that only benefited other nations. We spent too many years ignoring America's priorities.”\n\nHe then argued that there was only one man “with the strength to call out the lies and failures of both Democrats and Republicans:\" Donald Trump.\n\n“Donald Trump doesn't care if you're gay or straight, black, brown or white, or what gender you are.

Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, led the round of speakers Wednesday by criticizing President Joe Biden and, most pointedly, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“She has not been truthful with us,” Jackson said, referring to Biden’s decision to remain in the presidential race. “She has lied to us. She has put party above country and she is as unfit in character as Joe Biden is in body and mind.”\n\nShould Biden change his mind and exit the race, Harris is the top candidate to take his spot running against Trump.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow long is the Republican National Convention?\n\nThe Republican National Convention is four days total, running from Monday through Thursday.\n\nTrump is expected to speak on the final night, while his running mate, JD Vance, headlines Wednesday.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho is Usha Vance?\n\nUsha Vance, the wife of J.

JD Vance of Ohio. In late May, Harris accepted an invitation by CBS News to debate on either July 23 or Aug. 13. She accepted a third potential date – Aug. 12 – on Wednesday. The Trump-Vance campaign has yet to commit to any vice-presidential debate.\n\nThe Trump campaign suggested Wednesday its hands are tied because it doesn’t know who will be on the Democratic ticket.\n\n“We don’t know who the Democratic nominee for vice president is going to be, so we can’t lock in a date before their convention,” said Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior adviser.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBabydog on stage, with 2024 ‘prediction’\n\nWest Virginia Gov.

The former VP also launched his own bid for president last year.\n\nThis week, Trump chose Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio. as his 2024 running mate.

On Wednesday, she also accepted Aug. 12 as a potential date.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, named Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate on Monday. Vance has yet to accept the proposed CBS debate.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nWill J.D. Vance’s religious background sway Catholic voters?\n\nReligion experts told USA TODAY it is unlikely Vance’s religious background will sway Catholic voters as he seeks to shore up support for the Republican ticket.\n\n“People are already pretty committed to their positions. And JD Vance being Catholic or not Catholic is really, I don't think going to change anything,” said Cristina Traina, the Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J. Chair of Catholic Theology at Fordham University.\n\nVance’s selection as Trump’s running mate was unsurprising to Chris Devine, a political science professor at the University of Dayton, a Catholic university in Vance’s home state of Ohio. But it’s because of Vance’s loyalty to Trump, not his religion, that Devine believed he was added to the ticket.\n\nDevine co-authored the 2020 book, “Do Running Mates Matter? The Influence of Vice Presidential Candidates in Presidential Elections” alongside Kyle Kopko. The duo’s research suggested Catholic vice presidential nominees did not move the needle among Catholic voters in past elections.\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi and BrieAnna Frank\n\nTrump pollster says New Jersey, Virginia, Minnesota in play\n\nTrump campaign pollster John McLaughlin said during an interview on CNN Wednesday that he believes the possibility of traditionally blue states like New Jersey, Minnesota and Virginia voting for Trump is “very real” this election.\n\nIn Virginia, for instance, McLaughlin pointed to internal polling showing Trump performing well with African American voters and military service members.\n\n“We leading in the battleground states. We're leading in the national polls. We never saw that in 2016,” McLaughlin said.\n\nA recent Cook Political Report aggregate of national polls found Trump leading Joe Biden 47% to 45%.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nJD Vance speech to highlight is childhood, upbringing\n\nOhio Sen.

That story is outlined in his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” which thrust Vance into the national spotlight during the 2016 election cycle.\n\nVance will share how his upbringing informed his views on key campaign issues, including trade, immigration and the fentanyl crisis, the source said.\n\nIn announcing his running mate, Donald Trump said the senator will help his campaign reach Rust Belt voters, particularly in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\n— Haley BeMiller\n\nWho is speaking tonight at the RNC?

She criticized Vance for supporting Trump’s efforts to undermine the 2020 election, national abortion restrictions and voting against IVF protections in the Senate.\n\nHarris and Vance spoke over the phone on Tuesday.

Since then, Vance has become a loyal ally to Trump. He is also close with one of Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr.\n\n— Haley BeMiller and Riley Beggin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/07/18/what-happens-if-one-of-the-presidential-nominees-drops-out-of-the-race/74429032007/", "title": "What happens if one of the presidential nominees drops out of the race", "text": "Election Day 2024 is expected to be headlined by a rare presidential rematch between the oldest candidates in the nation's history: 81-year-old President Joe Biden and 78-year-old former President Donald Trump.\n\nEven before the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump, there had been talk about the duo's ability to serve based on age, cognitive ability, and in Trump's case, a potential prison sentence. All invite questions about what would happen if either nominee needs to be replaced by necessity or choice.\n\nThis brings into play the fragility of American democracy, said Saladin Ambar, professor of political science and senior scholar at the Eagleton Center on the American Governor.\n\nStory continues below photo gallery.\n\n\"We are just one outlandish scenario away from creating a whole matrix of problems,\" Ambar said. \"These are things we should be talking about not because we want to be morose, but because there is so much on the line.\"\n\nWho would run for president if something happened to Biden or Trump?\n\nThe White House announced that Biden tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, adding that he is \"experiencing mild symptoms.\"\n\nThough firmly the presumptive nominee, Biden has not yet been officially designated as the Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. The Democratic convention is set for August in Chicago. However, there have recently been reports that party officials are seeking to accelerate or possibly delay the nomination process, depending on their support for Biden.\n\nOn the other hand, GOP delegates have already formally nominated Trump for president. They did so on July 15 at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nNov. 5 would be the third consecutive ticket-topping election for Trump, who would join a small group including Henry Clay and William Jennings Bryan as three-time major party presidential nominees to make it to Election Day.\n\nHe almost didn't.\n\nJust two days before securing the nomination, Trump joined more than a dozen presidents and presidential candidates who have been targeted by gun-wielding attackers. The first was former President Andrew Jackson, who survived unscathed on Jan. 30, 1835.\n\nIf Biden were to resign, die or otherwise lose his ability to serve, the 25th Amendment says Vice President Kamala Harris would assume the presidency. However, the rules for nominees and presumptive nominees are more complex and must abide by election laws and political party protocol.\n\nSince Trump has already been nominated, his replacement scenario is slightly more clear. The Republican National Committee would essentially have two options: select the candidate or hold another national convention, according to party rules.\n\nTrump's vice-presidential pick, J.D. Vance, would be a clear contender, Ambar said. However, he would not be an automatic pick and there could be a series of potential candidates making their case to take Trump's or Vance's place on the ballot. People such as Tim Scott, Vivek Ramaswamy or Nikki Haley would be in the mix. The odds of a second convention would be slim to none, according to Ambar.\n\nIn Biden's case, Democratic delegates elected during Biden-dominated primary elections, conventions and caucuses and pledged to him would still be tasked with formally nominating a candidate at their national convention if he was no longer able to run. It would come down to the politics of the moment, how party leaders feel and possibly what Biden himself has to say, Ambar said.\n\n\"In the 21st century, politics are candidate centric. When the candidate is no more, we resort to an earlier process in American politics that is party centric and boss centric,\" he said. \"It becomes about who the leaders are in the party.\"\n\nIt would be a similar process to one Republicans would have faced if Trump had been assassinated.\n\nA replacement nominee would likely be chosen through a contentious process. Public speeches, negotiations on the convention floor and meetings behind closed doors could feature in a throwback process that many consider undemocratic in the modern system that relies on caucuses and primary elections to circumvent party bosses, Ambar said.\n\nThe process for the Democrats is also complicated by the existence of \"superdelegates,\" unpledged delegates who could sway a contested convention, with people such as Harris, California Gov. Gavin Newsom or Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer all lobbying for support.\n\n\"In the literal sense of the word, it would be a free-for-all,\" Ambar said.\n\nWhat happens if Biden drops out of the race?\n\nIn 1968, Senator Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated as he was battling Vice President Hubert Humphrey and U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy in the race for the Democratic nomination following Lyndon B. Johnson's withdrawal that March.\n\nKennedy was shot three times on June 5, just hours after winning the California primary, His 393 total delegates became uncommitted. U.S. Senator George McGovern offered himself as a replacement for Kennedy and a successor for his delegates two weeks before the convention. Yet, the delegates split themselves among the candidates. The largest group backed Humphrey, who won the nomination despite not entering a single state primary.\n\nIn 1972, Senator Thomas Eagleton was the Democratic candidate for vice president when he withdrew from the ticket after the convention. Eagleton, who reacted in response to reports that he had been treated for mental illness, was replaced by former U.S. Ambassador to France Sargent Shriver during a special meeting of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nA similar scenario is in play if Biden drops out of the race after gaining the nomination at the Democratic National Convention. Party protocol calls for the national committee to consult with Democratic leaders, including members of Congress and state governors, before finding consensus on a replacement nominee or an entirely new ticket.\n\nFor both Biden and Trump, changing the names on voters' ballots could be impossible depending on the timing of events. A move to change the ballot to reflect the candidates would be inevitable to ensure every voter was informed, Ambar said. However, regardless of the names on the ticket, voters in presidential elections vote for party electors in the electoral college and ballots denote the party. Congress could delay the election with the president's approval.\n\nHowever, Ambar said that it would likely be tested in the courts. Moreover, the president's end of term is firm. The 20th Amendment stipulates the president and vice president must vacate their positions at noon on Jan. 20. Congress typically convenes on Jan. 6 to count the electoral votes and certify the election results.\n\nIn 1872, Democratic presidential candidate Horace Greeley died after the election, but he had already lost to Ulysses S. Grant and the electoral votes had not yet been cast. The party electors were free to vote for another candidate or Greeley. Congress chose not to count the votes for Greeley.

For the latest news on the presidential election, read USA TODAY's live election updates for Monday, Nov. 4.\n\nWith just two days left until Election Day, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris are pushing to the finish line in must-win states.\n\nThe former president is rallying voters in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia on Sunday, while the vice president has planned multiple stops in Michigan.\n\nHere are some of the key moments from Sunday's campaign trail:\n\nTrump told a crowd in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, that he \"shouldn't have left\" the White House in 2020, going further than he has previously in claiming that he defeated President Joe Biden.\n\nThe former president also escalated his violent rhetoric toward journalists saying he wouldn't \"mind\" if a potential assassin shot \"through the fake news\" to get to him.\n\nHarris took the stage at Michigan State University making a direct appeal to Arab Americans promising to end the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nHarris also leaned in making her last appeal to young voters: \"I see you. And I see your power.\"\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's coverage live from the campaign trail.\n\nNBC gives Trump equal time after Harris appears on 'SNL'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was given free airtime during NBC’s NASCAR coverage Sunday to compensate for Vice President Kamala Harris’ appearance on \"Saturday Night Live,\" according to reports.\n\nIn a filing on Sunday, NBC told the Federal Communications Commission that Harris appeared \"without charge\" on \"SNL\" for 1 minute and 30 seconds during the show’s opening sketch.\n\nThe broadcaster gave Trump the chance to directly address viewers during the NASCAR 2024 Cup playoff race, according to CNN and The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe FCC's equal time rule requires American radio and television broadcast stations to provide equal access to competing political candidates.\n\n− Emily DeLetter and Maureen Groppe\n\nIf he returns to the White House, Trump says 'it'll be nasty a little bit’\n\nGreat. Fun. Nasty.\n\nThat’s how former President Donald Trump described the next four years if voters send him back to the White House.\n\n\"We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. You watch. It’s going to be so good. It’s going to be so much fun,\" Trump said as he wrapped up his third Sunday rally. “It’ll be nasty a little bit at times and maybe at the beginning in particular. But it’s going to be something.”\n\n− Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump hits hard on immigration\n\nFormer President Donald Trump continues to focus heavily on immigration, repeating at his Georgia rally his claims that the United States \"is now an occupied country.\"\n\n\"The day I take the oath in office the migrant invasion ends,\" Trump said. \"I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered.\"\n\nMany people in the country illegally, he said without evidence, are murderers and terrorists. And he said they were taking away jobs, mostly from Black Americans.\n\nBefore criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris’ record on immigration, Trump said she is \"running on nothing but hate and demonization.\"\n\n− Maureen Groppe\n\nIowa can challenge ballots of 2,000 voters on flawed noncitizen list\n\nA federal judge ruled Sunday that Iowa poll workers could challenge ballots of more than 2,000 state residents who appeared on a flawed list of possible noncitizens.\n\nIowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican, told county auditors on Oct. 22 to challenge the ballots of registered voters who’d previously told the state they were not U.S. citizens.\n\nA group of naturalized citizens and the League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa sued, saying the challenges wrongly forced naturalized citizens — who are eligible to vote — to clear extra hurdles that other voters did not have to undergo.\n\nU.S. District Judge Stephen Locher wrote Sunday that the decision could stand given that both the state and the plaintiffs agree that some of the individuals on the list are not U.S. citizens.\n\nPate, who acknowledged he was under immense pressure to ensure that only citizens were voting in Iowa, has said that challenged voters can submit provisional ballots and their votes will be counted if they prove their citizenship or the county auditor has verified they are a citizen.\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller and Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris calls on Black women organizers\n\nVice President Kamala Harris remained on the tarmac after arriving in Detroit on Sunday night so she could dial into a Win With Black Women organizing call.\n\nHarris dialed into the weekly call to thank her friends and some of the earliest supporters of her campaign.\n\n“This coalition has been in my corner for the last four years, and just four months ago immediately jumped into action with this weekly call to be the first group to organize tens of thousands of Black women in support of our brand new campaign,” Harris said. “You were the catalyst.”\n\nThe day President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, the group held a call that drew 44,000 participants. Other supporters of Harris soon held similar calls.\n\nShe asked them to mobilize their Facebook Groups and family group chats to vote for her.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump in Georgia: `Kamala broke it and I will fix it'\n\nAt a Sunday night rally in Macon, Georgia, former President Donal Trump said the election is a choice between “four more years in gross incompetence and failure” and the “four greatest years in the history of our country.”\n\n“This is really all you need to know,” Trump said. “Kamala broke it, and I will fix it.”\n\nIn 2020, Trump narrowly lost Georgia, one of seven states expected to decide this year’s presidential election.\n\nTrump said the race is “on the 5-yard line, maybe even the 1-yard line.”\n\n“We’re going to close this thing out,” he said, “and it’s going to be party time.”\n\n− Maureen Groppe\n\nHarris to Gen Z in Michigan: 'I see your power'\n\nDuring a rally at Michigan State University, Vice President Kamala Harris told young voters that she recognizes the power they hold.\n\nYoung voters are leading the charge to shield the environment from the effects of climate change and protect America’s schools from active shooters, she said, bringing up the Supreme Court’s rollback of reproductive rights.\n\n“None of these issues for you are theoretical. This is not political for you all, this is your lived experience. And I see you. And I see your power. And I am so proud of you,” she said to loud cheers.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris begins Michigan State rally with an appeal to Arab Americans\n\nVice President Kamala Harris started her final Michigan rally with an appeal to the state’s large Arab American population.\n\nAt the start of her remarks at a Sunday evening rally in East Lansing, Michigan, Harris acknowledged the presence of leaders of the Arab American community, which has “deep and proud roots” in the state.\n\n“And I want to say, this year has been difficult given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon. It is devastating,” Harris said. “And as president, I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza.”\n\nShe was stopped mid-sentence by loud cheering. Continuing, she said she’d work to “bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure Israel is secure, and ensure the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom and self-determination.”\n\nThe Biden administration is still working on a diplomatic resolution across the Israel-Lebanon border, she said, to “protect civilians and provide lasting stability.\n\n“And as president, I will work tirelessly toward a future with security and dignity for all people,” she pledged, before delivering her regular stump speech.\n\nHarris has been interrupted at her rallies over the past several weeks in Michigan and elsewhere by pro-Palestinian protesters who are unhappy about the Biden administration’s support for Israel in its war with Hamas. She stressed her support from Arab American leaders earlier on Sunday after she was asked about her closing message to the community.\n\nTrump met with Arab American supporters of his campaign on Friday in Dearborn, Michigan, which has a high concentration of Lebanese Americans.\n\n–Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris rally in Georgia a family affair with Doug Emhoff and Maya Harris\n\nA Harris rally in Atlanta on Sunday was a family affair featuring the vice president’s sister, Maya Harris, and her husband, Doug Emhoff.\n\nEmhoff, sporting a black Harris-Walz cap, said he was proud to see his wife address tens of thousands of people at the Eclipse in Washington, D.C.\n\n“My wife is such a badass,’’ he told a packed ballroom. “We saw a president on that stage. We saw a leader.’’\n\nEvery speaker that took the microphone Sunday, including Rep. Lucy McBath, a Democrat from Georgia, urged the crowd to vote and take others to the polls on Election Day.\n\n“Georgia you can decide this election,” Maya Harris told the crowd, praising people across the country canvassing for the campaign.\n\nGeorgians need to continue showing up in record numbers “so you leave no doubt where you stand,” she said.\n\nEmhoff said it’s the first campaign rally he and Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, have done together. Walz said that unlike Trump, Harris would not go into the White House with an enemy list but with a to-do list.\n\nGeorgia, Walz said, could help Harris win. “Momentum is on our side, but we’re not taking anything for granted,\" he said.\n\n“If we win by one vote it will be Jimmy Carter’s vote,’’ he said to rousing applause.\n\n– Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nKevin McCarthy calls on Donald Trump to campaign with Nikki Haley\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told USA TODAY Sunday that he believes Donald Trump has the “advantage” in the presidential race as it nears its conclusion, but said the former president could be doing more to close the deal.\n\n“You could’ve been more uniting, you know, if you put the Nikki Haleys, others, in there,” said the former congressman from California. “You’re running a general election, not a primary.”\n\nTrump’s former United Nations Ambassador, Haley ran against the former president in the GOP primary and drew support from moderate Republicans, a group Kamala Harris has courted with endorsements from Republicans such as former Rep. Liz Cheney. Haley endorsed Trump and spoke at the Republican National Convention, but hasn’t been on the campaign trail with him.\n\n“To me, it’s all about addition not subtraction,” McCarthy said. “So where am I weak? I bring Nikki Haley in.”\n\nYet McCarthy also believes Trump has “reached out” beyond his base by incorporating Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former Democrat, into his campaign.\n\nKennedy, who Trump has promised to give a big role on health issues in a future administration, has been campaigning heavily for the former president in the closing stretch. Kennedy is an anti-vaccine advocate whose public comments on health care have drawn widespread backlash.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nHarris stops by chicken and waffles restaurant in Detroit\n\nAfter attending a Sunday morning church service, Kamala Harris grabbed lunch at a chicken and waffles restaurant in Detroit.\n\nThe crowd crammed inside Kuzzo’s Chicken and Waffles erupted into cheers when Harris entered the restaurant, which is owned by former Detroit Lions cornerback Ron Bartell. The vice president worked the room for several minutes, shaking hands with two women who work at the eatery and posing for photos and selfies with other patrons.\n\nSpotted in the crowd: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.\n\nNo word on what the vice president picked up for lunch.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nOprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga to appear at Harris’ final campaign rally Monday night\n\nOprah Winfrey and Lady Gaga will join Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff Monday night in Philadelphia as the Democratic nominee makes her closing arguments to voters, according to her campaign.\n\nWinfrey and Gaga’s appearances will wrap up a star-studded lineup of back-to-back Harris-Walz events across all seven battleground states, all featuring a range of celebrity appearances and musical performances.\n\nHarris will hold two in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, starting in Pittsburgh where D-Nice, Katy Perry, and Andra Day are slated to perform. Later in Philadelphia, Winfrey and Gaga will be joined on stage by DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe, Freeway, Just Blaze, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Ricky Martin, The Roots, Jazmine Sullivan, and Adam Blackstone.\n\nThe Pennsylvania rallies are part of a series of get-out-the-vote events simultaneously taking place in other critical swing states of North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\nHarris addresses death toll in Israel-Hamas war\n\nWith just two days until the election, Kamala Harris on Sunday made a pitch to Arab Americans who are on the fence about supporting her over the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAsked by a reporter in Detroit what her closing argument would be to Arab Americans, Harris repeated what she has said previously about the war in the Gaza Strip. The number of “innocent Palestinians” killed is “unconscionable,” she said.\n\n“We need to end the war, and we need to get the hostages out, and as president of the United States, I will do everything in my power to achieve that end,” Harris said.\n\nHarris also repeated her call for a two-state solution.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nSupporters gather for Atlanta Harris-Walz rally\n\nThe line snaked down the halls Sunday afternoon for the Harris-Walz rally at a hotel in Atlanta, where Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were slated to speak. Some people wore T-shirts that read, “We’re not going back’’ and “Republicans for Harris.”\n\nRenee Cobbs, 70, of Powder Springs, Georgia, was among the first to enter the ballroom.\n\n“I’m celebrating already,’’ Cobbs said as she pinned a Harris button on her jean jacket. “I’m optimistic not only about Georgia, but also the other battleground states.’’\n\nIt was Cobbs’ second Harris-Walz rally. She went to hear the vice president at a recent rally in Decatur, Georgia. By Friday, the last day for early voting, more than 4 million people had voted in Georgia, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s office.\n\nCobbs said she worries Trump is too negative and pointed to what she called his ramped-up rhetoric, which she said has only gotten worse since Harris took the top of the ticket. “Kamala is one of the best things for the country and the world at this point,’’ said Cobbs.\n\n− Deborah Berry\n\nHarris votes by mail-in ballot\n\nKamala Harris has cast her vote for president – by mail.\n\nHarris, who served as a U.S. Senator from California before becoming vice president, told reporters traveling with her on Sunday that she filled out her ballot and that it is in the mail.\n\n“My ballot is on its way to California, and I'm going to trust the system that it will arrive there,” she said.\n\nHarris declined to say how she voted on a California ballot measure that would increase penalties for some theft- and drug-related crimes.\n\n“I am not going to talk about the vote on that, because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election, and I don't intend to create an endorsement one way or another around it,” she said.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nRFK Jr: Trump would seek to remove fluoride from public water sources\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said Saturday that Donald Trump would seek to remove fluoride from public water sources as one of his first presidential actions if he is reelected, falsely suggesting that the compound is dangerous.\n\nThe American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed water fluoridation, citing studies that show fluoride in community water systems can prevent at least 25 percent of tooth decay in children and adults.\n\nWhen reached for comment about Kennedy's remarks, Trump campaign Senior Adviser Danielle Alvarez did not directly address Kennedy's assertion, saying that Trump has \"received a variety of policy ideas\" but \"is focused on Tuesday’s election.\"\n\nBut in a phone call with Trump on Sunday morning, NBC News reporter Dasha Burns said the former president appeared open to Kennedy's plans. The former president reportedly said \"Well, I haven't talked to him about it yet, but it sounds okay to me. You know it's possible,\" when asked about Kennedy's suggestion to remove fluoride from public water.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump says he 'shouldn't have left' White House\n\nDonald Trump said during a Sunday rally in Pennsylvania that he \"shouldn't have left\" the White House as he touted his accomplishments during office.\n\nAs Trump addressed his handling of the southern border and the nation's economy, he told the crowd: \"We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left. I shouldn't have left, I mean honestly.\"\n\nTrump has long falsely said that fraud impacted the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to President Joe Biden. The former president launched a legal battle in states across the country after the election, but his claims of fraud were all rejected by courts.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nAllan Lichtman vs. Nate Silver: Who will accurately predict the 2024 election?\n\nAs voters look to polls and political analysts for insight into who might win the presidency on Tuesday, a feud between two of the nation’s leading election prognosticators, Allan Lichtman and Nate Silver, will soon be put to the test.\n\nLichtman, an American University professor who has correctly predicted nine out of 10 of the last presidential elections, has forecasted a win for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSilver, the statistician and pollster who founded FiveThirtyEight, wrote recently in the New York Times that the race is a virtual tie, but his \"gut\" tells him former President Donald Trump will likely prevail.\n\n− Karissa Waddick\n\nJD Vance's final pitch to Arizona voters ties economic woes to illegal immigration\n\nVisiting Arizona just days before Election Day, JD Vance revved up a crowd in Scottsdale, Arizona, by arguing that Kamala Harris has prioritized illegal immigrants over American citizens.\n\nVance, a senator from Ohio and the Republican nominee for vice president, ticked through a list of economic woes facing Americans and, using at times exaggerated or unclear claims, tied each problem to President Joe Biden and Harris' record on illegal immigration.\n\n“Compassion, for the American president, has to start with the American people, and the people who have the legal right to be here,” Vance told hundreds of supporters at Dillon Precision, a guns and ammunition storefront in Scottsdale.\n\n− Laura Gersony\n\nHarris says election offers opportunity for 'freedom, justice and compassion'\n\nKamala Harris followed her guest appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" by stopping by a Sunday morning church service in Detroit.\n\nHarris told congregants of the Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ that Tuesday’s election will give Americans a chance to decide whether they want to live in a country of “chaos, fear and hate” or “freedom, justice and compassion.”\n\nAmericans should answer that question, she said, “not just with our faith, but with our feet as we walk to the polls.”\n\nThe country will be tested over the next two days and the road won’t be easy, Harris said. But in times of uncertainty, she concluded by citing Psalm 30:5: “We are reminded weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”\n\n“Morning is on its way,” she said.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nWhen will election results be announced?\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nElise Stefanik addresses gender gap between Kamala Harris, Donald Trump supporters\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., was asked on \"Fox News Sunday\" about the major gender gap among supporters that has emerged between Harris and Trump.\n\nFor example, a USA TODAY/Suffolk poll of Pennsylvania voters found Trump is up by 20 points among men in the commonwealth, 57% to 37%, while Harris has an 18% hold on women over Trump, 57% to 39%. That’s compared to Trump’s 16-point advantage among men nationally and Harris' 17-point advantage among women.\n\nStefanik denied concerns about Trump’s performance among women, turning the conversation to Harris’ numbers with male voters, telling host Shannon Bream “Trump is doing better among women than Kamala Harris is doing among men.”\n\nShe also said that inflation and concerns about the southern border were reasons that women would vote for Trump, claiming American women were economically better off under Trump. “It was the highest number of women ever in the workforce, the largest wage and salary increase for working women ever, child care was affordable,” Stefanik said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what metric Stefanik was referencing. Data from the US Department of Labor shows that women’s labor force participation peaked in 1999.\n\n– Cy Neff\n\nTrump escalates violent rhetoric toward news media\n\nTalking about the protective glass surrounding him, Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday that a potential assassin would need to shoot through the news media to hit him. “I don’t mind that,” he said.\n\n\"I have a piece of glass over here. And I don't have a piece of glass there. And I have this piece of glass here. But all we really have over here is the fake news, right?\" Trump said to laughs from the crowd.\n\n“And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind that,” he said.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump criticizes polls after surprising Iowa survey\n\nThe former president usually loves to talk about polls, but on Sunday he criticized a surprising new poll out of the Midwest.\n\n\"The polls are just as corrupt as some of the writers back there,\" Donald Trump said during an airport rally near Lancaster, Pennsylvania., the start of a fly-around that will take him to North Carolina and Georgia on Sunday.\n\nTrump specifically cited The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released on Saturday that shows him now trailing Harris in the Hawkeye State. But he also knocked other surveys released ahead of Election Day.\n\n\"We've got all this crap going on, with the press and with the fake stuff,\" Trump said. \"And fake polls.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump says elections should be 'one day' and on 'paper ballots'\n\nAt a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, on Sunday morning, former President Donald Trump repeated arguments that elections should only last one day and should be conducted on paper ballots, rather than on voting machines. He also aired concerns that election offices were “extending hours and stuff.”\n\n“Whoever heard of this stuff?” Trump said.\n\nA judge in Pennsylvania last week extended the deadline for Bucks County voters to request a mail-in ballot after Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging that long lines prevented some supporters from getting their ballot. The order extended the deadline from Wednesday, Oct. 30 to Friday, Nov. 1.\n\nIn Indiana, election officials in one county have proposed adding additional early morning voting hours to stem long voting lines.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump campaign adviser dismisses Iowa poll as 'outlier'\n\nTop Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski is dismissing a poll out of Iowa that shows the former president trailing Kamala Harris in the red state.\n\nThe Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll has 47% of likely voters backing Harris, compared to Trump’s 44%. Lewandowski said the poll is “a complete outlier that has no credibility” and noted that the same poll had Trump and President Joe Biden tied in the state late in the 2020 race.\n\nTrump won Iowa by eight percentage points in 2020. Lewandowski noted that Harris hasn’t been campaigning in Iowa, pushing back against the idea that the state is in play.\n\nIt’s a bad sign for the Trump campaign if Harris is doing well in Iowa, one that raises questions about the former president’s prospects in other states with large numbers of older white voters. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey shows Harris winning female voters by 20 percentage points. She also has a big lead with senior voters and is beating Trump with Iowa independents.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\n'It doesn't make you a man': John Fetterman hits Donald Trump comments on transgender right\n\nSen. John Fetterman strongly condemned Donald Trump and Republicans' rhetoric about transgender rights during an interview on CNN Sunday, saying “it doesn't make you tough. It doesn't make you a man to pick on trans or gay kids.”\n\nFetterman was asked by anchor Dana Bash about whether Trump campaign ads that suggest Kamala Harris is “for they/them” are resonating in the pivotal swing state.\n\n“If your political capital, you know, comes from picking on trans kids or gay kids or anything like that, that you're just bankrupt throughout all of this,” Fetterman said. “My version of being is, it's like, ‘Hey, I like ribeye, I like Motorhead, and I'm never going to pick on trans kids and gay kids.”\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nDoug Burgum addresses Iowa poll showing Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a campaign surrogate for Donald Trump who was once floated as a possible running mate, is brushing off new polling that suggests a Democratic victory in a long-red state.\n\nA Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.\n\nIn an interview with Kristen Welker on Sunday’s “Meet the Press,” Burgum placed little stock with the surprise poll figures, pointing to a competing Saturday poll from Emerson College putting Trump in a 10-point lead over Harris in the state.\n\n“If you take the average of those last two polls, I think Trump's still going to confidently win Iowa,” Burgum said on the NBC talk show Sunday. “I would be surprised, completely shocked, that [Harris win] comes anywhere close to being the fact that Iowa.”\n\nThe Republican governor remained optimistic about his party’s candidate, pointing to his recent campaign trail visits in several key battleground states: \"It’s a very tight race that is going to be decided on Tuesday, but the momentum in the last week that I felt on the ground... is that the energy from all demographics is very, very positive.”\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\nDonald Trump reacts to Des Moines Register Iowa poll\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to criticize a new Iowa poll that shows him trailing Kamala Harris in the Midwestern state.\n\n\"No President has done more for FARMERS, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump,\" he said Sunday on his Truth Social account. \"In fact, it’s not even close!\"\n\nEven so, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.\n\nA loss in Iowa would be major for Trump, who campaigned in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia on Sunday.\n\n–David Jackson\n\nHarrison Ford, aka Indiana Jones, endorses Kamala Harris\n\nIndiana Jones is standing with Kamala Harris.\n\nActor Harrison Ford, who in a series of films played the adventurous archaeologist with a phobia of snakes, has released a video in which he endorses the Democratic presidential nominee and expresses a fear of something else: a second Donald Trump presidency.\n\nIn the video, a gruff-voiced Ford cites the dozens of former members of the Trump administration who are sounding the alarm about the Republican nominee and telling voters “for God’s sake, don’t do this again.” Harris, he said, will protect Americans’ rights to degree with her on policy or ideas “and then, as we have done for centuries, we'll debate them, we'll work on them together, and we'll move forward.”\n\nFord concludes by saying he has one vote, “same as anyone else,” and that he’s going to use it by moving forward and voting for Harris.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nGeorgia Sen. Raphael Warnock pressed on Joe Biden's 'garbage' comment\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock made an appearance Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and was asked about President Joe Biden's comment last week in which Biden appeared to call Trump's supporters \"garbage.\"\n\nThe president has since said he was only referring to the racist rhetoric at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally. But Warnock on Sunday called for all Americans to take a closer look at the way they talk politics.\n\n\"As the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. served, I think that we all need to elevate the character and the tone of our political discourse,\" Warnock said, adding that he believes \"That's what Kamala Harris is doing.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nCould Iowa be shifting back to a presidential swing state? What new poll shows\n\nCould red-state Iowa be shifting back to purple as a presidential swing state?\n\nThe new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump by 3 percentage points in the state, 47% to 44% – a result that suggests Iowa is in play with Election Day fast approaching.\n\nYet neither campaign has treated Iowa and its six Electoral College delegates as up for grabs. Neither Harris nor Trump has campaigned in Iowa since the presidential primaries, and neither campaign has established a ground presence in the state, according to Des Moines Register chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel.\n\n– Des Moines Register staff\n\nWhere do Trump, Harris stand in the polls?\n\nThe 2024 race for the White House is set to be neck-and-neck until Election Day. In Real Clear Politics' average of national polls, Trump leads Harris by 0.1 percentage points, well within the margin of error for each of the surveys included.\n\nIt's also razor-close in swing states across the country. For example, Harris leads Trump by 0.3 percentage points in Real Clear Politics' average of Wisconsin polls.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nFCC commissioner criticizes Harris' 'SNL' appearance\n\nBrendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission suggested in a social media post on Sunday that Kamala Harris’ appearance on “Saturday Night Live” may have broken the FCC’s Equal Time Rule.\n\nCarr called Harris’ spot on the comedy show a \"clear and blatant effort to evade\" the commission's rules unless NBC offered former President Donald Trump a similar opportunity. The Equal Time Rule stipulates that radio and TV broadcasters give political candidates similar air time.\n\n“With only days before the election, NBC appears to have structured this appearance in a way that evades these requirements,” Carr said in his post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nCarr, appointed by both Trump and President Joe Biden, is among five commissioners on the FCC. The other commissioners have not yet publicly weighed in on the matter. It's also not clear what conversations, if any, NBC and the Trump campaign have conducted.\n\n– Karissa Waddick", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/11/29/minnesota-elections-watch-these-important-2024-election-races/71720297007/", "title": "Minnesota elections: Watch these important 2024 election races", "text": "Minnesota elections: One year out — here are key races to watch in 2024\n\nHundreds of races will take place next year across the state, from county commissioner to President of the United States, each affecting communities in different ways.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen.

Stine, the author who has given goose bumps to millions of teens and children, launched a new graphic-novel series for middle-school readers earlier this month.\n\nStine will return to his hometown of Bexley for a sold-out appearance Sunday at the Drexel Theatre to discuss his new work, “Just Beyond: The Scare School.”\n\nStine, 75, began the “Goosebumps” horror fiction novels with “Welcome to Dead House” in 1992. He has published more than 200 books in that series and others. “Goosebumps” has sold more than 400 million books in 32 languages and spawned television and film versions. After “Harry Potter,” it is the second best-selling book series in history.\n\nIn advance of his appearance in Bexley, Stine spoke with The Dispatch.\n\nQ: Tell us about your new book, “Just Beyond: The Scare School.”\n\nA: The concept of the series is to take kids just beyond reality, sort of what I do in “Goosebumps” … This book takes place in a middle school and it opens with three kids, 12-year-olds, in very weird outfits slinking through the school. They’ve escaped from another school, which is in an alternate reality. It turns out there are two schools in the same building, one is nice and the other is not nice and they’re trying to get away from the bad school.\n\nQ: How do you like the graphic-novel format?\n\nA: I’ve never written a graphic novel before. I enjoy it because you don’t have to describe anything. The artist has to do everything. I’m not that good at description.\n\nQ: You’re 75 and you have a grown son. How do you keep up with middle-school readers — what they’re thinking, what they’re interested in, what they like to read?\n\nA: I’ve just done it so long. I know how to keep them interested. I have this gimmick that a lot of authors think is really cheap — a cliffhanger at the end of every chapter. That keeps them reading … I do have to spy on kids. I have to keep up with what they wear, listen to, what they talk about, what shows they watch, what games they play. I do a lot of school visits.\n\nQ: The first “Goosebumps” book was in 1992, right?\n\nA: The series is 27 years old. You can imagine that? … I’m still going at 27 years. I’m amazed.\n\nQ: The books have sold hundreds of millions of copies and been made into movies and television shows. Did you envision that sort of success?\n\nA: No. You can’t plan for it. It’s all luck. I didn’t want to do “Goosebumps.” My editors — my wife and her business partner — forced me. They said no one’s ever done a scary series for 12-year-olds. We have to try it … I said all right, I’ll do three or four … (For a long time the books sat on the bookstore shelves and then) somehow kids discovered them and kids told kids. It was a secret kids’ network — all word of mouth.\n\nQ: What did you read when you were that age?\n\nA: Comic books … “Tales from the Crypt,” “The Vault of Horror,” DC horror comics. They were just gruesome and all had funny endings. It’s kind of what I do now.\n\nQ: How many books have you written?\n\nA: I’ve lost track. Maybe 350 books, maybe 150 “Goosebumps” books.\n\nQ: Did you ever get tired of writing them?\n\nA: I’m old. I’m tired! No, I don’t. I love it. I wouldn’t know what else to do all day.\n\nQ: You’re also a joke writer. When did you start that?\n\nA: I always just wanted to be funny. I never planned to be scary. I was 9 years old in my room typing little joke magazines. I was a weird kid. I wrote about 100 joke books for kids.\n\nQ: What else do you remember about your formative years in Bexley?\n\nA: Bexley was an upper middle-class community and my family was very poor. We lived … three doors from the railroad tracks. There were five of us and we had no money at all. At school I kind of felt like an outsider. I would make jokes and bring in the magazines I was writing to get attention. The teachers begged me to stop. People ask me if I had a teacher who encouraged me and I give the worst answer: No, they tried to get me to stop.\n\nQ: What was your time like at Ohio State University?\n\nA: In those days every college had a humor magazine, and Ohio State had The Sundial. James Thurber was the editor of the Sundial … I was the editor three years in a row and that’s all I did at Ohio State. I hardly went to class. … I learned how to put out a magazine and work with a staff, all the business part of it.\n\nQ: What will you say to the audience at the Drexel on Sunday?\n\nA: I don’t know, but what a thrill for me. When we were kids, my brother and I were at the Drexel every Saturday for the cartoon festival and … then they’d show a horror film. What a thrill for me to go back and show my own movie in the theater where I spent so much time as a kid.\n\nnegilson@gmail.com\n\nListen to the Life in the 614 podcast:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/arts/2015/02/25/viola-davis-jenna-coleman-sufjan-mythbusters-lana-del-rey/23896637/", "title": "20 most fascinating people visiting Indiana this spring", "text": "David Lindquist\n\ndavid.lindquist@indystar.com\n\nA trio of world-renown women highlights The Star's roster of the 20 most fascinating people visiting Indiana in March, April and May.\n\n\"How to Get Away with Murder\" star Viola Davis will speak at the Downtown Marriott on March 2, \"Star Wars\" actress Carrie Fisher will meet fans at Indiana Comic Con on March 14-15 and music icon Loretta Lynn will perform at Carmel's Palladium on April 24.

Harper Lee’s novel Go Set a Watchman remains at No. 1 for the third straight week, while Dr. Seuss’s children’s book What Pet Should I Get? makes its debut right behind her at No. 2. (The full list will publish on Thursday.)\n\nThe new Seuss book, which follows a brother and sister on the loose in a pet store, was released July 28 with a first printing of 1 million copies. The book sold 200,000 copies its first week, making it the fastest-selling picture book in Random House Children’s Books history, according to the publisher.\n\nThe manuscript, spiffed up for publication by Random House, was discovered in 2013 by Seuss’s widow and secretary. USA TODAY gave What Pet Should I Get? 3 (out of four) stars and said, “It’s hard not to smile at this retro charmer.”\n\nThis is not Seuss’s highest spot on the list, but close. His 1990 graduation favorite Oh, the Places You’ll Go! hit No. 1 in June 1997. And the 1954 classic Horton Hears a Who! made it to No. 3 in 2008 when the animated movie version was released. Seuss (real name Theodor Seuss Geisel) died in 1991; USA TODAY’s list launched in 1993. A total of 27 Seuss titles have made USA TODAY’s list over the years.\n\nNeed a break?

It comes in for a smooth landing at No. 10. This is McLain’s follow-up to The Paris Wife, her 2011 novel about Hadley Richardson, Ernest Hemingway’s long-suffering first wife. The Paris Wife, which peaked at No. 33 on USA TODAY’s list, was popular with book groups.\n\nCircling the Sun, a hit out of the gate, is likely to also be embraced by women readers.

He was 75.\n\nA posting on Dyer's Facebook page said: \"Wayne has left his body, passing away through the night. He always said he couldn't wait for this next adventure to begin and had no fear of dying.

On Tuesday, a statement on Dyer's Facebook page said the cause of his death was a heart attack.\n\nDyer was diagnosed with leukemia several years ago. In an interview posted to the KPBS-TV, San Diego, website in 2012 after his leukemia diagnosis, Dyer said he'd begun looking at the illness as \"just the body's way of responding to, perhaps, psychological traumas, you know, from failed relationships in the past, or whatever it is, and that the body just always knows what it's doing - and the body is perfect.\"\n\nNeed a break?

The network began tweeting a series of interviews with Dyer beginning Sunday on the account of its spirituality and religion show Super Soul Sunday, NBC reported.\n\nOn Sunday, Winfrey tweeted: \"It was always a pleasure to talk to @DrWayneWDyer about life's big questions. He always had big answers. RIP Wayne. You brought the Light.\"\n\nDeepak Chopra tweeted: \"Grieving deeply at sudden passing of my life long friend @DrWayneWDyer.

We send love 4his next adventure.\"\n\nDyer's Facebook page on Sunday still advertised an upcoming two-week seminar, scheduled for October and dubbed \"The Holy Land and Beyond: A Spiritual Journey of Self-Discovery.\"\n\nA native of Detroit, Dyer had been living in Maui.\n\nDyer was a guidance counselor at a Detroit high school and went on to run a successful private therapy practice, but his motivational and self-help lectures at St. John's University, where he was a professor, attracted students beyond those enrolled, according to a biography on Dyer's Goodreads page. A literary agent persuaded him to package his ideas in book form, resulting in his first book, Your Erroneous Zones, in 1976.\n\nDyer eventually quit his teaching job and began touring the USA to promote the book, reportedly selling copies \"out of the back of his station wagon,\" according to Michael Korda. The book, Korda said, made the best-seller lists \"before book publishers even noticed what was happening.\"\n\nDyer may have lived in Hawaii, but he never forgot his Detroit roots. He was a million-dollar donor to the city's Wayne State University, establishing a scholarship fund at the college where he earned three degrees, including a doctorate in counseling. He helped raise more than $100 million for public broadcasting, including the local public broadcasting station, with motivational specials that ran for years.\n\n\"As a pioneer in the genre we now refer to as 'self-help' programming, he connected deeply with public television audiences that share his mission for personal improvement,\" Rich Homberg, president and CEO of Detroit Public Television, said Sunday\n\n\"For millions and millions of people, he was a touchstone of understanding and self-awareness and confidence,\" said Homberg. \"He always just felt so genuine, and so real, and he went to such lengths to help people understand.\"\n\nHomberg said public television stations around the country eagerly anticipated Dyer-staged shows, not only for the fundraising dollars they generated but because viewers so connected with Dyer's message.\n\nHe was born Wayne Walter Dyer in Detroit, and grew up in a series of foster care homes. His father was an alcoholic who left the family when Dyer was 3.\n\nIn the 1960s, he taught social studies at Detroit's Pershing High School, and then was a counselor for two years in the early '70s at Catholic all-girls Mercy High School in Farmington Hills. At Mercy, he also was a driver's education instructor. Not only did he teach students to drive, but he also taught several of the Mercy nuns, said Cheryl Kreger, the school's president.\n\nWhen Kreger called him a few months ago to thank him for a recent donation, Dyer said he'd be happy to be included in a capital fundraising campaign for the school.\n\n\"Use my name. Use my picture. Whatever you want to promote Mercy,\" Kreger said Dyer told her.\n\nContributing: Patricia Montemurri, Detroit Free Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2016/02/19/as-novel-mockingbird-soared-author-lee-grew-more-elusive/80614976/", "title": "As novel 'Mockingbird' soared, author Lee grew more elusive", "text": "Kendal Weaver\n\nAssociated Press\n\nHarper Lee was an ordinary woman as stunned as anybody by the extraordinary success of \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\"\n\n\"It was like being hit over the head and knocked cold,\" Lee — who died Thursday at age 89, according to publisher HarperCollins — said during a 1964 interview, at a time when she still talked to the media.\n\n\"I didn't expect the book to sell in the first place. I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of reviewers but at the same time I sort of hoped that maybe someone would like it enough to give me encouragement.\"\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" may not be the Great American Novel. But it's likely the most universally known work of fiction by an American author over the past 70 years, that rare volume to find a home both in classrooms and among voluntary readers, throughout the country and beyond.\n\nLee was cited for her subtle, graceful style and gift for explaining the world through a child's eye, but the secret to the novel's ongoing appeal was also in how many books this single book contained. \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" was a coming-of-age story, a courtroom thriller, a Southern novel, a period piece, a drama about class, and — of course — a drama of race.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"All I want to be is the Jane Austen of South Alabama,\" she once observed.\n\nThe story of Lee is essentially the story of her book, and how she responded to it. She wasn't a bragger, like Norman Mailer, or a misanthrope like J.D. Salinger or an eccentric or tormented genius. She was a celebrity who didn't live or behave like a celebrity. By the accounts of friends and Monroeville residents, she was a warm, vibrant and witty woman who played golf, fished, ate at McDonald's, fed ducks by tossing seed corn out of a Cool Whip tub, read voraciously, and got about to plays and concerts. She just didn't want to talk about it before an audience.\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" was an instant and ongoing hit, published in 1960, as the civil rights movement was accelerating. It's the story of a girl nicknamed Scout growing up in a Depression-era Southern town. A black man has been wrongly accused of raping a white woman, and Scout's father, the resolute lawyer Atticus Finch, defends him despite threats and the scorn of many.\n\nPraised by The New Yorker as \"skilled, unpretentious, and totally ingenious,\" the book won the Pulitzer Prize and was made into a memorable movie in 1962, with Gregory Peck winning an Oscar for his portrayal of Atticus. \"Mockingbird\" inspired a generation of young lawyers and social workers, was assigned in high schools all over the country and was a popular choice for citywide, or nationwide, reading programs, although it was also occasionally removed from shelves for its racial content and references to rape.\n\nBy 2015, sales topped 40 million copies. When the Library of Congress did a survey in 1991 on books that have affected people's lives, \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" was second only to the Bible.\n\nLee herself became more elusive to the public as her book became more famous. At first, she dutifully promoted her work. She spoke frequently to the press, wrote about herself and gave speeches, once to a class of cadets at West Point.\n\nBut she began declining interviews in the mid-1960s and, until late in her life, firmly avoided making any public comment about her novel or her career. Claudia Durst Johnson, author of a book-length critical analysis of Lee's novel, described her as preferring to guard her privacy \"like others in an older generation, who didn't go out and talk about themselves on Oprah or the Letterman show at the drop of a hat.\" According to Johnson, Lee also complained that the news media invariably misquoted her.\n\nOther than a few magazine pieces for Vogue and McCall's in the 1960s and a review of a 19th-Century Alabama history book in 1983, she published no other work until stunning the world in 2015 by permitting the novel \"Go Set a Watchman\" to be released.\n\n\"Watchman\" was written before \"Mockingbird\" but was set 20 years later, using the same location and many of the same characters. The tone was far more immediate and starker than for \"Mockingbird\" and readers and reviewers were disheartened to find an Atticus nothing like the hero of the earlier book. The man who defied the status quo in \"Mockingbird\" was now part of the mob in \"Watchman,\" denouncing the Supreme Court's ruling that school segregation was unconstitutional and denouncing blacks as unfit to enjoy full equality.\n\nBut despite unenthusiastic reviews and questions whether Lee was well enough to approve the publication, \"Watchman\" jumped to the top of best-seller lists within a day of its announcement and remained there for months. Critics, meanwhile, debated whether \"Watchman\" would damage Lee's reputation, and the legacy of Atticus as an American saint.\n\nLee was in the news at other times, not always in ways she preferred. She was involved in numerous legal disputes over the rights to her book and denied she had cooperated with the biography \"The Mockingbird Next Door: Life With Harper Lee,\" by Marja Mills.\n\nSome occasions were happier. She wrote a letter of thanks in 2001 when the Chicago Public Library chose \"Mockingbird\" for its first One Book, One Chicago program. In 2007, she agreed to attend a White House ceremony at which she received a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Around the same time, she wrote a rare published item — for O, The Oprah Magazine — about how she became a reader as a child in a rural, Depression-era Alabama town, and remained one.\n\n\"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have laptops, cell phones, iPods, and minds like empty rooms, I still plod along with books,\" she wrote.\n\nBy 2014, she had given in to the digital age and allowed her novel to come out as an e-book, calling it \" 'Mockingbird' for a new generation.\"\n\nBorn in Monroeville, Nelle Harper Lee was known to family and friends as Nelle (pronounced Nell) — the name of a relative, Ellen, spelled backward. Like Atticus Finch, her father was a lawyer and state legislator. One of her childhood friends was Truman Capote, who lived with relatives next door to the Lees for several years.\n\nCapote became the model for Scout's creative, impish and loving friend Dill. In the novel, Dill is described as \"a pocket Merlin, whose head teamed with eccentric plans, strange longings, and quaint fancies.\"\n\nLee's friendship with Capote was evident later when she traveled frequently with him to Kansas, beginning in 1959, to help him do research for what became his own best-seller, the \"nonfiction\" novel \"In Cold Blood.\" He dedicated the book to her and his longtime companion, Jack Dunphy, but never acknowledged how vital a role she played in its creation.\n\nCharles J. Shields, in the first book-length attempt at a biography of Lee, \"Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee,\" showed how Lee helped Capote gain entrance to key figures in the murder investigation and provided keen observations and myriad notes that Capote wove into his book. (He also debunked a long-standing rumor that Capote had actually written much of \"Mockingbird.\")\n\nIn the 2005 film \"Capote,\" Philip Seymour Hoffman won the best actor Academy Award for his portrayal of Capote struggling with his demons as he works on the book. Catherine Keener was nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Lee. The next year, Sandra Bullock took the role of Lee in \"Infamous,\" with Toby Jones as Capote.\n\nLee said in the 1960s that she was working on a second novel, but over time it dropped from view and never reached a publisher.\n\nLee researched another book, a nonfiction account of a bizarre voodoo murder case in rural east Alabama, but abandoned the project in the 1980s.\n\nLee, who attended Huntingdon College in Montgomery as a freshman, transferred to the University of Alabama as a sophomore, where she wrote and became editor of the campus literary magazine. After studying to be a lawyer like her father and older sister, Lee left the university before graduating, heading to New York to become a writer, as Capote already had done.\n\nLee worked as an airlines reservation clerk in New York City during the early 1950s, writing on the side. Finally, with a Christmas loan from friends, she quit to write full time, and the first draft of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" reached its publisher, J.B. Lippincott, in 1957.\n\nThe manuscript, according to the publishing house, arrived under the title \"Atticus.\" The title later became \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" referring to an old saying that it was all right to kill a blue jay but a sin to kill a mockingbird, which gives the world its music.\n\nLee worked with the editor Tay Hohoff in bringing the book to its final form, a period when Lee was scrimping financially and dealing with the difficulties of rewriting.\n\n\"Though Miss Lee then had never published even an essay or a short story, this was clearly not the work of an amateur or tyro,\" the editor wrote in an account published by Lippincott in 1967. \"... She had learned the essential part of her craft, with no so-called professional help, simply by working at it and working at it, endlessly.\"\n\nCapote, in a letter to an aunt in July 1959, said that a year earlier Lee \"showed me as much of the book as she'd written, and I liked it very much. She has real talent.\"\n\nHer novel, while hugely popular, was not ranked by many scholars in the same category as the work of other Southern authors such as Eudora Welty or Flannery O'Connor. Decades after its publication, little was written about it in scholarly journals. Some critics have called the book naive and sentimental, whether dismissing the Ku Klux Klan as a minor nuisance in Maycomb or advocating change through personal persuasion rather than collective action.\n\nO'Connor, in an October 1960 letter, said, \"I think I see what it really is — a child's book. ... I think for a child's book, it does all right.\" Decades later, Toni Morrison would call it a \"white savior\" narrative, \"one of those,\" she told the Associated Press, expressing a common objection that so many books by white people reduced blacks to passive, secondary roles.\n\nParallels were drawn between Lee and Margaret Mitchell, another Southern woman whose only novel, \"Gone With the Wind,\" became a phenomenon made into a beloved movie. But Mitchell's book romanticized the black-white divide; Lee's work confronted it, although more gently than novels before and since.\n\n\"Mockingbird\" features Scout's often meandering recollection of the people — some eccentric, such as the reclusive Boo Radley — in rural Maycomb County, during the years when her brother Jem reaches adolescence and she enters school. Some critics said it relied at times on stereotypes, such as the mean, trashy whites making false charges against a virtuous black. But the tomboy Scout and the quietly courageous Atticus Finch drew praise as memorable, singular creations.\n\nThe book's tension is built around the lynching atmosphere in Maycomb as the black man goes on trial, a scenario reminiscent of the Scottsboro Boys rape case of the same period. Scout, Dill and Jem, whose playful curiosity takes scary turns, witness the drama of an adult world with its own frightening lessons.\n\n\"Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that 'To Kill a Mockingbird' spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct,\" Lee wrote to an editor in the 1960s. \"Christian in its ethic, that is the heritage of all Southerners.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/02/03/knoxville-concerts-2023-in-spring-include-lizzo-stevie-nicks-eagles/69827440007/", "title": "Knoxville concerts 2023 in spring include Lizzo, Stevie Nicks, Eagles", "text": "Big Ears Festival is set to bring countless artists to Knoxville this spring, but it won’t be the only opportunity to enjoy amazing music and shows.

In fact, the underrated guitar hero from here in Florida composed every original song, except two, on the album that propelled the band to superstardom.\n\nIt was this thrilling era of the Allman Brothers, when they were the biggest band in America, that helped inspire Cameron Crowe's classic 2000 film \"Almost Famous\" and is now the focus of Alan Paul's excellent book \"Brothers and Sisters,\" which is being published July 25 by St. Martin's Press.\n\nDickey Betts obit: Influential Allman Brothers Band singer and guitarist dies at Sarasota home\n\nNeed a break?

His previous book, \"One Way Out,\" is a fascinating oral history written with the band's participation, capturing various highs and lows from the 1960s right up to the years just before their final show in 2014. Paul's latest Allman Brothers book, though, is even more rewarding.\n\nIt's a traditional narrative featuring Paul's clean, smart, conversational prose, which he uses to make a strong case for \"Brothers and Sisters\" indeed being the definitive album of the 1970s. The book also explores how the Allman Brothers played an important role in getting their Georgia governor, Jimmy Carter, elected president and delves into the band's relationship with the Grateful Dead, leading to one of the largest rock festivals of all time, Summer Jam at Watkins Glen. The \"Brothers and Sisters\" book utilizes previously unheard interviews with key figures, including Betts and Allman, conducted by Allman Brothers archivist, photographer, and \"tour mystic\" Kirk West in the mid-1980s, during the band's second hiatus.\n\nUnlike Scott Freeman's Allman Brothers book, 'Midnight Riders,' which was published in 1995 and based on interviews he conducted with the band members in the '80s, Paul's latest work mostly avoids delving into the darker aspects of the band's drug-addled past and internal conflicts. However, it would be incomplete for any book about the Allman Brothers in the 1970s to disregard the federal drug charges, Gregg Allman's marriage to Cher, or Betts' marriage to Sandy Bluesky Wabegijig and later to Cher's assistant, Paulette Eghiazarian. Even in these sections, though, Paul maintains a tactful approach, providing necessary information without sensationalism.\n\n\"Brothers and Sisters\" at Amazon for $29\n\nGregg Allman dies at 69: rock legend was Sarasota area resident\n\nNew book \"Brothers and Sisters\" celebrates one of the most underrated guitarists in rock history\n\nMoreover, Paul's \"Brothers and Sisters\" book celebrates one of the most underrated guitarists in rock history. The Allman Brothers created a distinctive fusion of rock, blues, jazz, and country, highlighted by the groundbreaking twin lead guitar playing of Duane Allman and Betts. Their exceptional chemistry is best experienced on the band's seminal 1971 live album, \"At Fillmore East,\" which features Betts' epic instrumental \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed.\" However, despite Betts' equal skill as a player and his more prominent role as a songwriter and singer, Duane Allman is often primarily remembered as the main guitarist of the Allman Brothers.\n\nFollowing the tragic death of Duane Allman in '71 and bassist Berry Oakley in '72, Betts emerged as the de facto leader of the group. He showcased his songwriting and vocal talents on \"Ramblin' Man,\" the Allman Brothers' first and only Top 10 pop hit, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the U.S. Cashbox Top 100. \"Brothers and Sisters\" also includes notable Betts compositions such as the propulsive \"Southbound,\" sung by Gregg Allman, and the ebullient instrumental track \"Jessica,\" which also climbed the Hot 100 upon release before becoming a staple of classic rock radio. Paul cites \"Brothers and Sisters\" as the Allman Brothers' best-selling album, with more than seven million copies sold.\n\nRather than replace Duane Allman, the Allman Brothers recorded \"Brothers and Sisters\" and toured behind the album with a new lineup consisting of Betts as the sole lead guitarist. New member Chuck Leavell played keyboards, with singer Gregg Allman switching between keyboards and rhythm guitar. Original drummers Butch Trucks and Jai Johanny \"Jaimoe\" Johanson provided the rhythm section along with Jaimoe's longtime friend Lamar Williams on bass, replacing Oakley. Leavell and Williams injected fresh energy into the band with Leavell in particular contributing integral parts to songs such as \"Jessica.\" By and large, though, when the Allman Brothers Band peaked in popularity in the summer of '73, with the biggest album and hottest concert tour in the country, it was Betts at the helm.\n\n\"In this new lineup, any combination of players could lock into grooves with one another at various times,\" Paul explains, before further elaborating: \"Betts, an absolutely monster guitarist playing with confidence and creativity, stood atop this musical juggernaut.\"\n\nPaul's celebratory \"Brothers and Sisters\" book, complemented by the Allman Brothers' brilliant studio and live recordings from the 1972-75 era, sets the stage for a long and glorious weekend of pure Allman Brothers bliss. It's an experience that is sure to entertain while cultivating a newfound admiration for Dickey Betts' exceptional guitar skills, songwriting, and singing.\n\nJust make sure you have the four-disc \"super deluxe edition\" of \"Brothers and Sisters\" with the complete Winterland '73 show, and a copy of Paul's book \"One Way Out\" handy. Because right after finishing \"Brothers and Sisters,\" I immediately dove back into my worn copy of \"One Way Out\" and read about Betts reviving the Allman Brothers again in the '90s before acrimoniously, and unfairly, parting ways with the band he carried for so many years in 2000.\n\nBetts made beautiful music with his own bands for nearly two more decades and reconciled with his old pal Gregg Allman before his passing in 2017. Today, the legendary musician enjoys retirement with his wife, Donna, at their handsome waterfront home in south Sarasota County. While he rarely performs on stage, Betts continues to inspire countless musicians including his gifted son and former bandmate, Duane Betts, who recently released his impressive debut solo album \"Wild & Precious Life.\"\n\n\"Brothers and Sisters\" at Amazon for $29\n\nRead liner notes exclusive for Dickey Betts album ‘Official Bootleg Vol. 1’\n\nRead liner notes exclusive for Dickey Betts live album 'Ramblin' Man Live at the St. George Theatre'\n\nWade Tatangelo, who has written the liner notes for Dickey Betts' last two albums, is Ticket Editor for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, and Florida Regional Dining and Entertainment Editor for the USA TODAY Network.

Neither the writer nor the publisher expected much of the book.\n\n\"They knew, as the publishing giant Alfred A. Knopf once put it, that 'many a novel is dead the day it is published.' Unexpectedly, 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' went on to sell over 45 million copies, solidified its stature as a literary classic, and garnered García Márquez fame and acclaim as one of the greatest Spanish-language writers in history.\"\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning author followed with, among other novels, \"Autumn of the Patriarch\" (1975), \"Love in the Time of Cholera\" (1985) and \"The General in His Labyrinth\" (1989). Yet García Márquez considered his earlier novella, \"No One Writes to the Colonel\" (1961), his best book.\n\nGarcía Márquez died in 2014 at the age of 87.\n\nLater that year, the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas agreed to pay $2.2 million — at first the price was kept a secret — for the archives of the author, who lived in Mexico City during the latter years of his life.\n\nAs reported in the American-Statesman at the time, the archives contained more than 75 boxes of documents, and researchers now have access to draft manuscripts of published and unpublished works, correspondence, 43 photograph albums, 22 scrapbooks, research material, notebooks, newspaper clippings, screenplays and ephemera.\n\nA museum show, \"Gabriel García Márquez: The Making of a Global Writer,\" opened on Feb. 1, 2020. More than 8,000 people filed through to examine the books, papers, photos, posters, clippings and other effects of the master, before the show closed abruptly because of the pandemic in March 2020.\n\nDespite the limitations imposed by the pandemic, after reopening in late August, roughly 3,000 people have visited.\n\nAfter seeing the mind-boggling show in September, I talked with Santana-Acuña, the writer of that article in The Atlantic and a professor of sociology at Whitman College, who curated the Ransom Center show.\n\nI wondered what it was like to bury oneself for more than a decade in the thinking, writing and personal belongings of one great writer.\n\nOur exchange has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAmerican-Statesman: How did you first become acquainted with the work of Gabriel García Márquez? Had you read him since childhood? What attracted you to his writing?\n\nAlvaro Santana-Acuña: My story with \"Gabo,\" as many people like to call Gabriel García Márquez, started in the Canary Islands, where I encountered his work. In high school, I first read his short story, “The Handsomest Drowned Man in the World,” along (with) classic works by Borges, Kafka and Poe. Beyond the title, the tale did not impress me at the time.\n\nBut shortly after, I read \"No One Writes to the Colonel,\" and many years later, I still remember the moment I got to know the tragic story of the colonel. What attracts me (to) Gabo’s writing is that it has the rare quality of being accessible to popular audiences across cultures and languages, and at the same time is praised and studied by critics, generation after generation.\n\nTell us about your relationship to the material acquired by the Ransom Center.\n\nIn 2017, the Ransom Center selected me as one of the first recipients of a Mellon Foundation fellowship in order to study García Márquez’s archives, which the center had recently opened. At the time, I had been writing for seven years my book \"Ascent to Glory,\" which is a biography of how Gabo’s most famous novel, \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" was written and became a global classic.\n\nTexas History: The Hobby team that led Houston, Texas and America\n\nTo my surprise, after a couple of days working with Gabo’s papers, I realized that I had to rewrite \"Ascent.\" There were too many unknown facts waiting to be discovered and too many legends waiting to be debunked. It took me another four years to finish the book and, in the middle of it, the Ransom Center invited me to curate the exhibition on Gabo, which gave me another opportunity to study Gabo’s papers more closely.\n\nYour formal training is in sociology, history and social sciences. How did those fields influence your view of the material?\n\nHistory is a discipline that investigates the past from the present, and sociology is a discipline that studies the present, keeping an eye on the near future.\n\nAs I worked on my book, and later as I designed the exhibition, being a historian helped me to insert García Márquez in his time, which is crucial to understand why he became such an important global figure.\n\nAlso, becoming an international writer is not the result of pure chance or genius. Sociology can help to explain this. There are social forces that intersect and help transform a writer from a remote village in Colombia into one of the most beloved writers in the Spanish language after Miguel de Cervantes, the author of \"Don Quixote.\"\n\nIn your compelling show now at the Ransom Center, I was surprised by García Márquez’s extensive career as a journalist. How did that affect his fiction?\n\nIn 1947, García Márquez finished high school. His family — of humble origins — wanted him to become a lawyer, so he could move up the social ladder. But he dropped out of college. He told his father he wanted to be a writer, and his father, who knew how hard it was to make a living as a professional writer, told Gabo in anger: “You will eat paper.”\n\nIn the Latin America of 1947, those who wanted to be writers had to start as journalists. Gabo’s real professional school was journalism; it taught him the basic skills he needed to master in order to work as a professional writer, from finding ideas for his fiction to writing stories with his readers in mind to careful editing of his own prose.\n\nIf García Márquez had not become a journalist first, Gabo, the famous fiction writer, would have not been born.\n\nI was also surprised by his active work in movies, not just as a critic, but as a screenwriter. Tell us more about that.\n\nGabo was obsessed with storytelling from an early age. Journalism — at least in the way he saw it — was about storytelling based on true facts.\n\nMovies became one his passions at that time, because cinema is about storytelling, too. For years, while he was writing his journalistic pieces and his first novels and short stories, he went to movie theaters to understand the craft of cinematic storytelling.\n\nHe also studied montage, because it teaches you how to tell stories with moving images. In his 30s, Gabo was so much in love with cinema that he pursued a career as a professional (scriptwriter) and seriously considered quitting fiction writing all together. Yet a year later, he changed his mind and decided to sit down and write \"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\"\n\nEverywhere García Márquez landed, he fell in with groups of intellectuals, artists, filmmakers and writers. How did these social circles affect his writing?\n\nGabo’s decision to start writing \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" happened a great deal because of his friends. In Mexico City, in 1965, he was part of a group of artists, who called themselves “La Mafia.” Members of this group encouraged him to finish a book he had been trying to write for more than ten years.\n\nSome friends listened to him read, out loud, fragments of the book in progress. Others wrote him letters of support from distant countries. Several gave him money to pay the bills, because Gabo stopped working to finish the novel. And many gave him feedback about what he was writing.\n\nBehind most great works of art, there is a constellation of social relations that makes such works of art possible. This was the case of several of García Márquez’s books before they were published. His friends and peers read them in advance and their feedback influenced how Gabo wrote them.\n\nYou devote a big chunk of the show to “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” the novel that made García Márquez a world figure. What was it about that novel that made him a breakthrough artist?\n\nThe middle section of the exhibition is dedicated to \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" because it cut Gabo’s life into two parts. There is clearly a before and after in his life once this novel came out.\n\nMy book, \"Ascent to Glory,\" tries to answer your question. I needed over 300 pages to answer it, and what I can tell you here is that this novel was the culmination of many things — culturally, aesthetically, in the publishing sector — that were going on for at least 20 years.\n\nIn your book, you wrestle with the myths about how “One Hundred Years of Solitude” was written. What should we remember about the real story of its writing?\n\nI open the book with the myth about how the first sentence of the novel occurred to Gabo when he was driving towards a tourist resort for a vacation with his family. Yet suddenly a cow crossed in front of his road. He stopped, got out of the car, and from nowhere, the sentence of the novel descended upon him. Once he realized what happened, he rushed to the car and drove back home, where he furiously wrote the novel for eighteenth months.\n\nThis story is of course a myth — part of it contains some truth and part of is pure fabrication. Yet one of the things I show in my book is that myths help works of art to become classics.\n\nThink about the myths that surround the making of \"Mona Lisa,\" Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, or many of the Beatles’ songs.\n\nSo we cannot toss myths away as useless. Yet the real story behind myths is as fascinating and sometimes even more. In \"Ascent,\" I show that the story behind the myth of the solitary genius, and what emerges, is an incredible story of friendship and perseverance.\n\nGarcía Márquez became a major public figure, a part of current affairs and politics as well as international culture. How do you think that part of his life will be remembered?\n\nGabo wrote about several of the most important social and political affairs of his time. He was also friends with influential leaders of his age, including his controversial friendship with Cuban ruler Fidel Castro, plus Bill Clinton and other presidents and heads of state.\n\nUnfortunately, there are political affairs in which he got involved that are still current, such the interference of foreign powers in the lives of Latin American countries. And there are issues in which he was certainly a pioneer.\n\nIn 1992, he wrote for Time magazine a statement — shown at the exhibition — declaring that humanity may disappear in the 21st century due to the destruction of the environment. His words are becoming as prophetic as the final words of the gypsy Melquíades in \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" who predicted that the Buendía family would be effaced from the face of the Earth.\n\nIt was an enormous coup for the Ransom Center to acquire García Márquez’s papers and other effects. Do you think this will encourage other Spanish-language writers to consider the Austin center as a steward of their legacies? Also, the Nettie Benson Latin American Collection at UT already has an excellent collection in this field. Does that create a special synergy?\n\nThe purchase of Gabo’s papers by a U.S. institution caused a lot of controversy in Latin America. Yet the Ransom Center is the best location for his papers.\n\nThe center preserves the archives of writers that influenced García Márquez as a writer, such as Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and Jorge Luis Borges.\n\nAs I was selecting the materials for exhibition, I realized it would be possible for visitors not only to see García Márquez’s works first hand, but also to put them alongside the works of other writers. Visitors can now see the manuscript of \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" and next to it that of Cortázar’s masterpiece \"Hopscotch.\" They can also (see) the galley proofs of Joyce’s \"Ulysses\" next to those of Woolf’s “Key Gardens” and Faulkner’s \"As I Lay Dying.\"\n\nAustin’s Ransom Center is one of the few places in the world where literary collections of this caliber can be put on display side by side.\n\nMichael Barnes writes about the people, places, culture and history of Austin and Texas.

He was 78.\n\nThomas, who announced in March that he had been diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, died from complications of the disease Saturday at his home in Arlington, Texas, his publicist Jeremy Westby said in a statement.\n\nWhile he was receiving treatment in a Texas health care facility, Thomas issued a statement noting he was hopeful for a full recovery.\n\n\"I just wanted to take this unique opportunity to share my gratitude to Gloria, my wonderful wife and my rock for over 53 years, my family, friends, and fans,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I'm so blessed to have had the opportunity to record and perform beautiful songs in pop, country, and gospel music, and to share those wonderful songs and memories around the world with millions of you.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nA Hugo, Oklahoma-native who grew up in Houston, Billy Joe Thomas broke through in 1966 with a gospel-styled cover of Hank Williams' \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" and went on to sell millions of records and have dozens of hits across genres. He reached No. 1 with pop, adult contemporary and country listeners in 1976 with \"(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song.\" The same year, his \"Home Where I Belong\" became one of the first gospel albums to be certified platinum for selling more than 1 million copies.\n\nHis signature recording was \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head,\" a No. 1 pop hit and an Oscar winner for best original song as part of the soundtrack to one of the biggest movies of 1969, the irreverent Western \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" Thomas wasn't the first choice to perform the whimsical ballad composed by Burt Bacharach and Hal David; Ray Stevens turned the songwriters down. But his warm, soulful tenor fit the song's easygoing mood, immortalized on film during the scene when Butch (Paul Newman) shows off his new bicycle to Etta Place (Katharine Ross), the girlfriend of the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford).\n\n\"Raindrops\" has since been heard everywhere from \"The Simpsons\" to \"Forrest Gump\" and was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2013. But, at first, not everyone was satisfied. Thomas was recovering from laryngitis while recording the soundtrack version and his vocals are raspier than for the track released on its own. Redford, meanwhile, doubted the song even belonged in \"Butch Cassidy.\"\n\n\"When the film was released, I was highly critical – how did the song fit with the film? There was no rain,\" Redford told USA TODAY in 2019. \"At the time, it seemed like a dumb idea. How wrong I was.\"\n\nThomas would later say the phenomenon of \"Raindrops\" exacerbated an addiction to pills and alcohol which dated back to his teens, when a record producer in Houston suggested he take amphetamines to keep his energy up. He was touring and recording constantly and taking dozens of pills a day. By 1976, while \"(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song\" was hitting No. 1, he felt like he was \"number 1,000.\"\n\n\"I was at the bottom with my addictions and my problems,\" he said in 2020 on \"The Debby Campbell Goodtime Show.\" He cited a \"spiritual awakening,\" shared with his wife, Gloria Richardson, with helping him to get clean.\n\nThomas had few pop hits after the mid-1970s, but he continued to score on the country charts with such No. 1 songs as \"Whatever Happened to Old-Fashioned Love\" and \"New Looks from an Old Lover.\" In the late 1970s and early '80s, he was also a top gospel and inspirational singer, winning two Dove awards and five Grammys, including a Grammy in 1979 for best gospel performance for \"The Lord's Prayer.\"\n\nFans of the 1980s sitcom \"Growing Pains\" heard him as the singer of the show's theme song. He also acted in a handful of movies, including \"Jory\" and \"Jake's Corner\" and toured often. Recent recordings included \"Living Room Music,\" featuring cameos from Lyle Lovett, Vince Gill and Richard Marx. He had planned to record in 2020 in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, but the sessions were delayed because of the pandemic.\n\nThomas married Richardson in 1968, and had three daughters: Paige, Nora and Erin. He and his wife worked on the 1982 memoir \"In Tune: Finding How Good Life Can Be.\" His book \"Home Where I Belong\" came out in 1978 and was co-authored by Jerry B. Jenkins, later famous for the million-selling \"Left Behind\" religious novels written with Tim LaHaye.\n\nSpeaking to the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, in 2019, Thomas reflected on the prospect of retiring from music one day.\n\n\"If I reach a point where I don't feel like I'm performing as well, I guess that could happen,\" he said. \"I am getting older; it's inevitable my throat is aging as well. Maybe there will come a time at some point, but you know as long as I'm really having fun and I still do have a major motivation to do it, I just want to do it.\"\n\n'School of Rock' drummer Kevin Clark dies at 32: Jack Black, Miranda Cosgrove share tributes\n\nBesides music, Thomas loved baseball as a kid and started calling himself B.J. because so many Little League teammates also were named Billy Joe. By his teens, he was singing in church and had joined a local rock band, the Triumphs, whom he would stay with into his 20s. He enjoyed Ernest Tubbs, Hank Williams and other country performers his parents liked, but on his own he was inspired by the soul and rhythm and blues singers he heard on the radio or saw on stage, notably Jackie Wilson, whose hit ballad \"To Be Loved\" Thomas later covered and adopted as a kind of guide to his life.\n\n\"I was raised in a fairly dysfunctional situation and I went through years of intense alcoholism and drug addiction so the song was always a touchstone for me. When you open yourself up to drugs and alcohol at such a young age it becomes something you have to deal with the rest of your life,\" he told the Huffington Post in 2014.\n\n\"What a road block and heartbreak and times of failure these addictions have caused me. But I had that little piece of lightning from that song. That's the essence of the whole thing. To love and be loved. And that takes a lifetime to accomplish. It's always been an important part of my emotions.\"\n\nContributing: Bryan Alexander, USA TODAY; Ed Masley, Arizona Republic; and the Associated Press\n\n'The Very Hungry Caterpillar': Author Eric Carle dies at 91", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/29"}]}

The gritty new show, adapted from S.E. Hinton’s 1967 coming-of-age novel, scooped up four awards including best direction (Danya Taymor), lighting and sound design. Jolie walked the red carpet with her 15-year-old daughter, Vivienne, who is credited as a producer assistant on the box-office phenomenon.\n\n“Society changes, but the experience of being an outsider is universal,” Jolie said during Sunday’s telecast, which also included performances from best play winner “Stereophonic” and best musical revival “Merrily We Roll Along.” The Who’s Pete Townshend joined the cast of “Tommy” for a rousing rendition of “Pinball Wizard,” while on social media, Eddie Redmayne drew comparisons to “The Ring” for his nightmarish “Cabaret” number.\n\nThe ceremony, which aired live from Lincoln Center, featured delightful presenters such as Idina Menzel and Cynthia Erivo, who proclaimed “green girl power” as past and future stars of “Wicked.” Jonathan Groff (“Merrily We Roll Along”), Kara Young (“Purlie Victorious”) and Maleah Joi Moon (“Hell’s Kitchen”) gave the most overwhelmingly emotional speeches of the night, all with teary and heartfelt tributes to their parents. And “Hell’s Kitchen” veteran Kecia Lewis was both hilarious and inspiring as she read acceptance remarks from her smartphone. (“People, stop texting me, Jesus!”)\n\nTony Awards 2024: The complete list of winners\n\nHere are more of the biggest moments from Sunday's Tony Awards:\n\nDaniel Radcliffe wins first Tony Award, thanks longtime girlfriend and son\n\nAfter five Broadway shows over 16 years, Daniel Radcliffe finally earned his first Tony nomination and win for “Merrily We Roll Along,” a revival of Stephen Sondheim’s infamous flop musical. In his acceptance speech, the “Harry Potter” actor sweetly thanked his crying co-stars Lindsay Mendez and Jonathan Groff. “I don’t really have to act in this show,” Radcliffe said. “I just have to look at you and feel everything that I want to feel. I will never have it this good again.”\n\nRadcliffe also honored his partner, Erin Darke, who gave birth to their first child early last year. “You and our son are the best thing that has ever happened to me,” Radcliffe said through tears. Backstage, he spoke about how it felt to get his first Tony on Father’s Day: “It’s lovely,” Radcliffe told reporters. “I honestly haven’t spent a ton of time with my son today, so I’m excited to see him tomorrow.”\n\nHillary Clinton makes surprise appearance, gets a standing ovation\n\nHillary Clinton, a producer of the new historical musical “Suffs,” received a thunderous standing ovation as she introduced a performance of \"Keep Marching\" from the show.\n\n“I have stood on a lot of stages, but this is really special,” Clinton said, wearing a flowing white-and-gold gown (colors of the women's suffrage movement). “I know a little bit about how hard it is to make change, so I’m extremely proud of this original American musical by Shaina Taub, now a two-time Tony winner (for best original score and book).\" Clinton went on to stress the show's relevance in our fraught political climate, adding, “It’s an election year and we need to be reminded how important it is to vote.\"\n\n'Succession' star Jeremy Strong jokes about his intense Tony-winning role\n\nEmmy winner Jeremy Strong is now halfway to an EGOT with his win for best leading actor in a play for “An Enemy of the People.” The “Succession” actor choked up as he thanked his wife, Emma Wall, and their “three beautiful children.” Strong also charmingly paid tribute to theater ushers and front-of-house staff, who “see me walking in every day looking like I’ve just been run over by a truck and see me walking out even worse,” he quipped.\n\nIn “Enemy,” Strong plays a freethinking doctor whose community turns on him – at one point, violently dousing him with giant buckets of ice. He jokingly thanked director Sam Gold for “being everything an actor could hope for, and for bringing new meaning to the term ‘ice bucket challenge.’”\n\nAlicia Keys brings out Jay-Z for stirring 'Empire State of Mind' performance\n\nAfter a perplexing opening number by host Ariana DeBose, the ceremony got a much-needed jolt thanks to the cast of Alicia Keys’ musical “Hell’s Kitchen,” who belted out an electrifying medley of her songs. The performance kicked into high gear when Keys took the stage, playing piano as she launched into her 2009 hit “Empire State of Mind.”\n\n“Are we at the Tony Awards tonight?” Keys declared as she walked into the crowd. “I had to do something crazy, it’s my hometown!” The camera then cut to rapper Jay-Z, who joined Keys midsong as the whole audience leaped to its feet. It’s the kind of joyous performance that’s primed to sell a million tickets, made even better by the cutaways to A-listers such as Sarah Paulson and Jennifer Hudson dancing in their seats.\n\nBrooke Shields makes a splash with comfortable Crocs on the red carpet\n\nBrooke Shields turned heads at the Tonys wearing a canary yellow dress, which she accessorized with matching Crocs shoes. The actress explained her affordable choice of footwear to People magazine, saying, “I got my Crocs! I couldn’t do this in heels!” She elaborated in an Instagram post over the weekend, noting that she was recovering from “double foot toe surgery.” The former model was on hand at the ceremony to introduce Nicole Scherzinger, who gorgeously sang “What I Did For Love” from “A Chorus Line” for the in-memoriam segment.\n\nSarah Paulson decompresses after her Broadway play with 'Real Housewives'\n\n\"Carol\" star Sarah Paulson won her first Tony for best leading actress in a play for \"Appropriate,\" a scorching melodrama about a family wrestling with their patriarch's racist past. Backstage, Paulson was asked about how she winds down after playing such a grueling role eight shows a week.\n\n\"I would lie to you and say, 'Oh, I meditate,'\" Paulson said. \"But I watch the 'Housewives,' I watch that 'Dancing with the Devil' TikTok show on Netflix. I'm trying to find ways to put air into my brain because there's a lot to hold with this play; it's emotionally and physically hard. But the truth is, I'm tired a lot. We've been doing this play since November,\" and recently crossed 200 performances. \"I'm doing what I love, so I'm not complaining, but I'm tired!\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/arts/2018/06/10/tony-shalhoub-wins-his-first-tony-award-bands-visit/687599002/", "title": "Tony Shalhoub wins his first Tony Award for 'The Band's Visit'", "text": "Green Bay native Tony Shalhoub took home his first Tony Award Sunday night, for best actor in a musical for his performance in \"The Band's Visit.\"\n\nIt was Shalhoub's fourth Tony nomination. He'd also been up for awards in 2014 for “Act One,” in 2013 for “Golden Boy” and in 1992 for “Conversations With My Father.”\n\n\"The Band's Visit,\" a musical based on a 2007 Israeli movie about an Egyptian police band finding itself in a small town in Israeli, was the big winner at the Tonys Sunday night. The show won 10 awards in all, including best musical, best actress in a musical for Katrina Lenk and best featured actor in a musical for Ari’el Stachel.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Shalhoub spoke of his immigrant father, Joe, who was 8 years old when he came to Ellis Island in 1920 on a boat from Lebanon.\n\n“Tonight, I celebrate him and all of those whose family journeyed before him and with him and after him. And I feel that this extremely generous gesture of yours honors not only their aspirations, their courage, their resourcefulness and their creativity and their selflessness,” he said, becoming emotional.\n\n“… May we, their descendants, never lose sight of what they taught us.”\n\nAND THE TONYS WENT TO … Winners in major categories at Sunday night's Tony Awards: Best musical: \"The Band's Visit\" Best play: \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts One and Two\" Best revival of a musical: \"Once on This Island\" Best revival of a play: \"Angels in America\" Best lead actress in a musical: Katrina Lenk, \"The Band's Visit\" Best lead actor in a musical: Tony Shalhoub, \"The Band's Visit\" Best lead actress in a play: Glenda Jackson, \"Edward Albee's Three Tall Women\" Best lead actor in a play: Andrew Garfield, \"Angels in America\" Best featured actress in a musical: Lindsay Mendez, \"Rodgers & Hammerstein's Carousel\" Best featured actor in a musical: Ari'el Stachel, \"The Band's Visit\" Best featured actress in a play: Laurie Metcalf, \"Edward Albee's Three Tall Women\" Best featured actor in a play: Nathan Lane, \"Angels in America\"\n\nWhen he addressed the press backstage after the win, Shalhoub talked about an event from his childhood that played a major role in his love for theater.\n\nHe was 6 and was recruited by his older sister, Susan Shalhoub Larkin, to be among the children who performed in her high school production of “The King and I.” During dress rehearsal, as Act I ended with a number by the children, he somehow found himself the only child on the outside of the curtain when it came down. There was laughter, and even more when he couldn’t find the opening in the curtains to get off the stage.\n\nHe burst into tears, he said.\n\n“It has just been one humiliation after another since then,” he joked. “But maybe that laughter was kind of like a bug burrowed into my system. It hooked me forever, I think.”\n\nOther nominees with Wisconsin ties didn't fare as well.\n\nMark Rylance, who's won three Tonys and an Academy Award, was nominated for best actor in a play for \"Farinelli and the King,\" but lost to Andrew Garfield, who won for his performance in the revival of Tony Kushner's \"Angels in America.\"\n\nPulitzer Prize winner and Brookfield Central High School alum Ayad Akhtar, nominated for best play for \"Junk,\" lost to the night's other big winner, \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts One and Two,\" which took home six Tonys in all.\n\nBonus local angle at Sunday's Tonys: Rachel Brosnahan, the Milwaukee native who won a Golden Globe for her performance on Amazon's \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\" introduced the musical number performed from \"The Band's Visit,\" \"Omar Sharif.\" The connection: Shalhoub plays Brosnahan's father on \"Mrs. Maisel.\"\n\nBut the night's biggest moment wasn't about giving or getting a Tony. After the telecast acknowledged that Melody Herzfeld — a drama teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida who had kept her students safe in a classroom during the massacre that left 17 people dead — had received the awrad for excellence in theater education, Herzfeld's students took the stage and sang a stirring rendition of “Seasons of Love,” from “Rent.”\n\nThe Green Bay Press Gazette's Kendra Meinert contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/theater/2013/06/09/tony-awards-news-story/2405905/", "title": "'Kinky Boots' wins six Tonys, 'Pippin' is top revival", "text": "Brian Truitt\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe musical %27Kinky Boots%27 leads Tony Awards with six wins\n\n%27Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike%27 wins best play\n\nCicely Tyson gets her first Tony for %27A Trip to Bountiful%27\n\nGirls and drag queens just wanted to have fun at the 67th annual Tony Awards.\n\nThe musical Kinky Boots led the Tonys with six awards, including wins for best musical, leading actor Billy Porter and composer — and 1980s rock star — Cyndi Lauper, while a revival of Stephen Schwartz's musical Pippin picked up four Tonys and Cicely Tyson won her first ever.\n\n\"I can't say I wasn't practicing in front of the shower curtain for a couple days for this speech,\" said Lauper, honored for best score. \"All right, I gotta thank my mom for sharing all that wonderful music. I wrecked all her Broadway musicals when I was a kid, the cast albums. That's how I learned how to sing, and I want to thank her for sharing the music with me.\n\n\"And I want to thank Harvey Fierstein for calling me up. I'm so glad I was done with the dishes and I answered the phone.\"\n\nPorter, who plays a drag queen helping out a struggling shoe-factory owner in Boots, was also overwhelmed with excitement. \"Shakespeare said 'To thine own self be true,' \" he said. \"When I was 11 years old, my journey to truth began when I discovered the Tony Awards washing dishes in my kitchen, and the performance of Jennifer Holliday and the cast of Dreamgirls on the Tony Awards took my breath away. That moment changed my life.\"\n\nBoots' Jerry Mitchell was honored for choreography, John Shivers won for best sound design, and the honor for best orchestrations went to Stephen Oremus, who spoke about seeing Lauper perform in 1984, when he was 13: \"It blows my mind to this day knowing that I collaborate with her.\"\n\nPippin won four Tonys, including best revival and lead actress in a musical for star Patina Miller, who told the crowd \"this is a childhood dream come true\" for the South Carolina native.\n\n\"When you get it right, it makes for extraordinary theater,\" said Pippin producer Barry Weisler. \"We got it right this time.\"\n\nAndrea Martin, who plays Pippin's perky grandma, hoisted the Tony for featured actress, and Diane Paulus picked up the trophy for best director of a musical. She dedicated the first of three Pippin wins to her family: \"To my parents who gave me the best gift a daughter could ever hope for: the encouragement to do what you want with your life, which for me was the theater, and I can only hope to be as good a mother to my two daughters, Natalie and Katharine, who are at home watching. This is for you, you are my joy.\"\n\nThe Trip to Bountiful star Tyson was honored with a Tony — her first — for lead actress in a play to mark her return to Broadway after three decades.\n\nShe didn't think she would ever get back. \"I had a burning desire to do one more great role. I didn't want to be greedy. Just one more,\" Tyson said.\n\n\"You wrapped me up in your arms after 30 years, and now I can go home with a Tony.\"\n\nVanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?took home the top play honors at the Tony Awards.\n\nChristopher Durang's Vanya and Sonia, a family comedy starring Sigourney Weaver and David Hyde Pierce, won for best play.\n\n\"I wrote my first play in second grade in 1958. It is now 2013. It's been a long road but I'm very happy to be here,\" Durang said. \"My mother died when I was 30, and I feel she wants to thank you tonight as well.\"\n\nVirginia Woolf, Edward Albee's classic play about a middle-aged couple's dissolving marriage, won for best revival, star Tracy Letts topped the leading-actor race (which included Oscar winner Tom Hanks), and Pam MacKinnon took home honors for best director, her second consecutive nomination and first Tony. She gave a shout-out to Albee \"for his fantastic play and for giving my career a shape, for giving my career a spine.\"\n\nMatilda the Musical also had four wins: first-time nominee Gabriel Ebert for featured actor in a musical, Hugh Vanstone for lighting designs, Rob Howell for scenic design and Dennis Kelly for best book of the musical adaptation of Roald Dahl's story of a 5-year-old girl who discovers she has telekinetic abilities.\n\nIt was the Matilda creative team who \"trusted and allowed me to step into their immaculate vision with my crazy alligator-skin shoes,\" Ebert said. \"To be in this room with these paragons of men, I'm so honored and humbled and grateful and slightly freaked out.\"\n\nThe Assembled Parties star Judith Light received the award for featured actress in a play, her second in a row — she also won last year for Other Desert Cities.\n\n\"I want to thank every woman that I am in this category nominated with. You have made this a celebration, not a competition,\" Light said.\n\nShe also thanked \"all of you in this community for your discipline and your devotion and your dedication. You lift your culture with your dedication and your artistry. You inspire me, and I cannot tell you how grateful I am to be a part of you and call you my family.\"\n\nA two-time Tony nominee, Courtney B. Vance won featured actor in a play for his role in Nora Ephron's posthumous Lucky Guy, which also scored a win for Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer for lighting design.\n\n\"Mommy, this one's for you. Which way do I go?\" Vance said.\n\nBroadway veteran William Ivey Long won best costume design of a musical for his work on Rodgers + Hammerstein's Cinderella, while Ann Roth was awarded for her costumes for the play The Nance, a tragicomic study of a gay burlesque performer. The Nance also won for sound design (Leon Rothenberg) and scenic design (John Lee Beatty).\n\nIn her speech, Roth saluted the show's star, a nominee for leading actor: \"I don't know if a man can be a muse, but Nathan Lane is my main guy. I think he's the best actor in the whole wide world. I mean it.\"\n\nIn a pre-show ceremony hosted by Jane Krakowski and Jesse Tyler Ferguson, lifetime achievement awards were given to Bernard Gersten, the 90-year-old executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater since 1985; Paul Libin, president of Circle in the Square Theatre School; and Ming Cho Lee, a Chinese-born American theatrical set designer and a longtime professor at the Yale School of Drama.\n\n\"I share this Tony Award with everyone who made it possible,\" Libin said.\n\n\"It takes a lifetime to get from there to here,\" Gersten said in his acceptance speech, in which he also thanked his wife, daughters and four grandchildren. \"This beloved family has been my lifetime achievement.\"\n\nLee joked that he holds \"the unbroken record of being a total failure in Broadway theater. I have more flaws than anyone can count.\n\n\"I never thought I'd be 82,\" he added, \"and here I am.

Then Spacey gets a Great Comet-esque fake beard and pokes fun at fellow awards hosts Ricky Gervais and Neil Patrick Harris.

Hard pass.)\n\nThe \"Color Purple\" powerhouse then ran into Winfrey in the wings, asking her, \"What do you do when everyone is telling you what you need to do?\" Winfrey dispensed her wisdom, saying: \"Forget about them, babe. The only thing you need to do is be yourself.\" Grinning, Erivo proceeded to grab Winfrey's finger – re-creating her viral \"holding space\" meme with \"Wicked\" co-star Ariana Grande from last fall.\n\n\"There's no place like home,\" Erivo said onstage, in one of her many nods to \"Wicked\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\" throughout the night. \"And Broadway has always been mine.\"\n\nFrom the stage to the screen: Sign up for USA TODAY's Entertainment newsletter.\n\nSarah Snook says 'Succession' group chat has lit up since her Tony win\n\nSnook, who's best known to HBO fans as Shiv Roy on \"Succession,\" received her first Tony Award for best leading actress in a play for \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" giving a marathon performance as 26 different characters in the one-person show.\n\nSeveral \"Succession\" alums have graced Broadway this past year, including Jeremy Strong (\"The Enemy of the People\"), Kieran Culkin (\"Glengarry Glen Ross\"), Juliana Canfield (\"Stereophonic\") and Molly Griggs (\"John Proctor is the Villain\").\n\n\"We haven't done much flaunting of awards in photos, but it's such a special group chat,\" Snook told reporters backstage. \"It’s a really special group of people, and we're all theater nerds deep down.\"\n\nLast spring, Cate Blanchett's production company Dirty Films acquired movie rights to bring \"Dorian Gray\" to the big screen. Snook said she hasn't yet heard anything about the potential adaptation, although she would be open to reprising her roles.\n\n\"I don’t know how this gets turned into a film,\" Snook said. \"It’s a particularly complex piece to do as a theater show. Dramaturgically, it holds up, and I think Kip (Williams) would be an incredible director for that project. If I got to be a part of that, that would be a dream come true.\"\n\nNicole Scherzinger, Audra McDonald, 'Hamilton' reunion hit Tony performance highs\n\nTo celebrate the 10th anniversary of \"Hamilton,\" Lin-Manuel Miranda, Leslie Odom Jr. and the original Broadway cast took the stage for an electrifying medley of the most beloved songs from the groundbreaking hip-hop musical, including \"My Shot,\" \"The Schuyler Sisters,\" \"You’ll Be Back\" and \"The Room Where It Happens.\" McDonald also brought the audience to its feet with her ferociously emotional rendition of \"Rose's Turn\" from \"Gypsy.\"\n\nEarlier in the night, \"Sunset Boulevard\" leading lady Scherzinger took our breath away with her stunning take on \"As If We Never Said Goodbye,\" introduced by the show's original Broadway star, Glenn Close.\n\nScherzinger went on to clinch the Tony for best leading actress in a musical in what was considered a neck-and-neck race with McDonald. “Growing up, I always felt like I didn’t belong,” the former Pussycat Dolls singer said through tears. “But you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home, at last.”\n\n'Maybe Happy Ending' star Darren Criss dedicates Tony Award to his wife and kids\n\nIn another of the tightest races of the evening, Criss garnered best leading actor in a musical for \"Maybe Happy Ending,\" trouncing formidable contenders Jonathan Groff (\"Just in Time\") and Tom Francis (\"Sunset Boulevard\"). The \"Glee\" charmer elatedly thanked his spouse for helping raise their two children amid his demanding schedule.\n\n\"The real hero … is my wife, Mia, who took a massive swing on allowing me to do this and to allow this crazy upheaval in our life to make this logistically possible,\" Criss said.\n\n\"And for bearing the brunt of raising two tiny friends under 3 so that I could raise a singing robot at the Belasco Theatre eight times a week.

And she is.\"\n\nWritten by Escola, \"Oh, Mary!\" imagines Lincoln as an alcoholic wannabe cabaret star and her husband, Abraham (Conrad Ricamora), as a closeted, temperamental commander-in-chief. Asked by reporters whether they would consider an Eleanor Roosevelt comedy next, Escola joked that she is \"played out. It would have to be something original, not another historical figure.\"\n\nThe singular playwright had some choice four-letter words for people who refuse to take chances on queer art; later, they sardonically compared the best actress showdown to a presidential election. (“Four more years!” they deadpanned when Scherzinger won.) But Escola had earnest moments, too, as they looked back at the unlikely phenomenon around “Oh, Mary!”\n\n“Trust that voice that says, ‘I think I’m right actually,’” Escola said. “It might take 12 years to put the pen to paper, but that voice is right.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/theater/2016/06/13/tonys-celebrate-tolerant-ideals-american-theater-hamilton-miller/85816812/", "title": "Tonys celebrate American theater, from Miller to 'Hamilton,' and ...", "text": "Elysa Gardner\n\n@elysagardner, USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK — Can a victory as utterly predictable as the bounty of Tony Awards reaped by Hamilton still be sweet? The answer, on Sunday night, was an unequivocal yes.\n\nThe hip-hop-infused blockbuster— which already had won the Pulitzer Prize and, in its earlier off-Broadway incarnation, pretty much every award available to it — made its presence felt early in the broadcast. Members of the company joined this year’s host, Tony winner turned TV personality James Corden, in a parody of Hamilton’s opening number. “We like to give the little guys a leg up here,” Corden joked, referring to the production’s record-setting 16 nominations.\n\nThe musical wound up winning 11 in all, stopping just short of The Producers' record 12 — no mean feat, given that three of Hamilton's actors ran against each other in one category, performance by a featured actor, and two in another, leading actor. Leslie Odom Jr., who as Aaron Burr is a blazing foil to creator/star Lin-Manuel Miranda's Alexander Hamilton, won in the latter category, over Miranda.\n\nMiranda, as predicted, collect awards for his book and score, with Hamilton also winning in the categories of featured actor and actress in a musical, director, orchestrations, choreography and costume and lighting design and, of course, musical.\n\nHow many Tonys did 'Hamilton' win?\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nDespite the celebratory atmosphere, there were nods throughout to the tragedy that shadowed the ceremony: the mass shooting that killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning. Jessica Lange, collecting her first Tony for playing — for a beautifully textured turn as tortured matriarch Mary Tyrone in a revival of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day’s Journey Into Night — said in her acceptance speech, “This is a dream come true and it fills me with such happiness on a sad day like this.\"\n\nFrank Langella, named best leading actor in a play for his equally harrowing portrait of an aging man inThe Father, urged those in the Florida city “to be strong, because I am standing in a room full of the most generous human beings on Earth, and we will be with you every step of the way.”\n\n'Hamilton' has huge night with 11 Tony Awards\n\nThe issue of tolerance was particularly relevant at this ceremony. The diversity embodied by Hamilton’s casting — Miranda is the son of Puerto Rican natives, and the multi-racial company features black actors as other founding fathers, including a few presidents — was typical of this Broadway season, and reflected in other nominated productions, among them Eclipsed and the 10-times-nominated musical (but not awarded) Shuffle Along. Corden suggested that the audience think of the Tonys as “the Oscars with diversity”\n\nA revelatory staging of The Color Purple (by Scottish director John Doyle) earned best revival of a musical, and another Tony for its powerhouse of a leading lady, Cynthia Erivo. With Odom and Hamilton's featured actor and actress, Daveed Diggs and Renée Elise Goldsberry, joining her, that made this the first year that all awards for performances in musicals were given to actors of color.\n\nThe Humans, Stephen Karam's witty, sobering portrait of a modern middle-class family facing numerous challenges, won best play, with beloved stage veteran Jayne Houdyshell winning her first Tony, for featured actress in a play, and costar Reed Birney winning featured actor. Belgian director Ivo Van Hove took home an award for his stark revival of Arthur Miller’s A View From the Bridge, named best revival.\n\nMiller and O'Neill were not the only great old-school scribes recognized at the Tonys. Winners announced prior to the broadcast included legendary lyricist Sheldon Harnick, represented on Broadway this season in revivals of both She Loves Me and Fiddler On The Roof, one of the many ambitious, socially conscious musicals that helped pave the way for Hamilton. Accepting a special award for lifetime achievement, the 92-year-old Harnick quipped, “If I didn’t deserve it, this would be embarrassing.”\n\nContributing: Brian Truitt", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/10/16/harrison-graduate-karen-olivo-has-shot-2nd-tony-award-moulin/3678902001/", "title": "Harrison grad Karen Olivo has shot at 2nd Tony for lead role in ...", "text": "LAKELAND — Even with Broadway theaters shuttered by the COVID-19 pandemic, Karen Olivo manages to shine.\n\nOlivo, a graduate of Lakeland’s Harrison School for the Arts, was nominated Thursday for a Tony Award for her lead performance in the musical “Moulin Rouge!” It is her first nomination since she won a Tony, the theater industry’s most prestigious award, in 2009 for her portrayal of Anita in a revival of “West Side Story.”\n\nThe former Winter Haven resident is one of three nominees in the category of best actress in a lead role in a musical. The others are Elizabeth Stanley for “Jagged Little Pill” and Adrienne Warren for “Tina: The Tina Turner Musical.”\n\nOlivo, 44, beat out a legion of actresses auditioning for the role of Satine, a cabaret artist performing in a Paris club at the turn of the 20th century. “Moulin Rouge!” is an adaptation of Baz Luhrmann’s 2001 movie, in which Nicole Kidman portrayed Satine.\n\nThat film juxtaposed the Belle Epoque setting and costumes with modern rock and pop songs, an approach that director Alex Timbers continued in the musical. The score includes many songs that date from after the release of the movie, and Olivo has gained particular notice for her rendition of Katy Perry’s “Firework.”\n\nThe role called on Olivo to display her acting, singing and dancing skills.\n\n“Moulin Rouge!” is one of three Tony nominees for best musical. Aaron Tveit, who plays Christian, the English poet who falls in love with Satine, was nominated for best actor in a lead role in a musical.\n\nThe Ledger could not reach Olivo for comment Friday, but the website Theater Mania posted a response from her. Olivo first gave credit to Ashley Loren, standby for Satine, and to dresser A.J. Littlefield and the production’s hair and makeup supervisor, Daniel Mortenson.\n\n“Not one of us in the theater does ANYTHING by ourselves,” Olivo wrote.\n\nShe added: “I hope that the spotlight on the Tony Awards will illuminate the fact that Arts Workers everywhere, not just on Broadway, are struggling. By all means, let's celebrate the work of all of these artisans but let us also seek the government mandated financial assistance that will ensure we exist beyond this global pandemic.\"\n\nOlivo’s father, Rick Olivo of Lakeland, said Karen has been heavily involved in advocating for theater workers since the pandemic forced the closing of productions.\n\n“Moulin Rouge!” opened in July 2019 at the Al Hirschfield Theatre on Broadway. Performances were suspended in March as COVID-19 began spreading and hit New York especially hard. At this point, all Broadway productions are on hold through May.\n\nBorn in New York, Olivo moved at age 7 with her family to Winter Haven and performed as a child at Theater Winter Haven and what is now Lakeland Community Theatre before being accepted to Harrison, graduating in 1994. She attended the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and left a year early after being cast in 1997 in the original Broadway production of the musical “Rent.”\n\nRick Olivo founded a troupe that evolved into Lakeland Community Theatre and directed many productions. The elder Olivo, best known as a painter and sculptor, said Friday morning that he hadn’t yet been able to talk to his daughter about the Tony nomination.\n\n“That phone is hotter than bacon on a grill,” he said.\n\nOlivo said Karen was “ecstatic” about being back on Broadway after landing the role in “Moulin Rouge!”\n\nKidman attended a performance of the musical and talked to Olivo afterward. Rick Olivo said his daughter described their conversation, in which Kidman seemed especially impressed with the way her fellow actress conveyed the symptoms of consumption, also known as tuberculosis.\n\n“She says Nicole was asking questions of how she does the coughing,” Rick Olivo said. “You think she’s going to drop a lung in that last scene.”\n\nKaren Olivo rose to prominence for originating the role of Vanessa in the musical “In the Heights,” which moved from small theaters to Broadway in 2008. The acclaimed musical was co-written by and starred Lin-Manuel Miranda, who later achieved renown as the creator of “Hamilton,” one of the most successful Broadway productions of the century.\n\nOlivo won an Astaire Award as best female dancer for “In the Heights.” Director Arthur Laurents then cast her in the role of Anita in a new version of “West Side Story,” the musical first produced on Broadway in 1957. Olivo captured her first Tony Award in 2009 as Best Featured Actress in a Musical.\n\nShe was forced to leave the production in 2010 after breaking her foot during a performance.\n\nOlivo moved to Los Angeles and gained roles on the TV shows “The Good Wife” and “Harry’s Law.” She shifted to Madison, Wisconsin, in 2013, marrying Jim Uphoff, a sound technician she met on Broadway. Over the next few years, she taught theater classes in Madison and performed in Austria, New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C. and released a music album.\n\nOlivo left a Chicago production of “Hamilton” in 2017, intending to devote more time to teaching, but then the opportunity to audition for “Moulin Rouge” arose. She landed the role, her first as the lead in a major production and her first Broadway engagement in a decade.\n\nOlivo and the other principals developed a laboratory version of the musical in 2017 and did pre-production performances in Boston the following year.\n\nRick Olivo admitted that he told his daughter after she left New York and eventually settled in Wisconsin that he didn’t think she would ever be cast in a Broadway role again.\n\n“I said, ‘They’re not going to take you after this,’ ” Olivo said. “You just snubbed them in the face.”\n\nHe said he was happy to see his daughter prove him wrong.\n\nThe 74th annual Tony Awards presentation was originally scheduled for June at Radio City Music Hall in New York.

The show also earned best book and score, and best director.\n\nLincoln Center Theater's glorious staging of The King and I won best revival of a musical, as widely predicted. Leading lady Kelli O'Hara, a six-time nominee, finally won her first Tony, triumphing in arguably the night's tightest race, in which co-host Kristin Chenoweth was also a nominee. In O'Hara's gracious, exuberant speech, she acknowledged her parents, \"sitting next to me for the sixth time.\" She added, \"You don't have to pretend it's OK this time.\"\n\nHelen Mirren was the other first-time winner, for performance by a leading actress in a play. Mirren won for playing Queen Elizabeth II, a role that previously earned her an Oscar, in the U.K. import The Audience. (The play was written by Peter Morgan, who also wrote the film that earned her the Academy Award, The Queen.) \"Your Majesty did it again,\" an elegant Mirren said in her acceptance speech. She acknowledged the cast of American and British actors, who \"make the Atlantic\" Ocean seem like \"a little creek you can just pop across.\"\n\nLater in the media room, asked if she'd portray the queen another time, Mirren quipped: \"I don't think I'll do it again. I'm sure Her Majesty is sick to the teeth with me.\" More seriously, she spoke of the \"incredible sense of community\" in theater, \"stronger here on Broadway than it is anywhere else that I've experienced.\"\n\nNeed a break?

Curious Incident's Marianne Elliott won best director of a play, and leading man Alex Sharp — a recent Juilliard graduate, who plays a teenager with an Asperger's Syndrome-like condition — beat out several more famous names, including Bradley Cooper, for best performance by an actor in a leading role in a play.\n\n\"To be holding this is just insane,\" Sharp said, accepting the award, and reached out movingly in his speech to young people who feel \"misunderstood or different.\"\n\nKing's Ruthie Ann Miles won the Tony for featured actress in a musical, edging out the three actresses who played the heroine in Fun Home (at different stages of life). Annaleigh Ashford won featured actress in a play, for a celebrated revival of You Can't Take It With You.\n\nMusicals were, of course, in focus. This year's nominees for best musical certainly represented the contemporary form in all its variety. Fun Home had tied for most nominations, 12, with An American in Paris, an adaptation of the beloved 1951 film directed by ballet-bred star choreographer and Broadway newbie Christopher Wheeldon (who won best choreographer).\n\nThe musical Something Rotten!, a giddy, bawdy romp set in Shakespeare's time — and featuring him as a rather buffoonish character — was a contender for 10 and had its share of champions. So did The Visit, the chilling final collaboration between composer John Kander and late lyricist Fred Ebb, the team behind Chicago and Cabaret.\n\nChristian Borle, the chap who played Shakespeare in Rotten! , collected the trophy for featured actor in a musical. He hailed his vehicle as something \"completely original\" and \"kindhearted\" as well as hilarious.\n\nIn a pre-show acceptance speech for best book, Fun Home librettist/lyricist Lisa Kron acknowledged the diversity of the season. \"Our house is so big,\" she said.\n\nChenoweth and co-host Alan Cumming arrived on the red carpet together, the latter decked out in a blue jacket with a wacky graphic print. (He said he was looking forward to deejaying at an afterparty.) Asked how she had juggled her hosting duties with performing eight shows a week in On the Twentieth Century, Chenoweth simply and seriously said, \"Prayer.\"\n\nMirren appeared on the carpet in a creamy gown with a lacey cape. \"I love working on Broadway,\" she said. \"I've done it three times now and each time it was a special experience.\" She noted that American audiences \"come without preconceived ideas about either the queen or the prime ministers. It's a very lively feeling in the house.\"\n\nElisabeth Moss, nominated for performance by a leading actress in a play for the acclaimed revival of The Heidi Chronicles, noted it was her first time at the Tonys. \"It means a lot to me to be here because I don't belong to the theater world, but I've always watched it and wanted to be part of it,\" said the actress, who was wearing an Oscar de la Renta cream-colored halter gown, sprinkled across the bodice and waist with a pattern of multi-colored flowers.\n\nFor George Takei, whose musical Allegiance is set to open on Broadway this fall, it was also the first time at the Tonys ball. He saluted the two \"queens\": \"Queen Helen of Mirren, and Queen Chita of Rivera.\" Takei also had praise for Something Rotten!, noting that while he loved the performance of Brad Oscar, one of the production's acting nominees for the role of Nostradamus, he'd like a crack at playing the soothsayer himself.\n\nPrevious Tony Award winner Patina Miller also saluted Chita Rivera, a nominee for leading actress in a musical for The Visit.\n\n\"I'd love to have a drink with Chita,\" Miller said. \"I've never had a drink with her. I loved her show.\"\n\nContributing: Donna Freydkin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/06/08"}]}

The system continuously monitors maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate, contractions, and labor progression to help clinicians quickly identify any concerning developments for faster intervention.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center delivers more than 750 babies each year. Stacy Wood, RN, director of women’s services, indicates this new technology is an important resource to support maternal/fetal health and safe deliveries.\n\n“Every delivery is unique and the health and well-being of every mom and baby is our priority during childbirth,” says Jeanette Toney, MD. “While most births happen without complication, there are some inherent risks in the delivery of a newborn. This new technology adds another layer of protection throughout the labor process to help our maternity team recognize, prevent and respond to avoidable complications.”\n\nThrough pattern recognition, the technology can also pinpoint opportunities for overall improvement based on consolidated data from multiple births. As the maternity team reviews trends and identifies areas where improvement is possible, the hospital can use that information to develop protocols that further increase safety and may lead to better outcomes for mothers and babies.\n\n“By investing in this technology, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center is making labor and delivery safer for mothers and babies,” said Colin McRae, chief executive officer, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center. “Our physicians and nurses are highly skilled medical professionals and excellent caregivers and they appreciate the use of technology to support their work, especially when it helps keep our patients safe.”\n\nThe team at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center has received the Daisy Team award for exceptional prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. Additionally, the spacious birthing suites at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center feature a labor, delivery, recovery and postpartum (LDRP) model that keeps mother and child together from admission to discharge. The larger rooms also accommodate larger family support networks.\n\nTo learn more about Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center childbirth services or to find a physician, visit tennovanorthknoxville.com/maternity-care-services or call 865-859-8000.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center offers a free e-newsletter with a monthly dose of health and wellness inspiration sent directly to your inbox from a trusted medical source.

(June 20, 2022) – A team of University of Tennessee Health Science Center researchers has been awarded $2.19 million from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for their investigation of the neurotoxic effects of toluene, a common chemical found in many household products.\n\nAlex M. Dopico, MD, Van Vleet Chair of Excellence and professor in the Department of Pharmacology, Addiction Science, and Toxicology (PHAST) in the UTHSC College of Medicine, and Anna N. Bukiya, PhD, professor in the same department, are principal investigators on the award. Jeff Steketee, PhD, also professor in the PHAST Department and chair of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, is a co-investigator.\n\nToluene reaches the brain through inhalation. Intoxication with toluene, whether accidental or following recreational use (e.g., “glue sniffing”), leads to dizziness, blurred vision and even neurological deficits with catastrophic outcomes, including death. A reduction in blood flow to the brain is thought to contribute to these toxic effects, but how and why toluene exposure affects the brain circulation is not known.\n\nThe team hypothesizes that toluene reduces the activity of a protein (the BK channel) located in the cerebral artery muscle cells, causing the brain arteries to constrict upon exposure. Performing tests at the molecular level using computational methods, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of BK channel function in animal models, the team aims to identify the specific mechanism and site of action in BK channels that makes cerebral arteries constrict in the presence of toluene. Their tests will include delivering new selective drug therapies for early intervention in toluene-induced brain ischemia.\n\nThe project, titled “Ionic mechanisms of toluene cerebrovascular actions,” is being funded over five years.\n\nAs Tennessee’s only public, statewide, academic health system, the mission of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center is to bring the benefits of the health sciences to the achievement and maintenance of human health through education, research, clinical care, and public service, with a focus on the citizens of Tennessee and the region. The main campus in Memphis includes six colleges: Dentistry, Graduate Health Sciences, Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy. UTHSC also educates and trains medicine, pharmacy, and/or health professions students, as well as medical residents and fellows, at major sites in Knoxville, Chattanooga and Nashville.

This show and Women Artists: Highlights from the Hunter Museum of American Art (one floor up) document what two important Tennessee cultural organizations are doing to support and empower women artists.\n\nLike the Hunter, the KMA has actively sought to acquire outstanding works by women, who have long lagged behind their male counterparts when it comes to museum-level recognition. The selection on view reflects the broad technical and aesthetic range found in contemporary art by women. A mixed media painting on wooden sections by Alison Moritsugu conveys a monumental landscape, expansive yet incomplete. Nancy Rubins elevates graphite drawing into a large sculptural construction apparently shaped by violent forces. British artist Marilène Oliver constructs provocative portraits of her family in the form of acrylic sheets imprinted with digital medical scans. Patty Chang uses water and mirrors to transform her own image taken in a Belgian church into a complex photographic work fragmented by harsh angles and provocative reflections. In her video Joan of Arc, Alex McQuilkin responds to Maria Falconetti’s memorable lead role in the legendary 1928 French silent film by Carl Dreyer, and to the film’s themes of adolescent desire, faith, and suffering. These and other selected works call overdue attention to women’s significant role in reshaping the contemporary art landscape.\n\nThe artists featured in this exhibition are Patty Chang, Janet Fish, Marcia Goldenstein, Michelle Grabner, EJ Hauser, Julie Heffernan, Jean Hess, Kate Katomski, Karen LaMonte, Pam Longobardi, Lauren Luloff, Alex McQuilkin, Alison Mortisugu, Althea Murphy-Price, Marilène Oliver, Amy Pleasant, Sumi Putman, Nancy Rubins, Tommie Rush, Denise Stewart-Sanabria, Jemima Stehli, and Toots Zynsky.\n\nOle Red Gatlinburg to celebrate Fourth of July with midnight parade patio party\n\nGatlinburg, Tenn. – Ole Red Gatlinburg will offer one of the best ways to celebrate Fourth of July this year when they host their Midnight Parade Patio Party during the annual Gatlinburg parade.

We partner with them because their mission of taking care of families is part of who we are as well.”\n\nTo take advantage of Sevier County Days, Sevier County residents must present a state- or federally-issued photo identification with a valid Sevier County zip code at any designated Dollywood (June 13-19) or Dollywood’s Splash Country (now- June 12) ticket booth.

Ever notice those historical markers along Volunteer Landing?

Jack Neely, historian of the Knoxville History Project, did the research for those markers back in the 1990s, and will help tell the stories, including that of Vagabondia, the long-vanished riverfront home of author Frances Hodgson Burnett that inspired the title of one of her early novels. It was surprisingly near the ramshackle houseboat home of Cornelius Suttree, the stoic protagonist of a very different novel by Cormac McCarthy.

As one of the most sought-after youth sports complexes in the country, Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge will be able to host teams from around the country on 10 total fields, including access to the newly renovated fields at Pigeon Forge’s Wear Farm City Park.\n\nThe park’s four fields will be completely upgraded and reimagined prior to the start of the 2023 season. Similar to the original six fields at Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge which opened in 2016, each field at Wear Farm City Park will become a youth replica of famous Major League Baseball parks of the past and present.\n\nResidents of Pigeon Forge will benefit from the renovations as Wear Farm City Park will continue to host tournaments throughout the year on state-of-the-art artificial turf that closely replicates real grass.\n\n“Every year, our teams and their families take home countless fond memories of the Pigeon Forge area when they participate in The Ripken Experience™,” said Cal Ripken, Jr., who co-founded Ripken Baseball with his brother Bill Ripken. “The views are unbelievable and the feeling you have when you experience our complex is special. The demand to play here is through the roof. This is an exciting opportunity to expand and welcome even more baseball families to Pigeon Forge.”\n\nWear Farm City Park’s four fields will be transformed into youth replicas of the following big league stadiums: St. Louis’ Busch Stadium, Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Stadium, Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium, and Cincinnati’s Riverfront Stadium. The $3 million renovation project will begin this summer.\n\n“Pigeon Forge’s partnership with Ripken Baseball is a successful one, as demonstrated by the annual increase in demand for the ball fields and the direct impact on our city’s tourism industry due to the many families who visit,” said Pigeon Forge City Manager Earlene Teaster. “The upgrades to Wear Farm City Park are a win-win for The Ripken Experience™ and our Pigeon Forge residents as these fields bring vast improvements for everyone to enjoy.”\n\nPigeon Forge residents and local youth teams will enjoy the renovations immediately following completion. The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge’s access to Wear Farm City Park applies primarily to daytime hours during the summer season, allowing the four baseball fields to remain available for Pigeon Forge residents during evenings, weekends, and most Fridays. The addition of artificial turf provides longer days during the winter months (November through early March), earlier year-round start times, and quicker turnaround during the event of rain. Wear Farm City Park is open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The park, which also has soccer and youth football facilities, will continue to host youth baseball leagues.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts more than 1,000 teams annually from over 30 states, traveling from as far away as California, Alaska, and overseas. Players’ families, many of whom are first-time visitors to Pigeon Forge, have a significant impact on the Pigeon Forge economy. A 2018 economic impact study attributed $33.8 million in visitor spending to The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge during the facility’s nine-month season that year.\n\nThe appeal of Pigeon Forge as a family vacation destination was a major reason the city built the $22.5 million complex and contracted with Ripken Baseball to operate it. During seven seasons of operations, the facility has solidified Pigeon Forge as a major sports tourism destination. In addition, research indicates that 99 percent of those who visit the facility reside outside of Sevier County.\n\nTournament participants, coaches, and their families contribute to the local economy through overnight lodging stays ticket purchases to area attractions, restaurant dining, and other purchases.\n\nPigeon Forge is located in Sevier County just six miles from the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nSince opening its doors in March 2016, more than 5,000 youth baseball teams and 250 high school softball teams have taken to the six fields at The Ripken Experience Pigeon Forge. In total, more than 75,000 players and coaches have traveled to play ball on fields that offer unobstructed views of the Great Smoky Mountains, with an additional 1,000 teams expected to travel to the complex for competition in 2022.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge is located on a ridge above Pigeon Forge. Each field borrows its design inspiration from current and former ballparks highlighting the professional player progression from the Minor to Major Leagues, including Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore.\n\nThe others are Calfee Park in Pulaski, Va., the oldest park in the Appalachian League; Fluor Field in Greenville, S.C., known as “Little Fenway”; Engel Stadium in Chattanooga, Tenn., a filming location for the “42” movie about Jackie Robinson; BB&T Ballpark in Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Isotopes Park in Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts tournaments nine months out of the year and offers year-round branded events in its 14,000-square-foot clubhouse. Tournaments are free to spectators, and parking is free at the complex.\n\nVisitor information about Pigeon Forge is available online at MyPigeonForge.com and toll-free at 800-251-9100.

Hammered silver bangles and crystal and silver necklace by Silpada; Lord & Taylor broad brim hat with off-white chiffon bow.\n\nTHIRD OUTFIT – White tennis tank by Head, scalloped skirt by Fila. Nike tennis shoes in orange, her favorite color. Racquet by Head. Pearl bracelet worn as ponytail holder. White Guess sunglasses with rhinestone accents.\n\nWHERE SHE SHOPS: “My sister and I make regular trips to Banana Republic. I love dresses and have found my favorite dresses from Bloomingdale’s in King of Prussia. Many times I head to Home Goods for props but I end up in the dress department at Marshall's. I love second-hand stores such as Clothes Mentor in West Chester and the Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition Savvy Resale shop on Concord Pike in North Wilmington.”\n\nFASHION ICON: Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge. “I love her classy, old school style.”\n\nFAVORITE DESIGNERS: Runway designer Elie Saab, “the dresses are gorgeous. For regular fashion, it’s Vince Camuto. His pieces are sexy but appropriate.” She also admires classics Lauren by Ralph Lauren, Marc Jacobs and Valentino.\n\nMOST RECENT PURCHASE: A royal blue chiffon tank from a downtown Rehoboth boutique.\n\nOLDEST ITEM IN HER CLOSET: A collection of John Wanamaker hats from the 1930s and 1940s handed down from her aunt and grandmother.\n\nMANE, MANICURE AND MAKEUP: “I religiously get my hair done by Stacy Mayo at Fringe Salon in Newark.

Even though Kate Middleton has brought back pantyhose I don’t wear them in summer unless it’s a formal occasion or a business meeting.”\n\nPANTS OR SKIRTS? Skirts, absolutely.\n\nHEELS OR FLATS? Both. “Flats for work, heels for fun.”\n\nDIAMONDS OR PEARLS? Pearls, always. “Wins out in tennis matches too. When my opponent spins the racquet, and they have a P or D, I always pick P for pearls.”\n\nWHY FASHION IS IMPORTANT: “I have always loved clothes, shoes and fashion. I think it would be fun to be an expert on the different eras and hunt for costumes for stage shows and movies. When I was little I was constantly making paper dolls. The highlight of my life was getting the JCPenney and Sears catalogs so I could make more paper dolls. I started college as a fashion major. When I traveled before I had kids, I always let myself splurge on a special outfit for each place I visited. When I am dressed great, I feel great. If I wake up in the morning and feel yucky, I put my ‘best dressed’ forward to change my attitude.”\n\nStyle Files runs weekly in Sundaylife.

André Leon Talley was indeed an influential fashion giant.\n\nWhile fashion week descended on New York City, memories of the former Vogue creative director, who died Jan. 18, 2022, stood as the tentpole: his impact as an intrepid fashion journalist, advocate and curator with an oversized wealth of knowledge looms large.\n\nAt a live auction Wednesday, individual pieces went for tens of thousands of dollars, according to Christie's auction house. \"True to form, the estate auction of André Leon Talley was as grand as he. Far exceeding the pre-sale estimates, Christie's raised over $3.5 million,\" a post on Talley's Instagram account shared.\n\nBefore the items were disbursed, the physical remnants of his memory were on display throughout the week in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nTalley's memory was accented further on a national stage during the Super Bowl halftime show as Rihanna, who was close to Talley, wore a comforter-sized red puffer coat from Alaïa, to seemingly pay homage to Talley's Norma Kamali coat of the same hue.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe legend's career met at the intersection of fashion, art and Black history, beginning his journey curating The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute before working for Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine. Later, he held editorial titles at fashion fixtures including WWD, Ebony Magazine, W Magazine and later as the first and only Black creative director and later editor at large.\n\nNotches in his timeline of legendary cultural contributions are evident in the well-worn and loved items collected from his home in White Plains, New York.\n\nAn inside look at some of the nearly 400 pieces Christie's collected reveals the beauty he carefully surrounded himself with in a life punctuated with both glamour and heartache.\n\nSale of Talley's items will benefit his first fashion influence: the church\n\nThough Talley witnessed fashion wonders of the world, including YSL runways in Paris and the inner workings of designer Karl Lagerfeld's home, his center of fashion was the Black church he attended with his grandmother as a child in North Carolina.\n\n\"We marched off into church and I discovered fashion,\" Talley said during an episode of PBS' \"Finding your Roots\" that aired in April. \"Everyone in the church was a queen.\"\n\nTalley entered the most exclusive rooms of fashion, but his collections along the way will benefit his beginnings. Auction proceeds will be split among his two centers of faith: His Harlem church home, Abyssinian Baptist, the first African American Baptist church in New York, and his church home where he grew up: Mt. Sinai Missionary Baptist Church in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n\"He loved his church, I think he took all the people that he loved at one point,\" close friend and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg told Christie's in a video for the in-person exhibit, highlighting Talley's talent and their lasting friendship.\n\nTalley's collection includes caftans, furniture, Louis Vuitton trunks\n\nThe luxurious items in Talley's collection – which were split among Christie's, The Savannah College of Art and Design and his estate – included several hand-painted Louis Vuitton trunks, an Hermès bike, and numerous iconic caftans designed by fashion luminaries Tom Ford, Ralph Rucci, Dapper Dan and von Furstenberg. Quotes from the wordsmith and striking photos peppered the Christie's exhibit, on display in the days before the auction and open to the public to peruse.\n\nAmong Talley's possessions were items he'd collected from his travels to several corners of the world, including caftans from designer Patience Torlowei, who visited the exhibit to pay tribute and whom he met in Nigeria when he visited for the first time with Naomi Campbell during Arise Fashion Week.\n\nThere was no fashion house that went uncollected among Talley's items, which included coats with gilded buttons made by Gianni Versace before his death in 1997, pieces from Chanel, Gucci, couture Dior, Balenciaga and Prada.\n\nAmong the luxury was also the most commonplace, including a pair of NAACP T-shirts he wore to the Met Gala with Whoopi Goldberg in 2010 under a Ralph Rucci cape. The simpler clothing items were made more fabulous with bedazzling and customization (his name beaded on the shoulder with black rhinestones) and L.L. Bean bags inscribed with \"Talley\" and \"Vogue.\" The pair of custom shirts sold for $1,386 and the pair of canvas bags have a current bid of $2,000.\n\nThe exhibit prominently displayed his large collection of Louis Vuitton trunks and bags, including one he carried in the first \"Sex and the City\" movie. A quote over one of the many clusters reads, \"I simply NEED a Louis Vuitton oversized trunk to travel with!\" Auction organizers noted they found receipts and scarves within pockets and bags as they curated his belongings.\n\nPieces from his New York home were grouped together in a salon of sorts, reflecting how his eye for design extended to interiors and replicating exactly how the creations lived within his space.\n\nMultiple extra large Hermès Birkin bags, plate sets from Keith Haring, Interview magazine boxes and Manolo Blahnik shoes showed Talley's flair and sartorial sentimentality.\n\n'A generous and loving friend to me': Naomi Campbell, Anna Wintour, more mourn André Leon Talley\n\nTalley's relationships were reflected in art, photos he collected\n\nAmong the physical artifacts of fashion came the visual in the collection obtained by Christie's. Talley's possessions included several artworks and photographs, from modern art greats like former boss and friend Andy Warhol and close friends and mentors, including Diana Vreeland and Lagerfeld.\n\nA significant collection of sketches and Lagerfeld-era Chanel, including a Chanel tennis racket still encased in plastic, showcased Talley and Lagerfeld's yearslong complicated friendship.\n\nAnother complex relationship in Talley's life, with Vogue eEditor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, was on display with a singular photo of her, the only image of the fashion boss that sales curators found in his home. The portrait of Wintour, taken by Annie Leibovitz in 2015, sold for $25,200.\n\nYet Vreeland, former Vogue editor-in-chief and consultant at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, was prominently featured.

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nThe highly-anticipated Nordstrom Anniversary Sale 2020 is finally here. The annual sale is without a doubt the best time to score fantastic prices on top fashion brands, beauty products, and home decor. Despite the fact that COVID-19 has changed many things this year, the quality (and quantity) of the retailer's big sale has remained the same.\n\nEvery summer, I look forward to Nordstrom's massive annual sale because many things I know I will end up buying anyway are available for a discounted price. For two weeks (or longer if you’re a cardmember), new arrivals from popular brands are marked down for a limited time before going back up to their full price. That being said, it’s not just a sale. It’s pretty much fashion’s Black Friday.\n\nThe sale is open to the public on Wednesday, August 19th, and ends on Sunday, August 30th, but cardholders began gaining early access on Tuesday, August 4th. For cardholders, your shopper status determines when you can start shopping. There are four different statuses, depending on how much money you spend per year at the retailer, and the higher your status, the earlier you get to shop. Here are all of the start dates for this year's sale.\n\nIcons: Tuesday, August 4th\n\nAmbassadors: Friday, August 7th\n\nInfluencers: Monday, August 10th\n\nInsiders: Thursday, August 13th\n\nPublic: Wednesday, August 19th\n\nNeed a break?

Nordstrom Moonlight Pajamas\n\nWhen quarantine began, I realized I did not own pajamas, for if I did, it would be easier to differentiate my 'day clothes' from my 'night clothes.' I always wore leggings at night pre-pandemic, but once I started wearing leggings during the day, I decided I needed pajamas. This is when I caved and purchased Nordstrom's popular Moonlight Pajamas, which have thousands of rave reviews. I purchased the short version and fell in love. They are comfortable, stylish, and perfect for lounging, and I've been waiting for them to be on sale to order the nightshirt and pants versions, which was the right move because now they have a cropped pants version for short people like me!\n\n2. Cardigans\n\nCardigans are a must-have item for every season. They're great for summer, winter, wearing summer clothes in winter, and wearing winter clothes in summer. They are honestly the most important and underrated closet essential. The Barefoot Dreams CozyChic cardigan with thousands of perfect reviews is on sale this year (you can get it in a leopard version now, too!), as well as\n\n3. Zella Leggings\n\nNordstrom's fitness brand Zella carries leggings, and they one of the most popular items you can buy at the store. As an owner of many pairs, I can attest to them being great quality. They don’t tear or get itchy, and compared to brands like Lululemon, Athleta, and ALO, they are a fantastic price. With 4.5 stars from over 6,000 people, there’s no questioning how good these things are. I buy new pairs of Zella leggings whenever they are on sale, and this year will be no different, especially since I am always in leggings now.\n\n4. BP. Jogger Pants & Top (Get both as a matching set!)\n\nBehold: A cozy matching set that comes in multiple patterns! Matching sets have been all over social media, and will most likely continue to thrive there, especially as we head into another round of pandemic fall/winter. Nordstrom's juniors brand, BP., makes quality clothing, and at just under $25 for the pants and top, you're getting a steal. You can also get shorts to match instead. Act fast, though. Matching sets have been a hot ticket item this year, selling out just about everywhere.\n\n5. Spanx Faux Leather Leggings\n\nI wear my Spanx Faux Leather Leggings all the time during fall and winter. They are great to wear with sweaters while running errands, and also great to pair with a top for nights out. With just about 3,000 rave reviews on Nordstrom’s website, I am not alone in my thoughts. We've even covered them at Reviewed because a number of our writers and editors also swear by them. Because they are Spanx, they are flattering by nature, but they are also extremely stylish, and they come in petite and plus size. Every time I wear them, I get compliments. These might be the best thing Nordstrom sells, but that’s just my opinion.\n\n6. Jeans\n\nThe Nordstrom Anniversary Sale is the best time to buy new jeans—which we can always use. You'll affordable Levi's for an even better price as well as high-end brands you've been eyeing like Paige and AG finally at a reasonable price. I'm always on the hunt for Madewell jeans (they're literally the only jeans our Director of Shopping content wears), and you can find several pairs on sale right now. It's a miracle.\n\n7. Wacoal Bras\n\nPeople are obsessed with Wacoal bras. With hundreds—some with thousands—of reviews, you really can't go wrong purchasing one of these, unless you buy the wrong size of course, but that's on you. I swear by Wacoal's strapless bra. I own a few of them and they are literally all I wear during summer when I am forced by society to wear a bra. With over 940 positive reviews, the How Perfect No-Wire Contour bra is also great and perfect for days when you have to wear a bra, but would rather not.\n\n8. Natori Bras\n\nBras are awful. We all know this. But what is one thing that has made my bra-wearing experience slightly better? These Natori bras. The over 3,000 4.5-star reviews do not lie. They are so comfortable, even though they do have underwire. Sure, wearing a bra still sucks, but at least there are some brands out there that make it suck less. Thank you, Natori.\n\n9. Hanky Panky Underwear\n\nIf you're looking for underwear that is high quality, stylish, and doesn't feel like it's actually there, look no further than Hanky Panky. I've tried buying cheap and more affordable underwear, but they always rip. Hanky Panky underwear, though? It doesn't rip. It doesn't become gross over time. Not to mention, it is glorious to wear. For years, I wouldn't buy these because of the price tag, but now, I always buy them—but only when they're on sale. The regular rise thongs are my favorite, but depending on your underwear preference, there are options galore. Okay, now that you all know what underwear I wear, let's move on.\n\n10. Spanx Underwear\n\nIf you haven't dabbled in Spanx underwear yet, I encourage you to do so while it's on sale. I own these and think they are great for when you want a little extra coverage, but you also want to be able to breathe and not feel constrained (one day I wore heavy-duty Spanx for twelve hours and felt like I was wearing a giant elastic around my stomach; these are about one hundred times more comfortable). Nearly 580 reviewers agree with me that they are a great purchase, so I am not alone on Spanx fan island. I am on this island with a lot of other people, too. Come join us.\n\nGet the Spanx Undie-tectable Lace Hi-Hipster Panties for $15.90 (Originally $24)\n\n11. Caslon V-Neck T-Shirt\n\nShort-sleeve tops are essential for all seasons. Wear them in winter with a cardigan and wear them in summer with shorts. This Caslon v-neck t-shirt is amazing. I own them in multiple colors and styles, and continue to stock up when they are on sale. Others agree that they are a great buy, as they have over 2,100 solid reviews.\n\nGet the Caslon Rounded V-Neck T-Shirt for $12.90 (Originally $25)\n\n12. Socks\n\nWhether you're looking for no-show socks or cozy socks, you might not be able to find ones you owned (the dryer probably ate them, it's fine), but you can find great deals on all types of new socks during Nordstrom's annual sale. Zella's no-show socks are the only sock of such kind that do not fall off my heels as I walk (or pedal on a stationary bike). With over 4 stars from over 340 reviews, I cannot be the only one who appreciates these socks.\n\n13. Nike Running Shorts\n\nRunning shorts are essential for outdoor and indoor workouts during summer, as well as lounging and leisurely walking around on warm days. With 4.5 stars from over 150 reviews, Nike's Tempo Dri-FIT Running Shorts are an excellent, breathable option. You can also get bike shorts—one of this summer's biggest trends—from Nike on sale during the big event. While I don't own Nike bike shorts, I did invest in another brand's bike shorts this summer and they have been absolute game-changes for indoor cycling and avoiding chafing while on long walks.\n\n14. Sports Bras\n\nWhether your preferred exercise is running, yoga, or kickboxing, you need a good sports bra.

Plus, they go great with Zella leggings (see No. 2). For more support, check out the Yogi Convertible Sports Bra from Natori. It has hidden underwire, making it ideal for those of us who have bigger busts, and more than 300 Nordstrom shoppers also love them.\n\n15. Matching Sports Bra and Leggings Set\n\nMatching sets aren't just limited to sweats. Workouts feel a little more cohesive when wearing a set and Zella's Studio set in simple and stylish—not to mention affordable. As we've said before, we're obsessed with Zella's inexpensive, yet quality athletic clothes, so it's a no brainer. You can get the set in black and pink silver—all for just over $60, which is one of the cheapest workout sets we've ever seen.\n\n16. Patagonia and The North Face Coats\n\nEven though it's scorching outside, it's time to start thinking about getting a winter coat. Why? Because they're on major sale!

Not only are celebrities constantly spotted them, but one of our editors (a yoga instructor!!) is obsessed with them. They're buttery soft, come in stylish colors and styles, and are built-it for withstanding even your sweatiest workouts. The only qualm is their $100-plus price tag, but thankfully you can score them for reasonable prices with this sale. The Alo Airlift Leggings that our editor swears by are included in the sale as well as the cool High Waist Moto Leggings, which have earned a 4.2-star rating from over 200 reviews. Snag them while you can!\n\nOther great deals:\n\nBest Women's Shoes Deals\n\n20. Boots and Booties\n\nThe Nordstrom Anniversary Sale is the absolute best time to purchase boots for fall and winter. New, designer shoes enter the market at unbeatable prices before going back up to their regular cost. I use this as a time to build my collection of quality boots that span seasons. Chelsea boots for casual everyday use, heeled booties for nights out and fancy days, white booties—which were sold out last year, but are back for this year's anniversary sale, Blondo booties for quality, waterproof goodness, the list goes on. These are our picks for the top boots on sale for the 2020 Nordstrom sale.\n\nChelsea Boots\n\nHeeled Booties\n\nWhite Boots\n\nBasic Booties\n\nKnee High Boots\n\n21.

Veja Sneakers\n\nVejas sneakers are one of Meghan Markle's favorites (she's been spotted in the V-10s all the time). Now may be the time to buy them. The sleek sneakers—which are rarely ever on sale—have a cult following thanks to their minimalist design and comfortable fit and the fact that they're made with sustainable materials.\n\n24. Uggs\n\nWhen I think of cozy footwear my mind always drifts to Uggs. From the slippers to warm, fuzzy boots, you really can't go wrong with these lounging shoes. Every year, my mom buys a new pair that she'll wear daily to keep her feet toasty from the cold A/C. We'll definitely be grabbing a pair of the Cozette Genuine Shearling Slide, but there are some fleece-lined boots to check out as well.\n\n25. Madewell Shoes\n\nI'm obsessed with Madewell shoes. They're minimalist, high-quality, and relatively affordable. You can find its classic mule shoe (which has over 100 reviews and a 4.2-star rating) for less than $50 right now. That's a steal.\n\nGet the Madewell Remi Mule for $49.90 (Originally $88)\n\n26. Hunter Boots\n\nHunter rain boots have garnered popularity for their minimalistic riding style and have been seen on the likes of celebrities such as Kate Moss and Alexa Chung. Plus, they actually live up to the hype. When we put these rain boots to the test, we found that they didn't let any water sneak through, were easy to wipe clean, and are comfortable to walk in. You can score several of Hunter boots on sale, and I highly recommend snatching them up before the rainy season.\n\n27. Supergas\n\nKate Middleton has been sporting her Superga Cotu sneaks for years (since 2016, to be exact). You'll find slip-on versions of the popular crisp, white shoes on sale at Nordstrom. And the Duchess isn't the only celebrity obsessed with the crisp white sneaks, which are made of breathable 100% cotton. Other stars who have been spotted with the Supergas include Jessica Alba, Jennifer Anniston, Emma Roberts, Alexa Chung, and Emma Watson (just to name a few).\n\n28. Hiking Boots\n\nWho said hiking boots were limited to just hiking? These sleek ones from Timberland and Blondo are edgy and function. They're designed with a tough sole for walking around town, and make for an Instagramable nature walk. Plus, they're both waterproof, which is essential for upcoming cold, raining weather.\n\n29. Timberland Chukka Boots\n\nThese shorter Timberland's are a must-have for fall. They're a trendier version of the iconic hiking boots that have garnered more than 600 reviews and 4.6-star rating.

I own a Tory Burch clutch and get compliments on it every time I take it to an event.\n\n33. Madewell Transport Tote\n\nThe Madewell Transport Tote has long been on our list of our favorite things to buy at Nordstrom. Not only is Meghan Markle a fan of it, but our Shopping Director, Samantha Matt, owns it as well and loves that it’s the perfect size for everything from commuting to traveling. While the plain brown version isn’t part of the sale, you can get the leather tote in a pretty embroidered style or in the slightly smaller spotted style.\n\n34. Kendra Scott Jewelry\n\nKendra Scott jewelry is one of those things that will never go out of style.

Nike Long Sleeve Shirt\n\nWorking out in a long sleeve shirt might sound like a recipe for disaster (so much sweat!) but not if you’re wearing this one from Nike. It’s made with the moisture-wicking Dri-Fit fabric that Nike is famous for and fans like that it keeps them dry yet warm when they’re exercising in cooler weather. They also say it’s great for just lounging around the house, too.\n\nGet the Nike Legend 2.0 Long Sleeve Dri-FIT Training T-Shirt for $22.50 (Originally $30)\n\n40. Performance T-Shirts\n\nRegular T-shirts are great but performance T-shirts are even better, especially if you’re running, lifting weights, or doing anything even remotely physical. From activewear brands like Rhone and Zella, these tees are designed not only to fit loosely (but not too loosely) but they’re also made with breathable materials that wick away sweat and keep you cool and comfortable.\n\n41. Jeans\n\nEvery man needs a good pair of jeans in his wardrobe. If you’ve been searching for the right ones, you’re in luck—there’s plenty available during Nordstrom’s sale.

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today’s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nI’ve been feeling especially grateful lately to Anthropologie. Normally, my feelings toward this bohemian store of my dreams are a mixture of envy and despair, because I can’t afford to shop there yet I’m desperate to emulate their free-spirited aesthetic. I’m not sure if they’ve been reading my articles or not (hey, anything’s possible), but lately Anthro has been blessing me with multiple amazing sales on chic summer styles, quirky home decor, gorgeous furniture, and everything in between.\n\nToday is no different, as right now Anthropologie is offering up to 70% off a variety of clothes, shoes, and home items for their Summer Tag Sale, which runs from now until June 18th at midnight. This means that instead of sadly exiting out of my browser window after I’ve shopped the entire site and filled up my cart, I actually get to buy things—hip hip, hooray! I’ve perused the sale already and picked out some of the cutest items that are sure to upgrade your summer wardrobe or add an eccentric touch to your home, so what are you waiting for? Let’s shop!\n\n1. Fireside throw\n\nI know it's already summer, but I still love to watch movies while cozied up with a fuzzy blanket on the couch. With more than 100 5-star reviews, this blanket is clearly adored for its comfort and softness. It sold out over the holidays when it first arrived at Anthropologie, but they've restocked since—and you can get it for almost half off. You'll love having this faux fur blanket draped on your couch for the next movie night, or for when the AC is just a little too cold this season. The blanket is available in white, light grey, mint, and blush, and will immediately make any room look more expensive.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nGet the Fireside Faux Fur Throw Blanket for $69.95 (Save $28.05)\n\n2. Jane Ribbed Top\n\nRecently I’ve started transitioning my shopping habits to include more basics. Though splurging on statement pieces can be quite a thrill, it’s smart to invest in more versatile things that you will get a ton of use out of. We love this ribbed, cotton top because of the flirty keyholes in the shoulders, so it’s not totally basic, but can still be paired with a variety of bottoms. The color selection is on point, too.\n\nGet the Jane Ribbed Top for $19.95 (Save $40.05)\n\n3. Waisted Cupro Dress\n\nWe all need a comfy dress that we can throw on during the summer, and this one is perfect. It’s waisted with ties on the side, giving it style, and its fabric is soft and cotton-like, meaning it’s comfortable too. Like the above dresses, this one also comes in a petite size. It's already discounted and you'll get an extra 40% off during this sale.\n\nGet the Waisted Cupro Dress for $49.95 (Save $48.05)\n\n4.

Brianne Cowl Neck Dress\n\nRecently I’ve been realizing that literally all the dresses I own are just a tad too short. Perhaps it’s just that I’ve gotten older and my style has become more refined, but I’ve decided that going forward, I only want to invest in dresses that are appropriate for the office, such as the breezy knee-length dress by brand Maeve. The cinched waist and fit-and-flare silhouette makes for a flattering fit on virtually any body type, and I especially love the orange color as a breezy summer staple.\n\nGet the Brianne Cowl Neck Dress for $59.95 (Save $60.05)\n\n6. Levi's Wedgie Icon Ultra High-Rise Straight Jeans\n\nEveryone should own a classic pair of Levi jeans in my opinion. Their hip-hugging, tapered shape will honestly never go out of style, and makes them super easy to pair with both sneakers and booties. I actually have quite a few pairs of 501’s in my wardrobe, and my favorite part about them is that they get better with age and conform to your body more snugly after each wash. I don’t know how they do it; it’s like magic. Levi’s usually cost $98 at most retailers, so this sale price of $60 is actually a crazy good deal.\n\nGet the Levi's Wedgie Icon Ultra High-Rise Straight Jeans for $59.95 (Save $38.05)\n\n7. Kiana Mosley Monogram Trinket Dish\n\nDo you ever wonder wear all your lost bobby pins go? It’s a common problem for most ladies, but having a good place to throw earrings, clips, and other easily misplaced items can easily solve it. This trinket dish will look cute on your dresser, but will also make a thoughtful, personalized (and cheap!) gift if you have any friend’s birthdays coming up.\n\nGet the Kiana Mosley Monogram Trinket Dish for $9.95 (Save $4.05)\n\n8. Miramar Top\n\nThis top gives a light, trendy spin on a classic silky shirt, and right now it's an extra 40% off its sale price. A white top like this is a style staple one can wear all the time, dressing it up or down. The shirt also comes in a fun leopard print light pink color and a color called ‘guacamole’ that is literally the color of guacamole. White is our recommendation if you don’t have a classic white top in your closet though.\n\nGet the Miramar Top for $29.95 (Save $48)\n\n9. Colorblocked Hair Clip\n\nFun hair clips are my favorite way to distract from a bad hair day or when I’m in-between washes. I can never have enough of them honestly, because I also use them for things like putting my hair up in the shower, or separating my hair into sections when I’m straightening it. This colorblocked clip will hold all your hair if you want to twist it up, or look gorgeous for a half up, half down hairstyle.\n\nGet the Colorblocked Hair Clip for $5.95 (Save $4.05)\n\n10. Lincoln Center Dress\n\nThis classic dress is simple yet chic, and it's not only already on sale but you'll get an extra 40% off when you add it to your cart. Just by looking at it, you can tell it would be perfect for both work, showers, weddings, and other events. Sure, it’s plain, but that’s what accessories are for, unless plain is what you’re going for, of course. The dress comes is only available in rose, but we still think its a winner.\n\nGet the Lincoln Center Dress for $49.95 (Save $118.05)\n\n11. Anthropologie Tracy Slingback Shooties\n\nIf your favorite heels and the comfiest pair of booties you own had a shoe-baby, it’d probably come out looking a bit like these Tracy Slingback Shooties, which are an extra 40% off. Available in rose, black, or grey, these shoes have a wear-anywhere style to them, so they’re just as good for the office as they are for date night. While reviewers say they run a bit large, they don’t feel heavy to wear, which is rare with platforms this thick.\n\nGet the Anthropologie Tracy Slingback Shooties for $49.95 (Save $80.05)\n\n12. Portland Collar Kimono\n\nThere’s just something about a kimono that immediately elevates your look. Cozy and functional—yet so on-trend right now—this fringed kimono can really tie your ensemble together. While it’s definitely warm enough that you could wear it in place of a coat or bulky sweater, it’s still funky enough that you can have a little fun with your outfit, especially during the colder (read: boring) months of the year. It will even work in the spring and summer months, honestly.\n\nGet the Portland Collar Kimono for $89.95 (Save $48.05)\n\n13. Rosemary Midi Dress\n\nMidi dresses have been trendy for a couple years now, especially this feminine, button down style with a circle-cut skirt that is very reminiscent of 1950s women fashion. I love the vibrant blue and pink versions for a pop of color that’s perfect for a workday, a date, or even a special occasion if you choose to dress it up with a pair of heels and some fun earrings. With an almost perfect 4.8-star rating, reviewers love the dress for its well-made design and high-quality fabric.\n\nGet the Rosemary Midi Dress for $89.95 (Save $80.05)\n\n14. Handy Sponge Caddy\n\nWhere do sponges go when you’re done with them? If you’re my disgusting self, they usually just go right back on the counter where they were to start. But that’s how germs get spread, obviously, so it’s time to change all that. This ceramic sponge caddy is cheap AF right now and it’s cute, since it’s shaped just like a little house. It’s fitting, since the caddy is designed to give sponges and Brillo pads a home of their own, too.\n\nGet the Handy Sponge Caddy for $7.95 (Save $4.05)\n\n15. Leopard Tee\n\nI love this leopard tee as a simple take on the animal print trend that’s all the rage this season. The grey color makes it less bold than the usual brown and black leopard color scheme, so it’ll be easier to pair with various denim bottoms, no matter the shade. Reviewers did remark that the cut was slightly short, so if you’d like a longer fit make sure to size up.\n\nGet the T.La Leopard Tee for $29.95 (Save $28.05)\n\n16. Oceanside Cropped Wide-Leg Pants\n\nMy roommate just got these trendy pants and I’m absolutely obsessed with them. They’re made of light linen and feel as billowy as a maxi skirt but they’re pants. Seriously, I could picture myself living in these this summer and I’m not against the idea. Now that they’re on sale, I might just get a pair for myself instead of trying to steal hers.\n\nGet the Oceanside Cropped Wide-Leg Pants for $59.95 (Save $60.05)\n\n17. Seafolly Deep-V One-Piece Swimsuit\n\nSwimsuit shopping is kind of the worst, especially for those of us who have curves. There’s no one perfect swimsuit for every body type, but this one-piece swimsuit from Seafolly comes really close. Sporty yet ultra-femme too, it’ll hug your curves but is designed to really flatter them, too. The cups are lined for extra coverage and support, and while this suit is definitely on the simpler side, it makes an incredible statement.\n\nGet the Seafolly Deep-V One-Piece Swimsuit for $69.95 (Save $58.05)\n\n18. Rosario Vase\n\nHandcrafted from seagrass and other natural materials, this exquisite vase can bring some much-needed texture to your living room, bedroom, or outdoor patio area. Right now, you can grab it on sale in cream, blue, or pink, and it comes in a variety of sizes, including tall and teardrop shaped. These vases definitely pop, so if you’re looking for a piece of decor that’ll immediately draw the eye, these are it.\n\nGet the Rosario Vase for $24.95–$34.95 (Save $33.05-$43.05)\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Friends and family agree, along with dozens of other people who gave it 4 and 5 star ratings online. But it’s not just the smell that makes them great. They are chic and stylish and do wonders for home decor. I own a bunch of large and mini sized versions of this candle. When they’re done, I keep the jar as decor.

They’re soft, come in a ton of cute colors, and will keep your ponytail in place and looking fresh all summer long.\n\nGet the Slip Silk Small Scrunchie Set from Anthropologie for $31.20 (Save $8)\n\n3. Faithfull Gemma Jumpsuit\n\nSummer is not complete without an airy jumpsuit—in our opinion. This one from the super trendy Faithfull brand has a fun tropical pattern that will bring on the compliments, and it's already in my cart. You can dress it down with cool pair of sneakers or rock it at night with wedges and hoops. Seriously, you can't go wrong.\n\nGet the Faithfull Gemma Jumpsuit for $143.20 (Save $35.80)\n\n4. Matisse Slides\n\nThese slides are a wardrobe staple that will become your go-to sandal to pair with summery dresses, skirts, and shorts.

Designer jeans\n\nJeans are important to own, yes, but not just any jeans. The right jeans. Some people don’t like spending a lot of money on jeans, and to those people, I say okay, but have you ever owned long-lasting, ultra comfortable designer jeans? As an unofficial ambassador for Madewell jeans, I do think mid-tier priced jeans are nice to have. BUT as someone who has also owned a fair share of AG and Paige jeans, I do understand the benefits of sporting these pricier designer pants. The stretch, material, and style goes a long way—and their comfort does last a long time. When you can get trendy designer jeans on sale, it is always a steal.

Rosemary Midi Dress\n\nThis feminine, button-down midi dress style is everywhere right now. Perfect for summer days, this delicate style is easy to wear no matter where you’re going. It comes in a light coral color and a unique indigo color that probably does not come close to matching anything already in your closet. The best part? If you’re short, like me, you can grab it in a petite size—no alterations necessary. That makes the price that much more worth it, not to mention… it’s $34 off right now.\n\nGet the Rosemary Midi Dress for $136 (Save $34)\n\n8. Cement Plant Stand\n\nThis might be the planter that stops me from killing all my plants. This cement planter is elevated and brings your greenery to the forefront of the space without any aggressively patterned pottery or massive containers.

It also has a real West Elm vibe to it, but at a fraction of the cost—even more so with this sale.\n\nGet the Cement Plant Stand for $78.40-$118.40 (Save $19.60-$29.60)\n\n9. Waisted Cupro Dress\n\nI am in need of a comfy dress I can wear all the time, so when I saw this dress, I immediately lit up. It’s waisted with ties on the side, giving it style, and its fabric is soft and cotton-like, meaning it’s comfortable too. Like the above dresses, this one also comes in a petite size. It's already discounted and you'll get an extra 25% off during this sale. Am I buying this? Yes. Would I buy it even if it wasn’t on sale? Yes. Here’s to hoping it fits.\n\nGet the Waisted Cupro Dress for $37.46 (Save $12.50)\n\n10. Miramar Top\n\nThis top gives a light, trendy spin on a classic silky shirt, and right now it's an extra 25% off its sale price. A white top like this is a style staple one can wear all the time, dressing it up or down. The shirt also comes in a fun leopard print light pink color and a color called ‘guacamole’ that is literally the color of guacamole. This shirt doesn’t cost extra though. In fact, it’s part of the sale! White is still my recommendation if you don’t have a classic white top in your closet though.\n\nGet the Miramar Top for $37.46 (Save $12.50)\n\n11. Removable wallpaper\n\nOne of the hottest design trends right now is removable wallpaper. It's perfect for sprucing up a space or for rentals where you aren't allowed to paint. Just simply cover up that boring beige paint and you can remove it before you move out without causing any damage. Anthropologie has some incredible designs that I am obsessed with. Even just adding some wallpaper (like the palm pattern pictured above) to one wall will completely change the the room. And because it's removable, you can switch it out in a few months for endless design options.\n\nGet the Pacifico Palm Wallpaper for $46.40-$119 (Save $11.60-$29.80)\n\nGet the Blithe Wallpaper for $134.40 (Save $33.60)\n\nGet the Lola Wallpaper for $118.40 (Save $29.60)\n\n12.

Just by looking at it, you can tell it would be perfect for both work, showers, weddings, and other events. Sure, it’s plain, but that’s what accessories are for, unless plain is what you’re going for, of course. The dress comes in black making this a perfect LBD, but you can also pick it up in rose or blue. I should add—this gem comes in a petite size as well, but since it's in the sale section size options are limited.\n\nGet the Lincoln Center Dress for $74.96 (Save $25)\n\n13. The Gal Meets Glam Collection\n\nI have been following fashion blogger Julia Engel for a long time, so when she announced she was launching a fashion line, my wallet became nervous. The Gal Meets Glam collection was everything I imagined it would be—modern, sophisticated, elegant, and romantic. In fact, I ended up buying one of the dresses (coincidentally the one that shared my name, Samantha) for my engagement photos. A select few of the Gal Meets Glam dresses are now available at Anthropologie as of a month or so ago, and they are part of the 20% off sale this weekend!\n\nAnd with Memorial Day just around the corner, it means we can officially wear white again, yay! We also love this dress from Engel’s Anthro collection. All her pieces are feminine and flattering, but we were especially drawn to this dreamy midi dress with a tiered skirt and puffed sleeves.

Large Stone Crescent Hoop Earrings\n\nI bought these earrings a few weeks ago and fell in love. They are by far the best jewelry I own (okay, I guess third best next to my engagement and wedding rings—shout out to my husband). They can turn any outfit, even the most boring, into a chic, head turning ensemble. Whenever I wear them, I have to field compliments left and right (that is an exaggeration, but I’m going with it anyway). You absolutely cannot go wrong with these while they’re 20% off or when they’re full price.\n\nGet the Large Stone Crescent Hoop Earrings for $35.20 (Save $8.80)\n\n15. Pilcro Classic Denim Jacket\n\nA denim jacket is a springtime staple. This one is a great medium-colored wash, will go with practically any outfit, and has a bunch of great reviews. I love my denim coats because they help dress down fancy outfits and dress up casual outfits. They are hands down my favorite thing about ‘light jacket’ weather.\n\nGet the Pilcro Classic Denim Jacket for $110.40 (Save $27.60)\n\n16. Penelope Pots\n\nNow, I'm not saying you need a llama pot, but I'm not saying you don't need a llama pot. It's earthenware, super cute, and the perfect size to hold small plants, succulents, and herbs. If you have issues keeping your plants alive (*cough, cough*), then maybe you'll have better luck with your green thumb if you know a llama or giraffe is counting on you. Or you can always put a fake plant in there. We won't judge.\n\nGet the Penelope Pot for $27.20 (Save $6.80)\n\n17. Juno Printed Dress\n\nThis dress is cute, comfortable, and stylish. You can dress it up with the right shoes and accessories, or dress it down with a jean jacket and booties. It has a bunch of 5-star reviews from women with different body types, comes in petite and regular sizes, and has four different prints and colors to choose from. For a dress you could get a ton of usage out of, the sale price is one you don’t want to miss!\n\nGet the Juno Printed Dress for $104 (Save $26)\n\n18. Superga Core Classic Sneakers\n\nWhite sneakers (or red if you want to be really bold) are another springtime essential. With them, you can dress down a chic dress—and add style to a casual outfit. These sneakers have a number of great reviews on Anthropologie and would be a great addition to your closet if they end up fitting. Why not try them out while they’re 20% off? I know I will.\n\nGet the Superga Core Classic Sneakers for $52 (Save $13)\n\n19. The Joanna Gaines collection at Anthropologie\n\nFor all the Fixer Upper fans out there, the Joanna Gaines collection at Anthropologie is a game changer. It's filled with incredible throw pillows, rugs, wallpaper, and more that will give your home a fashionable farmhouse upgrade. If you didn't already know, Joanna Gaines is a home decor icon. When I went to Magnolia Market in Waco, Texas, in hopes of seeing her (I didn't, but I got to meet her mom!), I really understood her style and this collection definitely matches it.\n\nGet the Joanna Gaines for Anthropologie Embroidered Sadie Pillow for $38.40-$54.40 (Save $$9.60-$13.60)\n\n20. Gleaming Primrose Mirror\n\nThis mirror has been featured all over Instagram—and for a good reason. It's chic, stylish, and will make your small apartment look so much bigger. I could see this big mirror opening the space of a living room or the smaller one placed on top of a desk for a makeshift vanity.

It is a family business. Audrey's is a very well-loved store. The three of us, my mom [Sonja Tilley], niece [Ashley Means] and myself, have a passion for it. When you walk in you can feel it. We're big on customer service. You can tell we love what we do. Ashley and I run the clothing and jewelry side while my mom runs the tea parlor. The store is in a stand alone, bright yellow metal building.\n\nYou have a tea parlor?\n\nThe tea room opened four years ago this August. It is a delightful respite; a place where women can come and leisurely dine in a lovely, serene place. It's like a Victorian English tea room. Mom uses fine bone china teacups and Irish linens. She hosts parties and baby showers and all kinds of women's groups. It's just a nice place to gather.\n\nWhat do you sell?\n\nIt is a mixture of high-end designer women's clothing and accessories. All the best brands are at the front of the store, but because we have about 4,000 feet to play with, we also have a shoe department, vintage clothing from '40s to '80s, evening wear, and a chapeau department with vintage and new hats. We have our contemporary, resort casual boutique and then we have our designer boutique with all the higher end brands that the ladies are looking for. We have a jewelry department where we sell estate and vintage costume and designer jewelry and handbags. It's a feast for the eyes and Aladdin's cave for the shoppers, but it's well organized so that you can find what you're looking for.\n\nWho is your typical customer?\n\nWe have everybody from the young teenagers and 20 somethings that absolutely love high-end designers and have a fascination with vintage to the other clientele who is in their 30s to 70s that are just looking for good quality at a great price. Or they might be looking for something unusual, a one-of-a-kind dress or accessory for a special event. They're very stylish Neapolitans that are well-heeled and get tired of the big stores.\n\nWhat is unique about Audrey's?\n\nIt's all in the editing. In the consignment business, the temptation is to take everything that comes in the door. But we've learned to pay attention to what our clientele wants. So we really hand select for our clients and narrow it down to current styles or vintage things and take on things that our clients are looking for in our lifestyle. So for instance, we don't take up space with sports attire or jeans or business suits. We want people to be excited by what we have because it's fashionable or high-end.\n\nWhat are your most popular items?\n\nIt depends on what time of year. They have a Downton Abbey tea party in which hundreds of women show up so we buy hats and clothing that suits that era so that we can help our clients. We can dress you head to toe in that style. We buy lots of one-of-a-kind hats for the garden parties and Kentucky Derby parties. We sell a lot of handbags from Chanel, Gucci and Louis Vuitton. And we feel really lucky that we have one of the better splits in consignment business. We do a 70-30 split on certain brands. We can price them more reasonably so we take a lesser commission to achieve that.\n\nDo you have a sale going on?\n\nWe have the best sale we've ever done. We've marked down racks and racks of clothes, shoes and handbags to $5 and $10. You can find Eileen Fisher and Lilly Pulitzer and just racks of it so we can make room for the new inventory. We have such good deals.\n\nWhere does the name come from?\n\nWe took over a business called Audrey's Attic. We dropped the attic and kept Audrey's. We have photographs of Audrey Hepburn because she's a style icon. We love the stylish, glamorous era that she projects. And we all answer to \"Audrey\" around here.\n\nKnow of a great local store?

Ten names will be added periodically, so be sure to check back for updates into 2025.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the first 100 names.\n\nJustice James Diament Westcott, Jr. (1839 - 1887)\n\nTallahassee born James Diament Westcott III, who preferred “Junior” rather than James the Third, had a knack for law and politics.\n\nBy the age of 28, Westcott served as the Assistant Secretary of the Florida Senate, the private secretary of Governor Madison S. Perry, and as a captain in the Confederate States Army.\n\nAfter the war he was elected as a Leon County representative to the Florida House.\n\nThe year he turned 30, he was elected attorney general. It was a remarkable feat because Westcott ran as a Democrat in the year a new Florida Constitution gave voting rights to freed slaves who registered as Republicans and the GOP won in landslides up and down the ballot.\n\nWithin a few weeks of the election Republican Gov. Harrison Reed appointed Westcott to the Florida Supreme Court, making him the youngest justice in Florida history.\n\nHe would serve for 17 years and would write 267 opinions – the most in Florida history.\n\nWestcott received his entire academic education at West Florida Seminary – which would become Florida State University, for which he was eternally grateful.\n\nUpon his death, he left his entire estate to West Florida Seminary. The principal would produce about $69,000 annually.\n\nThat was enough to provide a financial lifeline for the struggling institution – the stability needed for the school to evolve into a state-supported university. Today, a portion of the proceeds goes toward financial assistance for low-income students.\n\nWestcott died in 1887 and is buried in Tallahassee’s Old City Cemetery. In 1936, Florida State University named its administration building in his honor.\n\nGilbert Chandler (1889 - 1978)\n\nIn 1925, a Minnesota asparagus farmer was disappointed when he stopped for a night in Tallahassee – he found no place to stay, not even space to pitch a tent.\n\nThe disappointment would lead Gilbert Chandler to build a Tallahassee landmark, The Cottages of Lake Ella.\n\nChandler had $2,000 in his pocket when he ventured out of the land of lakes to seek his fortune as a “Tin Can Tourist,” the nickname for motorists touring the countryside at the dawn of the auto age.\n\nIn California, he stayed at an “auto camp,” cottages furnished with a bench, table and electric light.\n\nChandler told Susan Poplin for a Florida State University history thesis that the two-room cabins cost $750 to build and produced a 400% annual profit.\n\nChandler considered himself a Horatio Alger up-from-the-bootstrap character and after a quick look around a tiny state capital city that would soon be located at the intersection of two proposed U.S. highways (27 & 90), he decided to stay and pioneer auto camping in Florida.\n\nFirst, he paid $400 for some lots along the railroad tracks on Gaines Street. He built 10 cabins and a communal washroom and charged $1 a night to stay.\n\nTwo years later, he bought five acres north of town and built the Tallahassee Tourist Camp along a dirt road at Lake Ella. Once the road was paved and became U.S. 27, he expanded his camp with the Tallahassee Motor Hotel on the west side of the highway and the Lake Ella Motor Court on the east side.\n\nThe motor court consisted of 15 cottages. They were converted into apartments during a World War II housing shortage and rented for $30 a month.\n\nChandler used the money to upgrade the cottages with carpets, steam heat and the latest innovations. At war’s end and a tourism boom underway, Chandler promoted the Lake Ella Motor Court with hand-made billboards across the southeast.\n\nHe posted 4-by-8 feet red and yellow silkscreen painted signs advertising a motor court on the shore of Tallahassee's “beautiful Lake Ella,” every 10 miles on roads leading into and out of Birmingham, Atlanta, Daytona Beach, Tampa and the panhandle.\n\nOne night while out posting signs, “Dad called home to ask about business and Mom said they were full. People told her they’d been following the signs for hundreds of miles just to stop for the night,” Gilbert Chandler Jr., told the Tallahassee Democrat’s Andy Lindstrom in 1995 for a history of the Lake Ella cottages.\n\nAfter Gilbert Chandler passed, his heirs retired from the hospitality business. What had grown into the 92-room Tallahassee Motor Hotel on the west side of Monroe was torn down in the 1990s to make room for a Golden Corral restaurant.\n\nAcross the street, 11 of the original 15 cottages still stand, converted into specialty shops for the bustling Midtown neighborhood.\n\nTheir once white trim now is blue and grey, the multi-colored shingles replaced with brown ones, but they still sport marble facades. It is said, when a ton of marble was accidentally delivered to Tallahassee, Chandler bought it for a bargain to spruce up his cottages.\n\nChandler was a World War I veteran, Free Mason, and a Shriner who built an iconic Tallahassee destination after a disappointing first night in town.\n\nAquilina Howell (1917 - 2000)\n\nAquilina Howell was born on West Georgia Street and would go on to spend 42 years working in Leon County schools as a teacher and administrator.\n\nWhat's in a name? The historic figures and educators behind Leon County school names\n\nHowell was the first woman to serve as an Assistant Superintendent in Leon County and is credited as the driving force behind the peaceful desegregation of Tallahassee's public schools\n\n“Aquilina had unbelievable processing skills,\" said former school superintendent Charles Couch who appointed her assistant superintendent. “She could take angry people, get them to look at the issues calmly, and solve the problem in win-win fashion for everyone.”\n\nCouch, and others, recall how Howell led Leon schools during desegregation without the discord and violence that plagued other communities.\n\n“She could always make you calm down and see the other person’s point and make you think you did all the solving,” her sister Lucille Alexander told Gerald Ensley at Howell’s passing. “I used to say to her, ‘All right, Mr. Ralph Bunche.’” (Bunche was the first Black to win the Nobel Peace Prize.)\n\nHowell was married for 51 years to Tallahassee insurance agent Sam Howell, who passed in 1994. Howell died in 2000.\n\nThe Taylor House, where she was born, is now a museum celebrating Frenchtown and the Tallahassee Civil Rights movement.\n\nIn recognition of the path, she set a path for educators, civil activists, and community leaders, supporters created the Aquilina C. Howell Education Scholarship at Florida A&M University for first- and second-year students who graduated from a Leon County high school.\n\nAnd Howell’s name can still be spotted around town; including the Leon County schools administrative building on West Pensacola Street, and the Carter-Howell-Strong Park in Frenchtown.\n\nCarrie Meek (1926 - 2021)\n\nCarrie Meek, the grandchild of a slave and a sharecropper’s daughter as a child, was not allowed to enter the Florida State Capitol because she was Black.\n\nAs a 12-year-old Girl Scout, Meek was blocked at the front door when white members of her Girl Scout Troop delivered home-made brownies to Florida lawmakers. As a Lincoln High School and Florida A&M University graduate, she would be the first Black woman to represent Florida in the U.S. Congress since Reconstruction.\n\nWillie and Carrie Pittman’s daughter broke many racial, gender, and educational barriers.\n\nIn a 1992 interview with the Washington Post, she recalled in Jim Crow Tallahassee there weren’t any decent recreational facilities for Black people, and because she was Black, she couldn’t try on shoes in stores or pursue a master’s degree in her hometown.\n\nMeek earned a Master of Science at the University of Michigan after being awarded a B.S. in biology at FAMU in 1948, and after a career as a South Florida educator she would win a 1979 special election to represent Miami in the Florida House.\n\nIn 1982, she became the first Black woman elected to the Florida Senate.\n\nAs a politician, Meek was an unapologetic Democrat firebrand with an agenda rooted in the inequities she lived and witnessed.\n\nShe is remembered as an advocate for minorities, immigrants, and the working poor. And as someone who routinely intensified the debate.\n\nIn Tallahassee when Meek wanted to kill a bill, she would stand on the floor and wave a black flag of death adorned with a skull and crossbones.\n\nIn 1994, Meek provoked a massive argument with new Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. She chided Gingrich for negotiating a multi-million-dollar book deal with a publishing company that had a stake in telecommunications legislation.\n\nMeek said Gingrich stood “to make a whole lot of dust” from the deal.\n\nRepublicans struck Meek’s comments from the Congressional Record. The argument that followed dominated the coverage of the New York Times, Washington Post, and the television news networks.\n\n“The only thing missing up here is my black flag,” Meek told the Miami Herald at the time.\n\nCarrie Meek never lost an election. She retired from politics in 2002.\n\nThe Carrie Meek – James N. Eaton, Sr. Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum in Tallahassee, Florida, on the campus of Florida A&M University, is co-named in Meek's honor.\n\nHenry Livingston Rutgers (1810 - 1861)\n\nIn 1836, Henry Livingston Rutgers, direct kin of the namesake of Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey, married Jane Barnwall and the two moved to Tallahassee.\n\nFlorida Territorial Gov. William P. Duval had appointed Henry the Territorial Administrator and Treasurer.\n\nRutgers would go on to serve the territory and city for more than two decades. And although he was an early and apparently prominent settler, little is written about him.\n\nIn 1845, Rutgers cast a vote as an elector for the first Florida State Governor, William Dunn Moseley.\n\nRutgers also served two terms on the Tallahassee City Council and Circuit Court Judge Jesse J. Finely appointed him as an investigator in the renowned Croom-Smith Case of 1857 – which decided ownership of Goodwood Plantation’s 200 enslaved workers.\n\nIn 1856, the Floridian and Journal newspaper, according to the Tallahassee Heritage Foundation, reported the opening of a new state bank on Monroe Street, to which the paper added, \"We are indebted to Mr. H. L. Rutgers.\"\n\nThe Foundation suggests that druggist B. C. Lewis, who opened his own bank that year had bought the building from Rutgers.\n\nRutgers hired freedman George Proctor to build him two homes in Tallahassee – the Randall-Lewis House at 424 North Calhoun St., and the Rutgers House across Calhoun and now the Tallahassee Garden Center.\n\nIt was in a cabin on Rutgers’ Calhoun St property where Antonio Proctor, the scout and interpreter for the Simmons/Williams expedition that selected the site for Florida’s capital city, would pass in 1855.\n\nFredrich R. Cotten (1819 - 1878)\n\nFredrich R. Cotten had big plans for Florida when he came to Tallahassee in 1845. He got himself elected to the first Florida House of Representatives and then he developed a vast section of land that is today upper-middle class neighborhoods in north, northwest Tallahassee into the second largest cotton plantation in Leon County.\n\nSixty years later his grandson, Fred Cotten Elliot, would have even bigger land use plans.\n\nHe would try to drain the Everglades.\n\nBy 1850, Virginian Fredrich R. Cotten had transformed a wide swath of what is now north Tallahassee and west Leon County into a $12 million – in today's money – cotton growing operation.\n\nThat land today is a collection of upper middle class subdivisions, a country club, and Lake Jackson boat landings.\n\nCotten’s Burgesstown Plantation took in more than 8,000 acres from the Ochlocknee River and Lake Iamonia south to the Luna Pines neighborhood, east through Phipps-Overstreet Park and the eastern shore of Lake Jackson to Miller's Landing, then north to Golden Eagle Plantation, and Killearn Lakes Plantation.\n\nAccounting records indicate that shipments of cotton went regularly from Burgesstown via St. Marks to New York with proceeds credited to Cotten.\n\nThe Leon County Florida 1860 Agricultural Census shows Cotten was the single largest slaveholder in the county, with 275 enslaved workers.\n\nWhen Cotten passed in 1878, he was buried at Saint John's Episcopal Church Cemetery.\n\nCotten's heirs would sell Burgesstown to Lloyd Griscom of Philadelphia who in 1901 converted the land into a quail hunting plantation. Griscom’s son, Lloyd Carpenter Griscom, would purchase the Tallahassee Democrat in 1929 and the family would own the paper until 1965.\n\nCotten's grandson Fred Cotten Elliot became the state's chief civil engineer at the Internal Improvement Fund, now the Department of Environmental Protection. In 1913, Elliot developed a plan and directed an effort to drain the Everglades to create farmland.\n\nElliot joined a team of eight that hack through sawgrass to clear a path for barges, and he designed the first giant swamp buggies that allowed construction crews and farm workers to operate in the marshes of the Everglades.\n\nWhen he got back home after his Everglades adventure, Elliot laid out the first few holes of the Capital City Country Club golf course.\n\nThe state-owned Elliot Building, on the SE corner of Pensacola and Monroe, across from the Capitol was named for him. It is scheduled to be demolished and the site will become a Memorial Park, whose purpose is to honor Florida history and commemorate victims of slavery and the Holocaust.\n\nJayleen Woods (1934 - 2006)\n\nIn 1972, Jayleen Woods was included in a Tallahassee Democrat story about women who had “invaded” “men only” professions like public relations managers, commonly referred to as \"spokesmen\" by the media.\n\nWoods was a wordsmith. She was a writer and editor for the Florida Flambeau, Tallahassee Democrat and Tampa Tribune. Woods also worked 17 years as the Director of Information Services at Florida State University, where she served as the university’s spokesperson, and later as the editor of the Florida Hotel and Motel Association magazine for 30 years.\n\nWoods said she had “printer’s ink in her veins.”\n\nShe got a big infusion of it after a poem she wrote as a 12-year-old, about a volunteer group called The Red Feathers, appeared on the front page of her hometown newspaper in Bristol, CT.\n\nFive years later, she accepted a writing scholarship to Florida State University, where she would become a member of the Flying High Circus and edit the student newspaper the Florida Flambeau.\n\nAfter graduating from FSU, Woods took a job with the Tampa Tribune and then met Tom Woods of Tallahassee. That would lead to a move back to the Capital City and Woods breaking glass ceilings as she moved into management positions that previously were a male domain.\n\nTom and Jayleen were married for 48 years and had two daughters. He preceded her in death.\n\nIn retirement, Jayleen created fund-raising brochures for the Girl Scout Council and its Apalachee Camp for All Seasons. She also remained active with the League of Women Voters, Springtime Tallahassee, the Women’s Club of Tallahassee, and the Seminole Boosters.\n\nThomas DeSaille Tucker (1844 - 1903)\n\nA native of British Sierra Leon, Thomas DeSaille Tucker was a lawyer and missionary who became the first president of the State Normal College for Colored Students, which became Florida A&M University.\n\nHe was a graduate of Oberlin College in Ohio and taught at schools for emancipated slaves in Kentucky and Louisiana, before opening a law office in Pensacola.\n\nTucker devoted his life to combatting slavery, according to a Oberlin College biography.\n\n\"The colored men in this country have no voice in the general government; even in some of the States they have no voice in the State government,\" he wrote to a friend in Africa. \"It would fairly sicken you to be here on a fourth of July and hear guns firing and 'starspangled banner' waving 'over the land of the free and the home of the brave' while there are this day 4,000,000 of slaves in their possession. O what a hypocrisy. God will not always sleep but will yet come in judgment against this country except they speedily repent.\"\n\nIn 1887, Tucker accepted appointment as the first president of the State Normal College for Colored Students in DeFuniak Springs. With an infusion of federal money, Tucker moved the school to Tallahassee onto property once owned by Gov. Willliam Duval.\n\nWhen the State Board of Education selected Tucker to be the school’s first president, the editor of a local newspaper wrote:\n\n“We have known Professor Tucker for about 18 years and we have never met a more genial, broadminded and sterling gentleman. He possesses first-class qualities as a friend, gentleman and scholar, and commands the respect of all who know him. He is a strong man, morally and intellectually, and the new Normal has a security of success under his charge.”\n\nTucker served as president until an argument with William N. Sheats over the school’s direction. Sheats wanted Tucker to focus on agricultural and industrial education, Tucker insisted on a liberal arts education.\n\nSheats was appointed Superintendent in 1895 and slowly reduced Tucker’s authority and reduced the school’s budget and questioned spending until Tucker was finally ousted in 1901.\n\nTucker moved to Jacksonville where he practiced law until his death in 1903.\n\nThe Sims; Robert (1924 - 1966), Helen (1932 - 1966), Joy (1954 - 1966)\n\nThree members of the Sims family are the victims in a story that local lore holds as the moment Tallahassee lost its innocence.\n\nOctober 22, 1966, was a football Saturday and that night 30,000 people, more than half of the city’s population, attended the Mississippi State University vs. Florida State University football game at Doak Campbell Stadium.\n\nRobert Sims, the director of data processing for the Department of Education, Helen Sims, a former secretary for First Baptist Church, and their 12-year-old daughter Joy did not.\n\nVicious killers invaded their home in a quiet, upper middle-class neighborhood and the three were found bound, gagged and shot shortly before 11 p.m.\n\nRobert and Joy passed at the scene. Helen was rushed to the hospital and never regained consciousness to provide any clues to the killers. She died nine days later.\n\nSixteen-year-old ambulance attendant Rocky Bevis was among the first responders to the crime scene. He cut the bonds on all three victims at their ankles and wrists.\n\n\"We just woke up one morning in Tallahassee and we were part of an evil world,” he recalled to the Miami Herald for a story marking the 50th anniversary of the crime.\n\nBefore that October night, Tallahassee was a place where people did not lock their doors.\n\nBut as word of the murders spread, homes started to be kept locked at all hours, doors not opened to strangers, shades were drawn at dusk. And when no arrests were made, people bought watchdogs, hardware stores ran out of locks and safety door chains, and there was a rush at gun shops.\n\nFear spread through the city to the extent that Trick or Treat was cancelled that Halloween.\n\nA Tallahassee Democrat editorial stated, “This is no night to send young children in masks and costumes into the street.”\n\nA $16,000 reward was never collected. The murder weapons were never found. A motive never established.\n\nSheriff deputies had two suspects in their sights, and nearly 1,000 fingerprints collected at the scene but never secured enough evidence to bring any charges.\n\nThe late Leon County Sheriff Larry Campbell investigated the murders as a deputy and continued to probe the case through a 53-year law enforcement career.\n\n“I’ve done everything I think I can do,” he told the Miami Herald in 2006. “The big frustration is that I feel very confident that I know who did it.”\n\nThe case remains unsolved. Campbell passed in 2014.\n\nEd Ball (1888 - 1981)\n\nFrom the dark days of the depression and until his death in 1981, Ed Ball was one of the most powerful and feared men in Florida.\n\nBall owned a 7,500-acre farm outside of Tallahassee that today is the Southwood subdivision.\n\nThe brother-in-law of Alfred I. du Pont, Ed Ball managed du Pont’s finances and once Alfred died grew a $56-million du Pont trust into a $2-billion Florida empire, according to the Wall Street firm A.G. Becker.\n\nA du Pont grandson filed suit against Ball for spending too much money to make more money instead of on the charitable organizations the elder du Pont included as the trust’s beneficiaries.\n\nAmong the trust’s holdings were more than 1 million acres of north Florida timberland, the St. Joe Paper Company, Florida East Coast Railway, Apalachicola Northern Railroad Co., Florida National Bank, Talisman Sugar Corp, Florida Sugar Refinery Inc., and St. Joseph Telephone and Telegraph.\n\nThe news wire service UPI remembered Ball as a quick-witted man with “the courtly manners of a Southern gentleman” who loved a good scrap.\n\nHe was the father of the state sales tax, lobbying 20 years for it as a substitute for property taxes.\n\nA political kingmaker, Ball supported financially the so-called “Porkchop Gang,” a group of rural legislators who couldn’t have been elected without him. In the 1960s the group opposed legislative reapportionment because as Ball explained it would mean “the two organized minorities, the NAACP, and the (labor) unions will control the state.”\n\nWhen Florida East Coast Railway workers went on strike in 1963, Ball defied the Justice Department and a presidential emergency board and refused to budge on the wage issue which triggered the strike.\n\nThe strike continued until 1976.\n\nBall founded the St. Joe Paper Company in 1936. The company’s extensive use of water (35 million gallons daily) and clear-cutting of forests (98% of the region’s longleaf pine) led the U.S. Department of Interior in the 1970s to designate parts of North Florida a “Critically Endangered Ecosystem.”\n\nBall purchased 4,000 acres surrounding Wakulla Springs in 1937 and constructed the 27-room Wakulla Springs Lodge as a guest house. He used dynamite to open a channel to the Wakulla River so guests could arrive by boat. And he fenced off the water passage to keep out the “riff raff.”\n\nThe state acquired the land in 1986 and created Ed Ball Wakulla Springs State Park.\n\nRuth Chapman (1918 - 1983)\n\nWhen Ruth Chapman passed away it was big news; “Tallahassee activist Chapman dies at 65.”\n\nChapman studied at Northwestern University School of Journalism and worked at newspapers in Illinois and Florida before arriving in Tallahassee in 1946.\n\n“Ruth was sort of a crusader for the improvement of Tallahassee,” said former AP writer Hendrix Chandler upon Chapman’s death.\n\nRuth and Harold Chapman moved here after the war, Harold had been stationed in Pensacola and Ruth reported for the Pensacola News Journal.\n\nIn Tallahassee, Ruth was the Women’s Editor for the Tallahassee Democrat for seven years and then editor of the Department of Education Florida School Magazine for 14 years.\n\nAway from journalism, Chapman was a member of at least 12 civic groups, including being a charter member of boards for the Tallahassee Junior Museum, Leon County Public Library, and Tallahassee Junior College, along with being president of the League of Women Voters and serving two terms on the Tallahassee-Leon County planning commission.\n\nRuth was respected as a literary craftswoman. Laurence R. Campbell, who was a 1936 Northwestern classmate, wrote at the time of her passing that Chapman was, “an architect of perceptive and penetrating prose.”\n\nChapman wrote lengthy policy letters to former Gov. LeRoy Collins. Collins said he never threw away any of them.\n\n“The one thing I attach more to Ruth than anything else is her beautiful, beautiful letter writing . . . She was a professional person, and she knew English and could express herself very well,” said Collins in 1981.\n\nEventually Collins had Chapman review his speeches and letters. He said since she was so intent on telling him what she thought, he thought he would let her know what he was thinking.\n\n“She was an excellent neighbor,” Collins said.\n\nJack Crow (1939 - 2004)\n\nJack Crow completed the longest of long shots.\n\nIn a scientific competition with the renowned private Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its $23.5 billion endowment, a little-known physicist from a state school (endowment $947 million) won the world’s most powerful magnet and brought it home to Tallahassee.\n\nIt was 1990 and MIT had run the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory for three decades. But Crow and others developed a plan that included a consortium of Florida State University, the University of Florida and the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to move the lab to FSU.\n\nThe Maglab, as its called, uses up to 30 megawatts of power – roughly the amount needed to power a community of 50,000 – to create high-level magnetic fields for experiments that further the understanding of matter and living structures.\n\nSmaller labs are in Moscow; Amsterdam; Grenoble, France, and cities in Poland and Japan.\n\nAt Crow's passing, former FSU president T.K. Wetherell recalled being lobbied for millions of dollars by Crow to move the lab to Tallahassee.\n\n“He had the ability to talk molecules and the ability to talk dollars in a way that made sense to an old politician,” said Wetherell.\n\nThe lab draws thousands of scientists to Tallahassee annually to conduct experiments that help develop new technologies and materials.\n\n\"The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory truly is the house that Jack built, \" said Greg Boebinger, who replaced Crow as head of the lab director in 2002.\n\nWhile the public knew Crow as a stellar scientist, a visionary, and a persistent lobbyist, family and friends knew a man with a soft touch.\n\nThey said Crow would return from international trips with fewer clothes than when he left – having given away shirts to struggling scientists elsewhere.\n\nHis sons recalled a dad who regularly ate peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches with them, liked to fish and build sandcastles with his grandchildren, and enjoyed a good story about someone beating the odds.\n\n“He needed a towel to cry in while watching the movie ‘Rudy,’” his son Garth Crow said at his passing.\n\nJoan Heggen (1930 - 2016)\n\nJoan Heggen was a game changer with a quick wit. In 1972 she became the first woman elected to the city commission.\n\nHeggen had taught speech at Utah State University before she moved to Tallahassee when her husband accepted a position at Florida State University in 1969.\n\nShe ran a grass-roots campaign out of an abandoned gas station with volunteers going house-to-house explaining why Tallahassee had to do things differently – at the time the commission was made up of businessmen who often conducted city business from their private offices.\n\nHeggen beat Lee Everhart, who had just finished a term as mayor, 59% to 41%.\n\nIn office, the Eau Claire, Wisc., native did things differently.\n\nHeggen became the first commissioner to have an office at City Hall and her presence forced immediate changes.\n\nAt the time women were not allowed to wear pants or boots to work. But Heggen routinely wore pants suits and boots. And the city clerk was unable to dictate a commissioner's dress, so the prohibition fell for all employees.\n\nAs mayor in 1974, Heggen formed a “kitchen cabinet” of citizens to advise her, initiated the city's first applications for federal grants, and Tallahassee became nationally active in the League of Cities.\n\nHeggen would join with commissioners Russell Bevis and Johnnie Jones to replace longtime city manager Arvah Hopkins with the professionally trained Dan Kleman.\n\nTwenty years later, Bevis would tell Tallahassee Democrat columnist Gerald Ensley, “I don’t know if I ever saw a person better prepared for meetings.”\n\nHeggen read, studied, and asked questions. She credited her dogged determination to the parochial school she attended growing up in Wisconsin.\n\n\"I was taught by Benedictine nuns, so I have G.U.I.L.T. tattooed across my boobs,\" Heggen told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nHeggen did not run for reelection in 1975. She became deputy director and then secretary of the Department of Community Affairs and then the Broward County's Director of Health and Public Safety.\n\nShe returned to Tallahassee in 1987 and joined Leon County as the assistant administrator.\n\nJoan Heggen retired in 1994. Upon her retirement the Leon County Commission issued a proclamation naming Joan Heggin “mother emeritus” of the Leon County Courthouse.\n\nWally \"Famous\" Amos (1936 - 2024)\n\nTallahassee’s most famous maker of chocolate chip cookies was born on Lafayette Street in the raised Smokey Hollow neighborhood where the Department of Transportation building and Cascades Park is today.\n\nWhen he was 12 his parents divorced, and Amos was sent to live with an aunt in New York City. She loved to bake, and aunt and nephew bonded while baking her specialty; the chocolate chip cookie.\n\nAfter a stint in the Air Force, Amos took a job in the mailroom at the William Morris Agency and began to work his way up.\n\nHe became William Morris’ first African-American talent agent. He would get his foot in the door of potential clients with his home-made chocolate chip cookies.\n\nIt was an effective ploy. Amos’ clients would include Simon & Garfunkel, Marvin Gaye, Helen Reddy.\n\nGaye and Reddy thought so highly of the cookies that they urged Amos to open a store and lent him the money in 1975 to start baking out of a Sunset Blvd storefront in Los Angeles.\n\nIn its first year, Famous Amos Cookies generated $300,000 in revenue. Within six years, there were dozens of Famous Amos stores across the country, boxes of cookies on supermarket shelves and annual revenue of more than $12 million.\n\nWhile the cookies were delicious, the New York Times would report at the time of his passing, the big draw also was Mr. Amos himself.\n\n“An energetic, ever-smiling pitchman, known for his Panama hat and colorful Indian gauze shirts, he loved the hustle of building a brand, going on the road to promote it for weeks at a time. (Today both his hat and one of his shirts are held by the Smithsonian Institution.)”\n\nAmos was relentlessly optimistic and made regular appearances on sitcoms and entertainment shows such as Famous Amos.\n\nAs his fame grew, he made peace with his Tallahassee roots. His childhood memories were of a broken home in a segregated city, but when he returned as Famous Amos, he embraced the city of his birth.\n\n\"For years, I didn't have fond memories of Tallahassee - I grew up during segregation. But when I came back in 1981 to visit, and went back to my old neighborhood, I realized that a big part of who I was came from here. That community. Now I'm proud to be from Tallahassee,\" Amos told the Tallahassee Democrat in 1994.\n\nA fervent advocate for childhood literacy, Amos publicly visited the city to promote reading and other initiatives in 2006, 1995 and 1994.\n\nFinancial troubles forced Wally to sell Famous Amos cookies in 1988, at the time, he didn’t realize he had also sold his name.\n\nStripped of the company he started from scratch and forbidden to use the Famous Amos handle; he moved to Hawaii and became Uncle Noname, the baker of Gourmet Muffins.\n\nAmos also wrote an autobiography, “Man with No Name: Turns Lemons into Lemonade,” detailing how he lost the Famous Amos nickname.\n\nSheriff Phillip Decourcey (1846 - 1875)\n\nPhillip Decourcey, sometimes spelled DeCoursey, was born a slave on a plantation in Jefferson County. After the Civil War, he moved to Tallahassee, where he found work as a blacksmith, teacher and preacher.\n\nHe apparently was well liked, winning election to be the city’s tax assessor in 1873. Two years later DeCourcey was appointed Leon County Sheriff.\n\nAs the county’s leading law man, De Courscey earned praise from white and Black people, but he served only nine months.\n\nHe died in office with his death attributed to pneumonia.\n\nThe Tallahassee Sentinel newspaper wrote: “He was known as one of the most intelligent colored men in this county and during the last term of the circuit court he exhibited convincing evidence of his ability to perform the duties of the sheriff’s office in the most acceptable manner.”\n\nMrs. Helen Archer Gilliam ( * - 1967)\n\nMrs. Helen Archer Gilliam managed to keep her age out of numerous newspapers stories in which she appeared during her three decades in Tallahassee. Despite the best of our abilities, her streak remains intact.\n\nThe Camden, N. J., native arrived in the city 1941 and 21 years later was the Junior Woman’s Club nominee for Tallahassee Woman of the Year.\n\nGilliam is remembered as a humanitarian, for the work she provided to the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital Auxiliary and as a friend for those afflicted with chronic illness.\n\nGilliam organized and trained the city's first class of Candy Stripers, teen age hospital volunteers.\n\nDuring World War II, she was president of the local Chaperone Club, which organized dance nights and raised funds for social clubs for soldiers training at Dale Mabry field.\n\nGilliam was the only lay member of the district board of directors of the American Cancer Society.\n\nShe served as director of volunteers for the Easter Seal Society and ran fundraising campaigns. And she was the region's director of sales for the Christmas Seal campaign to raise money for charitable groups.\n\nAnd, Gilliam organized and was the director of the Tallahassee chapter of Beta Sigma Phil, the international sorority of working woman.\n\nFather James Page (1808 - 1883)\n\nJames Page was born into slavery in Richmond, V.A., brought to a Tallahassee plantation and grew up to become Florida's First African-American Itinerant preacher and the founder of one of Tallahassee’s most influential churches.\n\nPage was raised on the Bel Air plantation, south of town. There he met Elizabeth, a fellow slave. They married and Bel Air would be their permanent home.\n\nPlantation owner John Parkhill owned Bel Air, Page and Elizabeth. Page became Parkhill's chief assistant.\n\nParkhill was an elder in the Presbyterian Church, who provided religious instruction to Page. At the time, the Presbyterian Church did not admit Black congregants. Nonetheless, Page would plant the seeds that would become the missionary Baptist church in Florida.\n\nIn 1850, he started a ministry at Bel Air and led the enslaved community to organize the first known Baptist African-descendent congregation in Florida, and the origin of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nParkhill supported Page’s missionary. He donated land on Belaire Road for the church, raised funds among other slaveowners to build the church. He also provided Page the freedom and documents to travel throughout middle Florida to preach the gospel.\n\nWhen he died in 1859, Page was designated business manager and confidant for Parkhill’s widow.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Page became one of the most influential and respected religious leaders of the day.\n\nHe advocated for Black self-determination and independence through ownership of land and political participation. Page traveled throughout the South, converting hundreds of thousands to the Baptist faith.\n\nIn 1868, he built a school at Bel Air called the Page School Society, which was one of the first schools for African-Americans in Florida.\n\nIn 1879, Page helped African-American Bethlehem Baptist Association #1 establish a African-American Baptist school in Live Oak that was the forerunner of the present Florida Memorial College located in Miami.\n\nPage remained an active preacher into the final week of his life. The Weekly Floridian reported that he died “quietly and peacefully” at his home.\n\nPage is buried in Tallahassee’ Old City Cemetery, across Call Street from the church he founded as a ministry to enslaved workers.\n\nIn 2024, a historical marker honoring Father James Page was erected in front of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nGuyte Pierce McCord Sr. (1884 - 1970)\n\nGuyte Pierce McCord Sr. was one of the most influential city fathers at the turn of the 20th century and for some reason a park dedicated to his memory features a giant bronze sculpture of a Komodo dragon.\n\nHe wrote the city charter approved by the Florida Legislature in 1919. He also was the last mayor of the old system (1919), first mayor of the new system (1920-1922), city attorney from 1927 to 1936, and clerk of the Florida Supreme Court from 1938 to 1964.\n\nTallahassee saluted McCord in 1970 and named a park with canopy trails in his honor. It's at the southeast corner of the intersection of Thomasville and Armistead Roads.\n\nWhen a shopping center and gas station was proposed for the six-acre site in 1965, McCord led the opposition and spoke at a hotly contested zoning meeting.\n\n“You ought to put an end to this. This property ought to be bought for a city park,” he told the commission he once led.\n\n“There should not be further business along Thomasville Highway with more filling stations and sandwich stands. We are spending millions to make the Capitol Center beautiful but spending nothing for parks,” said McCord.\n\nThe Guyte P. McCord Park, features green spaces, a flowerly walking path, and a canopied walking path encircling a pond that attracts various bird species. Throughout the park are seven bronze sculptures of children and dogs at play and a giant Komodo dragon by Sandy Proctor. It is unclear why Proctor included the dragon in the McCord collection, but it is regarded today as one of the park's treasures.\n\nFrederick S. Humphries (1935 - 2021)\n\nFred Humphries was born in Apalachicola on Dec. 26, 1935, grew up in the segregated South and was inspired by a high school math teacher “to do better.”\n\nHumphries became a champion of education, especially for disadvantaged young people.\n\nHe graduated with honors from FAMU in 1957, with a degree in chemistry, then earned his master’s and doctorate degrees in physical chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. He was Pitt’s first African-American Ph.D. in chemistry. Humphries taught at Minnesota but returned to FAMU as a chemistry professor in 1968. He left to become president of Tennessee State University in 1974, overseeing that HBCU’s merger with the predominantly white UT-Nashville campus — the nation’s first successful merger of two such institutions, with TSU maintaining its administrative autonomy. Humphries became FAMU’s eighth president in 1985 and set the university on a path of unprecedented growth and national acclaim.\n\nThe Humphries’ years, 1985-2001, saw FAMU enrollment and national standing boosted by Humphries' unorthodox recruitment of scholars and donors and pursuit of academic grants.\n\nHumphries would approach young people on the streets of Europe and Africa touting the FAMU brand.\n\nHumphries was a Rattler from the moment he saw the Marching 100 perform at halftime of a game he saw as a high school student on a field trip.\n\nA student chemistry professor Fred Humphries recruited would later be a FAMU president. Larry Robinson (2017 –2024) eulogized Humphries as “a visionary, whose brilliance was on constant display.”\n\nThe number of National Achievement Scholars President Humphries enticed to enroll at FAMU recruited led the nation, outpacing Harvard, Yale, and Stanford in 1992, 95, 97 and tying Harvard in 2000.\n\nThe school’s enrollment increased from 5,100 when Humphries was hired to nearly 12,000 by the time he retired and included 657 National Achievement Scholars.\n\nThe amount of annual grant money the school secured increased during his tenure from $8 million to $62 million.\n\nAnd in 2000, with Humphries as president, the Florida Board of Regents restored the FAMU law school, closed in 1968, with a campus in Orlando.\n\nRuby Diamond (1886 - 1982) and Smiley Bruce (1919 - 2002)\n\nRuby Diamond was one of 13 members of the Florida State College’s 1905 graduating class and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry.\n\nMiss Ruby, as she preferred to be called, once deadpanned that she \"wasn't taught to do a blessed thing on earth but smile.”\n\nHowever, Diamond had a reputation as a shrewd businesswoman. And it appears her passion was to give away her wealth.\n\nRuby’s father, Julius Diamond, was a wealthy Tallahassee merchant.\n\nWhen Julius died, Ruby inherited a large fortune. She sold the family business and home and moved into the Floridian Hotel, where she assembled a collection of antique snuff bottles shipped in from all over the world.\n\nDiamond is representative of a class of wealthy, single, 19th century progressive women philanthropists. Columbia University philosopher John Dewey, a spokesman for that era of progressives and creator of the Dewey Decimal System, was a friend who visited and corresponded with Diamond.\n\nShe never married. The city became her family. Tallahasseans would often see Ruby Diamond taking drives around the city in a 1963 powder-blue Cadillac, chauffeured by Smiley Bruce, a former custodian for the state, bus driver and ice man.\n\nShe and Bruce were inseparable in his 25 years chaufering Miss Ruby. His recollection of their relationship informs E. Lynne Wright’s novel “It Happened in Florida: Remarkable Events That Shaped History.\" Others drew comparisons of Diamond and Bruce to the 1987 play “Driving Miss Daisy,” a story about another single, elderly, eccentric, Jewish woman.\n\nMiss Ruby fought for lower taxes and racial equality, helped establish Temple Israel, and founded the “Diamond Vegetable Basket,” to provide seeds and fertilizer to any Leon County resident who received welfare assistance.\n\n“At Christmastime she sent me out to get people who didn’t have any place to go and had me collect them up and carry them to different cafes,\" Bruce told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nShe always picked up the bill.\n\nRuby Diamond established scholarships at FSU for disadvantaged students and contributed to at least 37 charitable organizations. She was an active member of the Oleander Garden Circle, Tallahassee Historical Society, LeMoyne Art Foundation, and the Tallahassee Junior Museum.\n\nIn 1970 FSU named its largest auditorium in her honor, housed in the iconic Westcott Building.\n\nA year later, Diamond donated property valued at $100,000 to the university. And in 1981, she donated more property to help fund an endowed chair of national excellence in the College of Education.\n\nDiamond died in 1982, bequeathing to Smiley that blue Cadillac. The church leader at Friendship Primitive Baptist Church and foster grandparent then turned his hand to selling boiled peanuts in his retirement.\n\n\"He always liked to do something,\" said his grandaughter Regina Webster. \"He never could stay still. He liked to be around people. He loved to talk.\n\nRobert Butler (1786 - 1860)\n\nRobert Butler was an American military officer, a veteran of the Battle of New Orleans raised by Andrew Jackson after Butler’s parents died of yellow fever.\n\nWhen Spain ceded Florida to the U.S., Butler represented the U.S. at ceremonies in St. Augustine where Spanish Gov. Jose Maria Coppinger handed over possession of the city and territory and left for Cuba.\n\nIn 1824, when Tallahassee was founded and a crew of Jackson’s former officers were seemingly in charge of affairs, Butler was appointed the Survey General of Florida.\n\nHis first job was to establish the prime meridian, which serves as ground zero for all real estate transactions – the reference point for all surveys of property deeds in the state.\n\nInterim Gov. George Walton selected a spot about 200 yards south and east of the Capitol. Walton drove a cedar stake in the ground, next to the ampitheater at today's Cascades Park, and Butler would approve and certify all land surveys in the state until 1848 using the stake as the prime meridian.\n\nButler was a Jackson man. He organized Tallahassee’s first fraternal organization, the Masonic Jackson Lodge.\n\nHe married Jackson's daughter Rachel Hays, and gave Lake Jackson its name. Butler and Hays had a 900-acre plantation that extended from its shore and included the mounds built by Native Americans.\n\nNearby he built a holding pond to power a mill.\n\nWaist high tombstones for Robert and Rachel are located off Crowder Road near Lake Jackson Mounds State Park. They are off of the right fork of the park’s Butler Mill Trail, where a keen eye can spot remnants of the mill project.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown (1785 - 1867)\n\nThomas Brown the pioneer – not Tom Brown, the namesake of Tallahassee’s premier city park – was among a group of War of 1812 veterans who later settled in Tallahassee once it was named the Florida capital.\n\nBefore he moved to town, Brown, as the chief clerk of the Richmond, Va., post office, invented the post office letter box.\n\nIn 1828 Tallahassee, Brown built a hotel on Adams Street, between Pensacola and Lafayette streets, south of the present-day state Capitol campus. Originally called Brown’s Inn, the hotel underwent many name changes, including being called City Hotel for a couple of years.\n\nThe hotel provided the connections that enabled Brown to remain politically active. He served as president of the legislative council in 1838, was a member of the constitutional convention in 1839, and served in the first session of the Florida House of Representatives in 1845.\n\nIn 1849, Brown became the only Whig Party member elected Florida governor. He promoted agriculture and worked to improve the transportation and education systems.\n\nIntrigued by the rich soil in the Lake Okeechobee watershed, he explored whether to drain the Everglades to create more farmland. The initiative resulted in Fort Myers emerging as a bustling village.\n\nHe persuaded the legislature to endorse building a plank toll road from Jacksonville to Lake City. Under his tenure, a steamship line was initiated on the St. Johns River. And in 1853, the East Florida Seminary opened in Ocala. Closed by the Civil War, the school reopened in 1866 in Gainesville and would become the University of Florida.\n\nAt the end of his term as governor, Brown retired from public life. A Mason for more than 60 years, he served as the long-term secretary for the Tallahassee lodge and compiled a book on Masonry.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown is buried at the Old City Cemetery in Tallahassee.\n\nRev. Herbert Clarke Alexander (1929 - 1994)\n\nHerbert C. Alexander was a transitional figure who straddled two eras; between those who tried to work through Jim Crow and those who fought it.\n\nAlexander was a high school dropout from Palatka who joined the U.S. Army and then earned a degree in religion from Florida A&M University in 1957.\n\nHe would teach five years at Bond Elementary, and then at the old Lincoln High before leaving Tallahassee for the University of Tennessee where he would earn a Ph.D.\n\nAlexander would return to Tallahassee as FAMU’s Vice President of Student Affairs in 1969.\n\nIt was a turbulent time with the anti-war and Civil Rights movements flourishing and universities and the city struggling to meet student’s demands.\n\n“Herbert was never at the forefront of activism. But he was a man of impeccable character, who certainly always espoused the goals of the Civil Rights movement,” said the late Charles Smith, FAMU’s then Dean of Graduate Studies at Alexander’s passing.\n\nSmith participated in many of the marches and demonstrations students organized.\n\nAlexander was also a preacher, who ministered at Baptist churches in Valdosta, Quitman, and Tallahassee, where he followed his mentor, the Rev. C.K. Steele as pastor of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church..\n\nYet although Steele was a driving force in the 1956 Bus Boycott, Alexander’s conciliatory nature in the VP role did not always mesh well with the demands of 1970s-era students.\n\nHe said he grew weary in the job and stepped down in 1972.\n\n“I have great faith in young people. I see in them the energy, enthusiasm, that I feel I am losing,” Alexander told the Associated Press.\n\n“If the powers that be will not be unduly restrictive on them, they will find solutions to almost all kinds of problems we struggle with,” said Alexander.\n\nAlexander remained on the FAMU campus as the director of the business ethics program. In that role, his relentless positive voice about the nature of man became a magnet for students. They would line up outside his office to talk and seek advice.\n\n“He didn’t have the talent to turn them away,” said then Dean Sybil Mobley.\n\nAlexander was a recipient of the FAMU Distinguished Alumni Award in Religion and the Martin L. King Jr. Leadership Award.\n\nRob Roy Ashmore (1916 - 2010)\n\nRob Roy Ashmore held court for more than 60 years in a store that evolved into Ashmore Antique’s. Once a drug store, the place became a junktique emporium/pecan shop on West Brevard Street in Frenchtown, across from the Old Lincoln High and just down the street from the Governor’s Mansion.\n\nThe eclectic store with an eccentric owner became a landmark for generations of college students and politicians.\n\nWhen he passed, longtime social services lobbyist Jack Levine wrote of Ashmore, “no one knew more Florida governors more personally than Rob Roy.”\n\nThe reason governors made their way to his store, Ashmore told Levine was, “because I’m famous. I can’t say the same for some of them.”\n\nAshmore Antiques came to be after World War II when Rob Roy took over his cousin’s store.\n\nHe stocked it with funky junk, retro furniture, and abstract odds and ends, and bought pecans from teens and the homeless to sell.\n\nCollege students flocked to the store where the proprietor seemed more interested in spinning tall and small tales than he was in selling anything.\n\nCandidates would ask to put their posters in his window and after the election instead of trashing them, Ashmore used them to paper the store’s walls.\n\nThe place became an improv political museum, decorated with more than 200 posters and framed photographs of a who’s who of politicians from former President Harry Truman to former Mayor John Marks.\n\nAfter the store’s popularity attracted England’s Duke of Windsor in 1952, it became a campaign stop for candidates. In 1968 presidential candidates Hubert Humphrey, Shirley Chisholm and George Wallace visited and snacked on pecans with Rob Roy.\n\nAshmore once spent an afternoon drinking Coca-Cola and munching on fresh-shelled pecans with Gov. Claude Kirk. Kirk persuaded Ashmore to help move his daughter out of an FSU dorm room. A laborer Ashmore brought along asked why he kept calling the other man \"governor.\" The worker did not recognize Kirk, which delighted Ashmore.\n\nAshmore's tales also included cruising around town with Gov. LeRoy Collins in the governor’s limousine and supplying Gov. Lawton Chiles with tobacco snuff for hunting.\n\n“I’m not supposed to tell you because he took on big tobaccy – but he liked to pinch it when he was out shooting birds,” Ashmore said.\n\nA Sopchoppy native, Ashmore credited a lesson he learned working for at an uncle’s Jackson County drug store for his store becoming a Tallahassee landmark.\n\n“I learned quick that being nice back was good for business,” Ashmore said.\n\nAshmore closed his store in 2008. The city has purchased the building with the intent of turning it into a local cultural center and African American museum.\n\nThomas Irwin Brown Jr. (1914 - 1973)\n\nThomas Irwin Brown, no relation to the Floirda Gov. Brown, was a coach, athletic director and longtime county commissioner.\n\nA Pulaski County Georgia native, Brown played football at Clemson. In 1944, he was hired to coach the Leon High School football team. Brown also operated a laundry business, service station and built an apartment complex near Florida State University.\n\nGov. LeRoy Collins appointed Brown to the Leon County Board of County Commissioners in 1958 following the death of Commissioner William Kelley.\n\nHe would serve 14 years, being reelected three times.\n\nAs a politician, Brown followed a conservative philosophy that supported consolidation of city and county governments, expansion of Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, construction of the truck route that became Capital Circle, a county library, and an addition to the courthouse.\n\nHe served as the Commission’s chair 1963-1964, 1967-1968, and 1972.\n\nBrown also served as president of the Tallahassee Kiwanis Club and director of the Tallahassee Booster and Quarterback clubs. He coached a Babe Ruth League baseball team for 20 years.\n\nIn 1977, the City of Tallahassee dedicated a 255-acre recreation park in Tom Brown’s memory. As a fitting memory for a coach, Tom Brown Park features several softball and baseball fields, racquet and tennis courts, a disc golf course, a 3.1-mile-long bike and nature trails, and a fenced area for dogs to frolic.\n\nBrown died in 1973, and is buried at Roselawn Cemetery.\n\nEdward Bradford (1798 - 1871)\n\nEdward and brothers Thomas, William, Henry, and Richard arrived in Tallahassee from Enfield, North Carolina, in 1829. Direct descendants of William Bradford, governor of the Plymouth Colony, and English statesman Oliver Cromwell, the brothers would establish five plantations along what is now Thomasville Road in north Leon County.\n\nTallahassee’s northeast suburbs were once the site of a Bradford agricultural enterprise powered by the labor of enslaved individuals at Edgewood, Horseshoe, Pine Hill, Walnut Hill, and Water Oak plantations.\n\nRecords of transactions with New York cotton brokers between 1840 and 1866 indicate it was a prosperous business worth millions in today's money.\n\nThe Leon County 1860 Agricultural Census found 130 slaves worked Pine Hills and assessed the plantation’s value at $949,510 when adjusted for inflation.\n\nAccording to the Census, the brothers held 585 people as enslaved workers.\n\nA book titled \"Slavery and Plantation Growth in Antebellum Florida, 1821–1860\" noted that the Bradfords held a large barbecue for its enslaved workers on July 4th and that Christmas week was a time of no work except for tending livestock. Bradford's wife would commission gifts for the \"black folks\" including shawls, brightly colored printed dresses and bandannas, new hats and Sunday shoes, according to the author. It was a different scene at the nearby Chemonie plantation where there was no celebration.\n\nEdward's nephew Capt. Richard H. Bradford was the first soldier killed in Florida in the Civil War.\n\nEdward also owned the Horseshoe Plantation east of Lake Iamonia. When he died in 1871, Horseshoe became known as Bradfordville, which is today an unincorporated village of 19,000.\n\nDale Mabry (1891 - 1992)\n\nDale Mabry is a Florida name most people associate with a Tampa-area highway but Dale Mabry the man was a Tallahassee native, and his hometown didn’t appreciate when Tampa appropriated his name.\n\nMabry was the son of former Florida Supreme Court Justice Milton H. Mabry and Ella Dale Bramlett.\n\nOn February 21, 1922, Captain Dale Mabry lost his life at age 30 when the rudder system malfunctioned on the 410 foot long airship \"Roma\" that he was piloting over Norfolk, Va.\n\nFrom a height of 1,000 feet, the Roma with 43 people onboard, went into a dive straight to the ground.\n\nJust before the airship impacted the ground, it encountered power lines that caused the vessel to burst into flames.\n\nMabry and 34 airmen died in the accident, which at the time was the worst aviation disaster in U.S. history.\n\nWhen Mabry’s body was removed from the twisted and burnt wreckage he was still holding the wheel to steer the airship.\n\nThe US Army would never use hydrogen in any of its airships again.\n\nIn 1929, Tallahassee named its first airfield in his honor. Dale Mabry Field was dedicated on November 11, Veteran’s Day.\n\nA few years later, Tampa wanted to name its airfield after Mabry, but Tallahassee would not agree to change the name of its airfield. Tampa officials finally decided to just name a new road leading to the airfield after Mabry.\n\nMabry will one day have his Tallahassee moment again with the opening of the Dale Mabry Army Airfield Museum on the campus of Tallahassee State College.\n\nHelen Grissett (1916 - 2016)\n\nHelen Turner Grissett was a long-time educator whose love for animals made her a legendary director of what once was the Tallahassee Junior Museum, and today is the Tallahassee Museum – 52 acres of historical buildings and exhibits of animals and natural Florida.\n\nGrissett received a B.A. from Florida State College for Women in 1940 and a M.A. from the University of Florida in 1950. She taught at Caroline Brevard Elementary for two years, at Leon High for five, and Ruediger Elementary for a decade.\n\nIn 1964, she was appointed director of the fledgling Junior Museum and helped make into reality what psychology professor Howard Baker called at Grissett’s retirement in 1971, “the best idea from Tallahassee in our generation.”\n\nGrissett loved animals. Her idea of a mini zoo of petable animals became the Museum’s most popular feature.\n\nToday, the Museum is home to red wolves, black bears, white-tailed deer, red and grey fox, the Florida panther, bobcats, and cougars, along with many birds, and reptiles.\n\nGrissett was the last director to live on site, which made her view her park responsibilities as a 24-hour job.\n\nWhen a veterinarian had given up on a fox and said it would not survive, Grissett stayed up all night and nursed it. The fox lived.\n\nOne time Grissett took a baby goat, another time, a baby fawn to bed with her when they were sick to keep them warm while they recovered. And she used her bathtub as a hospital bed for alligators.\n\nThe Tallahassee Junior Museum held a Helen Grissett Day, June 13, 1971, when Grissett retired. A plaque on the Museum’s early childhood education building recognizes Grissett’s contribution to the Museum.\n\nMrs. Jessie Moon (1904 - 1982)\n\nMarion County’s Jessie Moon may be Leon County school systems' most successful innovator.\n\nJesse Moon earned a degree from Florida State College for Women in 1934 and taught at Kate Sullivan and Hartsfield elementary schools before being named the first principal of W.T. Moore Elementary School.\n\nThe school opened in the fall of 1968 as the county’s first truly integrated school.\n\nStudents still living in the footprint of old plantations where the families had been for generations and neighborhoods built by a nascent “Sun Belt” economic boom, were blended into one student body.\n\n“This was a relatively new concept at the time, but the school made great advances,” said DJ Wright, who joined the faculty in 1974.\n\nMoon wanted her teachers to know their students and each summer loaded them on a bus and drove through the areas where students lived – providing a visual display of a diverse student population.\n\nAnd she wanted students to understand each other. They would participate in daily discussions of their similarities and differences; even learning how each other's hair felt to the touch.\n\nMoon pioneered the open classroom concept for Leon County. The idea employed team teaching techniques. Classrooms consisted of seven large learning centers and two rooms for specialized instruction.\n\nAnd Moon also developed a hearing-impaired program that initially served seven counties. Students were bused from 50 miles away.\n\n“She was ahead of her times,” said Roberta Trowbridge, a student teacher for the program, who would spend all but one year of her career at Moore.\n\n“Mrs. Moon would come visit in our classroom and interact with the children regularly. She had such compassion for these kids,” said Trowbridge.\n\nAway from school, Mrs. Moon was a gardener who made bouquets of flowers for teachers, students, and parents.\n\nToday they are remembered as floral displays of the warm, inviting, positive school culture Moon created at Moore.\n\n“You felt it when you went through the doors. She knew she was creating an institution of learning for children, and it has lived on as a testament to her,” said Wright, who served as Moore’s principal 1994 - 2003.\n\nIn 1980, an addition previously identified as the Hearing Impairment Program’s Center M, was dedicated in honor of Mrs. Jessie Moon.\n\nRichard A. Shine (1810 -1862)\n\nTwenty-year old Richard A. Shine arrived in Tallahassee in 1830 and left a mark on the capital city that remains visible today. They include some notable tourist attractions .\n\nShine was a builder and supervised construction of the 1845 state Capitol, known today as the Historic Old Capitol. Other projects include the First Presbyterian Church, the Bloxham House at 410 Calhoun St., the Chittenden House at 323 Park Ave, and the main house of Goodwood Museum and Gardens.\n\nAccording to Census information from 1840, Shine was listed as the owner of 30 slaves. Historian Andrew Frank said Shine was known to have used slaves on his projects in Tallahassee and also hired them out as skilled laborers.\n\nThe bricks for the construction projects were made at a 50-acre brickyard located between Mahan Drive and Miccosukee Road that Shine owned. Remnants of the kilns were visible as late as 1934, according to the Tallahassee Historical Society Annual.\n\nBut he was also an engineer who made the deep cut along Mahan and under Magnolia Drive to lay the tracks that brought the Pensacola-Georgia Railroad to east Tallahassee in 1857. That cut, dug by enslaved people, is still in use today.\n\nA Quartermaster General of the Confederate army and Florida Militia, died in 1862, at the height of the Civil War. No written account of his death has been found. The Shine family tomb is in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nSeeking clues: Help solve mystery of two portraits found at Goodwood Museum\n\nMarion Franklin Tinsley (1927 - 1995)\n\nMarion F. Tinsley was so good at checkers that he ran out of human opponents. The Florida A&M and Florida State math professor spent the last five years of his life beating increasingly more powerful computers.\n\nTinsley earned a doctorate at The Ohio State University in 1957 and then taught math at FAMU for 26 years and 10 years at FSU. He also served as a part-time minister at Tallahassee Christian Church.\n\nTinsley won the world checkers championship in 1954 and today is recognized as the greatest checker player ever.\n\nHe was world champion from 1954 – 1958, and again from 1975 – 1991. He also claimed four consecutive Florida Open championships, 1974, 75, 76, 77.\n\nHe claimed he was a mediocre checkers player until at age 14 when he stumbled on a book of checkers while researching a math problem at the library.\n\n“Checkers can get quite a hold on you. Its beauty is just overwhelming, the mathematics, the elegance, the precision. It’s capable of wrapping you all up,” said Tinsley, according to a New York Times obituary.\n\nTwo of the seven games Tinsley lost during a 50-year run were to a Chinook computer program. It had a repertory of 250 billion moves and could make 3 million calculations a minute. It beat Tinsley once when he was intoxicated, and again during an exhibition when Tinsley competed in two matches at once.\n\nBefore cancer forced Tinsley to retire from competition, he fought the computer to six straight draws.\n\n“Tinsley was the Mount Everest we wanted to scale,” said program developer Jonathan Schaeffer after Tinsley withdrew from the 1994 world championship competition.\n\nBurt Norton (1943 - 1995)\n\nIt was 1966, about the time the Beatles released the landmark Revolver album, when Burt Norton drove into Tallahassee. He arrived in a Ford station wagon loaded with a 1960 Fender Jazzmaster, a Fender Pro Amp, a stand alone Fender reverb tank, and a few clothes.\n\nThirty years later when Tallahassee music community gathered for a memorial concert in his honor, the Tallahassee Democrat wrote, “no doubt there would have been a music scene in Tallahassee without Burt Norton. But just as certainly it would have been entirely different.”\n\nBurt Norton was the man behind Norton Audio and Music on Jackson Bluff Road. Tallahassee’s first rock n roll music store. It stocked the name brands that powered the Woodstock Generation. It became known as Norton Music, “The Guitar Store;” a mecca for musicians and fans.\n\nNorton provided services for his products, never charged for guitar string installations or setups.\n\n“It was just a given, Burt was always there,” recalled John Paul Waters before the 1995 tribute concert for Norton. “He didn’t make a big deal about it. Whatever you were looking for in the music world, he was a great resource.”\n\nPeople poured into the store – students, musicians, transients – to share stories and talk music.\n\n“I always found it interesting how I could wait on a farmer early in the morning and a state supreme court justice toward closing time,” recalled Ken Norton, who worked the counter at his brother’s store.\n\nEventually Norton decided Tallahassee needed a recording studio. So, he went off to Nashville and toured the studios where Roy Orbison recorded.\n\nHe opened a 16-track recording studio at the Jackson Bluff location.\n\nFor the next 10 years, Sweet Bay studios recorded dozens of local groups. Among those who cut songs or albums at Sweet Bay were LaBamba/Flipside, Meisburg and Walters, Bill Wharton, Drew Reid, BB Jam, Dixie Drive, Rainbow Band, Tallahassee Band, McKenzie Brothers – and a teenage country singer from Quincy, Billy Dean.\n\nIn 1986, amid growing competition from other music stores, Norton closed the store and took a job with the state. He passed away in January 1995 at age 52.\n\nLaura Mae Thompson Dixie (1925 - 2017)\n\nLaura Mae Thompson hailed from the Chaires neighborhood east of town and became a key organizer in the Civil Rights Movement in Tallahassee.\n\n“The Mother of the Movement in Tallahassee,” is how Bethel Missionary Baptist Rev. R.B. Holmes eulogized Dixie.\n\nDixie was an activist. Served as vice president of the Leon County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Was a board member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and president of AFSCME Local 2847.\n\nVisiting people who were sick, taking in first-generation Florida A&M students, and feeding people were the foundations of Dixie’s approach to community organizing.\n\nDixie didn’t like speaking in front of crowds and avoided the spotlight. She was the person that others depended on when funds needed to be raised, voters needed to be registered, or when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., needed a place to stay during a Tallahassee stop.\n\nDixie was persistent. When the pace of desegregation at W.T. Edward Hospital proved to be slow, she quietly went to work.\n\n\"I had a long fingernail file and they had these signs also where, you know, they had the patients segregated,\" she recalled in a recorded interview.\n\n\"They had a white wing, black wing, white bathroom, colored bathroom, white eating dining room, colored dining room, and so I took my fingernail file and went 'round and unscrewed every one of those segregation signs off the door ... the supervisor said, 'I can't picture nobody doing that but Dixie,' but they still couldn't prove that I did it. I was acting just as innocent as I could be.\"\n\nCharles Saxon Ausley (1907 - 1972)\n\nThere were some impressive shoes Charles Saxon Ausley had to fill. Tallahassee appreciated the work of his dad, the physician Charles, so much they named Ausley Road on the west side in his honor. And his grandfather George Saxon was the founder of the Capital City Bank, the city’s oldest operating business.\n\nCharlie, who carried both men’s names, set out to be, in the words of the Tallahassee Democrat, a “good citizen.”\n\nHe left his mark on the community. In 1930, he teamed with future Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins to create the Ausley McMullen law firm, one of Tallahassee’s oldest law firms.\n\nAusley wrote the first charter of the Florida State Foundation, founded the Tallahassee Jaycees, served as president of the Chamber of Commerce, and as corporate officer of the Tallahassee Democrat and director of the Orange Bowl committee.\n\nCharlie also was a municipal judge, city commissioner, and state senator – filling in for Collins when he resigned to join the Navy during World War II.\n\nWhen he died, a Tallahassee Democrat editorial acknowledged he served as the newspaper’s legal counsel but also extolled him as a “good citizen.”\n\nWrote the editorial board, “In the 42 years since he returned to Tallahassee with his law degree from the University of Florida, there was hardly a worthwhile project or mission on which his help was not sought and given without hesitation. It is such good citizens as Charlie Ausley who have made Tallahassee the place for the good life it is.”\n\nGene Calvin Cox (1935 - 2009)\n\nGene Calvin Cox is the winningest football coach ever to walk a Tallahassee sideline.\n\nIn a 27-year run as head football coach at Leon High School, the Lions were 238 – 67 and won two state championships, 14 district championships, seven regional championships and eight conference championships.\n\nMore than 100 players would sign a college scholarship.\n\nA Lake City native, Cox played at Columbiana High, and was listed behind Lee Corso on the running back depth chart for the 1954 Florida State University team, which won the Sun Bowl.\n\nAfter coaching at high schools in Jefferson and Suwannee counties, Cox became head coach at Leon and a football legend.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions ran off 25 straight wins in 1968, 1969, and 1970. On two other occasions, Leon won sixteen straight games. And in 1984 –1985 the Lions posted a 19-game winning streak.\n\n“He was so serious about and so intense that when you came to college at FSU, that it was really easier than what we were used to at Leon – the intensity of the workout and at practice. And you knew how to win,” said former FSU quarterback Wally Woodham.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions became a feeder program for Bobby Bowden’s teams at FSU.\n\nThe 1979 11 – 0 Seminoles featured seven Lions, including two quarterbacks, Woodham and Jimmy Jordan, along with QB coach Billy Sexton. The Lion-led Noles only loss was to Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl.\n\nCox retired from Leon in 1990 but would return to the sidelines for Aucilla Christian Academy a year later. When he successfully retired as coach after the 1995 season, his 313 wins were the most ever in Florida.\n\nIn 1997, the Tallahassee Sports Commission, the Leon County School Board and the Leon County Commission renamed Capital Stadium to Gene Cox Stadium.\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam (1926 - 2006)\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam dance students started performing revues at halftime of Leon High School football games in 1947. A New York trained ballet instructor, Gilliam had a studio in the Randall-Lewis House where students from age 2-and-a-half to 16 learned tap and ballet.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, troupes of Gilliam students publicly performed in dance reviews to popular songs. Gilliam outfitted dancers in calico dresses and bonnets for a “Gal in Calico” performance, and in Spanish-theme costumes for \"The Lady in Red.”\n\nBefore Tallahassee desegregated Gilliam opened her studio to Black girls for ballet lessons.\n\nCarla Richardson joined the classes in 1964 and said she and about a half dozen other girls were not fully aware of the controversy Gilliam created by agreeing to enroll them.\n\nIt was a bold stance. Gilliam lost a lot of her white students, and ultimately her downtown studio.\n\nLooking back, Richardson said she and her classmates were unaware of the controversy Gilliam provoked by welcoming them into her studio. They were younger than 10 at the time and would learn more about race relations when the city integrated public schools.\n\n“I just think we didn’t realize at the time this woman was a civil rights activist. She was phenomenal. A single woman who risked her business to teach African American girls,” said Richardson.\n\nOne of those girls was Joyce Warner Tobias, Miss Black America 1971.\n\n“Miss Patsy contributed to her winning. Joyce used dance as her talent in the competition,” said Richardson.\n\nGilliam closed her School of Dance in the early 1970s, and worked as the superintendent at Lewis State Bank.\n\nAlexis Roberts McMillian was among the group of little girls who showed up at Gilliam’s studio in 1964.\n\n“I attribute my agility and movement – that is good for a pretty-plus senior citizen – to my ballet lessons,” said McMillian. “I stuck it out through the 11th grade as one of the last students she had until she stopped teaching. Those classes were finally desegregated ... We raise a glass of cheer to Helen Patsy Gilliam.”\n\nAlvan S. Harper (1847 - 1911)\n\nNorristown, Pennsylvania’s Alvan S. Harper studied photography in Philadelphia. A chance meeting with Tallahassee Judge J.T. Bernard at the 1876 Centennial may have led Alvan and Agnes Harper to move to Tallahassee where they set up a studio to take “artistic photographs.”\n\nHarper posed portraits with backdrops in his studio and photographed residences, buildings, farming, hunting, railway activity and political leaders.\n\nHis portfolio includes hundreds of views of late 19th century Tallahassee street scenes, and about 1,300 portraits of men, women, and children taken between 1884 and 1910.\n\nAlvan had a special interest in Tallahassee’s African American community. While Jim Crow was enforced, he portrayed Black people in a way that defied the legal restrictions they faced. The Museum of Florida selection of his photographs has been made into a traveling exhibition, and his quiet contributions to civil rights were recognized by the University of Florida, the NAACP, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n\nIn 2017, a “Trolley ride through Alvan S. Harper’s Tallahassee” was held at the Pensacola Museum of History.\n\n\"Some of Harper's best negatives were lost when his studio was torn down in the 1920s,\" according to a state archives report. \"The negatives had been given to a Tallahassee historian who, because they were dirty, left them on a porch where they were mistaken for trash and taken to the dump.\"\n\nAbout 2,000 Harper negatives were found, however, in 1946 in the attic of a house the Harpers owned. The negatives were turned over to the State Library.\n\nAlvan and his wife Agnes never had children. Both are buried in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence (1918 - 2013)\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence was the final principal for segregated Lincoln High School. Lawrence grew up on a farm near Old. St. Augustine Road and Chaires Crossroad. He and his brother would walk the seven miles to attend Lincoln High School as students.\n\nUpon graduation and service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Lawrence would teach in Live Oak and Quincy before returning to Tallahassee. In 1957, he was named principal of his alma mater and would keep his students focused on education during the turbulent 1960s. Lawrence encouraged both academic and vocational students to pursue the highest level of education. He was Lincoln’s principal until the school closed in 1967.\n\nDuring his 25 and more years as a principal at “Black” elementary, junior high and high schools, Lawrence advocated and promoted a higher level of service and financial commitment for the education of Black children.\n\nAdditionally, he assumed responsibility for his teachers, encouraging them to pursue graduate degrees and to this end, made promotions into leadership positions in the Leon County School System possible.\n\nMany attributed Lawrence’s ability to create alliances and negotiate helped make Leon County’s transition to integrated schools look effortless while integration elsewhere came under duress and sometimes violence.\n\nAfter integration, Lawrence became principal of the newly created Lincoln-Griffin High School. He later moved on to Nims Middle School, before retiring in 1978,\n\nIn 1996, he received a Florida A&M University’s Distinguished Alumni Award, and in 2012 the Tallahassee Urban League bestowed its Legend Award to Freeman D. Lawrence.\n\nHe was remembered in his obituary as \"one of God's best servants.\"\n\n\"I once bought a three-piece suit just so I could look like Mr. Lawrence,\" then Sen. Bill Montford said at his funeral. \"In education, we as a state are always looking for the answer. I would suggest to you, we had the answer at the original Lincoln.\"\n\nMargaret Leonard (1942 - 2022)\n\nJournalism and justice inspired Margaret Leonard.\n\nRaised in Macon and Atlanta by parents who were reporters, Leonard would report for the Chattanooga Times, Miami Herald, and the St. Petersburg Times before she joined the Tallahassee Democrat as a government reporter in the 1980s.\n\nBefore making Tallahassee home, Leonard made history in 1960 as a Tulane University student when she became the “first unmistakably Southern white student\" to join the Freedom Riders to register Black people to vote in Mississippi.\n\nA teenage Leonard was repeatedly arrested as the Freedom Riders registered voters. She was jailed and spent time in the notorious Parchman Prison.\n\nLeonard told an oral history project in 2001 the experience traumatized her and inspired her journalism.\n\n“I wrote a lot about prisons, power stuff,” she said. “That was the question that I was interested in my whole life: What do people do when they have power, and what do you do about it if you don’t have it?”\n\nLeonard was open and frank in discussions with friends. As an editor, her comments were pointed but softened by a lilting Georgia accent.\n\nLate in life, after suffering a brain aneurysm, Leonard carried a dictionary to help her reprogram her brain with words she needed to keep her job.\n\nLeonard had an aversion to the limelight and praise for her work. Before she died, she asked her obituary not to begin with her role as a Freedom Rider.\n\nWhen she passed her family asked in lieu of flowers for contributions to the Equal Justice Initiative.\n\n“We’ve come a long way, but we ain’t through,“ Leonard reflected in 2012, in an article recognizing her wor\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadell (1875 - 1963)\n\nThe roots of Tall Timbers, the research station & land conservancy north of Tallahassee, were nourished by a passion for quail hunting.\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadel of Staten Island, New York, first came to Leon County in 1894 with his father to shoot quail, such as the bobwhite, the number one game bird of the South.\n\nHis uncle, Edward, had purchased a 2,200-acre quail hunting plantation known as Hickory Hill that sat on the north shore of Lake Iamonia. Henry would visit every winter and when Edward passed away in 1919, he inherited the property and built a home he named Tall Timbers.\n\nBeadel then devoted much of his time to scientific wildlife research. And in 1926, he began experimenting with controlled burns to study fire's effect on wildlife and plants.\n\nSix years later, he organized the Cooperative Quail Study Association, made up of 21 owners of quail lands in the Tallahassee-Thomasville-Albany area.\n\nAnd in 1958, Beadel founded the Tall Timbers research station with a mission to study game birds, fire and plant ecology, wildlife, and land conservation among other things.\n\nWhen Gov. Farris Bryan presented Beadel with a plague in 1961 to recognize his contributions to wildlife research, the Tallahassee Democrat observed Beadel possessed an “outstanding color motion film libraries on quail and wildlife in the Southeast.”\n\nToday, the Tall Timbers research station holds 158,000 acres in conservation easements.\n\nJames Cullen Lawrence (1932 - 2024)\n\nJames Cullen “J.C.” Lawrence grew up in the Allen subdivision, a neighborhood north of Florida A&M University. The family home was on Canal Street, now part of FAMU Way, where the Anita Favors Lake and Plaza is today.\n\nCherry Lawrence, a younger sister, said the Bronough Street bridge runs right through her childhood bedroom.\n\nJC was known as “Cowboy” while growing up. He starred in basketball at FAMU High, earned a master’s degree in education at FAMU and when he returned after serving in the U.S. Army, he became a role model for the Allen neighborhood kids.\n\nIn 1959, James Cullen Lawrence was named the first Black supervisor over the City of Tallahassee playgrounds and parks. He was put in charge of two recreation centers and the Jake Gaither Golf Course as well.\n\n“It was huge for a Black man to be named manager of a golf course in Tallahassee. That kind of opportunity did not come easy for Black folks,” said Deloris Harpool, who was a teenager and neighbor at the time.\n\n“His appointment was uplifting. It made us feel like we had a chance,” said Harpool.\n\nLawrence was an all-around volunteer. He initiated the first Black Pee Wee Football League of Tallahassee, coordinated the Jake Gaither Alumni Golf Association, and served as treasurer of the Tallahassee branch of the NAACP.\n\nAt the recreational centers, Harpool and Cherry said he “molded the maturity” of a younger generation.\n\nCherry said JC played the role of “a real big brother” for many. He modeled a standard of behavior that demonstrated respect for others. And he expected his young charges to follow his lead when it came to the rules governing playgrounds, rec centers, and golf courses.\n\n“Although he knew us as kids (from Canal St.), he was pretty strict about that. At the dances we attended, skating activities, and basketball games held there, we were all well behaved. He was someone that we really did look up to and we obeyed,” said Cherry.\n\nDelores said JC received the same level of respect given the principal at school.\n\nIn 2002, the previous Dade Street Recreation Center was renamed the Lawrence-Gregory Community Center to honor James C. Lawrence, retired Recreation Superintendent and Beulah Gregory, Supervisor of the Tallahassee Dade Street facility\n\nWilliam May Walker (1905 - 1974)\n\nThe Honorable W. May Walker was a Crawfordville native who practiced law in Tallahassee and became known as the hardest working judge in Florida.\n\nWalker served as a county judge from 1932 to 1940 and then as a Circuit Court judge until his death in 1974.\n\nTallahasseans of his era remember Judge Walker for ending Miami Sen. Lee Weisenborn’s efforts to move the state capital away from Tallahassee.\n\nFor three years, Weisenborn and allies filed challenges to a bond issue to raise the money to build a new state Capitol complex downtown.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs lost an appeal to the Supreme Court in 1968, Walker issued an injunction against any further challenges, telling Weisenborn anymore lawsuits would be “for what purpose I do not know.”\n\nAnother famous case involved a 1959 sexual assault of a FAMU student by four white defendants. At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Walker denied defense counsel’s motion for acquittal and sentenced all four defendants to life at the Florida State Prison in Raiford.\n\nAt his passing, former Leon County Judge Charles McClure recalled Walker had a talent to get to the crux of a case. McClure said “it seemed as if he could always come up with the right decision. It was second nature to him, and things would very logically fall into place.”\n\nThe 2nd Judicial Circuit Historical Society records Judge Walker as one of the most distinguished jurists ever to serve the state.\n\nGeorge Langford (1923 - 2019)\n\nGeorge Langford, founder of the Municipal Code Corporation, was the 1989 Florida Entrepreneur of the Year. The visionary publisher is also remembered as the father of the Seminole Boosters.\n\nLangford was a World War II veteran and University of Virginia Law graduate. He came to Tallahassee in 1951 with an idea: Codify the regulations of cities and towns, and publish them in books that are called the city codes.\n\nHaving all a city’s ordinances at one’s fingertips in a book turned out to be a hugely successful idea. Langford’s Municipal Code Corporation became a multi-million-dollar enterprise with a 40,000-square-foot printing press near the airport.\n\nThen in the mid-1970s a financial crisis threatened the Florida State University football team. The athletic department was $600,000 in debt and school president Stanley Marshall said if money was not found cuts would be made.\n\nA call was placed to Langford for help. All people can recall is he was “recruited.” In any event, he is credited with resurrecting the Seminole Boosters, which wiped out the debt.\n\nHe would lead the Boosters for three years – a defining moment for FSU athletics that included the hiring of Bobby Bowden as the head football coach.\n\n“The decision to recruit George Langford ... was one of the most important events that has occurred in our 64-year history,” said then Seminole Boosters President Andy Miller when Langford passed.\n\nLangford held a permanent seat on the FSU Foundation Board of Trustees, chaired FSU’s first Capital Campaign, was a founder of Springtime Tallahassee, and involved in dozens of civic organizations.\n\nHe raised money for MaClay School, Tall Timbers, the Monticello Opera House, Springtime Tallahassee, The Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce, the United Way, St. John’s Episcopal Church and St. Peter’s Anglican Church.\n\nThe George and Marian Langford $1 million endowment to FSU’s Department of Classics came about after Langford asked then-president Sandy D'Alemberte which department never had received a financial gift.\n\nLangford was recognized for his unwavering commitment and dedication to FSU in 2000 when the Boosters named a grassy area outside Doak Campbell Stadium where fans and vendors gather The Langford Green.\n\nNic Gavalas (1922 - 2014)\n\nTwenty-eight-year-old Nicholas George Gavalas arrived in Tallahassee after World War II and became a founding member of several civic-minded organizations and created the iconic Florida tie.\n\nThe son of a master tailor, Gavalas and his wife Janet opened Nic’s Toggery downtown at Monroe Street and Pensacola Street.\n\nThe store catered to college students and turned into a college hangout. Nic was warm and engaging with customers. He carried the latest fashions. The store quickly joined the ranks of Esquire Magazine’s Top 100 Men’s Store in the United States.\n\n“It was a gathering spot,\" former FSU football player Ron Schomburger, told Tallahassee Democrat’s Gerald Ensley when Gavalas died.\n\n“We’d go in to look at the clothes but have a good conversation with him and his employees. It was like talking to an old friend,” said Schomburger, about Nic.\n\n“To my generation, Nic was a legend,” said ESPN broadcaster Lee Corso, a former Seminole quarterback. “He was like a father figure to me.”\n\nA founding member of Seminole Boosters, Nic designed a Sammy Seminole tie to promote Florida State University athletics.\n\nBut it was his Florida tie that features an outline of the state that became ubiquitous, especially when the Legislature was in town. Former U.S. Senator and Gov. Bob Graham claimed to have worn one for more than 20 years.\n\nNic Gavalas’ legacy continues with Nic’s Toggery, the Official Clothier of the Florida State Seminoles, and with two stores, one downtown and a second one in north Tallahassee.\n\nWilmoth H. and Kathleen Baker (1928 - 2006 and 1929 - 2007)\n\nWhen Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker opened Baker’s Pharmacy in 1958 only one other pharmacy in town would hire a Black pharmacist and there were only certain stores where Black people could shop.\n\nKathleen had a pharmacy degree from Xavier University, and she convinced her husband Wilmoth to pursue one at Florida A&M University where she taught.\n\nThe couple then decide to open a pharmacy in a duplex where Wilmoth’s father had a practice. Sort of a one-stop medical facility for a segregated community.\n\nMoney was tight. When the couple opened their store in August 1958 on South Adams Street, the shelves were stocked with only one of each item – because that was all the Bakers could afford.\n\nWilmoth and Kathleen worked 12-hours a day, seven-days a week to make the pharmacy what former FAMU interim-President Henry Lewis III would call a “beacon of light for this community.”\n\nIt was eclectic. The Bakers sold medicine and almost everything else – from sewing thread to birthday and Christmas gifts.\n\nThe counter at their soda fountain drew college students, professionals, the elderly and unemployed. There they swapped news, traded gossip, and sold tickets to social events.\n\nBaker’s Pharmacy was also the internship training ground for nearly 200 FAMU pharmacy students, including Lewis, who would go on to become a Leon County Commissioner, Dean of the College of Pharmacy and a FAMU interim president.\n\nThe pharmacy closed in 2002. Here is an excerpt from a letter to the editor Lewis sent to the Tallahassee Democrat at the time.\n\n“Baker’s Pharmacy was a safe and clean place to take your girlfriend. It was a place where health care was a fundamental right, regardless of your ability to pay. Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker were mother and father away from home for hundreds of FAMU students in their quest for a college degree. The Bakers were a shining example of how a married couple should be and how to raise a family.”\n\nPaul Dirac (1902 - 1984)\n\nPaul Dirac may be the most distinguished Tallahassean ever.\n\nThe 1975 Compton Encyclopedia Yearbook declared him an equal to Sir Isacc Newton and Albert Einstein.\n\nEinstein once said about a Dirac paper, “this balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful.”\n\nDirac won the 1933 Nobel Prize in physics for his Relativistic Wave Equation. He anticipated the string theory in 1962 with the Dirac-Born-Infeld action and the Dirac membrane.\n\nTheoretical physicist Stephen Hawking said Dirac “changed our picture of the universe.”\n\nIt was a twist of fate, and lakes, that made him a Tallahasseean.\n\nDirac held the Lucasian Chair in Mathematics at Cambridge University in England – Newton was the first to hold the chair. As Dirac was approaching the mandatory retirement age of 70, FSU offered him a visiting professorship.\n\nIt was 1969. He liked the place. Became a familiar face at seafood restaurants. Would walk to work. Was often spotted swimming at Silver Lake and Lost Lake.\n\nDirac didn’t want to retire so he said goodbye Cambridge, hello Florida. He joined the FSU faculty full time in 1971.\n\n“FSU has a good physics department,” said Dirac when asked why he was here.\n\n“Here I escape the harsh winters of the North. I like swimming in the lakes, rivers, sinkholes and the sea. There are lots of swimming opportunities around Tallahassee. To some extent that is what brought me here.”\n\nDirac received many honors, including the Royal Medal, the Copley Medal, the Max Planck Medal and the inaugural J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize. He once turned down a knighthood because he did not want to be addressed by his first name but later consented and became a member of the Order of Merit in 1973.\n\nPaul Dirac passed away in Tallahassee and was buried at Roselawn Cemetery. His papers are held at the Paul A.M. Dirac Science Library at Florida State University. The street in Innovation Park where the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is located is named Paul Dirac Drive in his honor.\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos (1907 - 1977)\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos is the mother of Vo-Tech education in Leon County.\n\nWhen she was named principal of the Lively Continuation School in 1935, the Vienna, Ga., native was one of just two female vocational school directors in the country.\n\nCsikos would travel throughout Florida to construct a bureaucratic infrastructure for vocational education and became a stalwart lobbyist for job training in the Legislature.\n\nCsikos was born in 1907 and moved to Tallahassee eight years later. She graduated from Leon High School in 1926.\n\nShe was one of two teachers hired by Lewis M. Lively in 1931, one of two for 52 students at his school who trained office skills to students not college bound. She taught shorthand and typing.\n\nEvelyn also worked as a stenographer for the Legislature. When she was named director of what would become Lively, World War II was on the horizon and she would change the focus of vocational education.\n\nNorth Florida became a hub of activity for wartime preparation. Aircraft mechanics would join shorthand and accounting in the Lively curriculum, along with the operation of new technology like mimeographing.\n\nCsikos embraced the change and wangled millions of dollars from the federal and state governments to fund vocational and technical education for students not bound for college but wanting skills to earn a living.\n\nUpon her retirement in 1973, Csikos predicted the future of vocational education would be in middle and high schools because she said many college graduates “are learning a college diploma alone won’t get them a job.”\n\nIn retirement, Csikos developed the curriculum for the Pat Thomas Law Enforcement Program.\n\nCsikos died at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital while recovering from a heart attack in 1977.\n\nRear Admiral David Betton Macomb (1827 - 1911)\n\nDavid Macomb was the youngest son of David Macomb Sr., and Mary Tiffin Worthington. Mary’s father was the governor of Ohio, and her family opposed the marriage.\n\nThe couple moved to Tallahassee in 1824. They settled along Lake Iamonia, and had five children, David B. the youngest.\n\nThe senior Macomb gained notoriety for a duel with Prince Murat, shooting off Murat’s little finger. He then moved the family to Texas. Tuberculosis claimed Mary and the senior Macomb ended his life by slashing his throat a few months later.\n\nAt age 9, David and his siblings were left orphaned, and raised by family in Ohio.\n\nWhen he was 22, David was appointed a third assistant engineer in the U.S. Navy and explored the North Pacific and the Sea of Japan. When the Civil War broke out, Macomb would be aboard one of the first Union vessels to enter the conflict, and at war’s end he was on the ship that fired the final shots.\n\nHe also distinguished himself as an inventor.\n\nMacomb was the chief engineer of the USS Niagara in April 1861 when it became the first U.S. Navy ship to form up the blockade of Charleston. Niagara would later participate in the bombardment of the Pensacola Naval Yard.\n\nHe returned to Charleston in 1865 aboard the USS Canonicus, which fired the final shot as the rebels retreated to Sullivan’s Island as the South surrendered.\n\nThe Canonicus was then sent in pursuit of a Confederate ironclad, the chase took the Canonicus to Havana where she became the first American ironclad to enter a foreign port.\n\nAmong the inventions Macomb contributed to the U.S. Navy were a hydraulic lift used aboard ironclads, and he made and installed the first fresh-water maker used on a U.S. Navy vessel.\n\nMacomb retired February 27, 1889, with the rank of commodore. He was later promoted to rear admiral.\n\nA street in the Frenchtown neighborhood, and the destroyer the USS Macomb – known as the Mighty Mac by its crew – are named in honor of Rear Admiral Macomb.\n\nDr. Kamal Abdou Yousef, aka King Love (1936 - 1999)\n\nKing Love was someone no one understood but everyone talked about. He reigned in Tallahassee for six years.\n\nKing Love was the creation of Kamal Abdou Youssef. A child prodigy pianist who played for the King of Egypt at the Cairo Opera House in 1949, Yousef graduated from medical school in 1956, moved to New York City in 1969, and then West Palm in 1977.\n\nYoussef, a pathologist, established a successful practice.\n\nPeople say Youssef changed when the first Gulf War started in 1991. He became involved with an anti-war group, was diagnosed with manic depression and then became estranged from his family.\n\nThat’s when King Love came to be, a man with a white beard, a golden crown and a red cape holding a megaphone, and waving signs at intersections around town.\n\nOne would find the King at the corner of Tennessee and Monroe streets during the morning commute and at Apalachee Parkway and Magnolia Street in the afternoon. An electronic megaphone amplified shouts of “Yip, Yip, Yip,\" as he skipped through the crosswalk with signs that promoted love, denounced God, and one adorned with photos of JFK and Princess Diana that encouraged people to “Return to Camelot.”\n\n“I think it was the Gulf War that pushed him over the edge. Before that, he was a normal, very loving person,” his son Anwar told a Tallahassee Democrat reporter who tracked down the family after Yousef’s passing.\n\n“It was like his heart was being torn out. We lost all contact with him after the Gulf War,” said Anwar. “It was all quite sudden.”\n\nKing Love arrived in Tallahassee around 1993 and endeared himself to Tallahasseeans.\n\nTallahassee Police arrested him several times on petty theft, trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. Two college students who took him in briefly said Yousef was knowledgeable, a good conversationalist, but could become agitated and erratic.\n\nYousef’s Florida arrest record dates to 1991. A FDLE report listed eight different spellings of his given name and listed his occupation simply as “King.”\n\nHe used his monthly social security checks to publish “love declarations.” They were a mix of brotherhood tinged with paranoia.\n\n“I realize that people have been cheated of real paradise on Earth,” the King told break magazine in 1995. “They have been cheated of their innocence, falsely convicted as sinners and their wages of sin is hell and everlasting fire and wailing and gnashing of teeth. For some, hell is here and now.”\n\nWhen his health began to decline and in his final year, Youseff gave up the King Love persona.\n\nHe shaved his beard, stopped wearing crowns and robes, and quit ranting about politicians. Kamal Abdu Yousef began attending Baptist Celebration Church, which invited an Egyptian priest when it held services for Yousef after he died alone in his apartment.\n\n“I wish to thank the people of Tallahassee from the depth of my heart. People here tolerated him and didn’t harm him. In other societies they would have clobbered him to death. I know it,\" said his brother Nagaui A. Michael, a retired New York City attorney, before the service.\n\n“If I could say one thing to him right now it would be I’m sorry. Because I did not believe in him. Fortunately, the people of Tallahassee did.”\n\nFred Mahan (1886 - 1960)\n\nOn the east side of town where Hillcrest Avenue meets U.S. 90 there’s a 76-year-old marker that designates the highway from Tallahassee to Monticello as Fred Mahan Drive.\n\nFred Mahan was a horticulturist from Dodge City, Kansas, who had a passion for highway beautification.\n\nHe also created the Mahan Pecan, a pecan with a bigger nut and lighter shell, at his Monticello nursery.\n\nIn the 1920s, he would own the second-largest pecan and ornamental shrubs business in the southeast.\n\nCoronet Magazine described him as a “strange philanthropist who bestows beauty instead of dollars\" while \"spreading scenic bounty across the state he loves.”\n\nAt the height of the Great Depression, Mahan donated thousands of plants to the county unemployment relief commissions for beautification projects to employ the jobless.\n\nWhen a road company got a contract to remove tree stubs and make other road improvements along U.S. 90 between Tallahassee and Monticello, he contributed thousands of crepe myrtles, camelli", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2017/02/15/nylon-anniversary/97946354/", "title": "Game Changers: nylon, the fiber that changed America", "text": "Jim Beckerman\n\nThe (Bergen County, N.J.) Record\n\nWOODLAND PARK, N.J. — Between 1.2 million B.C. — when our humanoid ancestors began losing their fur — and Feb. 16, 1937, clothes didn't change much. Fashion was pretty much at the mercy of animals and vegetables.\n\nBears gave us their skins. Worms spun threads for us. Sheep were shorn, and cotton was harvested, all so we could look good on a date.\n\nThen, in February 1937 — 80 years ago this month — U.S. Patent No. 2071250 was issued to chemist Wallace H. Carothers (assignor to E.I. DuPont) for Linear Condensation Polymer.\n\n\"Nylon\" became the name, only after 400 others had been rejected. Among them: \"Klis\" (\"silk\" spelled backwards), \"Nuron\" (\"no run\" spelled backwards), and \"Duparooh\" (an acronym for \"DuPont Pulls A Rabbit Out Of a Hat\"). In-house, the new material was known as \"66\" — a reference to the 6 carbon atoms each in the two chemical compounds that make up the fiber.\n\nIt was one of the turning points in consumer history. There had been \"artificial\" fibers before: rayon, developed as early as 1855, was a synthetic creation made from wood pulp. But nylon was the world's first totally man-made fiber. And it was a sensation.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"It hit at the right time,\" said Debra Hughes, curator of collections and exhibits at the Hagley Museum and Library in Wilmington, Del. \"Women wanted it.\"\n\n► Related:17 pop culture icons having milestone anniversaries in 2017\n\nToday, nylon is taken for granted. Stockings, shirts, dresses, toothbrush bristles, fishing lines, guitar strings, parachutes, carpeting, automotive upholstery, and camping gear are made of it. Carry-on luggage only became possible thanks to lightweight nylon fabric. All the sexy, skin-tight fabrics out now have their origins in that breakthrough moment at DuPont in 1935 when Carothers and his many associates created a synthetic substance they called polyamide-6-6.\n\n\"The excitement was the newness of it, what it could to, how it looked, how easy it was to care for, how inexpensive,\" said Diane Maglio, who teaches a course in Fashion Textiles for Apparel and Home at Berkeley College, which has campuses in New York and New Jersey.\n\n\"It was fiber you could use for everything,\" Maglio said. \"And such style! And modern! People were looking to the future. This was modernity at its best.\"\n\nFor women, it also was the answer to a prayer.\n\nHemlines, in the 1930s and 1940s, had been getting higher, exposing more leg. Silk stockings were expensive and not very durable. As women increasingly joined the workforce during the Depression and war years, their stockings ran — and they ran through stockings. \"There was definitely a need for something stronger,\" said Hughes, whose recent exhibit \"Fashion Meets Science: Introducing Nylon,\" paid tribute to the miracle fiber.\n\nRumors that DuPont had created a new, magical fabric were already buzzing when 3,000 club women gathered at the future site of the New York World's Fair at Flushing Meadows, Queens, on Oct. 27, 1938.\n\nThey were there to attend a seminar called \"We Enter the World of Tomorrow,\" an annual forum on world problems. But Hitler, the Depression, and labor unrest all took a back seat when DuPont's Charles Stine used the occasion to make a dramatic announcement. \"A brand new chemical textile fiber\" was about to come on the market, he said, made entirely of ingredients found in the mineral kingdom — coal, water and air. \"It can be fashioned into filaments as strong as steel, as fine as a spider's web,\" he told them. Women all over America knew what that meant. Stockings. \"When he said that, all the women burst into applause,\" Hughes said.\n\nThe name \"nylon\" — lower case — was never trademarked; DuPont wanted to stress that they had invented, not merely a new product, but a brand new substance, like iron or sulfur.\n\nWhen the World's Fair opened in 1939, nylon stockings were one of the prize exhibits, along with television, \"Futurama,\" and Elektro, the Mechanical Man. When nylon hose went on general sale on May 15, 1940 — priced at $1.15 per pair — most locations sold out by noon.\"They called it N day,\" Hughes said. \"Everybody had to have a pair of them.\"\n\nFour million pairs of nylon stockings were sold within two days of the product launch. In 1941, DuPont's nylon sales were up to $25 million.\n\nBut the tumult created by the introduction of nylon in 1940 was nothing compared to the withdrawal of nylon in 1941.\n\nWhen America went to war on Dec. 7, 1941, DuPont re-geared its nylon production to the military. Parachutes could no longer be made of imported Japanese silk; nylon was the obvious substitute. Nylon was needed for shoelaces, hammocks, mosquito netting, flak jackets, tow ropes. As abruptly as they arrived, nylon stockings vanished from department stores. And American women experienced collective withdrawal.\n\nThe loss of nylon paved the way for a civil insurrection.\n\n\"The Nylon Riots\" which began in September 1945 were sparked by DuPont's announcement in August — eight days after V.J. Day — that it would be returning to civilian production of nylon. The excitement this generated — and the frustration when shortages occurred — boiled over into mob unrest not seen in department stores until the Black Friday era, 60 years later. In Pittsburgh, 40,000 customers fought over 13,000 pairs. In Augusta, Ga., women knocked down shelves and displays as they pushed their way into the store. \"We have quite a few pictures, including some of the mob scenes,\" Hughes says.\n\nIn succeeding decades, nylon went on to revolutionize first women's fashion, then fashion generally. Garter belts disappeared. \"Sheer\" became a watchword. And as more synthetic fibers followed — polyester, spandex — the world entered a new era of no-iron, super-durable, easy-to-wash, super-stretchy fabrics in riotous colors that could be seen everywhere.\n\nAnd where was Wallace H. Carothers, inventor of nylon, as his product was transforming America?\n\nHis story, unlike nylon's, is a sad one. Only two months after nylon received its patent, the inventor — subject to depression from childhood — committed suicide in a Philadelphia hotel room. An expert chemist to the end, he mixed potassium cyanide with lemon juice, so that the citric acid would catalyze the effect of the poison. But his product continued to make waves all around the world — and off it.\n\n\"Think of nylon, starting with nylon clothes, and then the pinnacle: space suits,\" Hughes said. \"It's an amazing diversity of products that came out of this.\"\n\nFollow Jim Beckerman on Twitter: @JimBeckerman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/15"}]}
