For the latest news on the winter storm, read USA TODAY's story for Wednesday, March 5.\n\nA massive winter storm marched across the central U.S. on Tuesday, unloading heavy winds, rain, and snow across much of the country, killing two people in Mississippi, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of customers, and forcing officials to reschedule Mardi Gras events in New Orleans.\n\nTwo people in Mississippi died due to the severe weather, Gov. Tate Reeves confirmed on the social media platform X. WAPT-TV reported that one person was killed when a power line fell in Madison County and that another person in the same county died after a tree fell on his car.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a tornado watch Tuesday extended until 9 p.m. CT for parts of Mississippi and Louisiana, including New Orleans, where tens of thousands gathered outdoors for the yearly Mardi Gras celebration. Police had already announced shortened parade routes ahead of the harsh weather.\n\nThe weather service reported a possible tornado moving northeastward at 45 mph toward Pointe à la Hache, a community about 50 miles southeast of New Orleans. By 8 p.m. CT, the service said severe weather in the region was \"almost done\" as the line of storms steadily moved east off the Louisiana coast.\n\nThe service also confirmed a brief tornado in Irving, Texas, about 10 miles northwest of Dallas, and said the twister had peak wind speeds of 110 mph. No injuries or deaths were reported.\n\nTens of millions of people were under severe weather advisories because of the storm, from tornado, thunderstorm and fire-related warnings in the South to blizzard warnings across the northern Plains region.\n\nHurricane-force winds were reported in northeastern Texas and southeastern Oklahoma through the morning, prompting red flag warnings across the drought-stricken region. The winds caused widespread power outages that affected over 360,000 homes and businesses in Texas alone.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters in Minnesota and Nebraska warned of heavy snowfall that could cause whiteout conditions and make travel \"treacherous and potentially life-threatening.\"\n\nThrough the midweek, the low-pressure system is expected to spread as far south as Florida and as far north as Pennsylvania and New Jersey, coming up just short of New York City, which may still be in for some thunderstorms, AccuWeather said. In all, the storm could impact up to 170 million people across more than 20 states.\n\nUprooted trees, damaged buildings, tangled power lines\n\nDamage was reported in multiple states as the expansive storm brought hurricane-force winds across the South.\n\nIn south-central Oklahoma, the city of Ada was ravaged by strong winds and a confirmed tornado. Images showed an uprooted tree smashed into a mobile home while mangled debris littered the streets. The city urged residents to stay home if possible, with \"downed power lines, gas leaks, and trees everywhere,\" according to a Facebook post.\n\nIn Lewisville, Texas, multiple local media outlets reported that a warehouse collapsed overnight. The city said wreckage-covered roads and winds knocked out traffic lights, snarling traffic. In the nearby city of Irving, the police department said on X that there was \"significant storm damage.\"\n\nIn Plano, just north of Dallas, winds ripped off a portion of a high school's roof while heavy rain flooded the school's sports facility, KHOU reported. The NWS office in Fort Worth, Texas, said dust storms the rest of Tuesday will reduce visibility to about 2 miles in some locations.\n\nThe El Paso, Texas, office of the NWS warned motorist against driving in such conditions Tuesday, when a \"plume of dust'' from New Mexico was headed its way. The previous day, a large, fast-moving dust storm known as a \"haboob'' drastically reduced visibility in parts of New Mexico and Texas.\n\nIn Ascension Parish, Louisiana, the local sheriff's office said about five houses received weather-related damage on Tuesday. No injuries were immediately reported.\n\nThe parish is part of the Baton Rouge metropolitan area and about 60 miles northwest of New Orleans. Responders throughout the Baton Rouge area also reported fallen trees in several parishes.\n\nIn Rapides Parish, located in central Louisiana, residents and authorities reported damages to structures, homes. and roads. The Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office said it was aware of damages, but there were no reported injuries.\n\nStrong winds, dry conditions cause fires in Texas\n\nHigh winds and low humidity, as well as dry vegetation in Texas fueled wildfires across the state.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the Texas A&M Forest Service said extreme fire weather conditions were expected to be widespread in the western and southern parts of Texas near the cities of Abilene, Austin, Del Rio, Fort Worth, Killeen, Laredo, San Angelo, San Antonio, Stephenville, and Weatherford.\n\n\"Any wildfire that ignites in dry vegetation could have forward rates of spread up to six miles per hour,\" the Texas A&M Forest Service warned.\n\nBy late Tuesday, fire crews responded to 13 active wildfires, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service's incident viewer.\n\nStorm blasts Plains, Midwest with whiteout conditions\n\nWhile the storm unleashed damaging winds in the South, it is also set to bring heavy snow and blizzard conditions to portions of the north-central U.S. into Wednesday.\n\nThe two main trouble spots for heavy snow are parts of Colorado and the upper Midwest. On Tuesday, the swath of heaviest snow will expand and shift from northeastern Colorado to South Dakota, Iowa, and central and western Minnesota, AccuWeather said.\n\nBlizzard warnings are in effect in six states, and some 6 million people could be impacted, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"Travel should be restricted to emergencies only,\" the NWS office in Iowa warned. \"If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle.\"\n\n– Doyle Rice\n\nHurricane-force winds threaten 'extreme fire behavior'\n\nThe storm's damaging winds come as parts of the eastern U.S. are seeing a breakout of wildfires and the South's drought conditions have turned the region into a tinderbox.\n\nIn the Carolinas, firefighters continued battling blazes that have prompted evacuations and clouded communities in heavy smoke. Just outside Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, first responders were working to contain a 2,000-acre fire that erupted over the weekend.\n\nIn North Carolina, fires were engulfing swaths of the state's national forests while evacuation orders remained in parts of Polk County, where a 600-acre fire burned in the Blue Ridge Mountains. With powerful winds on the horizon, fire officials across the East warned residents to refrain from burning anything outdoors.\n\nThe National Weather Service on Tuesday issued red flag warnings throughout central and southern Texas as the storm pushed across the state. The area did not receive much rain, and hurricane-force winds threatened to fuel any fires that ignited in the dry lands.\n\nPower outages abound amid cross-country storm\n\nIn Texas, the number of homes and businesses without power had dwindled from upward of 360,000 to about 210,000 as of 8 p.m. CT Tuesday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMore than 31,000 outages were reported in Louisiana while over 24,000 utility customers had no power in Mississippi and 39,000 in Alabama as the storm moved east, the outage tracker said.\n\n\"While we may not yet have a specific time for customers’ power to return, resources are working as quickly and safely as possible around the clock,\" Texas' largest power provider, Oncor, said in a statement.\n\nWind advisories stretch across the US\n\nWind warnings and advisories were in place Tuesday from New Mexico to Florida and up to Virginia as the massive storm barreled east across the central U.S.\n\n\"As these thunderstorms roar eastward, the biggest threat will be damaging wind gusts, especially in Arkansas, Louisiana and western Mississippi,\" said Tyler Roys, a senior meteorologist for AccuWeather, adding that the area could see \"widespread gusts of up to 80 mph\" and some possibly as high as 100 mph.\n\nA gust of 93 mph − just 3 mph below Category 2 hurricane strength − was registered near the small town of Hugoton in southwestern Kansas on Tuesday afternoon, KSN-TV reported.\n\nThe gusts are expected to continue grounding flights and knocking out power. Another main concern: the threat of wildfires in the South and spreading the blazes already burning in the Carolinas.\n\nTornado warnings and watches issued across Texas, Oklahoma\n\nThe National Weather Service issued tornado advisories for multiple southern Plains states Tuesday morning, including Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\nThe weather service offices in the Oklahoma cities of Tulsa and Norman warned residents of severe storms \"capable of producing tornadoes\" moving across the southeastern part of the state. Dallas was among the cities in northeastern Texas under tornado watches.\n\nThe service’s office in Forth Worth, Texas, urged residents to prepare an emergency kit with essentials. The office also alerted of the “critical fire weather’’ in the Dallas area because of the high winds and low humidity Tuesday.\n\nTravel delays pile up at Texas airports\n\nMore than 280 flights at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport were canceled Tuesday and over 500 were delayed, according to FlightAware. The Federal Aviation Administration said flights at the airport were being delayed by an average of two hours \"due to wind.\"\n\n“Strong storms this morning are leading to hazardous road conditions around the metro area,” the airport said in a statement on X. “Please allow extra time and be safe as storms move quickly over the area. Check your flight status for any schedule impacts this morning.”\n\nThe smaller Dallas Love Field airport reported over 60 cancellations and dozens of delays, according to FlightAware. In Houston, George Bush Intercontinental Airport saw 45-minute delays because of the storm, the FAA said.\n\nMardi Gras forced to reschedule events because of severe weather\n\nWith the storm threatening to bring powerful wind gusts, hail and possible tornadoes to New Orleans on Fat Tuesday, officials have had to reschedule events and cut some short.\n\nTwo of the city's largest parades were set for Tuesday morning, and while they still occurred, the New Orleans Police Department set a deadline of 11:30 a.m. for the festivities to end before the worst of the storm moves over the area. The parades will also have shortened routes.\n\nThe National Weather Service in New Orleans said the city is at an enhanced risk of severe weather, issuing a tornado watch and warning of \"damaging winds in excess of 60 mph.\"\n\nThe office reported damage from a possible tornado in Gramercy, about 45 miles west of New Orleans, and said around 5 p.m. local time, \"the next 2-3 hours will be the busiest.''\n\nMajor storm threatens nocturnal tornadoes\n\nThrough March 2, the U.S. had totaled 61 confirmed tornadoes this year, less than half the yearly average of 138 for that period. That figure is about to change, according to AccuWeather meteorologist Alex DaSilva, who said the number of twisters is less relevant than where and when they strike.\n\nNocturnal tornadoes are particularly concerning because they may hit homes when people are sleeping and not ready to seek cover.\n\n“It really only takes one,’’ he said in an online forecast. “If you get one really powerful tornado to go through a very populated area, people are really going to remember that. We just want people to be vigilant.’’\n\nForecasters raise alarms about layoffs, budget cuts\n\nWeather experts across the nation say they fear the Trump administration's government cuts that resulted in hundreds of employees leaving the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including the weather service, may increase the threat during these severe weather events.\n\n“Recent terminations within the government workforce for science are likely to cause irreparable harm and have far-reaching consequences for public safety, economic well-being, and the United States’ global leadership,” the American Meteorological Society said Monday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his senior advisor Elon Musk have looked to the Department of Government Efficiency to enact Trump's signature campaign promise to reduce the size of the federal government.\n\nMost weather service field offices already are understaffed, said James Spann, chief meteorologist for WBMA-TV in Birmingham, Alabama. “If NWS products and services are reduced, we all suffer … especially during times of life-threatening weather,” Spann wrote in a social media post.\n\nNOAA has said it's committed to keeping Americans informed about dangerous weather. More than 1,000 protesters demonstrated against the layoffs Monday outside the agency's office in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIn addition to the probationary employees who were dismissed, a wave of senior weather service meteorologists retired Friday, and others left as part of the agency’s “Fork in the Road” plan that will pay them administrative leave through September.\n\nContributing: Michael Tortorich, Gonzales Weekly Citizen; Melissa Gregory, Alexandria Town Talk", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/04"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/environment/953574/worlds-most-extreme-weather-events-2021", "title": "The most extreme weather events in 2021 | The Week", "text": "This year was regarded by scientists, politicians and environmentalists as pivotal in the global effort to take action on climate change.\n\nStark warnings and alarming forecasts were issued, as regions that were previously not considered to be on the frontline of climate change saw unprecedented weather events destroy homes and claim lives. As mercury levels in Moscow hit record-breaking highs in June, the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that the world was reaching a “point of no return”\n\nIn August, Boris Johnson described the latest global assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a “wake-up call to the world”. The “most comprehensive” climate report from the panel issued a “code red for humanity”, said The Independent, and stated the link between global warming and the increased rate and severity of extreme weather events.\n\nThe Week Escape your echo chamber.

Record-breaking snowfall, Madrid\n\n(Image credit: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images)\n\nIn the first weeks of 2021, Storm Filomena brought record-breaking levels of snow for Madrid and elderly Spanish citizens were warned to stay at home as temperatures plummeted. The heaviest snow for 50 years brought transport in and out of the city to a “standstill”, Euronews reported. The snowstorm caused around €1.4bn (£1.2bn) of damage, The New York Times said.\n\n2. Storm Christoph, UK\n\n(Image credit: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images)\n\nThe period from 18 to 20 January 2021 was “one of the wettest three-day periods on record” for North Wales and North-West England, according to the Met Office. Homes in Cheshire were flooded, and residents were evacuated from homes in Manchester and Merseyside. Once Storm Christoph cleared, significant snowfall also led to travel disruption with icy conditions and road closures. Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the Manchester Evening News the atmosphere was one of “anxiety and disbelief”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n3. Cyclone Ana, Fiji\n\n(Image credit: Leon Lord/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCyclone Ana “pummelled” Fiji towards the end of January, “just a month after category 5 Cyclone Yasa tore through the country’s northern islands”, The Guardian said. Satyendra Prasad, Fiji’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the cyclone – which caused more than 10,000 people to take refuge in 318 evacuation centres across the country – had left behind “a difficult recovery”.\n\n4. Winter storms, Texas\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Week US reported that 3.5 million businesses and homes were left without power in February as temperatures dropped to -13℃ in some areas of Texas. Power went out across the state, leaving many vulnerable people in extremely cold conditions. The total death toll rose from 151 to 210 in July, after a decision was made to include deaths caused by the collapse of the state electric power grid in the final count, The Guardian reported.\n\n5. Dust storm, China\n\n(Image credit: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)\n\nFlights were grounded and schools shut in what the South China Morning post reported as the worst sandstorm in a decade. But what was widely reported as a sandstorm in China was, in fact, a dust storm - “and that’s much worse”, said The Conversation. The miniscule particles can travel “much, much further” than sand, and can cause health risks if they are “drawn deep into the lungs”. In Beijing, the sky became orange as dust and pollution caused hazardous air quality.\n\n6. Flooding, New South Wales\n\n(Image credit: Jenny Evans/Getty Images)\n\nIn March, Sydney and New South Wales (NSW) residents felt the effects of extreme flooding. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) urged residents to take care of both their physical and mental health as heavy downpours lead to rivers and dams overflowing, with thousands evacuated from their homes.\n\n7. Cyclone Seroja\n\n(Image credit: Alfred Ike Wurin/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn April 160 people died in Indonesia after a tropical cyclone “hit a remote cluster of islands”, Climate Home News reported. Landslides and flash floods displaced at least 22,000 people, the news site adds. Reaching Western Australia days after it made landfall in Indonesia, residents in the town of Kalbarri, north of Perth, said the storm was “absolutely terrifying”, the BBC reported. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said Cyclone Seroja was \"like nothing we have seen before in decades”.\n\n8. Record temperatures, Moscow\n\n(Image credit: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAs temperatures reached 34.8℃ in Moscow, “the absolute record for any day in June was hit”, The Moscow Times reported. The “abnormal temperatures” of the “record-breaking heatwave” weren’t just recorded in the capital; Penza, Vologda and Petrozavodsk also broke heat records during the month.\n\n9. Heat dome, Pacific Northwest\n\n(Image credit: Nathan Howard/Getty Images)\n\nSoaring temperatures across the Northwest United States “rewrote the record books” this year, National Geographic reported. The “heat dome” was the “most dramatic example” of an extreme weather event, said The Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts, and the meteorological phenomenon led to evacuations across states that weren’t “remotely prepared for the heat”. Lytton, a village in Canada’s British Columbia, was “engulfed and largely destroyed by a wildfire” as a result of the temperatures, National Geographic continued.\n\nBlistering Pacific Northwest temperatures should act as a wake-up call\n\n10. Bootleg fire, Oregon\n\n(Image credit: Payton Bruni/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA “heavier-than-normal start to the US wildfire season” saw “one of the largest blazes in Oregon’s history” consume more than 364,000 acres of land, the BBC reported in July. More than 2,000 firefighters tackled the wildfire, which took more than a month to contain. The fire “generated its own weather system”, noted Oregon Live, and thousands of homes were threatened by the blaze, which saw residents temporarily housed in evacuation centres in the state.\n\n11. Flooding, west Germany\n\n(Image credit: Christof Stache/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFloods destroyed homes and bridges along the River Ahr in July, while in the German village of Schuld, water “engulfed streets and swallowed homes” CNN reported. Victims will be supported by a government-approved €400 million recovery package, as ministers have promised to move quickly on rebuilding affected areas, Euronews reported. A study by World Weather Attribution found that this event was between 1.2 and nine times more likely to happen in 2021 compared to pre-industrial periods.\n\n12. Flooding, China\n\n(Image credit: STR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMore than 300 people died when China’s Henan province experienced severe rainfall and flooding in July. Twelve people lost their lives in a Zhengzhou metro train, with survivors describing how water leaked through the carriage’s doors until it became difficult to breathe. While the country typically experiences flooding in the summer months, this year’s occurrence was “exacerbated by rapid urbanisation, conversion of farmland and the worsening climate crisis, as well as overwhelmed flood mitigation systems,” The Guardian reported.\n\n13. Wildfires, Greece\n\n(Image credit: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHuge wildfires “ravaged” large regions of southern Europe in August, claiming lives in Greece, Turkey and Italy, The Guardian reported. The blaze came as a heatwave swept the region, and Greece’s second largest island - Evia - was evacuated. Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis apologised for the blazes, and said that more than 580 fires have broken out in the past seven days. More than 20 countries offered to send firefighting resources, and the “camaraderie” that’s developed between Greek and British firefighters “is testament to the scale of the job before them”, Sky News reports.\n\n14. Hurricane Ida, US\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nMore than one million homes and businesses were left without power in the southern US states of Louisiana and Mississippi after Hurricane Ida made landfall on 29 August, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Ida hit with maximum sustained winds of 150mph. It was later downgraded to a tropical depression, and moved from a category four storm to category one. “Katrina followed a similar trajectory”, Sky News said. In the following days, Storm Ida moved up the northern-eastern coast of America. Subway stations and roads were flooded in New York, where the lives of at least nine people - including that of a two-year-old boy - were claimed by the storm. For communities in New Orleans, Ida has brought “painful reminders of the death and devastation” caused by the 2006 hurricane which killed more than 1,800 people, The New York Times reported.\n\n15. Monsoon floods, India and Nepal\n\n(Image credit: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSeveral Nepalese regions and two Indian states were hit by “heavy late monsoon rains” in October, Reuters reported. “Deadly flash floods” took the lives of more than 180 people as “homes were submerged or crushed by rocks”, said the BBC. The Nepalese government committed to giving each of the victims’ families $1,700 (£1,220) in response.\n\nThe unseasonal rainfall was attributed to the climate crisis, but some experts indicated that hydro-power projects in the Himalayas, and “excessive and often unchecked construction on steep slopes”, had contributed to the damage caused to the region’s “fragile ecology”, said the broadcaster.\n\n16. Tornadoes, Kentucky\n\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden said that Kentucky had experienced “one of the largest tornado outbreaks in US history”. More than 30 tornadoes “tore through” Kentucky and seven other states, claiming the lives of at least 90 people, and leaving thousands of residents homeless, said Sky News.\n\nThe state’s governor, Andy Beshear, said that this was “the most devastating, most deadly tornado event in Kentucky’s history”.\n\nTwo brothers, aged 15 months and three months old, were placed in a bathtub before being carried away by the severe winds. Their grandmother, Clara Lutz, later learned that both boys had been found alive in her garden under the upturned bath.\n\nBiden’s infrastructure bill has allocated billions of dollars to climate resilience projects, in the hope of strengthening infrastructure and defence against future extreme weather events.\n\n17. Typhoons, Philippines\n\nThe Philippine Red Cross described “complete carnage” in coastal areas of the country after Super Typhoon Rai “sent some 400,000 people running for safety” on 16 December, said the BBC. Thousands of military and service personnel were working to assist with search and rescue efforts in the worst-hit areas.\n\nWinds of around 120mph ripped through the nation’s south-eastern islands, injuring at least 500 people. A further 375 people are known to have died. “There are some areas that look like it has been bombed worse than World War Two,” Red Cross chair Richard Gordon told the BBC.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/17/deadly-storm-flooding-recovery-outages-closures/78945822007/", "title": "Death toll rises after weekend storm batters eastern US", "text": "Feb. 17, 2025 Updated Feb. 18, 2025, 4:23 p.m. ET\n\nPIKEVILLE, Ky. – Communities across the eastern U.S. were grappling Monday with major flooding from a storm that brought heavy rain and strong winds to multiple states over the weekend, causing widespread power outages, evacuations, water rescues and over a dozen deaths.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, whose disaster declaration was approved by President Donald Trump, described the storm as \"one of most serious weather events\" the state has seen in a decade. At a news conference on Monday, Beshear said the death toll had risen to 11 and told reporters he fears it will continue to grow. Storm related deaths were also reported in Georgia and West Virginia.\n\nIn Kentucky, the storm has left tens of thousands without power or water, and has forced authorities to close a possible record number of roads, Beshear said. Swift water crews rescued over 1,000 people from floodwaters.\n\n\"We are still in a search and rescue phase,\" Beshear said Monday, adding that several \"significant\" rescue missions were ongoing in areas where rivers were cresting. \"There are still people that are in harm's way.\"\n\nIn West Virginia, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said rivers will continue rising this week as search and rescue teams continue to look for missing people. Morrisey, as well as officials in Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee have warned of the danger of cresting rivers and said they could prompt additional evacuations.\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin submitted a major disaster declaration to Trump citing \"catastrophic flooding\" that reached historic levels in Buchanan County and triggered over 150 swift water rescues.\n\nAuthorities across the eastern U.S. urged people to stay off the roads and warned that an incoming storm could drop several inches of snow and cause the floodwaters to freeze, creating treacherous travel conditions later this week. In the meantime, crews were clearing roads and linemen were working to restore power before temperatures drop.\n\nFlooding in eastern Kentucky: 'I had to fight my way' home\n\nIn Pikeville, a rural county in eastern Kentucky that was battered by the storm, shopping centers, schools and homes and were inundated by floodwaters.\n\nBobby Luster, an auto shop employee, said he’d been called to work that morning at 1 a.m. to retrieve some computers as the water rose – but by that point, he said, it was already too late. “You couldn’t go through there,\" he said. \"I had to fight my way to get home.”\n\nAt Pikeville High School, which has designated an emergency center Saturday night, a group of evacuees were told to flee to Pike Central High School as floodwaters continued to rise. Many at the school also saw their own homes flooded. Cory Smith, a school district employee, said his basement had been submerged under six feet of water.\n\nAt least three people in Pike County died due to the floods, according to Beshear. Pikeville Mayor Jimmy Carter said 100 people were rescued by swift water crews in the county. As water levels began receding Monday, Carter said the goal had shifted to “clean up and assess the homes that were flooded, the businesses that were flooded.“\n\nDeath toll rises after devastating storm ravages eastern US\n\nIn Kentucky, 11 people have died as a result of the weekend storm, including a mother and her 7-year-old child who were found in a submerged vehicle Saturday night in Bonnieville, Hart County Coroner Anthony Roberts told The Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network. Their identities have not been shared publicly at the family's request.\n\nIn south-central Kentucky, a man identified by the Hart County Coroner's Office as William Rutledge, 59, of Etoile, was killed in a single-vehicle crash on Interstate 65 near Cave City, Kentucky State Police Trooper Katan Parker said in a statement. A preliminary investigation revealed the pickup truck Rutledge was driving went off the roadway and overturned. Investigators determined the accident was weather-related.\n\nA 73-year-old Manchester man died as evacuations in Clay County began Saturday, officials said. The man was later identified by the Clay County Coroner's Office as Donald Keith Nicholson.\n\nBeshear said other confirmed victims of the flooding include three people in Pike County, a woman in Washington County, a man in Hardin County, a man in Floyd County and an unidentified person in Nelson County.\n\nWest Virginia's governor said in a news conference Monday that officials have confirmed one fatality, but are withholding further information until the family is notified.\n\nIn Georgia, one person was killed in Atlanta after an uprooted tree fell on a home, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nAnother winter storm to hit the central, eastern US\n\nThe latest in a chain of closely packed winter storms was taking aim at the Midwest on Monday before rolling toward the East for what could be the biggest snow yet to hit the region − or nothing at all, forecasters said.\n\nAccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Tom Kines said the storm was taking shape Monday and tracking over parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri. St. Louis was on the northern edge and might get nothing or a few inches, while Missouri cities such as Kansas City and Springfield could get 6 inches or more, Kines said.\n\nOne major question is how the storm will impact cities across the Mid-Atlantic. Kines said the storm will roll straight across the country before turning north. How sharp that turn becomes is crucial. Eastern cities such as Boston, New York and Philadelphia are likely to be spared, he said. Washington, D.C., could get 6 inches of snow or none at all.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that the storm could impact parts of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, bringing a possible wintry mix Wednesday and Thursday. Kines said parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee could see ice.\n\n– John Bacon\n\nRivers still cresting after weekend rainstorm, officials say\n\nFlood watches and warnings remained active Monday across much of the eastern U.S., from Ohio and Kentucky to the Gulf Coast states. The National Weather Service warned that rivers are continuing to crest, keeping some areas inundated with floodwaters more than a day after the most extreme storm conditions abated.\n\nBeshear said on Monday that the Kentucky, Rolling Fork and Green river basins are all either above their flood stage or are expected to surpass their banks. He said water may not recede in some areas until late this week.\n\nThe Rolling Fork River near Boston, Kentucky, is one of a couple of waterways expected to crest in the coming days, according to the National Water Prediction Service.

At one point over 400,000 homes and businesses across half the country were without power, though that figure had decreased to around 94,000 by late Wednesday.\n\nThe National Weather Service said preliminary information showed that at least eight tornadoes hit parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana on Tuesday.\n\nWhile many areas will see a respite as the weekend arrives, AccuWeather meteorologists said they are monitoring the potential for multiple rounds of severe weather next week. One possible storm that could develop late next week could spark a \"significant outbreak of severe weather\" across the central U.S. for several days, AccuWeather said.\n\nOn Wednesday, severe weather walloped much of the Eastern Seaboard from the Mid-Atlantic to Jacksonville, Florida. \"Damaging winds are the primary threat from these storms, but a few tornadoes can't be ruled out either,'' the National Weather Service said.\n\nThe worst conditions are anticipated across southeast Virginia and the eastern Carolinas, where authorities already are dealing with an outbreak of wildfires that began last weekend.\n\n\"The rain will be intense enough to knock down or cease the wildfire threat temporarily but will also trigger localized urban flooding of city streets,\" AccuWeather senior meteorologist Bill Deger said.\n\nThe downpours, gusty winds, severe thunderstorms and possible tornadoes hitting the Atlantic Seaboard through Wednesday night will create a risk to lives and property and could trigger power outages and \"significant\" travel delays, AccuWeather meteorologists warn.\n\nThe harsh weather driven by an advancing cold front will span about 100 miles in width but extend more than 1,000 miles from north to south. The heaviest rain and the greatest risk of thunderstorms may only last 6 hours or less, but chaos could be widespread.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ In Oklahoma, the weather service confirmed five tornadoes were in Okmulgee and McIntosh counties. According to preliminary information, the damage from the tornadoes was consistent with an EF-0 and EF-1.\n\n∎ At least two tornadoes were confirmed in the communities of Darrow and Gramercy, Louisiana, according to the weather service. Damage in Darrow was consistent with an EF-1 and peak winds were estimated at 90 mph while an EF-0 hit Gramercy with winds estimated at 75 mph.\n\n∎ In Texas, a weather service damage survey team confirmed an EF-1 tornado occurred Tuesday in the Fort Worth area. Peak winds were estimated at 110 mph for the tornado, which remained on the ground for about a half mile.\n\n∎ In Florida, Tallahassee schools opened an hour late Wednesday amid concerns tornadoes could develop. The region remained under a wind advisory into Wednesday night; gusts were expected to reach 45 mph.\n\n2 dead in Nebraska amid blizzard conditions\n\nNebraska state troopers have responded to more than 400 weather-related incidents since Tuesday morning, the agency said Wednesday. The incidents included 31 vehicle crashes and 382 motorist assists.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the Nebraska State Patrol said severe winter weather in the state contributed to a head-on crash on Tuesday. Two people were killed on Interstate 80 when a vehicle lost control, crossed the median, and struck an eastbound semi-truck, according to the agency.\n\nThe agency identified the victims as Emelin Ortega Rodas, 25, of Lexington, and Daniel Ortega Marroquin, 62, of Lexington. The driver of the semi-truck was transported to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe incident occurred amid blizzard conditions in parts of the state. On Wednesday, the weather service in Hastings and Omaha warned that more snow is expected overnight and into Friday.\n\n\"There’s another round of snow coming, with several inches of accumulation expected in northern Nebraska by Friday afternoon. Be safe and stay prepared for winter driving,\" the Nebraska State Patrol said in a statement.\n\nTornadoes possible in East\n\nThe Weather Channel warned that damaging winds and tornadoes were possible all day Wednesday from Pennsylvania to far northern Florida. Charleston, South Carolina, Raleigh, North Carolina, Richmond, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., are among a slew of cities facing the threat into Wednesday night.\n\n\"L​arge hail and perhaps an isolated tornado could accompany storms that develop in western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia,\" the Weather Channel said.\n\nDeaths reported in Mississippi\n\nIn Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves said three people died as high winds swept across the state Tuesday.\n\n\"Please pray for their family during this difficult time,'' Reeves said on the X platform, adding that six other people have been reported injured.\n\nWAPT-TV in Jackson reported two of the deaths occurred in Madison County, one when a 71-year-old man came in contact with a downed power line and the other one when a tree fell on a car occupied by a 63-year-old man. The other storm-related fatality took place in Clarke County when a woman was struck by a tree branch that fell in her yard, WLBT-TV in Jackson reported.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Mississippi posted a video of the roof ripping off a building at the Clay County Jail. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph on Wednesday could topple large branches and some trees could fall, resulting in more power outages and making travel risky, forecasters said.\n\nMassive disruption of air travel because of storm\n\nMuch like Tuesday, when about 350 flights were canceled in Dallas-area airports alone, the rough weather caused major disruptions to air travel Wednesday.\n\nCharlotte Douglas Airport in North Carolina led the way with 176 cancellations and 286 delayed flights through 6:30 p.m. ET, according to the tracking website FlightAware. But the turbulence was widespread, as Washington's National Reagan Airport reported 130 cancellations and 258 delays. Dallas-Fort Worth had 110 cancellations and 327 delays.\n\nIowa encounters blizzard conditions\n\nIn Iowa, crews from the Des Moines Fire Department's Hazardous Materials assisted with clearing an accident scene along Interstate 80 near Wednesday morning. The driver of a semitruck collided with another truck that had previously jackknifed under an overpass, the Des Moines Register reported.\n\nStrong winds were expected throughout the day, leading to blizzard conditions and making winter roads dangerous. A blizzard warning was in effect for much of Iowa. Conditions overnight left roads in western Iowa \"nearly impassable\" and visibility Wednesday morning was near zero at times, according to the National Weather Service. Snowfall totals in the north-central part of the state reached 9 inches, the Register said.\n\nThe dangerous conditions come as thousands try to descend on Des Moines for the Iowa girls' high school state basketball tournament, a major winter event in the state.\n\nTexas bracing for more fires\n\nSouth-central Texas was facing \"near critical\" fire weather conditions Wednesday because of the dry air and wind gusts forecast for the area. A Rangeland Fire Danger warning was in effect as 20-mph wind gusts were likely to combine with a minimum relative humidity of 15% to 25%, the weather service said.\n\nAreas of New Mexico and Texas were temporarily shrouded by a brown mist earlier this week, when dust storms known as haboobs swept across the southern Plains on Monday afternoon. More than a dozen fire reports were received by the National Weather Service office in San Antonio and Austin.\n\nBlizzard conditions expected in Midwest\n\nBlizzard conditions are expected \"at times\" Wednesday from north of Kansas City, Missouri, to Iowa and Illinois and up to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and several inches of snowfall combined with strong winds are likely, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"The main concern today will continue to be the high winds with gusts expected to range between 50-65 mph through this evening,\" the NWS office in Kansas City said on X. The office in Marquette, Michigan, said strong winds along Lake Superior \"will result in blizzard conditions, possible tree damage, and potential for power outages.\"\n\nContributing: Kate Kealey, Cooper Worth, and Victoria Reyna-Rodriguez, Des Moines Register", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/11/25/thanksgiving-weather-forecast-winter-storm/76563196007/", "title": "Thanksgiving weather forecast: Winter storm could affect travel", "text": "Nov. 25, 2024 Updated Nov. 26, 2024, 8:10 a.m. ET\n\nEditor's Note: This page is a summary of news on weather and Thanksgiving travel for Monday, Nov. 25.

That would represent a 6% increase from 2023.\n\nPassenger volumes have reached record highs in 2024; there has been an increase of 17% since 2022, the TSA said in a statement. TSA Administrator David Pekoske said the 10 busiest travel days in the TSA's history have all occurred in 2024, adding that \"we anticipate that trend to continue.\"\n\nLow gas prices could drive record travel\n\nAAA projects 79.9 million people will travel 50 miles or more from their homes for Thanksgiving from Tuesday to Dec. 2. That represents 1.7 million more travelers than last year and 2 million more than in 2019.\n\n“Thanksgiving is the busiest holiday for travel, and this year we’re expecting to set new records across the board, from driving to flying and cruising,” said Stacey Barber, Vice President of AAA Travel.\n\nLow gas prices are expected to fuel record travel.

For the latest updates on the snow, follow USA TODAY's coverage for Wednesday, Jan. 22.\n\nLAFAYETTE, La. − A wide swath of the South was targeted by a major winter storm Tuesday as brutally cold temperatures gripped much of the nation, breaking snowfall records more than a century old in a southern region where flurries are unusual.\n\nStacey Denson, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, told USA TODAY that a blizzard warning was a first for Louisiana. A blizzard warning means the expectation that snow and frequent wind gusts of up to 35 mph could reduce visibility to 1/4 mile or less.\n\n\"It was pretty crazy to see,\" Denson said. \"It is actually improving a bit, but we had whiteout conditions.\"\n\nThe blizzard warning expired for all of Louisiana as of noon CDT, but a winter storm warning remained in effect until Wednesday. More than 30 million people were under a snowstorm warning until Wednesday morning, from southern Texas through Georgia and into Virginia. Authorities in Houston investigated two deaths that may be weather-related, including that of a homeless man who was found near an apartment complex, the Harris County Sheriff said on X.\n\nIn Lafayette, 70 miles east of Lake Charles, Louisiana, Mayor-President Monique Blanco Boulet said residents should plan to stay home for the next few days, and that the approaching storm represents a weather event unlike anything the city has ever experienced.\n\n\"We are prepared for hurricanes, we have all the equipment we need, we know what we need,\" Boulet said. \"This is going to be different. We don't necessarily have snow equipment to deal with what we have coming.\"\n\nThe storm was on a track to sweep through Texas and Louisiana, across the Gulf Coast, and deep into Florida, with significant snow and ice in tow. Some areas slammed by the storm haven't seen frozen storms in decades.\n\nBy Tuesday evening, parts of the 1-10 corridor in Louisiana had received 10 inches of snow, while areas of southeastern Texas reported up to 6 inches, and some locations in Mississippi and Alabama were at 4-plus inches, according to AccuWeather.\n\nDenson said snow is rare in Louisiana and even more unusual to have the unrelenting cold required to keep it from quickly melting. The cold front was not expected to release its grip until Thursday, meaning hazardous road conditions won't be gone soon. The weather service message to residents was simple: \"Do not travel. If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you.\"\n\n\"We don't really have any snowplows,\" Denson said. \"Our neighboring state (Arkansas) sent plows down to help us out.\"\n\nElsewhere, temperatures in many areas from the interior West through the Midwest and up and down the East Coast were 20 degrees below normal, even for the dead of winter. And in Southern California, another round of Santa Ana winds racing through the smoldering fires of greater Los Angeles − combined with dry conditions − drew new concerns.\n\nWind chills 55 below: Snow and ice in Florida? Extreme cold invading US\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Richard Bann, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said that the service was confirming whether Tuesday's snowfall broke a New Orleans record set in 1895 when 8 inches fell.\n\n∎ Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey proclaimed a state of emergency for 39 counties and ordered the National Guard to prepare for activation. The weather service office in Mobile posted a video of heavy snow with about an inch already covering the ground and vehicles.\n\n∎ All roads and bridges in Montgomery County should be considered impassable until further notice due to snowy conditions, the Montgomery County engineering department has determined. Only emergency vehicles should travel on county roads and bridges until further notice.\n\n∎ The Port of Houston said all its facilities will be closed through Wednesday because of the harsh winter weather.\n\n∎ In Georgia, Savannah and its surrounding area are under a winter storm warning issued by the National Weather Service beginning Tuesday at 5 p.m. and lasting until noon Wednesday. The forecast calls for \"heavy mixed precipitation.\"\n\nWinter storm across Gulf Coast draws superlatives\n\nWeather experts are using terms like \"historic snowfall'' and \"the most significant winter storm'' to describe the cold front coursing through the Gulf Coast.\n\nSo this is far from your garden-variety system. But how rare? For starters, New Orleans, which had not received measurable snow since 2009, is expecting 8 inches, near its record total set in 1895.\n\n\"It almost looks like a hurricane … only with snow as the precip type!\" meteorologist A.J. Mastrangelo said on social media as the city got blanketed Tuesday morning.\n\nOther examples: The Houston area is expecting its largest winter storm in more than 60 years, and Jacksonville, Florida, which hasn't had measurable snow in 35 years, is forecast to get freezing rain overnight. So yes, very rare.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nNew Orleans resident: 'Sit and watch, 'cause it's really beautiful'\n\nNew Orleans resident Claire Spenard has had her fair share of snow days from her time growing up in Rochester, New York. At first, she thought the weather predictions of a frozen landscape in the South were a hoax. Now watching schools and major highways close, she regrets failing to buy a shovel before the storm hit.\n\n“It reminds me of being home, and I never thought I would say that,” Spenard told USA TODAY.\n\nThe 23-year-old ballet teacher and server described a ghost town of a city sprinkled with excited children seeing snow for the first time, making snowmen, and walking in the middle of roads untouched by cars.\n\nHer advice for those not used to braving the cold?

The office reposted several photos of Alabamians reporting 7-plus inches at their locations.\n\nPensacola, better known for its white-sand beaches, was covered in a different source of white Tuesday as it set a record with 5 inches of snow while more was still coming down, breaking the 3-inch clip set in 1895. As it was still snowing, a full total for the day wasn't expected until later in the evening. said meteorologist Jason Beaman.\n\nScattered reports of 6.5 to 7.5 inches had been received nearby, Beaman said.\n\n\"FLORIDA WHITEOUT'' blared the homepage of the Pensacola News Journal's website, saying the 5 1/2 inches of snow registered almost certainly beat a previous mark that had stood for 130 years.\n\n- Jim Little, Pensacola News Journal\n\nWinter sledding Florida style on tap in state capital\n\nFloridians commonly keep pool floats, boogie boards and kayaks in storage during the winter months.

In preparation, his family left open their cabinets to prevent pipes from freezing, have all agreed to stay off the roads and stocked up on essential food for the days ahead.\n\nAs the snow fell and his family bunkered down, his young siblings relished the first. \"I just want to enjoy this time with my family, watching them make snow angels and snowmen,\" Hebert said.\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\nFlights canceled as airlines struggle with storm\n\nThe winter storm was upending travel plans across the Southeast. Winter storm warnings were in effect from Texas through the Carolinas, according to the National Weather Service. As of 8 p.m. ET, more than 2,200 U.S. flights had been canceled, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware. That includes 22% of United Airlines flights and 12% of Southwest Airlines flights, the bulk of which were canceled Monday ahead of the storm's impact.\n\nMore than 90% of flights out of George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P.

The total snow and sleet forecast for the area that includes San Antonio, 80 miles to the south, ranged from a dusting up to 1 1/2 inches − with hazardous ice accumulations of one-tenth of an inch. The forecast was enough for all Central Texas school districts − including the Austin district − the University of Texas and Texas State University to shut down Tuesday.\n\nOutside of his home in Austin's Travis Heights neighborhood, Gail Armstrong prepared for the cold by replacing the propane in the trailer in front of his house. Armstrong said he's concerned about road conditions.\n\n“People don’t know diddly about driving on snow and ice,” Armstrong said.\n\n− Keri Heath and Ella McCarthy, Austin American-Statesman\n\nSingle-digit temperatures coming to Mississippi\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for Central and South Mississippi through Wednesday.

The center reported one person injured in Stoddard, Missouri, when a home was destroyed by a tornado, and four others injured after structures were damaged in Gage, Kentucky.\n\nAn EF-1 tornado that hit Vernon County, Missouri, around 12:30 p.m. caused widespread damage, knocking over “multiple semi trucks” on Interstate 49 and eight train cars, according to the weather service office in Springfield, Missouri.\n\nAmong several dozen reports of large hail, baseball-sized hail was reported in five locations across Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee.\n\nMore than 480,000 power outages were reported across the U.S. just before 2 a.m. Thursday. More than 429,000 were in seven central states, including Indiana, where more than 5% of the state’s utility customers (178,486) were without electricity.\n\n'Large and destructive tornado' hits in Arkansas\n\nBy the early evening, the National Weather Service issued a tornado emergency, the highest warning possible, as a \"large and destructive tornado” hit Lake City, Arkansas, and surrounding areas in the northeastern part of the state.\n\nArkansas Gov. Sara Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency Wednesday and posted on X that she has received reports of tornado and storm damage.\n\nVideos shared on social media showed a massive tornado tearing across the land.\n\nThe tornado emergency issued by the weather service, which covered an area near the Arkansas-Missouri border, ended at 7:45 p.m. local time, but Accuweather reporter Leslie Hudson told the weather outlet that the danger did not abate with nightfall.\n\n\"The sun is setting here, so now this turns into a much more dangerous situation, trying to track the severe weather as the daylight goes away,\" Hudson said.\n\nTornado passes over weather station\n\nTwisters were also reported in Kentucky and Missouri.\n\nA tornado caused the National Weather Service office in Paducah, Kentucky, to shelter in place at 8:18 p.m. local time Wednesday, while KFVS-TV, a Missouri-based CBS affiliate, broadcast as a tornado passed over the station.\n\n\"That was a little bit intense folks,\" meteorologist Grant Dade said on the broadcast. \"I’ve never witnessed a wedge tornado come right into the station.\"\n\nThe station reported that at least one person has died due to the storm, citing Sgt. Clark Parrott with the Missouri State Highway Patrol, who said there was \"devastation everywhere\" between the towns of Advance and Delta.\n\nKentucky governor declares state of emergency\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency ahead of the arrival of the major spring storm.\n\n\"Kentucky, we're under some of the most serious weather threats I've seen,\" he said in a statement posted on social media. \"We need everyone statewide to take this seriously.\"\n\nBeshear said tornadoes, dangerous winds, and hail are expected Wednesday night and urged residents to prepare an emergency kit and find a safe place to stay.\n\n\"This is a four-day event, with rain continuing through Saturday,\" he said in a statement. \"There may be widespread flooding, with impacts felt from the west to the east. I've signed a state of emergency to ensure we are ready to respond. Please stay alert. Let's do everything possible to stay safe.\"\n\nNational Weather Service in Memphis: 'This isn't routine'\n\nThe National Weather Service in Memphis, Tennessee, issued a dire warning to residents in the path of the major spring storm, urging them to prepare for major flooding and widespread travel disruptions.\n\n\"This isn’t routine. This is a rare, high-impact, and potentially devastating event,\" the statement said. \"Heavy rainfall will likely lead to widespread river, flash, and areal flooding that could cause severe disruptions especially along and north of I-40.\"\n\nWhere will it rain the hardest?\n\nThe epicenter of the rain and floods is expected to be in the mid-South, forecasters said. Some of the heaviest rain is projected to fall along the Ohio River between Kentucky and Illinois, where the weather service in Paducah, Kentucky, warned of \"catastrophic\" flooding.\n\nThe major rivers most likely to have significant water level rises include the Ohio, Wabash, White, St. Francis, Kentucky, and Tennessee, according to AccuWeather.\n\nMeteorologists say record flooding is possible in Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and Mississippi.\n\n– Doyle Rice\n\nOwasso, Oklahoma, hit by possible tornado\n\nA suspected tornado hit the Oklahoma city of Owasso on Wednesday, damaging buildings, topping utility poles, and uprooting trees.\n\nThe path of destruction stretched about 11 miles in the city outside Tulsa, and radar indicated a possible tornado had formed, according to a statement from the city government. There were no reported injuries, officials said, as multiple agencies, including the local fire and police department, examined the damage.\n\nImages of the aftermath show shredded roofs, collapsed fences, and piles of debris.\n\nDelays pile up at airports across the U.S.\n\nThe massive spring storm is causing delays at major airports from Chicago to Dallas.\n\nOver 120 flights at Chicago O'Hare International Airport were canceled and 500 delayed Wednesday morning, according to FlightAware. Meanwhile, departures at the airport were delayed by an average of over two hours \"due to thunderstorms,\" according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nIn Texas, the FAA said a temporary ground stop was issued at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Nearby departures at Dallas Love Field were delayed by over half an hour due to the potent storm system.\n\nConfirmed tornado touches down in Missouri\n\nA confirmed tornado touched down in west-central Missouri on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe twister was measured moving at 50 mph northeast of Adrian, a city near the Kansas state line.\n\n\"Flying debris will be dangerous to those caught without shelter. Mobile homes will be damaged or destroyed. Damage to roofs, windows, and vehicles will occur. Tree damage is likely,\" said the weather service in Pleasant Hill, Missouri.\n\nSchool closings\n\nA late-season winter storm impacting states in the northern Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes regions has led school districts to cancel classes on Wednesday as bands of heavy snow and ice make travel dangerous.\n\nDozens of schools in Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota switched to virtual learning, delayed the start of class or closed schools altogether.\n\nThese states, which have had heavy snowfall since the weekend, could get 8 inches more of snow, with higher amounts possible in some areas.\n\n\"Gusty winds may lead to areas of blowing snow and very difficult travel conditions,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nMap of active tornado watches, flood watches\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/11/11/flight-cancellations-shutdown-deal-live-updates/87208751007/", "title": "Airlines, FAA in talks about when flight cuts will stop as shutdown ...", "text": "Nov. 11, 2025 Updated Nov. 12, 2025, 8:18 a.m. ET\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Tuesday warned that flight disruptions could skyrocket in the coming days if the House of Representatives does not vote to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nOngoing government-mandated flight cancellations and severe weather in parts of the country wreaked havoc on air travel. In a news conference Tuesday afternoon from Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Duffy urged lawmakers to approve the bipartisan bill to reopen the government.\n\n\"If the House doesn’t act, I think we’ll see more than 10% disruption — and possibly airlines grounding planes altogether,\" Duffy said. \"That’s how serious this is.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday night, FlightAware data showed more than 1,200 cancellations and over 3,600 delays for flights within, into, or out of the United States. Monday saw over 2,400 cancellations, while more than 14,000 total disruptions occurred on Sunday.\n\nThe percentage of flights required to be cut by the Federal Aviation Administration was originally expected to increase to 6% from 4% at 40 major airports on Tuesday, the first bump on the ramp-up to a full 10% of cuts by Friday. Duffy said Tuesday that he will reduce flight cuts as safety allows.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\n\"When that data changes, we're going to start taking that down from 6%, maybe we'll go to four, two, and get back to normal air travel,\" he said. \"It depends on controllers coming back to work.\"\n\nAir traffic control staffing shortages improved on Tuesday after more than two dozen issues on Monday. Duffy said just four staffing issues were reported Tuesday, down from 81 on Saturday.\n\nThousands of flights have been cut since Duffy ordered the cancellations to begin last Friday, Nov. 7. On Monday, the travel woes were compounded by a Chicago-area winter storm that grounded even more flights.\n\nFlight cancellations improve after days of travel chaos\n\nAir traffic control staffing shortages, along with weather issues, have led to tens of thousands of flight cancellations and delays since Oct. 1, when the government shutdown began.\n\nOver the weekend, 1.2 million passengers were delayed or had their flights cancelled due to air traffic controller absences, according to Reuters. FlightAware data showed 1,025 cancellations on Friday and 1,566 on Saturday for flights \"within, into, or out of the United States.\"\n\nFlight cancellations jumped to 2,954 on Sunday and 2,422 on Monday, according to FlightAware. By 8:40 p.m. ET on Tuesday, data showed that 1,254 flights had been cancelled as air traffic control staffing improved for the day.\n\nAirlines, FAA talk flight cuts\n\nThe FAA ordered airlines to cut 4% of daily flights — starting on Nov. 7 — at 40 major airports due to air traffic control staffing issues. Reductions in flights rose to 6% on Tuesday.\n\nThe reductions were set to hit 8% on Thursday and 10% on Friday. Reuters reported that some airlines were holding off on cutting 8% of flights for Thursday. United Airlines said Tuesday it cut about 5% of its flights for Thursday.\n\nAirlines and the FAA said they are in discussions about when the cuts will stop as the government shutdown nears an end. Experts previously told USA TODAY that the impact on air travel will stretch well beyond the shutdown's end as airlines work to untangle complicated flight schedules and recover from staff shortages.\n\n\"It's going to be a step-up, phased-in approach to cutting flights,\" said Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, an independent travel analytics firm. \"For an airline to be told by the government they’ve got 36 or so hours to start dismembering their carefully built flight schedules doesn’t give airlines a lot of time.\"\n\n$10K bonuses for FAA employees? Duffy on Trump’s promises for workers\n\nPresident Donald Trump has alternatively threatened to \"dock\" the pay of workers who don’t show or told them to quit and promised $10,000 bonuses for employees who continued working.\n\nDuffy called the president’s offered bonuses \"brilliant\" while stopping short of guaranteeing them.\n\n\"The air traffic controllers who didn't miss a day, they came for every scheduled shift that they had. They should get a bonus,\" said Duffy, adding that the exact amount would be contingent on an analysis. He called the workers \"patriots\" and said they should be invited to the White House to receive their checks.\n\nHe also stopped short of telling workers who failed to show up not to return.\n\n\"I'm concerned about those controllers. I'm concerned about their dedication. I'm concerned about their patriotism,\" the secretary said. \"We haven't made a decision, but we are going to look at those controllers.\"\n\n— Michael Loria\n\nLawmakers face one last hurdle to end shutdown: Flying to DC\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson needs enough members of the House of Representatives to return to Washington by Wednesday night to vote to reopen the government. The shutdown is causing travel issues so widespread that those very lawmakers may not all get back to D.C. in time to do their jobs.\n\nFor nearly two months, many House members have been residing in their districts while the speaker kept them away from Washington and their day jobs. The pressure tactic was meant to force Democratic senators into reopening the government without major concessions from Republicans.\n\nBy Sunday, when lawmakers in the Senate finally reached a bipartisan deal to end the historic crisis, nearly half of all domestic flights were either canceled or delayed. It didn't take long for Johnson to shift his marching orders.\n\n\"You need to begin, right now, returning to the Hill,\" he said in a message to lawmakers Monday morning. \"We have to do this as quickly as possible.\" Read more here.\n\n— Zachary Schermele\n\n'We have to live today': Duffy promises modernization of air traffic tech\n\nAmong goals for the FAA under Duffy, the transportation secretary promised to modernize equipment air traffic controllers use.\n\n\"Air traffic controllers need brand new equipment,\" said Duffy, noting air traffic controllers are still using paper flight strips, which he called \"great 1985 technology\" but outdated. \"It’s a blast from the past but we should live today and technology from today.\"\n\nCongress has allocated $12.5 billion to the FAA, said Duffy, short of the $31.5 billion he says is needed for the program he envisions.\n\nIn addition to changing to digital flight strips, the secretary said he wants to build a digital platform for managing the skies. Duffy estimated the program would take more than three years. He said the agency would likely look to hire a private company for the project.\n\n\"The FAA does a great job at safety, they don't know how to build,\" Duffy said. We’re going to have radios, new voice switches, new radar, new telecom, we’re going to have to switch from analog to digital.\"\n\n— Michael Loria\n\nWhen can air traffic controllers expect to be paid after the government shutdown ends?\n\nAir traffic controllers will receive 70% of their back pay within 24 to 48 hours after the government reopens, with the remaining 30% arriving about a week later, Duffy said at a news conference on Nov. 11.\n\n\"They’re going to get money in their bank accounts very quickly,\" he said, thanking Congress for ensuring controllers are \"made whole\" after working without pay during the shutdown.\n\nShortages of air traffic controllers are one of the key reasons the FAA ordered flight reductions at 40 airports across the nation starting Nov. 7. He said the FAA is still short about 2,000 air traffic controllers.\n\nDuffy urges House to act and vote to end the government shutdown\n\nDuring a news conference in Chicago, Duffy urged the House to follow the Senate and vote to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nIf the House doesn't act and the government remains shuttered, Duffy warned of dire consequences for the nation's air traffic system. Some airlines, he said, may choose to ground their fleets.\n\n\"If the House doesn’t pass this bill, I think you’re going to look at Saturday, Sunday, and Monday as tiddlywinks. It was beautiful. It’s going to get much worse than that.\"\n\nDuffy said Tuesday the travel system is slowly stabilizing after a chaotic weekend of delays and cancellations caused by air traffic controller shortages during the government shutdown.\n\n\"Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were very rough travel days,\" he said, \"however, today has been a much better day.\"\n\n\"I don’t have a crystal ball for you, but I can tell you what we’re seeing with all of our equities, there will be real disruption,\" Duffy said when asked by a reporter about massive disruptions that may be ahead if the government doesn't reopen.\n\nDelta, Southwest continue with planned cancellations\n\nIn an update Tuesday, Delta Air Lines said its operations remained stable amid air traffic control constraints. The airline noted that it expects to \"operate the vast majority\" of its flight schedule and continues to coordinate with the FAA.\n\n\"Planned FAA-directed cancellations are complete through Nov. 13,\" the airline said. \"Additional delays and cancels may be necessary if Air Traffic Control constraints continue in the National Airspace System.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Southwest Airlines has said it reduced its flight schedule through Wednesday across 34 airports. According to the airline, the majority of customers' flights have not been disrupted.\n\n\"For Tuesday, we removed roughly 155 flights from the schedule, and 145 on Wednesday to meet the FAA’s requirements,\" the airline said. \"International flights are exempt from the restrictions.\"\n\nUnited CEO thanks employees for work during historic flight cuts\n\nUnited Airlines CEO Scott Kirby thanked employees on Tuesday for working through the weekend as the company cut hundreds of flights in response to the FAA directive.\n\nKirby said the weekend, during which flight delays topped 10,000, saw more FAA staffing triggers than ever before. Despite the disruptions, Kirby said the company saw some of the highest net promoter scores, which measure how likely a customer is to promote United to their friends, family or colleagues, since 2022.\n\n“It's clear that the way that you have come together to take care of our customers has made an impact and is a genuine reflection of Good Leads The Way,\" Kirby wrote in his letter to employees.\n\nCan you cancel your flight and get a refund?\n\nThe four major airline operators in the U.S. – Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and American Airlines – have canceled hundreds of flights to adhere to the FAA's reduction demands.\n\nThe good news for stressed travelers? All four carriers have nixed the usual fines and fees that would apply to last-minute changes and cancellations, even for tickets that are usually non-refundable.\n\nAnd smaller mainland U.S. airlines, including JetBlue, Alaska/Hawaiian Airlines, Spirit, and Frontier, are taking a cue from the big four, offering similar fee-free changes and cancellations. Here's what to know about how to change or cancel your trip.\n\n— Mary Walrath-Holdridge\n\nIncoming atmospheric river storm will cause more flight problems\n\nFolks flying through or to California are in for a rough ride this week, weather forecasters cautioned.\n\nAir – and road – travelers will likely confront weather delays in the West, including California, as a potent atmospheric river storm slams the region late Wednesday and on Thursday.\n\nIn California, travelers should anticipate hazardous road and air travel throughout the state, AccuWeather warned, which added that \"the combination of drenching rain, heavy mountain snow and strong winds will likely cause transportation delays, affect freight and airline operations, and increase risks of power interruptions and mudslides.\"\n\nHeavy snow will wreak road havoc in the mountains, while coastal and valley areas see heavy, potentially flooding rain and even mudslides. All the airports in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas are forecast to see rain, potentially sparking delays and cancellations.\n\nMeanwhile, travelers in the East will continue to endure heavy snow near the Great Lakes and frigid cold as far south as Florida.\n\n— Doyle Rice\n\nWill 'unprecedented' flight disruptions impact Thanksgiving travel plans?\n\nThough mandated flight cuts impact 40 of the nation's airports and air carriers are mainly cutting service through their regional partners, meaning flights between large hubs and smaller cities and towns are most likely to be affected, the entire system has become discombobulated. The effects are likely to stretch into the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n\"Typically, with a storm, one airline can recover operations within 48 to 72 hours after the weather event has finished ‒ but that’s when one hub is impacted,\" Tiffany Funk, co-founder and president of the travel-tech company point.me, said. \"This is unprecedented, and it's also storm season. I don't think we'll see equal recovery. Airports will come online at different rates, which means airlines won't be equally impacted.\"\n\nAirlines for America, the industry’s main trade group, warned that “more than 3.5 million passengers have experienced delays or cancellations because of air-traffic-control staffing concerns since the shutdown began,” calling the situation “not sustainable” with an all-time-high 31 million passengers expected between Nov. 21 and Dec. 1.\n\n— Zach Wichter\n\nThe next step to reopening the government could come on Wednesday\n\nThe House of Representatives could begin voting as early as 4 p.m. on Nov. 12 to approve legislation reopening the government and sending it to Trump for his signature. The House vote is the next step to reopening the government, which would begin the process of getting flight traffic back on track.\n\nThe Senate voted Nov. 10 on a funding patch through Jan. 30. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, notified lawmakers to return to the Capitol by Nov. 12, when the chamber will reconvene at noon. Multiple series of votes are expected. The House often votes on motions such as whether to adjourn or reconsider legislation before voting to finally approve a contentious bill.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nIf you're traveling this week, here's what to expect\n\nDespite the government shutdown expected to come to a close, travelers should still brace for delays and cancellations in the coming days.\n\n“I would expect really bumpy operations and pretty brutal travel experiences, at least throughout the week,” said Tiffany Funk, co-founder and president of point.me, which specializes in points-based travel. “Even if funding were magically restored today, this is going to take a long time to reset.”\n\nThe longer the cancellations and flight disruptions continue, the longer it will take to restore, experts told USA TODAY, and the pace of recovery could vary at different airports and across airlines. Air traffic controllers, whose work can include long hours and mandated overtime, may not immediately return to work in full force.\n\nIn the meantime, Ahmed Abdelghany, associate dean for research at the David B. O'Maley College of Business at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, recommended travelers keep an eye on their flight’s status via the airline’s mobile app or website, and get to the airport “well in advance” in case there are long waits at security. He said it’s worth considering rebooking options – if flyers can travel at another time – and purchasing travel insurance, which may reimburse some costs if there are hiccups. And if you don't have to travel now, consider putting it off.\n\n— Eve Chen\n\nThe essential, invisible work of air traffic controllers\n\nBefore the government shutdown, the nation's air traffic control system included just under 11,000 fully certified controllers – 30% fewer than the government says we need. That meant controllers were already consistently working six days a week, up to 10 hours a day on mandatory overtime, with vacations strictly limited.\n\n\"This situation creates substantial distractions for individuals who are already engaged in extremely stressful work,\" Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association union, said in a statement. \"The financial and mental strain increases risks within the National Airspace System, making it less safe with each passing day of the shutdown.\"\n\nBecoming a certified controller takes years of training, usually starting at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City, followed by several years of closely supervised on-the-job practice.\n\nAir traffic controller applicants need to meet vision and health standards, get mental-health assessments and commit to a high-stakes, high-stress job that's physically isolated from the travelers they serve every day. They need to be prepared to deal with midair fires, hijacking reports or medical emergencies at 36,000 feet or just feet from the terminal.

For the latest updates on the snow and frigid temperatures, follow USA TODAY's coverage for Thursday, Jan. 23.\n\nPENSACOLA, Fla. − Light snow fell on this panhandle city Wednesday as the last remnant of an unprecedented, deadly storm rolled out to sea after smashing snow records from here to New Orleans and casting a blanket of ice across a region not targeted by such a severe wintry assault in generations.\n\nThe storm's impact will be felt for days in cities in the South unaccustomed to the deep freeze that has gripped most of the nation this week. About 20 million people across the region were under winter weather advisories and warnings, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe Florida capital of Tallahassee, which usually gets temperatures in the 60s at this time of year, is expecting an overnight low of 20 degrees. Sleet and snow-topped 2 inches in at least one location in Tallahassee, according to preliminary snowfall estimates from the National Weather Service in Tallahassee.\n\n“This has been the worst winter storm to hit the Gulf Coast in decades,\" AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter said.\n\nThe dig-out, so common in the nation's northern tier, was underway in earnest from Texas to Florida while challenged by a dearth of snow plows. Residents were urged not to travel on the iced-over roadways, and temperatures were expected to linger around freezing into Thursday.\n\nThe storm began its march Tuesday in Texas, blanketing highways and snarling traffic before making its way east. Neighboring Louisiana saw it first-ever blizzard warning. New Orleans International Airport recorded 8 inches of snow, triple the previous record set more than 60 years ago, the National Weather Service reported. Records fell in Alabama, and parts of Mississippi were hit with almost a foot of snow.\n\nIn Florida, the Pensacola area broke the state's 130-year-old record for total snowfall. The National Weather Service reported 8.9 inches in Pensacola and 9.8 inches in Milton, both breaking the previous Florida record of 4 inches set in 1954.\n\n\"We plead with our with our residents to continue to stay off the road,\" Pensacola Mayor D.C.

And in Georgia, Emergency Management Agency/Homeland Security Director Chris Stallings said a \"critical needs\" patient went outside and died of hypothermia.\n\nA 19-year-old was killed Wednesday afternoon when his vehicle overturned into the icy waters of Cross Creek in North Carolina, according to the Fayetteville Police Department. Police spokesperson Rickelle Harrell said the weather conditions contributed to the crash and speed was not a factor.\n\nSnow in Florida's capital city a 'once-in-a-lifetime experience'\n\nThe storm brought a rare snow day to Tallahassee, shutting down practically the entire city and giving people a chance to throw snowballs or sleighs down a hill — some for the first time.\n\nLocal schools, universities, and state, local government agencies and Tallahassee International Airport had already planned to close for the day. But the sleet and snowstorm rendered Tallahassee an utter ghost town. Nearly every business in town closed, at least for the first part of the day, before a beaming sun began to melt some of the ice.\n\nOutside, the usual traffic noise of honking horns and screeching tires was replaced by the sound of laughter as kids and the young-hearted alike played outside. The Flom sisters, Pandora, 18, and Kalliope, 15, rigged cardboard boxes with exercise bands to race down a frozen hill at Lafayette Park in Midtown.\n\n\"It’s hard to comprehend that this is going to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” the older sister said as she wiped ice from her smile.\n\n— Jeff Burlew, Douglas Soule, Ana Goñi-Lessan, and Elena Barrera, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nSnow collapses old Civic Center in Mobile, Alabama\n\nThe roof of the Civic Center in Mobile, Alabama, a building that was in the process of being demolished, collapsed under the weight of the snow Wednesday morning, the city said in a Facebook post.\n\n\"The collapse occurred in a manner consistent with the plans for the building’s ongoing demolition,'' the city said. \"Fortunately, there were no injuries, and the mosaic murals were undamaged.''\n\nThe port city received 7 1/2 inches of snow Tuesday as part of the massive storm hitting the Gulf Coast states. WKRG-TV showed drone footage of the collapsed roof in a building whose demolition started in September.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nTallahassee sees a winter Waffle House indicator\n\nIn Florida, Tallahassee police have advised residents to stay off icy roads. But a handful of brave patrons made their way to one local Waffle House on Wednesday morning – bundled up, clutching fresh cups of coffee to warm their hands for the walk back home. The full menu wasn't available, but Tallahassee's Waffle Houses were serving the \"Emergency Bowl Menu.\"\n\nCustomers could enjoy a bacon, egg and cheese bowl with their hash browns. Best known for being an indicator of how severe a hurricane threat is, the Waffle House easily withstood the Florida winter storm threat in Tallahassee.\n\nWaffle House said the limited menu is designed to accommodate lower staffing levels and to serve guests quickly. The chain's website shows eight 24-hour locations in and around the city.\n\n− Kyla A. Sanford, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nFor Houston resident, snow makes her feel 'like a kid inside'\n\nNot since elementary school had retired truck driver Thelma Foster seen the snow fall the way it did Monday night in Houston.\n\n\"I just started feeling all warm like a kid inside,\" Foster, 55, told USA TODAY.\n\nFoster was prepared for any possible power outages with portable generators and camping heaters from her planning for Hurricane Beryl last year. She's staying off the roads and has spent the last few days enjoying the powdery snow from her apartment window with coffee in hand, wrapped in a blanket. This, she said, is the best way to take in the frigid weather.\n\n\"I've been taking in every moment,\" Foster said. \"I've really enjoyed it.\"\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\nStorm will be costly to businesses\n\nAccuWeather issued a preliminary estimate of $14-$17 billion across the South for total damage and economic loss from the snow, ice and extreme cold. Porter noted that businesses have been forced to shut down, in some cases for days, and supply chain and shipping logistics have been severely disrupted.\n\n\"With the cold remaining in place, the impacts and interruptions from this winter storm will be felt for days to come,\" Porter said.\n\nConcern for the homeless in Pensacola\n\nIn Pensacola, transit bus drivers provided free transportation to area cold weather shelters that made room for record numbers of people. Waterfront Mission staff moved all the furniture out of its lobby to make room for emergency cots and pallets.\n\nPensacola police have been reaching out to people who stay in camps or on the streets asking whether they need help or a ride to a shelter. For those who refuse, police offer them donated blankets and sleeping bags.\n\n“We have officers out there patrolling, and if they're contacted by anyone that wants assistance, we're going to transport them to any shelter that's available that's open,” officer Gregory Gordon said. “We're going to get them off streets.”\n\nStunning snowfall totals sweep across South\n\nBabbie, Alabama, 100 miles northeast of Pensacola, claimed the region's highest snow total with 11.5 inches reported, according to the National Weather service snowfall report. Lafayette, Louisiana, checked in at 10.5 inches.\n\nMilton led the way in Florida, but several locations reported 9 inches − as did Cordele, Georgia, 160 miles south of Atlanta. In Texas, La Porte outside Houston recorded 6 inches, and in Mississippi, Evanston reported 5 1/2 inches.\n\nStill, a more likely community topped the weather service list: 48 inches fell in Rodman, N.Y.\n\nStorm brings havoc to air travel\n\nAir travelers are continuing to feel the effects of a rare winter storm that swept across the Southeast on Tuesday and Wednesday. More than 1,800 U.S. flights were canceled and another 3,100 others were delayed as of 4:30 p.m. ET Wednesday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nThose cancellations include hundreds of flights to and from George Bush Intercontinental and William P. Hobby airports in Houston, which both planned to resume operations later Wednesday after temporarily suspending them for the storm. Cities such as New Orleans, Charleston, South Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida, were also seeing major cancellations. Read more here.\n\n− Zach Wichter and Eve Chen\n\nWhat are your rights? What happens if your flight is delayed or canceled?\n\nGenerational storm slams Gulf Coast – and 'there are no plows'\n\nThe snowstorm currently lashing the Gulf Coast – which included the first-ever blizzard warning in Louisiana – is being described as a once-in-a-generation weather event, the National Weather Service said Monday. How rare is snow for some of these Southern cities?\n\n\"This will be the most significant winter storm the Greater Houston area has experienced since at least 1960,\" the weather service in Houston said.\n\nElsewhere, New Orleans hasn't seen measurable snowfall since 2009. And it has been 35 years for Jacksonville.\n\n\"This will be an historic snowfall for the Gulf Coast,\" noted meteorologist Paul Douglas on X, who added that in many parts of that region, \"there are no plows – they will pretty much wait for the snow to melt (which happens later this week).\" Read more here.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nHow rare is this Southern snowstorm? Texas, Louisiana, Florida blanketed by snow\n\nRare snow in Louisiana is a thrill for this family\n\nFor 21-year-old meteorology student Gabriel Hebert, a once-in-a-lifetime winter storm in his hometown of Lafayette, Louisiana, isn't just a snow day, but a great learning opportunity.\n\n\"I'm so thrilled,\" he told USA TODAY. \"This is my favorite kind of weather.\"\n\nHebert had been monitoring the storm for a few days, staying up late to track snowfall. In preparation, his family left open their cabinets to prevent pipes from freezing, have all agreed to stay off the roads and stocked up on essential food for the days ahead.\n\n\"We don't know how to prepare for anything like this,\" Hebert said. As the snow fell and his family bunkered down, his young siblings relished the first. \"I just want to enjoy this time with my family, watching them make snow angels and snowmen,\" he said.\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\nIn New Orleans, 'taking time to really sit and enjoy it'\n\nNew Orleans resident Claire Spenard has had her fair share of snow days from her time growing up in Rochester, New York. At first, she thought the weather predictions of a frozen landscape in the South were a hoax. Now watching schools and major highways close, she regrets failing to buy a shovel before the storm hit.\n\n“It reminds me of being home, and I never thought I would say that,” Spenard told USA TODAY.\n\nThe 23-year-old ballet teacher and server described a ghost town of a city sprinkled with excited children seeing snow for the first time, making snowmen and walking in the middle of roads untouched by cars.\n\nHer advice for those not used to braving the cold? Yield to the occasional vehicle and soak up the wonder.\n\n“Sit and watch, 'cause it’s really beautiful,'' Spenard said. \"And I think that’s what a lot of people here are doing, they’re taking time to really sit and enjoy it, 'cause that’s what people in New Orleans do about most things.”\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\nContributing: Troy Moon, Edward Bunch III, and Tom McLaughlin, Pensacola News Journal; Jeff Burlew, William L.

Here's what could be coming.", "text": "Jan. 19, 2025 Updated Jan. 20, 2025, 5:04 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump intends to start his second White House term with a bang through a flurry of executive orders and directives that leave no doubt a major transformation is underway.\n\n\"Shock and awe,\" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., recently predicted after Republicans members of Congress received a preview of the activity to come.\n\nConvinced he has an election \"mandate\" from American voters, Trump is planning to surpass the century mark in executive actions over his first few days of office after getting sworn in as the 47th president on Monday ‒ a moment he's called a \"liberation day for America.\"\n\n\"There will be over 100 executive actions ‒ commands to the bureaucracies to change their ways,\" Stephen Miller, Trump's incoming deputy chief of staff for policy, told Fox News last week.\n\nThe orders will bypass Congress to undo President Joe Biden's policies ranging from climate to diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce while carrying out Trump's campaign promises to secure the southern border, expand domestic energy production and target transgender Americans.\n\nMany of the actions will be controversial and draw protests from Democrats and others on the political left. Some orders, particularly involving immigration, are expected to invite lawsuits.\n\nIt could be a busy few days and weeks of signatures from Trump, who has also also promised \"major pardons\" for people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHere's a look at some of the executive actions that Trump and his top advisers have signaled the incoming president might take:\n\nReinstating Title 42\n\nOn the immigration front, Trump has talked about a series of orders he would issue on \"Day 1\" to seal the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings have in recent weeks fallen to record lows.\n\nThat includes executive action to revive Title 42 authority to quickly expel asylum-seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTitle 42 is an emergency public health law that both the Trump and Biden administrations used during the COVID pandemic to justify turning back migrants and asylum-seekers who crossed the border illegally. Biden ended the policy in 2023.\n\nWhat the incoming Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nMass deportations\n\nOne of Trump's signatures campaign promises is to carry out \"mass deportations\" of immigrants who are in the country unlawfully.\n\nTo carry out his sweeping plans, Trump has suggested he would expand the authority of immigration agents and use the U.S. military. The expected moves have already generated pushback from Democrats.\n\nEnding birthright citizenship\n\nTrump has also promised to end birthright citizenship on Day 1 of his presidency ‒ and will do so through executive action \"if we can\" ‒ likely setting up a constitutional legal fight.\n\nBirthright citizenship refers to anyone born in the U.S. being considering a U.S. citizen based on the 14th Amendment, which says \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"\n\nIf he decides he can't end birthright citizenship through executive action because of constitutional constraints, Trump would seemingly have to pursue an amendment to the Constitution, which would require support from two-thirds of Congress and ratification from three-fourths of state legislatures.\n\nBorder wall and empowering local law enforcement\n\nTrump has promised to restart construction of the border fence at the U.S.-Mexico border, an original staple of his first term policy agenda that the Biden administration halted.\n\nAbout 452 miles of barriers along the southern border were constructed during Trump's presidency, but only 40 miles of wall were placed where a barrier didn't previously exist.\n\nTrump advisers also have signaled plans to direct the federal government to more aggressively use 287(g) ‒ a federal program that empowers local law enforcement to carry out some immigration enforcement duties.\n\nTrump turned to the federal program often in his first term. Biden campaigned on ending the Trump-era agreements during his 2020 campaign. Although Biden did not embrace the program at the same level as Trump, immigration activists have accused Biden of not fulfilling his original pledge.\n\nTariffs\n\nTrump has promised major new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China on his first day in office.\n\nThree weeks after his election victory, Trump said one of his first executive orders would be to sign all the necessary paperwork to levy a 25% tariff on all products arriving from Canada and Mexico.\n\nTrump said he plans to levy an additional 10% tariff on top of existing tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States.\n\nHe's said the tariffs on goods from the neighboring country's are in response to \"thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before.\"\n\nTikTok\n\nWith a ban on TikTok going into effect over the weekend, Trump said he plans to issue a Day 1 executive order to ensure the wildly popular social media app can continue to operate.\n\nTrump on Sunday said he will issue an order extending the period before the sell-or-ban TikTok law goes into effect \"so we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\n\"The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nAfter going dark in the U.S. on Saturday, TikTok responded to Trump's commitment with a statement that said it is \"in the process of restoring service.\" TikTok thanked Trump for providing \"clarity and assurance\" to service providers that they won't face penalties for making the platform available.\n\nBiden signed bipartisan legislation in April banning TikTok if Beijing-based parent company ByteDance did not sell off its U.S. assets by Sunday. Biden cited national security concerns with the app ‒ which some fear the Chinese government could exploit to gain access to private user data or spread misinformation.\n\nAlthough Trump now wants to keep TikTok operating, he tried to ban TikTok by executive order in 2020 during his first term.\n\n'Drill, baby, drill' agenda\n\nTrump, who campaigned on a mantra of \"drill, baby, drill,\" is expected to take multiple executive actions aimed at fulfilling his pro-oil agenda to boost the production of domestic energy, even as it's already at an all-time high.\n\nTrump has promised to swiftly overturn Biden's recent action to ban offshore drilling on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. He also wants to reopen drilling for oil in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nAmong several moves expected in the energy sector, the incoming president has said he will create a new National Energy Council to \"oversee the path to U.S. energy dominance.\" The new council will be led by former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump's nominee for secretary of the Department of Interior. But how the council will be structured, staffed and operate hasn't been detailed.\n\nEliminating the 'electric vehicle mandate'\n\nTrump has talked repeatedly about eliminating Biden's so-called \"electric vehicle mandate,\" referring to an Environmental Protection Agency rule that requires auto manufacturers to cut greenhouse gas emissions by half in new light- and medium-duty vehicles beginning in 2027.\n\nThe EPA estimates that auto manufacturers may choose to build electric vehicles for about 30% to 56% of their new light-duty vehicles by 2032 and 20% to 32% of new medium duty vehicles.\n\nBiden has used the federal government to accelerate the transition to clean-energy electric vehicles. Trump has pledged to undo the efforts.\n\nEnding natural gas export ban\n\nTrump has said he will take executive action to end the Biden administration's pause on issuing new permits for projects aimed at exporting liquified natural gas.\n\nLike the emissions guidelines, it's among several rules issued by the Biden administration to combat climate change, which Trump has called a \"hoax.\"\n\nA Louisiana federal judge in July ruled the Biden administration cannot halt issuing permits for such projects. The Justice Department appealed the decision.\n\n'Transgender lunacy'\n\nTrump has promised first-day action taking aim at rights for transgender people, including making it the official policy of the U.S. government to recognize only two genders: males and females.\n\n\"With the stroke of my pen, on Day 1, we're going to stop the transgender lunacy,\" Trump said in a speech last month in Phoenix.\n\nTrump said he will sign executive orders to end \"child sexual mutilation,\" get transgender people out of the military and public schools, and to keep athletes born male biologically from participating in women's sports.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House voted Tuesday to pass a bill that would ban transgender women and girls from participating in women's and girls' school sports, but it's unclear if the legislation can garner 60 Senate votes and eventually make it to Trump's desk for signature into law.\n\nDEI in the federal government\n\nTrump has signaled he will take action to overturn Biden-era policies aimed at diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, in the federal government.\n\n\"I'll end all of the Marxist diversity, equity and inclusion policies across the entire federal government immediately,\" Trump said last month.\n\nDEI in business and government has become a top target of Republicans. In his first year in the White House, Biden signed an executive order that established procedures to ensure diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility are priorities in building the federal workforce.\n\nIn-person work for federal employees\n\nTrump and his top advisers have signaled possible executive action directing federal employees to return to working in-person.\n\n\"He's going to bring workers back to their offices,\" Miller said. \"He's going to end the travesty in which federal workers are pretending to work but are not actually working. They're at home watching Netflix while you're paying their salaries.\"\n\nTrump has said he will fire any federal employees who don't physically return to their offices once his new administration begins. He also pledged to challenge in court a Biden agreement allowing Social Security Administration employees to work remotely.\n\nWork-from-home policies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic remain in place for some federal workers.\n\nEnd funding to 'radical left NGOs'\n\nMiller said Trump will take action to stop federal funding for \"radical left NGOs,\" though he did not specify which entities would be targeted.\n\nNGOs, or non-governmental operations, refers to nonprofit organizations that receive federal funding.\n\nBiden used executive authority to overturn a Trump executive order for a so-called \"global gag rule\" that prevented federal aid from going to foreign organizations that provide abortion services or information.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/29/ice-immigration-raids-trump-administration/78000782007/", "title": "Where are ICE raids, other immigration arrests happening? What to ...", "text": "Updated Jan. 29, 2025, 3:08 p.m. ET\n\n(This article was updated to include new information.)\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration has taken center stage in the first days of his second term, from his sweeping order on birthright citizenship to the growing number of raids across the country.\n\nThe Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency is even publicizing its daily total of arrests, which added up to 3,104 in the past three days alone and more than 4,500 since Thursday.\n\nStricter enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws isn't a new development. President Joe Biden’s administration deported more than 271,000 people last year, the largest number since 2014, according to an ICE report.\n\nThe president has repeatedly said his administration will prioritize deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal histories. In recent days, some local officials have emphasized that focus.\n\nAustin Police Chief Lisa Davis said “at the end of the day, these are people APD would be looking for as well. They were wanted for violent offenses.”\n\nStill, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked at a news briefing how many of those arrested by ICE since Trump returned to power actually have criminal records.\n\n“All of them, because they illegally broke our nation’s laws and therefore they are criminals as far as this administration goes,’’ Leavitt said.\n\nHere's the USA TODAY Network's look at states that have seen major immigration actions in recent days.\n\nTexas\n\nThe state sharing the largest border with Mexico figured to be the site of multiple raids, and those were carried out last weekend in cities like Houston, San Antonio, Austin and Laredo, among others, according to the Austin American-Statesman. The newspaper pointed out other federal agencies besides ICE were also involved, including the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nNo arrest totals were immediately available, but Texas Public Radio reported 84 ICE arrests in the Dallas metropolitan area.\n\nDavis, Austin's police chief, said while her department was not involved in the operations, federal officials told her they focused on “wanted violent offenders.’’ Jorge Vela, a defense lawyer in the city who has represented clients accused of committing violent crimes while in the U.S. illegally, said that’s common practice.\n\n“This is nothing new so far from what I have seen,’’ Vela told the American-Statesman. “It’s just that more resources are being devoted to that, and this feels like an initial show of force.’’\n\nStart your day informed: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.\n\nColorado\n\nAgents from a handful of federal agencies combined to arrest more than 40 people in the country illegally early Sunday during a raid in Adams County, the local office of the Drug Enforcement Administration said.\n\nThe office shared on social media the operation targeted “drug trafficking & members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA). Drugs, weapons, and cash were seized in Adams County. Nearly 50 illegal aliens were taken into custody.’’\n\nKDVR-TV reported the investigation that led to the raid began under the Biden administration. Several media reports indicate federal authorities are zeroing on nearby Aurora, which Trump claimed was overrun by Venezuelan gangs during the presidential campaign.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago officials said on Tuesday at least 100 people have been detained as immigration-related operations ramped up across the country.\n\n\"We don't have an exact number of Chicago people who have been detained, but what I can tell you is that the number in the Chicagoland area exceeds 100,\" said Chicago Police Department Superintendent Larry Snelling at a news conference Tuesday, adding that arrests have occurred in the city as well as surrounding suburbs.\n\nSnelling – who reiterated that Chicago officers will not assist federal immigration officers – did not describe the operations in detail but said he received notification before the detentions took place. He indicated the arrests appear to be targeted, saying \"We have not seen federal agents running through Chicago, looking for children, going to work locations and grabbing people.\"\n\nAt least one of the raids was attended by \"border czar\" Tom Homan and television personality Dr. Phil, who documented an arrest on a live stream.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson criticized what he called the Trump administration's \"desire to popularize fear\" and said \"We will continue to protect civil and human rights, and we welcome all individuals and families who want to work, live and thrive here in our beloved city.\"\n\nFlorida\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee, in collaboration with the Florida Highway Patrol, detained 12 suspected undocumented immigrants Tuesday in Jefferson County, the Tallahassee Democrat reported.\n\nThe FHP posted photos of the operation, saying, “We are ready and willing to follow the governor’s lead and work with federal partners to execute the Trump illegal immigration mandate!’’\n\nOn Sunday, the ICE office in Miami said it had separately arrested a Nicaraguan resident and a Jamaican resident on multiple charges.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nIn Newark, ICE agents raiding a local business without a warrant Thursday detained not only undocumented immigrants but American citizens as well, Mayor Ras Baraka said.\n\n“One of the detainees is a U.S. military veteran who suffered the indignity of having the legitimacy of his military documentation questioned,” Baraka said.\n\nOfficials in New Jersey, which has nearly half a million undocumented residents and about 2 million immigrants in all, frequently clashed with Trump’s administration during his first term. Some appear ready for another round.\n\nBaraka said Newark won’t “stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorized,” the Star-Ledger reported.\n\nNew York\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem joined immigration officers as they arrested several people in New York City this week, posting several videos and photos of the operations on social media.\n\n\"Arresting some criminal aliens this morning in NYC – thank you to the brave officers involved,\" Noem said in several posts on X. \"Criminal alien with kidnapping, assault & burglary charges is now in custody – thanks to ICE. Dirtbags like this will continue to be removed from our streets.\"\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams said the city worked with the Department of Homeland Security to nab Anderson Zambrano-Pacheco, 26, who officials say has alleged ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Adams said he was \"hiding\" in New York City and was connected with \"multiple violent crimes,\" including burglary, kidnapping, extortion, firearms possession and menacing with a firearm among other charges.\n\nOfficials also said Zambrano-Pacheco was one of several men, including members of Tren de Aragua, who was shown in security footage at an Aurora apartment complex that gained national attention last year.\n\n\"As I have repeatedly said, we will not hesitate to partner with federal authorities to bring violent criminals to justice – just as we have done for years,\" Adams said in a post on X.\n\nIn Westchester County on Tuesday, the Sleepy Hallow Police Department received a notice from ICE that immigration officers would in the area to serve a warrant for \"two specific individuals,\" reported the Journal News/lohud.\n\n\"The agent did not state or imply that there would be a 'mass round-up,'\" Sleepy Hollow Police Chief Anthony Bueti said in a statement. \"Instead, they were in Sleepy Hollow for the two individuals with a criminal past.\"\n\nCalifornia\n\nFederal agencies working in California pledged cooperation in immigration enforcement operations and posted photos on social media of people being taken into custody.\n\n“The DEA, along with @TheJusticeDept, is assisting @DHSgov and other federal law enforcement partners w their immigration enforcement efforts. Today, our agents conducted enhanced targeted operations throughout L.A,’’ the agency’s local office said on social media Sunday, adding photos of officers.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security Investigations in L.A. posted a similar message, saying agencies including the FBI are “conducting enhanced law enforcement operations in accordance with directives from the administration and in alignment with its established priorities #immigration.’’\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration field office in San Diego said the agency was assisting other federal agencies with immigration enforcement in a post on X that included several photos of officers detaining people.\n\nMeanwhile, state and local officials throughout the state have notified their constituents of operations by immigration authorities.\n\nCalifornia state Sen. Scott Weiner said in a post on X that \"ICE went to downtown SF office buildings\" on Friday, referring to the city of San Francisco.

In Portland, Oregon, masked officers clashed with protesters wearing inflatable animal costumes. In the nation's capital, police set up checkpoints and troops patrolled the streets.\n\nSince early June, President Donald Trump has surged federal resources into a growing number of Democratic-led cities as part of a widening crackdown on illegal immigration and violent crime.\n\nThe deployments have sparked intense backlash, a dizzying number of legal battles and upended daily life in communities flooded with federal agents and National Guard troops.\n\nThe Trump administration says the added resources are needed to service the president’s mass deportation campaign and clamp down on violence in liberal cities. Critics, including state and local officials, say the deployments are an illegal show of force and a power grab.\n\nAcross the country, federal operations have taken different forms, shaped by levels of cooperation between federal and local officials, protests over heightened immigration enforcement and the scale of the operations themselves.\n\nIn several cities, immigration raids touched off a wave of demonstrations, prompting Trump to call up National Guard troops. In others, federal agents worked closely with local police to target crime more broadly, setting up roving patrols and checkpoints. One major commonality: The cities all experienced a surge in immigration enforcement.\n\nReporters across the USA TODAY Network spoke with experts, residents, officials and local advocates to capture the impact of federal intervention in U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis, Portland and Chicago – a short list that seems likely to grow as the president eyes deployments to other cities.\n\nMany residents and local officials said the cities didn't need intervention, especially a deployment of troops. Some living in crime-stricken areas said while they generally support the idea of more law enforcement in their communities, they want the operations to target violent crimes – not immigration violations.\n\nExperts, meanwhile, said targeted police work is the most effective way to lower crime and worry that the federal government's flood-the-zone tactics, both in immigration enforcement and general crimefighting, could erode public trust in police.\n\n“Aggressive enforcement needs to be reserved for the most aggressive criminals,” said Thomas Abt, director of the Center for the Study and Practice of Violence Reduction. He added that broad, heavy-handed policing has “limited benefits and a lot of collateral consequences.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson hailed the president's efforts and said local leaders across the country should take inspiration and \"clean up their city.\"\n\n\"Making America Safe Again – especially crime-ridden cities – was a key campaign promise from the President that the American people elected him to fulfill,\" Jackson said in a statement.\n\nChicago: Intensifying ICE raids and widespread protests\n\nThe nation’s third-largest city has become the latest flashpoint in the battle between local officials and the Trump administration over the president's deportation campaign and federal deployments.\n\nIn September, Trump launched Operation Midway Blitz, an initiative he said was needed to catch \"the worst of the worst\" criminal immigrants. Research has shown that, on average, immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Further, immigration violations, such as living in the country without proper documentation, are civil, not criminal, under U.S. law.\n\nExpanding Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids triggered protests in downtown Chicago and the city's surrounding suburbs. As tensions boiled, clashes broke out and federal agents used pepper balls and tear gas, hitting journalists, a pastor and officers with the Chicago Police Department, according to reports and a lawsuit.\n\nThe president called for the arrests of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for “failing to protect” ICE agents.\n\nResidents and local advocates have accused ICE of employing reckless and brutal tactics during the blitz. Some incidents that have raised alarm: Immigration agents fatally shot a Mexican immigrant accused of resisting arrest; a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a U.S. citizen on the city’s South Side; and, reportedly, a school had to hold recess indoors after federal authorities deployed a chemical agent nearby.\n\nThe most controversial raid came on Sept. 30, when federal agents descended from Black Hawk helicopters and ransacked a South Side apartment building in an aggressive search of apartments inhabited by Venezuelan migrants.\n\nTwo of 37 people arrested were “confirmed” gang members, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Dozens of U.S. citizens were pulled from their beds and temporarily zip-tied during the operation, which Pritzker wants investigated by state agencies.\n\nDHS officials say aggressive tactics are necessary to catch criminals, and accused protesters of attacking agents and \"rioting.\" Over 1,500 immigrants have been arrested in connection with the blitz, the agency said. USA TODAY has not been able to verify the number of detentions or the criminal background of those in custody.\n\nChicagoans said the federal intervention has made their neighborhoods virtually unrecognizable.\n\n\"We went from being this community that walks our kids to school or goes out to parks. Now the streets are empty,\" said Corina Pedraza, a longtime South Sider.\n\nLocal alderwoman Julia Ramirez told USA TODAY that people \"can't live their lives the way they did before.\"\n\n\"Agents have created a war zone in our community,\" she said.\n\nPortland, Oregon: Tensions flare at ICE facility\n\n“War ravaged,” “burning to the ground” and “hell” are words Trump has used to describe the liberal stronghold of Portland in recent weeks – characterizations vehemently disputed by local residents and officials.\n\nThe back-and-forth comes as the president seeks to deploy troops to the city over the objections of local and state officials. A federal judge in Oregon initially blocked the deployments, but an appeals court on Oct. 20 ruled in Trump’s favor, lifting one of the orders preventing the president from calling up 200 Oregon guardsmen to Portland.\n\nTrump officials say soldiers are necessary to protect federal personnel and an ICE facility in South Portland, where demonstrators have protested on a nightly basis.\n\nOutside the facility earlier this month, USA TODAY reporters saw demonstrators peacefully protesting. There were people in puffy animal costumes dancing on the sidewalk and waving signs as motorists drove by, honking in support. Other forms of resistance have had a distinctly Portland vibe, such as an “emergency” naked bike ride in mid-October.\n\nCity residents said Trump’s characterization of Portland as a city “under siege” is false and misleading.\n\n“It offends me so deeply that we have a president that is willing and able to spread such misinformation without hitting the streets and coming out here,” said Tiana Stewart, 37, a bartender. “But he knows that the people who are watching are going to buy into it. It’s ludicrous to me.”\n\nPortland is not without its problems. Homeless camps are visible in parts of the city and drug use, especially the surge of fentanyl, is a serious concern that prompted officials to declare a 90-day state of emergency last year. But residents said they don’t think the president’s crackdown is meant to address those issues.\n\n“Obviously, this is all a scam,” said Curtis Best, 70, a retired molecular biologist. “I really believe it’s a way to militarize police and make problems in these cities … I think he just wants revenge on us. I think he just doesn't like Democrat cities, Democrat states, or its people.”\n\nMemphis: A crime-stricken city flooded with feds. Is it helping?\n\nUnlike other cities where Trump deployed National Guard troops, Memphis sits in a state led by a Republican governor who has welcomed the president’s wishes to mobilize military forces.\n\nIn September, Trump created a crime-fighting task force involving over a dozen federal agencies and the state's National Guard – a move he said was requested by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee.\n\nA week after troops were seen patrolling downtown Memphis on Oct. 10, a group of Democratic officials filed a lawsuit against Lee, claiming the deployment violated the state constitution. A judge has since denied the plaintiffs’ request to pause the deployment.\n\nIn 2024, Memphis had the highest rate of murder and other violent crimes of any large American city, according to a USA TODAY analysis of FBI data from 30 cities with more than 500,000 residents.\n\nMemphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, said he's working to steer the task force to focus on violent offenders, rather than immigration enforcement.\n\n\"The busier we can keep them with (the Memphis Police Department), the less time they will have to focus on immigration,\" he said at a town hall on Oct. 20.\n\nOfficials have given conflicting portrayals of the task force's work so far.\n\nThe White House says the task force has yielded 1,300 arrests related to outstanding warrants, drugs and firearms. But a county mayor and local advocates say a large portion of the arrests were for immigration offenses, not violent crime.\n\nMauricio Calvo, president and CEO of advocacy organization Latino Memphis, said some people have shut themselves in their homes because of the heightened immigration enforcement and concerns over racial profiling.\n\n“People don’t want to send the kids to school, people don’t want to work,” he said. “We’re in crisis mode.\"\n\nWashington, DC: Mixed feelings on Trump's crime crackdown\n\nTrump declared a “crime emergency” in the nation’s capital on Aug. 11, using its status as a federal district to take control of the city’s police department and send in thousands of federal agents and National Guard troops.\n\nFor weeks, federal agents and local police set up checkpoints across the city, spurring protests. Immigration raids expanded, instilling fear as officers arrested workers and delivery drivers. Several of the city’s small homeless campsites were broken down, leading some of the homeless to enter shelters temporarily.\n\nMeanwhile, National Guard troops patrolled monuments and Metro stations, some with assault rifles. They removed graffiti, picked up trash and shoveled mulch. An internal budget viewed by USA TODAY estimated the guard deployment could cost taxpayers more than $200 million.\n\nAfter 30 days, the federal takeover of the police department ended and Trump declared the operation a success, touting a drop in reported crimes and anecdotes of people “going out to dinner where they didn’t go out for years.”\n\nThe data, though, was murky. While local police data shows a short-term dip in some reported crimes after the crackdown began – especially incidents involving firearms – crime had already been trending downward in recent years. Experts who viewed the data said it’s too soon to know if the crackdown had any significant or long-term impact on violent crime.\n\nAcross the city, residents were conflicted about the federal operation.\n\nFor 20 years, Charles Wilson has lived in Anacostia, a neighborhood with one of the highest rates of murder and violent crime in Washington. He said while he has not seen a surge of federal agents in his neighborhood, he’s noticed fewer people loitering and he doesn’t hear as many “random gunshots.”\n\n“There’s definitely been a shift, and things feel a little calmer and a little safer,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nBut Wilson also said the assertive immigration enforcement in Washington, some of which has gone viral online, \"doesn't sit well\" with him or his neighbors.\n\n\"It seems un-American and mean-spirited,\" he said.\n\nLos Angeles: Raids, protests, state of emergency\n\nLos Angeles has remained one of the central targets of Trump’s sweeping illegal immigration campaign and was the first American city where he deployed National Guard troops in his second term in office.\n\nFollowing ICE raids at a Home Depot and a clothing manufacturer in June, thousands of people took to the streets to protest. While demonstrations were contained to a few downtown blocks, they erupted into violence, with clashes breaking out between protesters and police, and reports of looting and property damage.\n\nTrump ordered 4,000 California National Guard troops and at least 500 Marines to protect federal personnel and property in the city. The move was challenged in court, and a California judge said the deployment was illegal but did not order the remaining soldiers to leave. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in September that the deployment had already cost taxpayers nearly $120 million.\n\nICE agents kept up their high pace of arrests, and in October, the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency. Local officials said the federal agency \"created a climate of fear, leading to widespread disruption in daily life and adverse impacts to our regional economy.\"\n\nOngoing immigration raids and operations across Los Angeles County – which is home to over 3 million people born outside the United States – have led to a decline in workplace attendance and strained critical services such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship, according to the board of supervisors.\n\nLupe Lopez, 69, whose family owns nine Arteagas Food Center supermarkets, told USA TODAY she’s seen a big drop in foot traffic at her family’s shop in the Hispanic neighborhood of East San Jose. The reason: Young people are buying in bulk because their parents are afraid of being outside, where they might be picked up by immigration agents.\n\n\"A lot more people are either staying closer to home or not coming out at all,” she said.\n\nChristopher Cann, Michael Loria, Suzette Hackney and Terry Collins report for USA TODAY.

It can figure out where you shop, what you buy and with whom you spend time.\n\nIt knows how much money you have, where you've worked and, in many cases, what medical procedures you've had. It can figure out if you've attended a protest or bought marijuana, and it can even read your emails if it wants.\n\nBut because all of those data points about you were scattered across dozens of federal, state and commercial databases, it wasn't easy for the government to easily build a comprehensive profile of your life.\n\nThat's changing ‒ fast.\n\nWith the help of Big Tech, in just a few short months the Trump administration has expanded the government surveillance state to a whole new level as the president and his allies chase down illegal immigrants and suspected domestic terrorists while simultaneously trying to slash federal spending they've deemed wasteful and keep foreigners from voting.\n\nAnd in doing so, privacy experts warn, the federal government is inevitably scooping up, sorting, combining and storing data about millions of law-abiding Americans. The vast data storehouses, some of which have been targeted for access by Elon Musk's DOGE teams, raise significant privacy concerns and the threat of cybersecurity breaches.\n\n\"What makes the Trump administration's approach so chilling is that they are seeking to collect and use data across federal agencies in ways that are unprecedented,\" said Cody Venzke, a senior policy counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. \"The federal government's collection of data has always been a double-edged sword.\"\n\nAmericans value their privacy\n\nAmericans have fiercely guarded and worried about their privacy even from the country's earliest days: The Constitution's Fourth Amendment specifically limits the government's ability to invade a person's privacy.\n\nThose concerns have only grown as more government functions are carried out online.\n\nA 2023 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 71% of Americans worry about the government's use of data about them, up from 64% in 2019. The survey found the concern was greatest among those people who lean or consistently vote Republican, up from 63% to 77%. The level of concern among people who lean or consistently vote Democrat remained steady at 65%, the survey found.\n\nThat same survey found that Americans overall are almost as concerned about government access to their data as they are about social media companies having access. People who had attended college were more worried about data privacy, while people with high school degrees were in general \"confident that those who have access to their personal information will do the right thing.\"\n\nIn acknowledgment of those concerns, the federal government carefully stores most data about Americans in separate databases, from Social Security payments to Medicare reimbursements, housing vouchers and food stamps. That limits the ability of government employees to surreptitiously build comprehensive profiles of Americans without court oversight.\n\nIn the name of rooting out fraud, and government inefficiency, however, President Donald Trump in March ordered federal agencies under his control to lower the walls between their data warehouses.\n\nThe Government Accounting Office estimates the federal government loses $233 billion to $521 billion to fraud annually, much of that because of improper payments to contractors or falsified medical payments, according to a GAO report in April. The report also noted significant losses via Medicare or unemployment fraud and pandemic-era stimulus payments.\n\n\"Decades of restricted data access within and between agencies have led to duplicated efforts, undetected overpayments, and unchecked fraud, costing taxpayers billions,\" President Donald Trump said in a March 20 executive order that helped create the new system. \"This executive order dismantles unnecessary barriers, promotes inter-agency collaboration, and ensures the Federal Government operates responsibly and efficiently to safeguard public funds.\"\n\nMerging of commercial and government databases\n\nSupporters say this kind of data archive, especially video surveillance coupled with AI-powered facial recognition, can also be a powerful tool to fight crime. Authorities in New Orleans used video footage collected by privately owned security cameras to help capture at least one of the fugitives in a high-profile prison escape in May.\n\nAnd systems that read license plates helped Colorado police track down a suspect accused of repeatedly vandalizing a Tesla dealership. White House authorities are now prosecuting some Tesla vandalism cases as terrorism.\n\nBut the new White House efforts go far beyond anything ever attempted in the United States, allowing the government to conduct intrusive surveillance against almost anyone by combining government and commercial databases.\n\nPrivacy experts say it's the merging of government and commercial databases that poses the most significant concern because much of it can be done without court oversight.\n\nAs part of the broader White House effort, contractors are building a $30 million system to track suspected gang members and undocumented immigrants and buying access to a system that tracks passengers on virtually every U.S.-based airline flight.\n\nAnd federal officials also are making plans to compile and share state-level voting registration information, which the president argues is necessary to prevent foreign nationals from illegally voting in federal elections.\n\nPrivacy experts say that while all of that data has long been collected and kept separate by different government agencies or private vendors ‒ like your supermarket frequent shopper card and cell phone provider ‒ the Trump administration is dramatically expanding its compilation into comprehensive dossiers on Americans. Much of the work has been kicked off by Musk's DOGE teams, with the assistance of billionaire Peter Thiel's Denver-based Palantir.\n\nOpponents say such a system could track women who cross state lines for abortions − something a police officer in Texas is accused of doing − or be abused by law enforcement to target political opponents or even stalk romantic partners. And if somehow accessed by hackers, the centralized systems would prove a trove of information for fraud or blackmail.\n\nThe nonpartisan, nonprofit Project on Government Oversight has been warning about the risks of federal surveillance expansion for years, and it noted that Democrats and Republicans alike have voted to expand such information-gathering.\n\n\"We need our leaders to recognize that as the surveillance apparatus grows, it becomes an enticing prize for a would-be autocrat,\" POGO said in a report in August 2024. \"Our country cannot build and expand a surveillance superstructure and expect that it will not be turned against the people it is meant to protect.\"\n\nStarting with immigration, ending where?\n\nTrump campaigned in 2024 on a platform of tough immigration enforcement, including large-scale deportations and ending access by undocumented people to federal programs. Immigrants' rights advocates point out that people living illegally in the United States are generally barred from federal programs, although those who have children born as U.S. citizens can often access things like food assistance or health care.\n\nSupporters say having access to that data will help them prioritize people for deportation by comparing work history and tax payments to immigration status, work that used to be far more labor-intensive.\n\nBecause federal officials don't know exactly who is living illegally in the United States, the systems by default must scoop up information about everyone first.\n\nOne example: A newly expanded program to collect biometric data from suspected illegal immigrants intercepted at sea also can be used to collect the same information on American citizens under the vague justification of \"officer safety.\" That data can be retained for up to 75 years, according to federal documents.\n\n\"It's only a matter of time before the harmful ripples from this new effort reach other groups,\" Venzke said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/01/federal-government-shutdown-trump-congress-live-updates/86442840007/", "title": "Government shutdown 2025: What to know about federal layoffs ...", "text": "Updated Oct. 1, 2025, 9:15 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON ‒ The federal government shut down at midnight as President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats blamed each other for failing to reach an agreement in a bitter standoff over funding the government.\n\nIt marks the 15th government shutdown since 1981, and there’s no immediate end in sight as congressional Democrats demand health-care policy changes that Trump and Republicans have refused to entertain.\n\nLooming over the fight is the threat of mass layoffs, with Trump saying \"vast numbers\" of federal workers could be terminated. The White House Office of Management and Budget said in a recent email that workers whose activities are “not consistent with the President’s priorities” are a target, and Vice President JD Vance told reporters that the administration will \"have to lay people off\" if a shutdown extends for weeks.\n\nThe shutdown blame game also is ratcheting up. The White House website features a clock counting the amount of time \"Democrats have shut down the government,\" while the Democratic National Committee wrote on social media early Wednesday that \"Republicans own this shutdown.\"\n\nKeep up with live coverage across the USA TODAY Network.\n\nMass federal layoffs will begin in 'a day or two,' budget chief says\n\nRuss Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told House Republicans in a private call Wednesday that mass layoffs of federal workers will begin in \"a day or two,\" according to a lawmaker on the call.\n\nVought's timeline for so-called \"reductions in force\" of federal workers comes as President Donald Trump has warned Democrats that he could choose to eliminate “vast numbers\" of federal workers under a government shutdown, which started Wednesday.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, during a briefing with reporters, did not elaborate on which federal departments could be affected but said layoffs are \"imminent.”\n\nRead more here.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nStatue of Liberty may go dark, New York governor warns\n\nThe Statue of Liberty may go dark during the federal government shutdown, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said on Wednesday.\n\nWith Lady Liberty as a backdrop, the New York Democrat stood alongside state elected officials and union representatives to call out Republicans in Washington, D.C., for the shutdown’s effects on entitlement programs, as well as closures to services and parks. This may include Liberty Island and nearby Ellis Island, the historic entry to the United States for millions of people who became Americans. Lady Liberty, dedicated nearly 140 years ago in New York Harbor, has symbolized the country’s embrace of immigrants.\n\nHochul said New York wouldn’t pay to keep the Statue of Liberty open during Washington's budget fight as the state had done before.\n\n“Today, the torch she holds — as a beacon to others, a symbol — could literally go dark,” Hochul said. “Not because of an act of God or a horrific storm, flood or hurricane. But literally because Donald Trump and Republicans in Washington forced a government shutdown.”\n\nNeither the National Park Service nor the Department of Interior immediately responded to emailed questions about keeping Liberty and Ellis islands open.\n\nDuring previous government shutdowns, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo used state funds to keep the Statue of Liberty open. The federal shutdown in 2018-19 cost about $1.5 million to keep the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, Gothamist reported.\n\nRead more here.\n\n- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWhy are lawmakers fighting over health care?\n\nRepublicans are claiming Democrats shut down the government to demand free health care for undocumented immigrants. But these migrants are largely ineligible for federal health benefits, said Leo Cuello, a professor at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy.\n\nThey don't qualify for comprehensive Medicaid coverage, Medicare or the Children's Health Insurance Program. And they can't purchase federally subsidized health plans on exchanges backed by the Affordable Care Act. There are legal immigrants on Medicaid in the United States, so-called \"qualified aliens\" who were previously eligible for Medicaid coverage.\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, they included only lawful immigrants: legal permanent residents, refugees, people granted asylum, people granted humanitarian parole including Ukrainians and Afghans, certain Cubans and Haitians; and certain victims of human trafficking and domestic violence, among others.\n\nThe new tax and spending law Trump signed in July restricts eligibility only to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents – i.e. green card holders – as well as some Cuban and Haitian immigrants.\n\nThere is no proposal to provide free health care to people living in the country illegally.\n\n– Lauren Villagran and Sarah Wire\n\nShutdown stalls case against ICE in Chicago\n\nThe shutdown has also stalled a case against the Department of Homeland Security over the agency’s immigration enforcement crackdown known as Operation Midway Blitz.\n\nThe National Immigrant Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois filed documents in federal court over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests in the Chicago area. The arrests violated a settlement agreement with ICE dating back to 2022 that barred many vehicle stops and arrests made without a warrant, according to defense attorneys.\n\nA spokesperson for the Northern District of Illinois federal court confirmed that a hearing set for Oct. 3 over potential violations to the Castañon Nava consent decree was delayed following the shutdown.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, urged the court to take up the case again: \"We urgently need the court to weigh in to hold the Trump administration accountable for its ongoing immigration raids in the Chicago area, where federal agents are detaining people, including children, without warrants or probable cause, and using increasingly violent tactics to do so.\"\n\nThe case comes as parts of the region say that Trump’s Midway Blitz amounts to a siege and as Illinois leaders fear masked federal agents will spark protests the White House will use the National Guard to quell.\n\nJeffries says Trump behaving 'erratically,' hits back over sombrero videos\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says he had not heard from the White House since congressional leaders left the property after a meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday.\n\nJeffries said Trump, who has been posting AI-generated videos of the Democratic leader in a mustache and sombrero, has been behaving \"somewhat erratically\" since the meeting and does not seem to be interested in coming up with a resolution to the government shutdown that began on Wednesday.\n\n\"It would seem to me that as the president of the United States, on the brink of a government shutdown, if you actually wanted to bring everyone together to try to get to a resolution in a common-sense, bipartisan way, that's not the type of behavior that we would see,\" Jeffries said on The Lead with Jake Tapper on CNN.\n\nVice President JD Vance told reporters at the White House earlier in the day that Trump was \"joking\" when he shared the memes that Jeffries and others have criticized as racist.\n\nBut Jeffries said he did not want to dwell on the videos. \"The broader problem is it's deeply unserious, and this is a serious moment. We need to reopen the government,\" Jeffries told CNN.\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nFirst DOGE. Now shutdown. Federal workers see tough year.\n\nIt’s been a tough year to be a federal worker.\n\nPotential widespread layoffs under the government shutdown are just the latest in a tough year for federal workers that’s already seen over 200,000 civil servants leave the workforce, according to the Partnership for Public Service.\n\nEarly cuts to the federal workforce came at the hands of Elon Musk’s \"U.S. Department of Government Efficiency”, a project Trump established on Jan. 20 to reduce spending and eliminate “waste, bloat, and insularity” in the federal bureaucracy. Among those who left were 150,000 federal workers who took the White House’s \"Fork in the Road\" buyout offer, provided early in the Trump administration.\n\nBut some are pushing back. In response to potential layoffs under the shutdown, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees on Sept. 30 filed a lawsuit challenging the administration’s threats of a mass firing saying it was designed to “inflict punishment on, and further traumatize, federal employees throughout the nation.”\n\nThese actions are a “cynical use of federal employees as a pawn in Congressional deliberations should be declared unlawful and enjoined by this Court,” the lawsuit said.\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nFederal spending cuts to Democratic states\n\nFor the second time today, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced a cut to federal funding to Democratic led states.\n\nOn social media Vought said that he would cancel funding for green energy projects in 16 Democrat-led states.\n\n\"Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled,\" Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said in a social media post.\n\nHe said the cuts would impact California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.\n\nEarlier in the day Vought announced that $18 million for two of New York city’s largest projects in decades — the 2nd Avenue subway expansion and the Hudson River rail tunnel — were on hold.\n\nWashington's Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, the highest ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriation's Committee, decried the \"mafioso tactics.\"\n\n\"We're less than a day into this shutdown, and Trump & Vought are illegally punishing Democrat-led states,\" Murray said on social media.\n\n- Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhite House plays AI videos of Jeffries in sombrero\n\nPresident Donald Trump is doubling down on his portrayal of House Democratic Leader of Hakeem Jeffries in a fake mustache and sombrero.\n\nOn the first day of a government shutdown, the White House on Tuesday afternoon started playing the controversial AI-generated videos featuring Jefferies in a mustache and sombrero on loop in the press briefing room.\n\nVice President JD Vance earlier in the day brushed off criticism from Jeffries and other Democrats who have called the videos racist. The videos, which are playing on a pair of large television screens in the briefing room, also include made up audio of Schumer making derogatory comments about immigrants, as mariachi music played in the background.\n\n“The president's joking,” Vance said when asked about the videos. “And we're having a good time.”\n\nThe vice president added: “Hakeem Jeffries said it was racist, and I know that he said that, and I honestly don’t even know what that means. Like, is he a Mexican-American that is offended by having a sombrero meme?”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWhat does a government shutdown mean for student loans? What about FAFSA?\n\nIn the event of a government shutdown, borrowers would still be required to make payments on their outstanding student debt.\n\nThe Department of Education will continue to disburse Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans, according to the department’s contingency plan. As available, permanent and multi-year appropriations will also be used to continue processing Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, the plan said.\n\nDuring a lapse in funding, the department would cease any new grantmaking activities; however, grant programs typically make awards over the summer.\n\nBorrowers with a question or dispute related to their loan may have a tougher time reaching the department, as it plans to furlough the majority of its staff.\n\nExperts say while most borrowers won’t “feel” a short shutdown, more issues could arise the longer it takes those in Washington to make a deal.\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nFederal agency websites blame Democrats for shutdown\n\nThe websites of several Cabinet-level agencies now have banners blaming Democrats for the government shutdown rather than the routine language noting that a “lapse in funding” has occurred and response times might be slower.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development was the first to take a political approach, putting up its banner Tuesday.\n\nThe USDA’s website blames “Radical Left Democrat shutdown” for the page not being updated.\n\nThe DHS website says “Mission-critical activities of HHS will continue during the Democrat-led government shutdown. Please use this site as a resource as the Trump Administration works to reopen the government for the American people.”\n\nThe Justice Department claims “Democrats have shut down the government.”\n\n“Due to the Democrat-led shutdown, website updates will be limited until full operations resume,” the State Department’s site says.\n\nThe Treasury Department states “The radical left has chosen to shut down the United States government in the name of reckless spending and obstructionism.”\n\nSeveral agencies including the Education, Labor and Transportation departments simply refer to a lapse in funding.\n\n- Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhat does it mean to be furloughed?\n\nA furlough is the \"placing of an employee in a temporary nonduty, non-pay status because of lack of work or funds, or other non-disciplinary reasons,\" according to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\n\nWhen an agency does not have enough funds, such as in the case of a government shutdown, a “shutdown” furlough occurs and those employees not categorized as \"excepted,\" or essential, pause their work.\n\nTSA warns of possible delays\n\nTravelers heading to the airport don’t need to worry about TSA disruptions from the government shutdown – at least for now.\n\nThe agency said on X that about 61,000 of its 64,000 employees are considered essential and will continue screening passengers, though their paychecks may be delayed until funding resumes. TSA warned that an extended shutdown could eventually lead to longer wait times, with past shutdowns showing rising absences among TSA and FAA employees can snarl air travel.\n\nFor now, flights and security operations are expected to run normally, but travelers should monitor flight status and security line updates if the shutdown continues.\n\n– Zach Wichter\n\nMillions of Medicare recipients could lose access to telehealth, in-home care\n\nSeniors who rely on Medicare could face major changes and new barriers to receiving medical care during the shutdown. Two COVID-era programs that expanded access to healthcare expired on Tuesday, despite having largely bipartisan support: One provided greater flexibility around telehealth and another allowed hospitals to continue high-level care at home.\n\nAs part of the shutdown, Congress missed the deadline on extending telehealth programs for Medicare beneficiaries, meaning previous restrictions will go back into place.\n\nTherefore, patients can no longer receive telehealth from home unless they meet specific criteria. Telehealth flexibility will again be limited to rural areas; audio-only visits will no longer be reimbursed for most services; and physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists and audiologists will be excluded from telehealth reimbursement.\n\n– Mary Walrath-Holdridge\n\nYes, Congress and the president receive salaries during a government shutdown\n\nCongressional lawmakers and the president continue to receive paychecks during a shutdown under Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution.\n\n“The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States,\" the Constitution states.\n\nHowever, some lawmakers such as New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer and Florida Rep. Kat Cammack, say they will not take compensation during the shutdown. Trump also receives a salary as president, but the one-time real estate mogul has historically donated his pay.\n\nWill there be layoffs during the government shutdown? OMB director huddles with GOP lawmakers\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought would brief House Republican lawmakers Wednesday about federal government layoffs planned under the shutdown.\n\nTrump has warned “vast” layoffs are possible. Leavitt confirmed a time frame that layoffs are “imminent” and could begin in as little as two days.\n\n“We have to put a plan in place,” Leavitt told reporters.\n\nIs the DMV impacted by the government shutdown?\n\nNo. It's business as usual at Department of Motor Vehicles offices across the country. Like the U.S. Postal Service, the agency's operations are not contingent on Congress passing a funding package.\n\nMotor vehicle departments, which are state-run agencies, are largely funded through state budgets and supplemented by fees charged to drivers.\n\n– Amaris Encinas\n\nVance takes center stage in shutdown fight\n\nVance made a surprise appearance at a White House press briefing on Wednesday, placing himself at the forefront of the administration's fight with Democrats over government spending.\n\nIn remarks to reporters, Vance repeatedly blasted Schumer, who he accused of acting in his own political interests, and threatened mass layoffs for federal workers if the shutdown continues.\n\n\"We need to reopen the government,\" Vance said. \"Let's fix America's problems, let's work together to solve them, but let's reopen the government before have our negotiation about healthcare policy.\"\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWhat government services will be impacted by shutdown?\n\nSocial Security checks will still be delivered. Medicare and Medicaid benefits also will still be paid, but many other aspects of the federal government will grind to a halt during the shutdown.\n\nAll federal agencies and services that officials do not deem \"essential\" must stop working during a shutdown.\n\nEssential services include the U.S. Postal Service, Medicare and Social Security services and air-traffic control. \"Nonessential\" work, however, must pause, which affects thousands of federal employees and millions of Americans.\n\nDo you have Medicare or Medicaid? Your doctor will see you, for now\n\nIf you have Medicare or Medicaid, you should be able to see your doctor without disruption. But if the shutdown drags on several weeks, problems could surface, experts said.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will continue operations during the shutdown.\n\nDoctors, hospitals and other health providers could see delays in Medicare and Medicaid payments during a longer-term shutdown, said Jonathan Burks, executive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nDoctors might be reluctant to schedule appointments for new or existing patients if their payments are delayed, Burks said. Federal law requires hospitals to assess and stabilize anyone who seeks care at an emergency room.\n\n– Ken Alltucker\n\nTrump is no stranger to shutdowns\n\nA shuttered government is familiar territory for Trump, whose first term saw three shutdowns, including a 35-day closure spanning the end of 2018 into early 2019. It remains the longest in U.S. history.\n\nWhen Congress failed to pass new spending authority Tuesday, it prompted the 4th shutdown of the federal government during a Trump presidency.\n\nWhen will the government reopen? Here's what would need to happen\n\nThe government will remain shut down until Congress can agree on federal funding allocations.\n\nTo reopen the government, Congress will need to pass funding appropriations. Trump will then have to sign the appropriations bill into law.\n\nLawmakers could also pass a temporary spending bill, known as a continuing resolution (or CR, for short), to buy more time for negotiations.\n\nStocks little changed on shutdown’s first day\n\nU.S. stocks were mixed in the late morning in New York as investors digested the first day of the government shutdown and a weaker-than-expected report about hiring.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average added 66 points, about 0.1%, to trade near 46,464, while the broader S&P 500 index was down 2 points near 6,687. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was off 25 points, or 0.1%, trading near 22,635. Gold, which investors snatch up during periods of uncertainty, was up $22 near $3,895.\n\nBefore the market opened, payroll processor ADP said that private employers had shed a net 32,000 jobs in September. Economists had expected a gain of 50,000 jobs. ADP’s report will likely be the only read on the state of hiring until the shutdown ends, and with the Federal Reserve set to meet during the last week of October, it takes on outsize importance.\n\nThe lackluster reading “makes the Fed more likely to cut rates a quarter percent at their next decision in late October,” said Bill Adams, chief economist for Dallas-based Comerica Bank, in an email.\n\nHow is the IRS impacted by the government shutdown?\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service will not immediately be impacted by the government shutdown. More than 74,000 IRS employees are expected to report to work for the first day days after the shutdown's start, per the IRS' government shutdown contingency plan.\n\nThe federal government agency will continue operating under the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides supplemental appropriations to the IRS through Sept. 30, 2031, according to the contingency plan. However, the plan does not outline the agency's next steps after Oct. 5.\n\n– Greta Cross\n\nAOC: ‘This is so not about me’\n\nProgressive firebrand New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday that Republicans who are speculating the government shutdown is her fault should negotiate with her on a deal directly.\n\nHer remarks come as some Republicans have argued that Schumer opposed a temporary short-term bill to fund the government because of pressure from progressive Democrats and a potential primary challenge from Ocasio-Cortez in 2028.\n\nSchumer received backlash in March after voting in favor of a Republican-crafted short-term funding bill. Ocasio-Cortez told reporters then that there was \"a deep sense of outrage and betrayal\" and said Senate Democrats must \"correct course.\" Other House Democrats and New York politicos urged her to mount a primary challenge to him when he is next up for re-election in 2028.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez said just hours before the government shut down that, “This is so not about me in this moment.”\n\nShe added, “I saw some senators speculating about this, and I saw some Republican members of Congress saying, ‘Oh, well, if we have this shutdown, it's because of AOC.’ Well, if that's the case, my office is open and you are free to walk in and negotiate with me directly.”\n\nSchumer shutdown becomes key phrase for congressional Republicans\n\nCongressional Republicans adopted two key phrases at a Wednesday news conference to accuse Democrats of holding the American public “hostage” and blast what they called the “Schumer shutdown.”\n\nSchumer of New York has become the face of the Democratic Party as he negotiates federal funding with Trump. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota; Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming; and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, each called it a “Schumer shutdown.”\n\n“The reason the government is shut down this morning is because the Democrats decided they would rather hold our government hostage and issue a $1.5 trillion random note,” said Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minnesota.\n\nSchumer has highlighted that many people will lose health insurance if federal subsidies aren’t extended under Obamacare as the renewal period begins Nov. 1.\n\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, said subsidies could be debated in December before new insurance rates go into effect Jan. 1.\n\n“That is not a decision that has to be made before the end of the year,” Johnson said. “Don’t buy it. They’re grasping at straws.”\n\nMike Johnson says shutdown ‘opportunity to downsize’ government\n\nJohnson told Fox Business that he has spoken to Trump about using the shutdown to cut the federal government.\n\n“The president and I have talked about this at great length,” Johnson said Wednesday. “While a shutdown is very damaging for real American people who depend on government services, it can provide an opportunity to downsize the scope and the scale of government, which is something that we’ve all always wanted to do.”\n\nTrump is threatening mass layoffs of federal workers. Johnson said the shutdown is an opportunity to do things “we would not otherwise be able to do because we would never get Democrat votes for them.”\n\n‘No way out’: Congressional Republicans push for short-term funding\n\nRepublican congressional leaders urged Democrats to support a short-term extension of funding through Nov. 21 and reopen the government while lawmakers continue to debate spending levels.\n\n“There’s no way out,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, said at a Wednesday news conference outside the Capitol. “Everybody’s asking the question how does this end.”\n\nThe House previously approved the short-term funding extension. Another Senate vote is expected about 11 a.m. on Wednesday. But a 55-45 vote on Tuesday fell short of the 60 votes needed to approve the bill.\n\n“They have taken the American people hostage,” Thune said of Democrats. “This could all end today.”\n\nDoes the military still operate during a government shutdown?\n\nMilitary operations are necessary to national security, so service members will continue to work during the shutdown, according to a Saturday contingency plan published by the Department of War.\n\nHowever, military members won't get paid while working during the shutdown because their compensation is funded through annual personnel appropriations to the Department of Homeland Security and Department of War, according to the Library of Congress.\n\nIt's possible that Congress will act to ensure active duty members continue to get paid as they have in past shutdowns. For example, the Pay Our Military Act allowed military members to be paid during a government shutdown in 2013.\n\nNational Park site operations will vary during the government shutdown.\n\nNational Park operations will vary during the government shutdown.\n\nIn general parks will remain open and “park roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors,” according to newly published contingency plans on the Department of Interior’s website.\n\nParks with accessible areas that collect fees under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act are to use balances from those fees to continue providing basic visitor services like restroom maintenance and trash collection.\n\nHowever, the plan says the National Park Service will not operate nor offer visitor services in parks without accessible areas, though essential services like law enforcement and border safety will continue. Also facilities and areas that are typically locked or secured after business hours will largely remain so during the shutdown.\n\n– Eve Chen\n\n'There’s going to be some pain' Vance says shutdown could hurt.\n\nVance in a Wednesday appearance on CBS Mornings said Americans could be harmed by the shutdown’s impact on government services.\n\n“There are critical, essential services that the people rely on that are going to suffer because of this,” Vance said, adding: “There’s going to be some pain.”\n\nVance also appeared on Fox News, where he criticized Democrats’ focus on including an extension of health care subsidies in any government funding bill, saying “you don’t shut down the government because you have a policy disagreement about a totally separate issue.”\n\nCongressional Democratic leaders – Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York – issued a joint statement at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday saying Trump and Republicans shut down the government “because they do not want to protect the healthcare of the American people.”\n\nWill a government shutdown impact my flight?\n\nFor the most part, no. Air passengers should still be able to continue with their flights during a partial government shutdown.\n\nThose workers who screen at airport security checkpoints, give flight clearance, and verify at border control are deemed essential, so they are still required to work.\n\nHowever, a group representing major U.S. airlines warned that a partial federal government shutdown could strain American aviation and slow flights, as air traffic controllers and security officers would be forced to work without pay and other functions would be halted.\n\nAirline trade group Airlines for America, which represents United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and others, warned that if funding lapses \"the system may need to slow down, reducing efficiency\" and impacting travelers.\n\n– Kathleen Wong\n\nAbout $18 billion in NYC infrastructure funds frozen amid shutdown\n\nThe Trump administration has frozen about $18 billion in infrastructure project funds to New York City amid the federal government shutdown. Federal officials on Wednesday alleged discrimination from a city program meant to help underrepresented groups obtain federal contracts.\n\nThe federal Department of Transportation said two of the city’s largest projects in decades — the 2nd Avenue subway expansion and the Hudson River rail tunnel — are on hold pending administrative review. An agency news release called the projects “arguably the largest infrastructure initiatives in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nIn an X post, Russ Vought, the director of the federal Office of Management and Budget, said the hold is meant to “ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.”\n\nThe Transportation Department cited the city’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, an equity initiative meant to expand participation in federally assisted contracts. Projects, for now, can’t reimbursed, an agency news release said.\n\nA spokesperson for Mayor Eric Adams didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a New York Democrat, called the hold “political payback and an attack on New York and its residents.”\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nSmithsonian museums remaining open this week\n\nThe Smithsonian Institute’s museums, research centers, and the National Zoo remain open this week despite the government shutdown.\n\nThe organization posted on its website that it will use money from the last fiscal year’s budget to stay open at least through Monday, Oct. 6.\n\nThe Smithsonian has 17 museums and a zoo in the Washington area plus two museums in New York City.\n\nWhat does the government shutdown mean for mortgage borrowers?\n\nAmericans who are hoping to close on a mortgage soon – whether for a purchase or a refinance – may experience some delays as government functions are curtailed. Here are a few things to know:\n\nMost mortgages that will be assumed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be unaffected, industry participants say. However, if your Social Security number needs to be verified, you may encounter delays.\n\nIf your mortgage comes from a rural housing program like those from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, expect delays. As the National Association of Realtors explains in an online memo to members, “new direct and guaranteed home loans, and any scheduled direct‑loan closings will be postponed. Pending conditional commitments for guaranteed loans are still being reviewed.”\n\nIf your mortgage comes from the Department of Veterans Affairs, you should also expect delays. “Some VA staff and support functions may be reduced, which may slow down approvals, appraisals and certificate of eligibility requests,” NAR says.\n\nIf you are working with a housing counselor affiliated with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, that agency may need to scale back or halt their activities, NAR says.\n\nBuyers in flood-prone areas like Florida and Louisiana might encounter delays because the National Flood Insurance Program will not be funded. Some lenders may allow the purchase to proceed anyway, but that can create problems if a storm happens before insurance can be written, said Jeff Lichtenstein, president and broker of Echo Fine Properties in south Florida.\n\n“Uncertainty in the marketplace might have some buyers just wanting to back out,” Lichtenstein told USA TODAY in an email. “Nothing good ever comes out of these things.”\n\nWhite House website features shutdown clock\n\nTrump is doing everything he can to blame Democrats for the shutdown, including featuring a shutdown clock on the White House website.\n\nThe top of the website displays the amount of time since “Democrats have shutdown the government.” There’s also a link to a video with clips of Democrats criticizing past shutdowns.\n\nThe Trump administration has used other government channels to blast out highly partisan shutdown messages, including a banner on the Department of Housing and Urban Development website declaring the “radical left” is shutting down the government.\n\nDemocrats say blame for the shutdown lies with the GOP.\n\n“Republicans own this shutdown,” the Democratic National Committee posted on social media early Wednesday.\n\nMassive furloughs expected in federal government\n\nAbout 750,000 federal employees ranging from workers at national parks to financial regulators could be furloughed each day under a shutdown, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, withholding about $400 million in daily compensation.\n\nOther workers in government services that are considered “essential,” such as the military and law enforcement, will continue to work but won’t be paid until a deal is reached.\n\nTrump warns of government layoffs\n\nTrump has also warned Democrats he may lay off federal workers under a shutdown. \"We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them ‒ cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things they that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump said in the Oval Office, hours before the shutdown.\n\nThe president later said: “A lot of good can come down from shutdowns. We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn't want. They’d be Democrat things.”\n\nThe shutdown is the first since 2019, which came during Trump’s first term following Democratic objections over funding Trump’s border wall. It was also the longest shutdown in U.S. history at 35 days, costing the U.S. economy about $3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nDemocrats hold out for health-care demands\n\nDemocrats have demanded the reversal of Medicaid cuts that Republicans passed this year and the extension of health care subsidies be included in a funding measure.\n\n“He doesn't understand that if the government shuts down, people's healthcare premiums will go up,” Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said of Trump from the Senate Floor on Tuesday.\n\nTrump and Republicans have countered by accusing Democrats of wanting to provide health care for immigrants who are in the country illegally. “That’s what they’re insisting, and obviously, I have an obligation to not accept that,” Trump said. Democrats have called the president's claims a lie, noting that undocumented immigrants aren’t eligible for payments from Medicare, Medicaid, or the Affordable Care Act.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/06/23/iran-us-conflict-live-updates/84308966007/", "title": "Iran-US: Israel says Iran violates Trump ceasefires", "text": "June 23, 2025 Updated June 24, 2025, 1:22 p.m. ET\n\nEditor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Mideast conflict from Monday, June 23. For the latest news on the Iran-Israel conflict, read USA TODAY's live updates on the conflict for Tuesday, June 24.\n\nIsrael said that Iran had committed a ''severe violation\" of the Trump-announced ceasefire, and vowed to respond with force, only hours after Iran signaled it was willing to abide by the deal.Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel had detected Iranian missile launches and ordered \"high-intensity operations\" targeting Iran. Iranian media reported that the country has denied a ceasefire violation.\n\nEarlier, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office thanked President Donald Trump and said it achieved its objective of \"eliminating the Iranian nuclear threat.\" Iranian officials said their government would halt attacks if Israel did.\n\nTrump had first announced the deal in a social media post and urged both countries not to violated it. He said that Israel and Iran agreed to a \"total ceasefire\" after the Iranian military retaliated for U.S. strikes on three of the country's nuclear facilities.\n\nA senior White House official told USA TODAY that Trump communicated directly with Netanyahu about the ceasefire, which Israel also agreed to as long as it was not struck again by Iran.\n\nVice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and special envoy Steve Witkoff negotiated with the Iranians, through both direct and indirect channels, the person said. Qatar's emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani helped broker the agreement, and Trump called the Gulf leader to thank him, the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump thanked Iran for providing a warning of its Monday attack, and he made a peace offering to end the brief but intense war. Trump said Iran fired 14 missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar, and 13 of them were intercepted, while the other one was deemed nonthreatening.\n\nTrump reported there were no American or Qatari casualties and very little damage from the attack.\n\nIran’s military had claimed it had carried out a “devastating and powerful” missile assault on the Al Udeid U.S. military base in Doha, but Qatar said the missiles were intercepted. U.S. officials said the base had been emptied out, lending credence to the notion Iran was merely saving face with the missile launch.\n\n\"They’ve gotten it all out of their 'system,' and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE,'' Trump said in his earlier post. \"I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured. Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same.''\n\nContributing: Zac Anderson\n\nIran fires missiles at US base in Qatar: Where else could it strike?\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The State Department said it has evacuated approximately 250 U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents and their immediate family members from Israel on seven flights since June 21.\n\n∎ Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Iran's foreign minister in Moscow and told him there was no justification for the U.S. bombing of Iran, which he described as \"unprovoked aggression,\" according to the Kremlin. Putin added that Moscow is making efforts to assist the Iranian people.\n\n∎ Iranian official Ebrahim Zolfaqari warned that the U.S. should expect severe consequences. \"Mr. Trump, the gambler, you may start this war, but we will be the ones to end it,\" Zolfaqari said in English in a video shared Monday.\n\nReported attacks in Israel and Iran\n\nTrump's ceasefire announcement came after Iran had launched a fresh wave of missiles, killing four people, according to Israel's ambulance service, and as Iranian authorities reported nine people killed in an attack in northern Iran on Tuesday morning.\n\nWitnesses said they heard explosions near Tel Aviv and Beersheba in southern Israel. Iran's semi-official SNN news agency reported that Tehran fired its last round of missiles before the ceasefire came into effect.\n\nIn Iran, the deputy governor of the northern province of Gilan said four residential units were destroyed in a \"terrorist attack\" on Tuesday morning, killing nine people and injuring 33, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.\n\n--Reuters\n\nTrump celebrates ceasefire while Israeli Forces say attacks continue\n\nThe president took to his social media platform Truth Social on Monday evening to celebrate the end of fighting between the two countries.\n\n“Israel & Iran came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, ‘PEACE!’ Trump proclaimed on the platform. “I knew the time was NOW. The World, and the Middle East, are the real WINNERS! Both Nations will see tremendous LOVE, PEACE, AND PROSPERITY in their futures. They have so much to gain, and yet, so much to lose if they stray from the road of RIGHTEOUSNESS & TRUTH. The future for Israel & Iran is UNLIMITED, & filled with great PROMISE. GOD BLESS YOU BOTH!”\n\nThe White House told USA TODAY earlier in the evening that Trump spoke to Netanyahu and the emir of Qatar. Top-ranking U.S. officials spoke directly and indirectly to Tehran.\n\nIranian state media said the ceasefire came as a result of the nation’s retaliatory strikes, according to reporting by CNN. Trump called for the ceasefire “in a begging-like manner” after the attacks on U.S. bases in Qatar, an Iranian state anchor said.\n\nIranian attacks haven’t ceased yet, according to the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nMinutes before the president’s celebratory post, Israeli Defense Forces in a post on X announced an incoming attack: “Sirens sounding in Israel due to a missile launch from Iran.”\n\nAn hour later, Israeli forces said “for the third time in the last hour, Israelis are currently running to shelter due to another missile launch from Iran.”\n\nVance says Trump is working on long-term deal\n\nVice President JD Vance was about to do a live, in-studio interview on Fox News when Trump posted the cease-fire message. Vance said the administration had been working on the truce when he left the White House. \"So that's good news that the president was able to get that across the finish line,\" Vance said.\n\nHe said the United States must now talk to Iran and Israel about what comes next, following days of strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites. \"I think that is what the president is really trying to figure out here, is to build a long-term settlement,\" Vance said.\n\nVance said Trump told his team the U.S. would now work to make sure Iran doesn't rebuild its nuclear capability in the future.\n\nAs for the six hours that Trump referred to, Vance said the fighting may continue for a few hours. \"And tomorrow really is a new day. The end of the 12-day war, the end of the Iranian nuclear program, and I really do believe, something big for peace in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nUS was ready for missiles, evacuated base\n\nA U.S. defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly confirmed to USA TODAY that Al Udeid Air Base was attacked by short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles originating from Iran. There were no reports of U.S. casualties, the official said.\n\nAnother U.S. official said on condition of anonymity that the base had been mostly evacuated, and that it appeared the Qatari military had fended off most missiles.\n\nMajed Al Ansari, foreign affairs spokesman for Qatar, issued a statement strongly condemning the missile launch, calling it \"a flagrant violation'' of the country's sovereignty. \"We reassure that Qatar’s air defenses successfully thwarted the attack,\" the statement said.\n\nThe U.S. has remained on alert with its 40,000 troops in the region two days after Trump ordered the bombing of Fordow, a uranium-enrichment facility deep inside a remote mountain in Iran, and facilities at Natanz and Isfahan. Trump convened his national security team Monday afternoon in the Situation Room.\n\nMany world leaders − including those from the UK, France and Germany − called for restraint and a return to diplomatic negotiations. The extent of the damage to the Iran nuclear sites remains in question because so far there has been no independent assessment.\n\nThe U.S. Ain al-Asad air base in Iraq had activated its air defense system out of concern of a potential attack, military officials told Reuters.\n\nWhat is the Al Udeid US military base in Qatar?\n\nAl Udeid is the sprawling hub of U.S. military air operations in the Middle East. There about 10,000 U.S. troops stationed there, on the outskirts of the capital of Doha.\n\nIts air operations center has overseen fighters, bombers and drones that have conducted combat missions in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nDignitaries make stops there frequently, including Trump and secretaries of Defense.\n\nTrump warns other countries not to supply nukes to Iran\n\nTrump warned other countries Monday not to supply nuclear weapons to Iran in response to the U.S. bombing, after a former Russian president suggested the option.\n\n“The ‘N word’ should not be treated so casually,” Trump said in a social media post, referring to nuclear weapons.Trump was alluding to a social media post by Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia, but questioned its accuracy. Medvedev’s post suggested “a number of countries are ready to directly support Iran with their own nuclear warheads.”−Bart Jansen\n\nSpeaker says no to House vote on war powers resolution\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Monday he didn’t think it was “an appropriate time” for the House to vote on a bipartisan war powers resolution pushed by two representatives, Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie and California Democrat Ro Khanna.\n\n“I don’t think it’s necessary,” Johnson said, according to Punchbowl News. “For 80 years, presidents of both parties have acted with the same Commander in Chief authority under Article 2.''\n\nJohnson said President Joe Biden used the authority in three Middle East operations, and added: \"President Obama went on an eight-month campaign bombing Libya to take down the regime there. I never heard a Democrat balk about any of that. And suddenly now they're just up in arms. It's all politics. This is not a time for politics.”\n\nHis remarks will likely earn pushback from Massie and Khanna, who were looking to bring their measure to the floor for a vote, seeking to forbid the U.S. from \"unauthorized hostilities” in Iran after Trump ordered airstrikes at three nuclear sites in Iran.\n\nLawmakers across the aisle have alleged that Trump’s order violated the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action. Some of Trump’s staunchest allies have split with him over Iran.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nStocks waver but regain footing, end up higher\n\nStocks wavered but quickly moved back into positive ground after Iran said it attacked a U.S. military base Monday. The market wound up on a high note upon news the assault caused no casualties or disruptions to oil supplies.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow closed up 0.89%, or 374.96 points, to 42,581.78; the broad S&P 500 added 0.96%, or 57.33 points, to 6025.17 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.94%, or 183.57 points, to 19630.98. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slipped to 4.34%.\n\nU.S. oil prices initially rose on the news of explosions over Qatar but settled back to trade down about 7.94% to $67.98 per barrel. Qatar said it intercepted Iran's missiles.\n\n− Medora Lee\n\nIsrael flags Tehran residents: More strikes to come\n\nThe Israeli military released an urgent warning to residents in Tehran urging them to stay away from \"security institutions\" as they plan to continue pounding the capital city with airstrikes.\n\n\"Dear citizens of Tehran, In the coming days, the Israeli army will continue its attacks against military targets in the Tehran region,\" read the statement posed Monday on X. \"To maintain your personal safety, we ask you to stay away from weapons production centers, military bases, and security institutions affiliated with the regime.\"\n\nTehran is one of the largest cities in the Middle East and is home to an estimated 9.5 million people. On Monday, Israel launched several strikes on the city, hitting near Evin Prison and several command and security operations centers.\n\nOil spikes on Iran strikes but drops again\n\nOil prices initially rose on reports of explosions over Qatar but dropped again as analysts said oil supplies remained safe. Just after 1:30 p.m. ET, oil prices were down 4.97% at $70.17 per barrel.\n\nAnalysts’ primary concern is if Iran retaliates by closing the Strait of Hormuz, the main artery that carries global oil supplies.\n\nIf transport through the Strait of Hormuz is significantly disrupted, oil prices could surge to $130-150 per barrel, said David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics.\n\n− Medora Lee\n\nNo U.S. forces present at Syrian military base reportedly attacked\n\nThere are no U.S. forces at the military base in Syria that reportedly had come under mortar fire, a U.S. official said Monday.\n\nThe official, who could not confirm whether an attack had occurred at the base, was not authorized to speak publicly about U.S. troop movements in the region. The alleged attack at a base in western Syria was first reported by Mehr, a news agency affiliated with the Iranian government.\n\nThe Pentagon has been bracing for a counterattack after the U.S. airstrikes Saturday on three nuclear facilities in Iran. The Pentagon has sent an additional aircraft carrier strike group to the region and bolstered air defenses to protect troops in recent weeks following Israel’s ongoing attacks on Iran.\n\nMilitia groups, funded and supplied by Iran, have regularly fired rockets, mortars and drones at bases with U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria. Those attacks typically do not cause casualties or major damage.\n\nIs it safe to travel abroad right now? Worldwide caution issued after US strikes on Iran\n\n'Bait and switch': Marjorie Taylor Greene blasts Trump on strike\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has been one of Trump’s most loyal supporters, but she’s not holding back in slamming his decision to bomb Iran. In a second lengthy social media post since the bombing, Greene accused Trump of a “bait and switch” with his supporters.\n\nGreene wrote in the Monday post that she campaigned with Trump on a “MAGA agenda” that included “NO MORE FOREIGN WARS. NO MORE REGIME CHANGE. WORLD PEACE.” Now, less than six months into Trump’s second administration, Greene wrote “we are back into foreign wars, regime change, and world war 3.”\n\n“It feels like a complete bait and switch to please the neocons, warmongers, military industrial complex contracts, and neocon tv personalities that MAGA hates and who were NEVER TRUMPERS!” Greene added.\n\nGreene was among a vocal MAGA contingent warning against attacking Iran before Trump decided to go forward with the strike. Greene has remained outspoken, saying in an earlier social media post that “I can also support President Trump … while disagreeing on bombing Iran and getting involved in a hot war that Israel started.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi, Zac Anderson\n\nTrump calls for low oil prices after U.S. airstrikes on Iran\n\nTrump called for oil prices not to increase after U.S. airstrikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran.\n\n“EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I’M WATCHING! YOU’RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON’T DO IT!” he wrote in a Truth Social post. It wasn’t clear who he was referring to in the post.\n\nIn a follow-up Truth Social post, Trump urged the Department of Energy to “DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!!

On Sunday, the State Department released an advisory urging U.S. citizens worldwide to \"exercise increased caution\" as the conflict between Israel and Iran continued to escalate.\n\nQatar's foreign ministry in a statement on Monday said recent advisories issued by embassies \"do not necessarily reflect the existence of specific threats.\" The statement added the the security situation in Qatar is \"stable.\"\n\nGas price effects: Can Iran close the Strait of Hormuz?\n\nIran’s parliament voted Sunday in support of closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital trade route that carries an estimated 20% of the world's oil and gas.\n\nThe decision to close the strait ultimately belongs to Iran's Supreme National Security Council, which has yet to officially weigh in.\n\nLeavitt said the Iranian regime would be “foolish” to close the strait when asked whether the Trump administration would release more oil to dampen potential price hikes.\n\n“I can assure you the administration is actively and closely monitoring the situation in the Strait of Hormuz,” Leavitt told ABC News. “The Iranian regime would be foolish to make that decision.”\n\n− Savannah Kuchar and Bart Jansen\n\nTrump's floats notion of Iran regime change\n\nTrump met with his national security team as tensions in the Middle East grew after he ordered a trio of strikes at Iranian nuclear facilities Saturday.\n\nIn a post on his social media platform, Trump raised the prospect of regime change while officials in his administration said they were seeking to resume negotiations talks with Iran.\n\n\"It’s not politically correct to use the term, 'Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change???

Dan Caine said.\n\nThe bombs used in the strikes, called Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs, weigh 30,000 pounds each and cost millions to produce. MOPs, also known as the Guided Bomb Unit, or GBU-57, are GPS-guided weapons designed to burrow deep into underground targets, such as fortified tunnels or bunkers.

But lawyers representing the deportees said two flights took off for Honduras and El Salvador between the oral and written arguments, suggesting the government defied the judge’s order.\n\nA Justice Department lawyer, Abhishek Kambli, told Boasberg no flights took off after his written order.

He said he couldn’t share information in open court because of national security and delicate foreign negotiations.\n\n“Those are operational issues and I’m not at liberty to provide any information about the flights,” Kambli said. “It is based on national security concerns.”\n\nBoasberg disagreed.

But flights were already in the air heading to Honduras and El Salvador when he ruled.\n\nGovernment lawyers led by Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a filing Monday the planes were already outside U.S. territory and so not subject to Boasberg’s ruling.\n\n“Contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion, an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction,” said government lawyers, citing a 1990 decision in the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. “A judge who proclaims ‘I enjoin you’ and does not follow up with an injunction has done nothing,” and, if the judge “does not record an injunction or declaratory judgment on a separate document, the defendant is under no judicial compulsion.”\n\nLawyers for the Venezuelans said the refusal to turn the planes around looked like blatant defiance of the judge's order.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nJudge refuses to drop hearing over Venezuelan deportations\n\nA federal judge refused to drop his Monday hearing into whether the Trump administration defied his order temporarily blocking the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans, after government lawyers argued neither the judge nor the migrants had the power to stop the removals.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi and top aides urged Chief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg not to hold the hearing and “de-escalate the grave incursions on Executive Branch authority that have already arisen.”\n\nBut Boasberg rejected the request without elaborating.\n\nThe government lawyers argued that Boasberg lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute because the president has the ultimate power to conduct foreign affairs and negotiate with foreign governments to transfer deportees abroad.\n\n“Plaintiffs cannot use these proceedings to interfere with the President’s national-security and foreign-affairs authority, and the Court lacks jurisdiction to do so,” the government lawyers wrote. “Once the terrorists had been removed from the United States, any decision by the President to take such actions pursuant to independent constitutional authority is therefore not a violation of the Court’s orders in all events.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nU.S. disputes reports of a new travel ban\n\nThe U.S. State Department refuted a report on Monday that it had drafted a list of countries whose nationals President Donald Trump should consider for a travel ban.\n\n\"First of all there is no list.

The move came despite a federal judge blocking the deportation Saturday and ordering deportation planes be turned around.\n\nLeavitt said the Trump administration complied with the judge’s order, arguing the Venezuelans were deported before the judge’s written order was released.

The flights landed at 7:36 p.m. Eastern and 8:02 p.m. Eastern, respectively.\n\nBoasberg’s oral order to turn around planes headed to other countries came between 6:45 p.m. and 6:48 p.m. Eastern, according to the lawyers.\n\nBoasberg said during the hearing that “any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.”\n\nGovernment lawyers said in a filing Sunday the five initial plaintiffs weren't deported. The filing said Boasberg’s order was published in the online court docket at 7:26 p.m. Eastern and that “some gang members subject to removal under the Proclamation has already been removed from United States territory” before the second, oral order.\n\nThe lawyers asked Boasberg to review whether the government complied with his order.\n\n“If that is how the government proceeded, it was a blatant violation of the Court’s Order,” the lawyers wrote.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump justifies Alien Enemies Act because of ‘invasion’\n\nPresident Donald Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which has been linked to contract killings, kidnapping and organized crime.\n\nThe law says a president can invoke it during “a declared war” with a foreign nation or government, or when “any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted or threatened” against the United States. The law had previously been invoked only three times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.\n\nCongress hasn’t declared a war. But Trump told reporters while flying from Florida back to Washington on Sunday that he considered this a “a time of war” because foreign criminals entered the country without legal authorization during previous administrations.\n\n\"This is a time of war, because Biden allowed millions of people, many of them criminals, many of them at the highest level, they emptied jails out,” Trump said. “That's an invasion. They invaded our country.”\n\n“In that sense, this is war,” Trump added. “In many respects, it's more dangerous than war because, you know, in war, they have uniforms. You know who you're shooting at. You know you're going after.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWhy were hundreds of Venezuelans deported?\n\nChief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg initially ordered the administration Saturday not to deport five Venezuelans who were fighting their removal from the United States. He later expanded the order to cover all Venezuelans being deported under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nBut flight logs suggest at least two deportation flights bound for Honduras and El Salvador might have taken off or landed after Boasberg issued his second oral order.\n\nThe Trump administration has asked the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to halt Boasberg's order while the case is litigated. The appeals court asked for written arguments Tuesday from the government and Wednesday from Venezuelans. Boasberg postponed a Monday hearing until Friday because of the appeal.\n\nGovernment lawyers said in a filing Sunday that “some gang members” had “already been removed from United States territory” under Trump’s proclamation and before the court’s second order.\n\nLawyers representing the Venezuelans from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Democracy Forward Foundation asked Boasberg in a filing early Monday to review whether the government obeyed his order.\n\nMark Zaid, a national security lawyer who has represented whistleblowers against the Trump administration and whose security clearance Trump rescinded, said the potential defiance of a court order moves the country closer to a \"constitutional crisis.\"\n\n-Bart Jansen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/05/colorado-ice-raid-targets-immigrant-gang-members/78248926007/", "title": "Trump's promised immigration raids hit Denver, Aurora, Colo.", "text": "Updated Feb. 5, 2025, 5:52 p.m. ET\n\nDENVER ‒ Federal agents detained people in Denver and neighboring Aurora early Wednesday morning, breaking down doors and questioning bleary-eyed residents as they searched for more than 100 reported Venezuelan gang members.\n\nThe high-profile operation appeared to be one of the largest targeted raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since President Donald Trump took office on a promise to deport immigrants with criminal records. Trump months ago vowed to launch the deportation effort \"Operation Aurora\" upon taking office.\n\n\"As long there bad guys in the streets, we're going to be out here arresting them and making sure we're keeping these communities safe,\" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Caleb Vitello said in a video press release from an apartment complex raided on Wednesday morning.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many people were apprehended but an immigrant-rights group said they tracked five detentions. It was the second federal raid on Denver-area residents identified as Tren de Aragua gang members in a week, according to authorities.\n\nSingling out the Denver area\n\nFernando Martinez, 54, said he was sleeping off a hangover at a friend's apartment in the Cedar Run Apartments in Denver when police began banging on the door. He said he didn't have a chance to get up before they broke in.\n\n\"They come in with their guns drawn,” said Martinez, who was not arrested. \"They flash-banged me like three times,\" referring to disorientation devices commonly used by police.\n\nICE Denver’s Enforcement and Removal Operations team in a statement said it was targeting Tren de Aragua members but did not immediately release the names of those arrested or provide any other specifics. Media reports said at least seven Denver-area locations were targeted, including an apartment complex singled out by Trump on the campaign trail.\n\nFederal officials had previously established a command and logistics center at nearby Buckley Space Force base.\n\nTrump has repeatedly singled out Denver and Aurora for being too welcoming to people living illegally in the United States. Immigration authorities had reportedly planned to conduct widespread raids in the area last week, but they canceled them following publicity.\n\nColorado state law prohibits local police from participating in most types of immigration-related enforcement actions, and there was no sign that either Denver or Aurora police participated on Wednesday. Officials from both cities said they were monitoring the raids\n\nTrump and other top immigration-enforcement officials have demanded that local law enforcement do more to help.\n\n\"Unfortunately we have to come to the communities because we don't get the cooperation that we need from the jails,\" Vitello said in his video statement. \"But if we have to come out in the community to do this, that's what we’re going to do.\"\n\nTargeting gang members\n\nTrump and other members of his administration have often described Tren de Aragua as a violent, dangerous gang that is taking over cities across the country.\n\nBut law enforcement officials speaking with USA TODAY late last year described a group whose ranks in the U.S. are thin and whose activities – mostly petty crimes, often targeting other migrants – pale in comparison to other, more established gangs operating in the United States.\n\nLast week, federal authorities led by the DEA raided a \"makeshift nightclub\" in Denver frequented by suspected Tren de Aragua gang members. Authorities arrested 49 people, seized drugs and a \"large amount\" of U.S. currency, according to the DEA. ICE determined at least 41 of those arrested were present in the country illegally.\n\nOn Wednesday, several dozen ICE agents in body armor and carrying pepper spray and guns were staged after the raids in a Best Buy parking lot near central Denver, along with two large passenger buses with bars on the windows and three other armored vehicles.\n\nShortly before 11:30 a.m., a group of the ICE agents left the staging area and walked across the street to a convenience store. The two buses with bars on the windows left the area empty.\n\nRabbi Rachel Kobrim, 51, visited the Cedar Run after the morning raids, talking to residents to show her support for their presence.\n\n“I pray this will stop and that people will come out and stand up for their neighbors and their children’s classmates and the folks they work with and the people who work in fields and work in our stores,” said Kobrim, who leads nearby Congregation Rodef Shalom.\n\nSweeping up as many immigrants as possible\n\nRaquel Lane-Arellano of the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, which sent “rapid-response” volunteers to the scene to monitor the raids, said more than 100 agents from ICE, DEA and ATF showed up to the Cedar Run Apartments and began knocking on doors and asking people their immigration status.\n\nWhen asked by the advocates at the scene for judicial warrants, the agents would not produce any, she said.\n\nLane-Arellano said around five people were detained and driven away by the agents.\n\nShe said she didn’t believe the agents were targeting Tren de Aragua members, just sweeping up as many undocumented immigrants as possible.\n\n“It’s a farce,” Lane-Arellano said. “They are clearly targeting anyone who doesn’t have any documentation regardless of whether they have criminal backgrounds. They’re trying to intimidate and scare the community.”\n\n'They said they were looking for drugs'\n\nMartinez said he and his friends were briefly detained while investigators searched the small apartment.\n\n\"They said there were looking for drugs,” Martinez said. “There was no drugs in there but there were a lot of beer cans.\"\n\nMartinez, who said he previously lived in the complex, said he didn’t know anyone arrested Wednesday.\n\nReporters quickly fanned out across the Cedar Run complex to interview residents after federal officials left, talking to some workers as they loaded their cars with housecleaning supplies.\n\nCedar Run is a 384-unit complex where rents for one-bedroom apartments start about $1,090 monthly. Wednesday morning, many residents hung over their balconies to watch the situation unfolding, dogs barking at all the strangers. A number of Cedar Run residents told a USA TODAY reporter that they only speak Spanish.\n\nMartinez and several other residents said they have witnessed several crimes at the complex, including drug overdoses.\n\nIn a statement, the investment group that owns Cedar Run said it was approached by Denver city officials about 18 months ago to house people during a sharp increase in arrivals.\n\nThe city paid rent for a number of people for several months, Gelt Venture Partners said in the statement, but \"our attempt to help the city has resulted in numerous challenges, including suspected gang activity, unpaid rent and widespread significant damage throughout our complex.\"\n\nThe company said it complies with legal government orders and hoped to find a solution.\n\n\"The ongoing challenges on the property stem from a few problematic residents, creating a frustrating cycle where our attempts to mitigate issues are repeatedly undermined by damage and mistreatment,\" the company said. \"We want to assure the community that we are complying with all legal government orders while also respecting the privacy of those who call our community home.\"\n\nContributing: Lauren Villagran, USA TODAY\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/11/19/north-carolina-immigration-enforcement-trump-administration/87334104007/", "title": "Feds swarm North Carolina in 'Operation Charlotte's Web.' Why?", "text": "Updated Nov. 19, 2025, 12:31 p.m. ET\n\nIn Charlotte, North Carolina, federal agents smashed the window of a U.S. citizen's truck before pulling him to the ground. Tens of thousands of public school students have been reported absent. And businesses in immigrant communities shuttered as border agents patrolled the streets.\n\nNorth Carolina has become the latest focus of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, as federal agents surge into Charlotte and spread out across other Democratic-led cities in the notorious swing state, including Durham and Raleigh.\n\nLocated hundreds of miles from the southern and northern borders, North Carolina doesn't often generate national attention for immigration related issues, leading residents and local officials to question why the state that voted for Donald Trump in the last three presidential elections is being targeted.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said it launched “Operation Charlotte’s Web” to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”\n\nBut Charlotte is not considered a sanctuary city, and the state has some of the strictest immigration provisions in the country, experts said, including a mandate passed last year requiring local jails to hold arrested immigrants for a limited time so they can be picked up by federal authorities.\n\n“No cities in the state have sanctuary policies, if they did they would be violating state law,” said Rick Su, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina who specializes in immigration and local government.\n\nSu also noted that no city in North Carolina was included on the Justice Department’s list of \"sanctuary jurisdictions,\" which the agency defines as areas with “policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”\n\nOver the weekend, federal agents arrested over 130 undocumented immigrants in Charlotte, including several dozen with previous charges ranging from driving under the influence to aggravated assault, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). USA TODAY is unable to independently verify those figures as the agency has not released the names of those arrested, or their exact charges.\n\nAfter the weekend raids, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein criticized the operation as inducing “widespread fear” and said it is “not about public safety.”\n\n“They’re driving around Charlotte in unmarked cars wearing paramilitary garb, masks, stopping people on the street randomly based on the color of their skin,” Stein said. “This is not promoting safety in our communities. The people of North Carolina deserve to be safe.”\n\nCharlotte reeling from immigration sweeps as enforcement expands\n\nFederal agents began surging into Charlotte neighborhoods on Saturday, Nov. 15, spurring business closures across immigrant communities as protesters took to the streets to decry the operations.\n\nHomeland Security officials have not said how many agents have been sent to the state or how long the heightened enforcement will last.\n\nThe operations are being led by Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol official who coordinated immigration raids in Chicago that triggered lawsuits and fierce backlash over what many described as agents' aggressive enforcement tactics.\n\nBovino, who, according to a federal judge, admitted to lying about a rock-throwing incident used to justify the deployment tear gas on protesters, is from western North Carolina.\n\nSince the enforcement began in Charlotte, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District said over 30,000 students – about 20% of the student population – were absent on Monday, Nov. 17, according to preliminary data. Officials have not tied the low attendance numbers directly to the immigration enforcement. According to data from the school district, 31% of the student population identifies as Hispanic.\n\nVideos of border agents conducting arrests have drawn scrutiny, including one of masked agents smashing the window of a U.S. citizen and pulling him to the ground. The man, Willy Aceituno, was brought into a Border Patrol vehicle and released after he showed agents documentation proving his citizenship, he told the Associated Press.\n\n“I am deeply concerned with many of the videos I’ve seen,” said Mayor Vi Lyles in a statement on X. She added that her office is working to determine “what more we can do to support our community while working within complicated legal boundaries.”\n\nAt a city council meeting on Tuesday, Nov. 18, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said immigration authorities were spotted in Wake and Durham counties. She urged people to call the Raleigh Police Department if they feel unsafe or see something illegal.\n\nIn Durham, local officials held a news conference and spoke out against the federal intervention. Nida Allam, the chair of the Durham Board of County Commissioners, said border agents were in the city to stoke fear, not fight crime.\n\n“Durham is over 1,300 miles from the border,” Allam said. “None of this was about securing our borders, none of it was about enforcing the law. It was a show of force meant to scare people.”\n\nCharlotte, a recent flashpoint in the debate around crime in US cities\n\nThis is not the first time Charlotte has found itself at the center of national debates around public safety.\n\nIn August, the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, on a public train in Charlotte drew national headlines and the attention of the White House. Trump seized on the incident as an example of rampant violent crime in Democratic-led cities, pointing to the suspect’s lengthy criminal history.\n\nIn Charlotte, rates of violent crime have fallen sharply this year, according to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. The agency said through the first nine months of 2025, Charlotte saw a 20% reduction in violent crimes including as homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.\n\nSo far this year, Durham and Raleigh have seen rates of violent crime either stay level or dip when compared with 2024, according to their respective police departments.\n\nIn its recent statements, the Department of Homeland Security has sought to tie its immigration enforcement in North Carolina to public safety and policies that they say allow criminals to roam the streets.\n\nResearch has shown that, on average, immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Further, immigration violations, such as living in the country without proper documentation, are civil, not criminal, under U.S. law.\n\n\"Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”\n\nIn a statement posted to its website, DHS also accused local law enforcement in North Carolina of refusing to comply with almost 1,400 detainer requests by immigration officials to hold arrested suspects for 48 hours.\n\nIt is true that for years, Mecklenburg County, which encompasses Charlotte, did not honor such detainers. But that changed last year when the majority-Republican legislature overcame a veto and passed a measure forcing sheriff's offices to hold arrested immigrants temporarily for federal authorities.\n\nMecklenburg County Sheriff Garry L. McFadden, a Democrat, has publicly feuded with immigration authorities over enforcement but he has maintained that his office is complying with detainer requirements.\n\nIn recent months, he said he has sought to improve communication with federal immigration officials. In late October, McFadden called a meeting with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement's regional leaders.\n\n\"I made it clear that I do not want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,\" McFadden said after the meeting, according to local media reports.\n\nLast week, McFadden announced publicly that two federal officials told him Border Patrol agents would soon be arriving in Charlotte. He added, “specific details regarding the federal operation have not been disclosed.”\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/08/13/new-trump-immigration-policy-means-more-deportations-across-us/1880847001/", "title": "New Trump immigration policy means more deportations across US", "text": "Updated Aug. 13, 2019, 4:44 p.m. ET\n\nAaron Hall, an immigration attorney in Aurora, Colorado, is still trying to figure out what exactly to tell his clients about a new Trump administration policy that allows federal immigration agents to quickly deport undocumented immigrants they encounter anywhere in the U.S.\n\nFor the past 15 years, the fast-track deportation process, known as expedited removal, has been used mostly by Border Patrol agents near the border. But now, for the first time, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents can unilaterally question, arrest, detain and deport undocumented immigrants who have been here for less than two years that they encounter anywhere in the country.\n\nDoes that mean immigrants should carry all their papers proving their legal status every time they leave the house? Should undocumented immigrants carry paperwork showing they've been in the country longer than two years? Should all Hispanics approached by ICE remain silent and demand to speak with an attorney?\n\n\"It's really tricky,\" Hall said. The only certainty is that \"people who have legal immigration status, or have pending applications, or even U.S. citizens, will be put into expedited removal proceedings, and some will be deported before they’re able to make their case.\"\n\nThe nationwide expansion of expedited removal, which took effect July 23, may be one of the most consequential changes to immigration enforcement under Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nTo combat illegal immigration, the White House has focused mostly on the southern border, deploying National Guard and active-duty military troops to stem what they describe as a national security crisis. But expanding expedited removal moves immigration enforcement far from the border and into every community in the U.S.\n\nThat dramatic expansion, which has been considered since the early days of the Trump administration, has opened a wide range of questions about the way federal immigration agents will use their new powers, how to limit cases of racial profiling and how many legal residents and U.S. citizens will be caught up in the process.\n\n\"It means that the only limit on (the administration's) ability to deport brown-skinned people is going to be the number of detention beds they have,\" said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, legal director of the immigrant advocacy program at the Legal Aid Justice Center based in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nICE, which is primarily responsible for arresting undocumented immigrants in the interior of the country, said its agents do not, and will not, conduct \"random or indiscriminate\" raids as it expands its use of expedited removal. Instead, the agency said, it will continue using \"targeted enforcement operations\" to identify and arrest specific undocumented immigrants. ICE vowed to use the new powers responsibly.\n\n\"ICE's routine targeted enforcement model remains the same,\" spokesman Richard Rocha said. The only change is \"how ICE is able to remove aliens.\"\n\nExpedited removal was created by Congress in 1996. It allows federal immigration agents to bypass the regular deportation system, which includes court hearings, appeals and a final deportation order signed by a judge. The immigration agent needs only approval from a supervisor in the field, and the decision cannot be appealed in any court.\n\nThe main exception provided in the law is for undocumented immigrants who request asylum. Once the undocumented immigrant claims a fear of returning to his or her home country, the immigrant agent is supposed to pause the deportation process until an asylum officer can hear the person's claim.\n\nAt first, the program was used sparingly. President Bill Clinton allowed it to be used only against people who entered U.S. ports of entry without a visa or valid travel documents.\n\nIn 2004, President George W. Bush expanded its use to include people caught within 100 miles of the nation's land border with Canada and Mexico and people who had illegally entered the country within the previous two weeks. President Barack Obama maintained that structure.\n\nFrom the first days of Trump's presidency, the administration saw expedited removal as a way to get around the historic backlog in immigration court and more quickly deport more undocumented immigrants.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan made it official when his agency published a rule expanding expedited removal to the fullest extent allowable under law. Federal immigration agents can use expedited removal against people caught anywhere in the country who arrived within the previous two years.\n\nMcAleenan said the expansion is \"one more tool\" his agents could use to confront the \"security and humanitarian crisis on the Southwest border.\"\n\nImmigration attorneys, and even some government reports, raise serious questions about granting ICE agents powers to unilaterally deport people from the country.\n\nOne major concern is that people legally residing in the U.S. – citizens, permanent residents or visa holders – will be erroneously scooped up by federal agents.\n\nThat's what happened in June when Francisco Erwin Galicia, 17, who was born in Dallas, was arrested by Border Patrol agents. Even though his attorney said Galicia was carrying his Texas state ID and a wallet-sized copy of his birth certificate, the government held him for 26 days. It wasn't until The Dallas Morning News ran a story about his case that Galicia was released.\n\nSuch cases have been on the rise since Trump took office.\n\nIn the final year of Obama's presidency, ICE agents questioned 5,940 U.S. citizens, according to government data obtained by the American Immigration Council. In the first year of the Trump presidency, following orders that freed ICE agents to target a broader group of people, ICE agents questioned 27,540 U.S. citizens, a nearly fivefold increase.\n\n\"With this expansion of authority, we can expect that that would grow exponentially,\" said Royce Murray, managing director of programs at the council. \"And it's unclear what if any checks and balances there will be to make sure we are not putting U.S. citizens and others at real risk.\"\n\nThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, a body created by Congress, has studied expedited removal for more than a decade. In its first study published in 2005, it found that an \"alarming\" number of Border Patrol agents violated the rules of implementing expedited removal.\n\nIn some cases, agents didn't ask if people feared returning to their home country, a legally required step. In other cases, commission observers heard undocumented immigrants request asylum, but Border Patrol agents wrote down that they had not.\n\nIn all, 15% of the undocumented immigrants who requested asylum were deported before getting an asylum hearing, the report found. The commission reviewed the program again in 2016, and even though it was given far less access to expedited removal interviews, it concluded that problems remained rampant.\n\nThere are also questions about whether the use of expedited removal in places away from the border are legal. Congress allowed that to happen, but because the Trump administration is the first to try it out, the legality of the process has never been tested.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan group that conducts research for members of Congress, found that courts have generally allowed people to be deported through expedited removal near the border. But courts raised questions about eliminating due process rights for immigrants the longer they've been in the country and the farther they are captured from the border.\n\nThat's why the nationwide use of expedited removal \"remains an unresolved question,\" the service concluded in a report in 2018.\n\nU.S. law makes clear that people who are deported through expedited removal cannot challenge their deportation. Even challenging their initial arrest on constitutional grounds may be impossible, as evidenced by a case filed last year.\n\nIn February 2017, ICE agents arrested nine undocumented immigrants in two separate locations in Northern Virginia, even though they were searching for different people. A group of the immigrants sued, claiming they were racially profiled and wrongly detained in violation of their Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. A federal judge allowed the case to proceed, ruling that the undocumented immigrants raised \"clear violations of a known constitutional right.\"\n\nIn April, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit – one nominated by Trump, all three nominated by Republican presidents – struck down the lawsuit, ruling that Congress had not created any mechanism for ICE agents to be sued in federal court, meaning the case couldn't proceed.\n\nSandoval-Moshenberg, who represents the undocumented immigrants and appealed the court of appeals decision, said the ruling shows how helpless immigrants will be as ICE agents use their expanded powers.\n\n\"It's a shocking ruling,\" he said. \"It drastically expands the number of people who will never even go before a judge, so they have no one.\"\n\nIn a statement, ICE said it does not usually approach people on the street and question them about their immigration status. But the statement points out that Congress gave ICE agents the power to do just that, quoting a section of U.S. law that allows agents to interrogate any \"person believed to be an alien as to his or her right to be or remain in the United States.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and the American Immigration Council filed a lawsuit challenging the nationwide expansion of expedited removal last week.\n\nImmigrants remain in a state of apprehension, knowing that any encounter with ICE may lead to their quick removal from the country. Megan Lantz, a lawyer who represents immigrants who work in meatpacking plants and farms around Ames, Iowa, simply hopes she'll be able to talk to immigrants before they're on a plane back home.\n\n\"Immigration officers have total authority here,\" she said. \"So there's no chance for me as a lawyer to fight for that person. That is really concerning.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/13"}]}

The corporation noted in the filing that the suit was necessary because importers are not guaranteed to receive a refund if the high court strikes down the tariffs, unless they sue.\n\nCostco also claims in the lawsuit that Customs and Border Protection denied its request to delay the calculation of the total tariffs that it owes. The lawsuit claims that Costco’s ability to receive a refund will be significantly impacted if those calculations are completed.\n\nThe suit is separate from the larger case challenging Trump’s tariffs that the Supreme Court heard on Nov. 5.\n\nOther companies have sued to preserve refund rights, but the Issaquah, Washington-based retail warehouse club operator is among the largest to sue the administration so far. Others that have sought to protect tariff refunds include Bumble Bee Foods, eyeglass giant EssilorLuxottica, Kawasaki Motors, Revlon, and Yokohama Tire, court records show.\n\nCBP deferred to an earlier White House statement on tariffs in an email sent to USA TODAY on Dec. 2. Costco did not respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment on Dec. 1.\n\nTrump touts tariffs, so why are small businesses they suing to stop them?\n\n‘Razor-close case’\n\nDuring nearly three hours of debate on Nov. 5, Supreme Court justices questioned whether Trump has the power to impose sweeping tariffs on most imports using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Several legal experts said the justices’ questions reveal a lot about where they stand on Trump’s policy.\n\nAshley Akers, a former Justice Department attorney now with the law firm Holland & Knight, previously told USA TODAY that she heard a “notable skepticism from justices across the ideological spectrum.”\n\n“Overall, it felt like a strong day for the tariff challengers, though it feels like this will be a razor-close case,” Akers said.\n\nSeveral justices were concerned that if they sided with Trump, Congress would lose control over tariffs, even though the Constitution gives that power to lawmakers, said Curtis A. Bradley, an expert on foreign relations law at the University of Chicago Law School.\n\nOliver Dunford, an attorney with the libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation, said the case is complicated enough without a majority of the court focusing on just one legal argument.\n\n“If I had to guess,” Dunford said, “I’d guess that the court will rule against the president without agreeing on the reason.”\n\nThe Supreme Court took the tariff case on an accelerated basis, but has not said when it will rule.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe, Bart Jansen, and Aysha Bagchi, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/01/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-consequences/86947342007/", "title": "Are Trump's tariffs too big to fail at the Supreme Court?", "text": "Nov. 1, 2025 Updated Nov. 5, 2025, 9:36 a.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON – As President Donald Trump sees it, the Supreme Court faces a stark choice when it considers on Nov. 5 whether to uphold the sweeping tariffs he’s imposed on nearly every product brought into the United States.\n\nBack the tariffs and the nation will have “unprecedented success.”\n\nStrike them down and there will be “catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy and the economy,” the administration told the justices in its written briefs before Wednesday's oral arguments.\n\nWhile Trump’s rhetoric may be unusually dramatic for a court filing, there’s no question that the stakes are huge – for Trump’s agenda, the economy, the federal budget, presidential power and for businesses and households that are bearing the brunt of the tariffs.\n\n“Just about every way you look at it, it’s a big deal,” said Daniel Walters, an expert on administrative law at Texas A&M University School of Law.\n\n'Breathtaking assertion of power'\n\nTrump has argued that trillions of dollars in new tariffs are needed to reduce persistent trade deficits, which he says have hollowed out the nation’s manufacturing base, undermined critical supply chains and allowed other nations to take advantage of the United States.\n\nThe businesses and states challenging the import fees say that they’re doing more harm than good, including raising costs and uncertainty for consumers and businesses.\n\nAnd they argue the president doesn’t have the legal authority to take such expansive and consequential action.\n\n“This is a breathtaking assertion of power,” lawyers for some of the challengers told the high court in a filing.\n\nNot unusual for Supreme Court to hear major economic cases\n\nTo be sure, it’s not unusual for the Supreme Court to decide cases with big effects on the economy.\n\nIn 1935, the court narrowly upheld a change Congress made to contracts so that repayments couldn't be requested in gold rather than dollars, notes legal historian Stuart Banner, author of the book \"The Most Powerful Court in the World.\"\n\nBecause President Franklin D. Roosevelt had recently devalued the dollar, a decision the other way would have increased most debts by 60%. The Roosevelt administration considered the case so significant that the president planned to disobey the court if the ruling came out differently, Banner said.\n\nMichael McConnell, a Stanford Law School professor and one of the lawyers representing some of the businesses challenging the tariffs, said the first case he teaches in his constitutional law class is the court’s 1952 ruling that President Harry Truman could not seize private steel mills to keep production going during the Korean War.\n\n“You can scarcely imagine anything more important than, at a time of war, being able to have armaments,” he said. “And the Supreme Court said, 'No, there is no authorization for that.' And this is widely considered to be the Supreme Court’s finest hour.”\n\nHigh court has considered cases central to a president's agenda\n\nHistorically, it’s also not unprecedented for the court to take cases as central to a president’s agenda as the tariffs are to Trump’s economic and foreign policy plans.\n\nMatthew Fitzgerald, a partner at the law firm McGuireWoods who previously clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas, said the case reminds him of the court’s rejection of a challenge to President Barack Obama’s health care initiative.\n\n“And there were justices on the court, even conservative-leaning justices, who were very wary of overturning a president’s signature achievement on any sort of questionable ground at all,” Fitzgerald said at a McGuireWoods event previewing the court's term. “I wonder if that same sort of impulse will play in here in Trump’s favor.”\n\nBut Alan Morrison, who teaches at George Washington University Law School, noted that – unlike Trump’s tariffs – Obamacare was explicitly created by Congress through the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court would’ve been taking on both the legislative and executive branches if it had struck down that measure.\n\n“The law that Trump is relying on here is a law that was passed in 1977 and doesn’t mention trade at all,” Morrison said. \"I can’t think of anything where a president has claimed this level of power over the economy.”\n\nPresident's emergency authority could be expanded\n\nThat 1977 law, called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, has historically been used to impose economic sanctions and other penalties on foreign countries. But the administration contends that the authority the law gives presidents to “regulate” importation in response to an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national interests includes the power to impose tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce argues it defies common sense to think that Congress meant to give presidents such “unprecedented authority to upend the domestic economy through taxation” without directly saying so.\n\n“In other words, the President urged the court to uphold his tariff decisions because of their vast economic and political significance,” the influential business group wrote in a brief opposing the tariffs. “Yet it is precisely that significance which demands an unambiguous authorization from Congress.”\n\nIf the court doesn’t agree, Trump could use the same law to impose excise taxes on many other things, including the transportation of goods, wire communications, bank transactions and more, said Peter M. Shane, an expert on the separation of powers at New York University.\n\n“He could put excises on lots and lots and lots of things,” Shane said. “That would be a very big deal.”\n\nAnd a decision in Trump’s favor could also indicate how deferential the court will be to presidents in deciding when emergency powers can be triggered, said Walters at Texas A&M University School of Law.\n\n“If this is expansively interpreted by the Supreme Court, that Trump is allowed to do this, it’s not hard to imagine there would be other emergency statutes that would open up other things beyond economic regulations,” he said.\n\nA ruling against Trump would create a big budget hole\n\nIf the court rules against Trump, however, the administration might have to refund at least $90 billion in tariff revenues, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. (The amount will grow the longer it takes the court to reach a decision.)\n\n“That would create a lot of problems for the federal government,” said Juscelino Colares, a trade expert at Case Western Reserve University. “This is the biggest trade case ever, by orders of magnitude.”\n\nIt could be a logistical problem, potentially subject to more litigation, and would also impact the federal budget.\n\nIn addition to paying back tariffs already collected, the government would not bring in about $2.2 trillion over the next decade that Republicans were counting on to pay for much of the cost of Trump’s big tax and policy bill, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\n“It’s a massive amount of money,” said Marc Goldwein, the group’s senior policy director.\n\nTrump could use other, nonemergency laws to impose new tariffs, but that would take time and may also face challenges.\n\nCongress could find other ways to raise the revenue, such as through a business consumption tax that somewhat resembles tariffs.\n\nBut Goldwein thinks it's more likely lawmakers won’t replace the revenue, which would put the United States closer to the precarious situation of the national debt growing fast enough to spark a debt crisis.\n\n“We’re kind of on the cusp of that,” he said.\n\nExperts are 'flying blind' in predicting which way the court will rule\n\nHow the high court is likely to rule is anyone’s guess.\n\nColares thinks the odds are slightly in Trump’s favor.\n\n“It’s not that the president is acting in an area where we’re not used to seeing presidents act,” he said. “Trade is diplomacy. Diplomacy encompasses trade.”\n\nShane thinks the odds are slightly against Trump.\n\n“There are numerous other ways in which Congress has explicitly given tariff adjustment power to the president,” he said, “and it seems quite surprising they would do so by implication here.”\n\nAnd Walters, the administrative law expert, said he can’t stress enough how much everyone is “flying blind in trying to understand what the court might do.”\n\n“You have a lot of legal factors, political factors and more at play here,” he said. “It’s just not something that lends itself to a lot of certainty.”\n\n(This story was updated to add a video.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/california/2025/04/16/california-will-sue-trump-and-seek-to-stop-tariffs-immediately-newsom-says/83111535007/", "title": "California sues Trump, seeks to stop tariffs immediately", "text": "Updated April 16, 2025, 4:57 p.m. ET\n\nAI-assisted summary A new lawsuit filed by the state of California argues President Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs is unlawful.\n\nState officials point to prior Supreme Court holdings to argue significant economic actions require clear Congressional authorization.\n\n(This story has been updated with new information.)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta sued President Donald Trump on Wednesday April 16, seeking an immediate injunction to stop what they say is his illegal use of emergency powers to impose highly damaging tariffs \"that hurt states, consumers, and businesses.\".\n\nTariffs have an outsized impact on California businesses, the two state officials argue, including more than 60,000 small business exporters. The tariffs will also affect access to construction materials critical to rebuilding after the Los Angeles fires, the officials say, including timber, wood, steel and aluminum, and key drywall components. Retaliatory tariffs will also impact farmers and ranchers, they say.\n\n“President Trump’s unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on California families, businesses, and our economy — driving up prices and threatening jobs. We’re standing up for American families who can’t afford to let the chaos continue,” said Newsom in a news release.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, requests the court immediately halt the sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump against nations around the world, saying he lacks the authority to impose them through the International Economic Emergency Powers Act unilaterally, and is \"creating immediate and irreparable harm to California, the largest economy, manufacturing, and agriculture state in the nation.\"\n\nThat act, passed by Congress in 1977, affords a U.S. President a broad set of powers to be used in an emergency, but does not include tariffs as an option, state officials argue, making Trump's recent actions unlawful.\n\nDuring a press conference Wednesday, April 16, Bonta described Trump’s actions as an attempt to override Congress — and thereby “trampling over his own party\" in control of Congress — and “steamroll” the separation of powers.\n\n“Congress hasn't given him the authority to impose these sweeping and chaotic tariffs pursuant to emergency powers, which means he can't do it,” Bonta said. “Bottom line, Trump doesn't have the singular power to radically upend the country's economic landscape.”\n\nSupreme Court showdown on tariffs likely between California, Trump administration\n\nThe filing appears to set the stage for a showdown in the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. The lawsuit will invoke the Supreme Court’s major questions doctrine, \"which holds that in matters of vast economic and political significance, federal agencies and the executive branch must have clear and specific authorization from Congress.\"\n\nIn recent years, California officials note, the high court has used the standard to strike down major initiatives, including President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan and President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, ruling that broad impacts on the national economy cannot rest on vague statutory authority.\n\nThey say it's time to do the same with Trump, arguing he lacks the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs against Mexico, China, and Canada or create an across-the-board 10% tariff, and that his use of the International Emergency Powers Act to enact them is \"unlawful and unprecedented.\"\n\n\"It is difficult to imagine a more economically significant set of actions than the one Trump is taking on tariffs, which have inflicted hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses on a whim, using a statute that doesn’t mention tariffs,\" the release says. \"The Court, applying this doctrine even-handedly, will find that such expansive action absent congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.\"\n\nNewsom echoed the latter point during Wednesday's press conference, saying the lawsuit is a \"lock\" if the Supreme Court is consistent.\n\nBonta said in the earlier news release: “The President’s chaotic and haphazard implementation of tariffs is not only deeply troubling, it’s illegal. As the fifth largest economy in the world, California understands global trade policy is not just a game.\"\n\nHe added, \"Californians are bracing for fallout from the impact of the President’s choices — from farmers in the Central Valley, to small businesses in Sacramento, and worried families at the kitchen table. ... I am proud to go to bat alongside Governor Newsom to fight for California’s vibrant economy, businesses, and residents.”\n\nHow big is California's economy?\n\nCalifornia’s gross domestic product was $3.9 trillion in 2023, state officials say, which is 50% bigger than the nation’s next-largest state, Texas. The state also sends over $83 billion more to the federal government than it receives in federal funding, and is the leading agricultural producer in the country. It also has over 36,000 manufacturing firms employing over 1.1 million Californians.\n\nThose firms, sometimes spurred by California regulations against harmful products or pollution, have created new industries and supplied the world with goods spanning aerospace, computers and electronics, and, most recently, zero-emission vehicles\n\nCalifornia engaged in nearly $675 billion in two-way trade in 2024, and its economy and workers rely heavily on trade, officials say, particularly with Mexico, Canada, and China — the state's top 3 trade partners. Over 40% of the Golden State's imports come from these countries, totaling $203 billion of more $491 billion in goods imported by California in 2024.\n\nThe three countries are also the state's top three export destinations, buying nearly $67 billion in California exports, over one-third of the state’s $183 billion in exported goods in 2024.\n\nTrump has argued that lopsided imports over exports, like those in the Golden State, are a national emergency and security risk. But California officials see it differently.\n\n\"As the largest economy in the nation, the largest agricultural state, and the largest U.S. trading partner, the harm of the tariffs on California is immense. President Trump’s policies have already inflicted hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses,\" the governor's office said in its release.\n\nDuring Wednesday's press conference, Newsom repeatedly described Trump's tariffs as disproportionately impacting California.\n\nThe lawsuit follows the governor’s recent announcement of California’s goal to create new strategic trade relationships with international partners, to strengthen shared economic resilience and protect state businesses, workers, and supply chains. Newsom also has announced a new international campaign to help maintain a strong tourism partnership between California and Canada.

Trump is setting rates by bypassing laws that require a more detailed process for imposing tariffs in limited circumstances.\n\n“I can’t really plan if the rates might change again next month,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nBusinesses are not embracing Trump's tariffs\n\nAmerican businesses moving overseas is the opposite outcome Trump promised when he imposed tariffs on nearly every product imported into the United States.\n\nTrump said persistent trade deficits have become an emergency because they’ve hollowed out the nation’s manufacturing base. He’s also used tariffs as a way to get China, Mexico and Canada to do more to stop illegal drugs from coming into the United States.\n\nBut businesses are not embracing his strategy.\n\nLevi is among the small business owners challenging Trump’s tariffs, an issue the Supreme Court will take up on Nov. 5.\n\nOther businesses arguing that Trump overstepped his authority include a Vermont company that makes women’s cycling gear, two Illinois-based businesses that sell educational toys and a wine importer based in New York City.\n\n“These tariffs threatened the very existence of small businesses like mine, making it difficult to survive, let alone grow,” Victor Owen Schwartz, who founded his wine and spirits import business nearly 40 years ago with his mother, said of his decision to take on the president. “I was shocked that those with much more power and money did not step up.”\n\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes Trump's tariffs\n\nWhile Fortune 500 companies did not file suit as Schwartz did, major business organizations have spoken out against the tariffs.\n\nIn a filing supporting the challenges, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Consumer Technology Association told the Supreme Court the question of whether the tariffs are legal is of “paramount importance to the business community.”\n\nTrump’s tariffs injected greater uncertainty into the trade economy than the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and, unless stopped by the court, would let presidents claim “unprecedented authority to upend the domestic economy through taxation,” the groups wrote.\n\nA 'blessing for the American factory worker'\n\nDrew Greenblatt, CEO of Marlin Steel Wire Products, is a rare businessman championing the tariffs.\n\nGreenblatt said the import fees evened the playing field for companies like his, which rely on U.S.-made steel to make metal baskets and other wire products in Baltimore, Michigan and Indiana factories.\n\nGreenblatt competes against companies that get their steel from China, which subsidizes its steel industry.\n\nBut after tariffs were imposed on Canada, Marlin Steel took a $1.3 million job away from a Canadian company that uses Chinese steel. That order is funding six shifts around the clock, he said.\n\n“Tariffs are a leveling tactic because there are a lot of people out there not playing fair,” he said. “It’s a blessing for the American factory worker.”\n\nGreenblatt said he’s not naïve enough to think all the manufacturing jobs that migrated overseas will come back because of the tariffs. But if just 10% or 20% do, he said, “our factories will double or triple in size.”\n\nEconomists argue tariffs hurt more than they help\n\nMichael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank that promotes the free enterprise system, said there’s no question that the tariffs help some businesses.\n\nBut on balance, he said, American manufacturers are worse off.\n\nDomestic manufacturers import a lot of materials and equipment they need to make their finished product, he said. And the higher cost from those “intermediate goods” is greater than the benefits of import protections.\n\nThat was proven, Strain said, during the trade war of Trump’s first administration. Economists for the Federal Reserve estimated that the United States lost five times more manufacturing jobs than it gained.\n\nA group of economists – including Strain and former U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke – told the Supreme Court that the decline in domestic manufacturing jobs has nothing to do with the trade deficit.\n\n“In fact, the United States does not manufacture less today than it did in the past,” the economists said in a filing supporting the businesses challenging the tariffs. “Instead, the same manufacturing now requires fewer people and is less expensive relative to other goods.”\n\nSmall businesses could be hurt the most\n\nMore than 700 small businesses signed onto a separate brief telling the court their decision “will determine whether many small and micro businesses across the United States can survive.”\n\nCassie Abel, the CEO of Wild Rye, an Idaho company that produces outdoor apparel for women that is made in China, said she leveraged her house to help finance her business.\n\n“So every tariff increase means the risk of losing my home,” she said. “My family’s housing is at stake in addition to everything else.”\n\nJess Nepstad, the chief adventure officer with a Montana-based company that designs and sells coffee storage and brewing equipment, said he hadn’t realized how nerve-wracking the tariffs are until the day in May when a lower court ruled that Trump lacked the power to impose sweeping tariffs.\n\n“I remember sitting out on my porch, eight o’clock at night, hearing that ruling and I actually wept,” he said. “I had no idea I was carrying that much stress.”\n\nAsked what it’s like taking on the president of the United States from his small workshop in Charlottesville, Levi – the founder of MicroKits – said it “kind of just feels like being a citizen.”\n\n“As a citizen, you can go to the courts and be like, 'I’m not sure if the government can do this. Let’s figure this out,’ ” he said.\n\nWhatever the justices decide, Levi hopes they will rule quickly.\n\n“The main thing is I just want enough certainty,” he said, “to be able to move my business forward.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/04/16/california-newsom-sue-trump-tariffs/83119418007/", "title": "California Gov.

But the court has also been receptive to conservative arguments that Congress can’t give too much of its power to the executive branch. And when it does give substantial decision-making authority, it must do so clearly. That was the basis for the court’s rejection of some of President Joe Biden’s policies, which he justified because of “emergencies.”\n\nWhichever way the justices rule, their decision will affect Trump’s agenda, the economy, the federal budget, presidential power and businesses and households that are bearing the brunt of the tariffs.\n\nAmericans headed into a ‘rough’ holiday season if tariffs continue, Arizona AG says\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said the tariff case before the Supreme Court could be the “most important case this court has heard in 100 years,” citing the widespread economic impact on everyone from restaurateurs and hotel owners to cattle ranchers in her state.Mayes, who was joined by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and California Attorney General Rob Bonta, said she and her fellow attorneys general who are challenging the tariffs “feel really good” about the arguments made and questions asked by the justices, particularly those related to the major question doctrine.But if the court doesn’t rule in their favor, Mayes warned Americans would be in for a “really rough” holiday season.“We needed to slay this dragon called tariffs or taxes because people of this country are hurting,” she said.– N’dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nSmall business owner says ‘very survival is at stake’ in tariff case\n\nEverything is on the line for businesses impacted by these tariffs, according to the business owners involved in the case.\n\nAfter oral arguments wrapped up on Nov. 4, Victor Owen Schwartz reiterated that the “arbitrary” and “unpredictable” tariffs have thrown his New York-based wine importing business into chaos.Schwartz, one of the plaintiffs in the case challenging the tariffs, said small businesses like his and American consumers are bearing the brunt of the tariff costs.“When I was given the chance to speak up for small American businesses, I took it. I had to,” Schwartz told reporters in front of the Supreme Court. “Our very survival is at stake.”\n\n– N’dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nWhat is the major questions doctrine?\n\nThe major questions doctrine is a principle that the Supreme Court has established in other cases. It means presidents only have the authority to enact major policies if Congress clearly gives them that authority.\n\nThe high court has said in recent years that the executive branch can’t take actions that have a major impact on the economy or are a matter of great “political significance” without clear authorization from Congress.\n\nIn this case, the businesses and states challenging Trump's tariffs say the tariffs are so significant that they qualify as a major question. That would mean Congress needed to be especially clear about granting that authority. According to those challenging the tariffs, it wasn't.\n\nThe Trump administration has said Congress clearly granted Trump this authority.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi and Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat happened at the Supreme Court on Nov. 5?\n\nOn Nov. 5, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that could decide if President Donald Trump can keep the steep tariffs he has slapped on countries around the world.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court sometimes takes months to decide its biggest cases, the justices may try to rule faster on the tariff case. That’s in part because the longer Trump's tariffs are in place, the more money the government will collect that it may have to refund.\n\nThe justices are also aware that the uncertainty about the tariffs is making it hard for affected businesses to plan.\n\nThe court is looking at whether it was legal for Trump to use a 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to impose broad tariffs.\n\nThe challengers – a group of states and small businesses – said Trump is stretching the word \"regulate\" to encompass imposing broad taxes. The Trump administration says taxing imports is just another form of regulation.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Maureen Groppe\n\nWho is Neal Katyal?\n\nNeal Katyal, who has argued more than 50 cases before the Supreme Court, is representing a group of businesses in the high-profile case.\n\nKatyal, now a partner in the Washington, DC office of the Milbank LLP law firm, is the former Acting Solicitor General of the United States, and has argued 52 cases before the court, with more pending, according to his official bio on the Milbank website.\n\nA familiar face on TV news programs, Katyal won the landmark voting case Moore v. Harper, which Judge Michael Luttig described as “the most important case for American democracy in the almost two and a half centuries since America’s founding.”\n\nLuttig also said Katyal’s argument “was the single best oral argument I have ever heard made in the Supreme Court of the United States.” His other wins include successfully striking down the Guantanamo military tribunals, successfully defending the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act and successfully defending the Peace Cross in Maryland.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nWho is John Sauer?\n\nJohn Sauer is the U.S. solicitor general. His role is to supervise and run U.S. government litigation at the Supreme Court. He was appointed by President Donald Trump in 2025.\n\nSauer previously represented Trump personally at the U.S. Supreme Court in 2024, when Trump was arguing that he was protected from federal criminal charges alleging he illegally conspired to overturn the 2020 election. Sauer argued that Trump enjoyed significant immunity from prosecution as a former president.\n\nSauer also served as Missouri's solicitor general from 2017 to 2023.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nKavanaugh agrees Trump may not need powers at issue\n\nOregon Solicitor General Benjamin Gutman had an answer that may have helped satisfy Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s concerns about restricting a president’s ability to respond to an emergency.\n\nKavanaugh had noted that the tariffs President Trump has imposed on India are aimed at trying to settle the war between Russia and Ukraine. If the court rules against the tariffs, that tool is “out the window,” he said.\n\nGutman noted that there are laws other than the one Trump is relying on that do allow presidents to impose tariffs in specific circumstances.\n\n“That’s a good point,” Kavanaugh replied.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSotomayor questions whether Congress granted president broad tariff power\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor questioned whether Congress would have granted a president such wide-ranging power as tariffs without explicitly saying so in the disputed statute.\n\nShe noted that Trump threatened a 10% tariff on Canada for running an ad during the World Series and a 40% tariff on Brazil because it prosecuted a former president.\n\n“The point is, those may be good policies, but does a statute that gives without limit the power to a president to impose this kind of tax – does it require more than the word regulate?” Sotomayor asked.\n\n“Exactly,” replied Oregon Solicitor General Benjamin Gutman, who represented states opposed to Trump’s tariffs.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTop Oregon government lawyer says Trump isn't helped by 19th-century history\n\nBenjamin Gutman, Oregon's solicitor general, is now arguing on behalf of several states that have challenged the president's tariffs. He opened his portion of the arguments by trying to distinguish some 19th-century Supreme Court decisions from the case the court is considering now.\n\nGutman said those old decisions dealt with the president's power to impose tariffs in territories the military was occupying during wartime, and didn't include the power to impose tariffs on imports coming into the U.S.\n\n\"I don't think any of that provides authority for this general notion that there is a background principle that the president, even in wartime, has an Article II authority to impose tariffs,\" Gutman said. Article II is the part of the Constitution that outlines the powers of the president.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTariffs 'not a donut hole\" they're 'a different kind of pastry’\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh asked the critics of tariffs how Congress provided the president with the power to shut down all trade with every other country or set severe quotas on imports, but not allow him to impose a 1% tariff on imports.\n\n“That leaves, as the government said in its briefs, an odd donut hole in the statute,” Kavanaugh said. “That doesn’t seem – but I want to get your answer – to have a lot of common sense behind it.”\n\nOregon Solicitor General Benjamin Gutman said tariffs are a fundamentally different power than embargoes.\n\n“It’s not a donut hole, it’s a different kind of pastry,” Gutman said to laughter in the courtroom, which Kavanaugh complimented as “a good one.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\n‘Zilch’: Tariff opponent says Congress didn’t envision tariffs while debating bill\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked whether anything in the legislative history of the disputed 1977 statute provided for tariffs.\n\nNeal Katyal, a lawyer representing small businesses fighting the tariffs, said there is one brief mention of tariffs in the public record, which, “if I blinked, I would miss it.”\n\nBut Katyal said that Congress passed the bill by voice vote, which wouldn’t have happened if it granted the president the power to impose tariffs, one of the most contentious debates in the country’s history.\n\n“You’re saying there’s nothing in the legislative history?” Jackson asked.\n\n“Zilch,” Katyal said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nBarrett asks about reimbursements for businesses if the tariffs are illegal\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett asked how difficult it would be for the government to refund the tens of billions of dollars in tariffs already collected if the court ruled they were illegal.\n\n“Would it be a complete mess?” Barrett asked the lawyer for the businesses challenging the tariffs.\n\nNeal Katyal said the government has said it would reimburse the specific businesses he’s representing. Other importers would have to rely on complicated rules set in trade laws to get refunds.\n\n“So, a mess,” Barrett said.\n\nKatyal responded that even if reimbursements would be difficult, that’s not a reason for the court to side with the administration.\n\nAnd the court can also rule that businesses can’t get reimbursed, even if the justices strike down the tariffs, he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n'Torn up the entire tariff architecture': lawyer for businesses says Trump tariffs are different\n\nNeal Katyal, who is arguing on behalf of businesses challenging the Trump tariffs, pushed back on a question from Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, that suggested Congress may have previously approved of Nixon using emergency powers to impose temporary 10% tariffs – and by extension, empowered Trump to impose his current tariffs.\n\n\"This president has torn up the entire tariff architecture,\" Katyal said. As an example, he said that Trump has imposed a 39% tariff on an ally, Switzerland, despite a U.S. trade surplus with the country.\n\n\"That is just not something that any president has ever had the power to do in our history,\" Katyal said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nKavanaugh suggests he's not sure yet how he would rule on Trump tariffs\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, suggested that he hasn't made up his mind about the case. He said he's trying to figure out whether Congress was granting presidents the power to impose these types of tariffs when it passed a law in 1977 giving the president power to \"regulate importation.\"\n\nCongress knew at that time that President Richard Nixon, in 1971, had invoked an earlier, similar law to impose temporary 10% tariffs. If Congress disagreed with that move from Nixon, Kavanaugh said, it could have made it clear in the 1977 law that it wasn't providing that kind of power.\n\n\"Why didn't they say regulate, but not tariffs?\" Kavanaugh asked.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAlito asks whether law at issue was intended to be open-ended\n\nJustice Samuel Alito asked the lawyer representing the small businesses why the federal law at issue needed to more specifically lay out a president’s powers. Aren’t laws intended to address emergency provisions by nature open-ended, Alito asked.\n\nLawyer Neal Katyal disagreed. He said other emergency statutes include extremely serious limits on a president’s authority.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nAlito asks if Congress must authorize tariffs if they aren’t collected\n\nJustice Samuel Alito asked if Congress would need to authorize tariffs if a president wielded them as just a threat.\n\nAlito proposed that a president could threaten a tariff to take effect in 90 days to discourage another country from declaring war and then cancel the tariff.\n\n“Would that be a revenue-raising tariff?” Alito asked.\n\nNeal Katyal, a lawyer representing small businesses, said it was. He said tariffs would have to be authorized by Congress even if they weren’t collected.\n\n“Taxation is special and different,” Katyal said. “It is the most powerful thing the government does.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nAlito compares tariffs to national park fees\n\nJustice Samuel Alito focused on how the tariffs raise money by asking whether a national park could charge entry fees to “regulate” admission, as Trump has imposed tariffs to regulate imports.\n\nNeal Katyal, a lawyer for small businesses fighting the tariffs, said if the fees raised revenue, Congress would have to authorize it and not have parks impose fees as part of regulating entries.\n\n“I do dispute that, absolutely,” Katyal said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nRoberts pushes on the foreign policy role of tariffs\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who had been tough on the Justice Department, started his questioning of the DOJ's opposing lawyers by probing one of their weakest points: the foreign policy role of tariffs.\n\nRoberts said the small businesses challenging the tariffs can’t dismiss the fact that tariffs directly implicate a president’s foreign affairs powers.\n\nNeal Katyal, the lawyer representing small businesses, agreed that tariffs have foreign policy implications. But the founding fathers still made tariffs the exclusive power of Congress, he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat a SCOTUS ruling against Trump's tariffs could mean for Americans\n\nTheoretically, if the Supreme Court strikes down Trump's tariffs, businesses may expect refunds and consumers may expect some potential price decreases in the long run. Both should expect more uncertainty.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed to hear Trump’s appeal of lower court rulings that he overreached when he invoked a 1977 law to impose tariffs on imports from most countries. If the court sides against him, many – but not all – of the tariffs imposed during 2025 could be affected.\n\nTrump has said the United States will face an \"economic disaster\" unless the tariffs remain in place and called the case a matter of \"LIFE OR DEATH\" for the country in a post on Truth Social the night before oral arguments began.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nSmall-business lawyer calls Trump argument ‘an open-ended power to junk the tariff laws’\n\nNeal Katyal, a lawyer representing small businesses fighting the tariffs, said it was “simply implausible” that Congress handed the president the power to overhaul the entire tariff regime and the country’s economy multiple times on his own.\n\n“As Justices Gorsuch and Barrett just said, this is a one-way ratchet,” Katyal said. “We will never get this power back if the government wins this case.”\n\nKatyal said if Trump wins, a future president could declare another emergency, such as climate change, and set different tariffs.\n\n“This is an open-ended power to junk the tariff laws and is certainly not conveyed by the word regulate,” Katyal said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nBarrett: It will be hard for Congress to get tariffing power back\n\nAddressing the balance of power issue at the heart of the case, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wondered what recourse lawmakers would have if they didn’t want to cede so much tariffing power to presidents under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nCongress would need a veto-proof majority to change the law, she said, because a president would try to kill it.\n\n“Let’s say that we adopt your interpretation of the statute,” Barrett said. “If Congress said, `Whoa, we don’t like that. That gives a president too much authority under IEEPA,’ it’s going to have a very hard time pulling that tariff power out of IEEPA, correct?”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n'It's a one-way ratchet': Conservative Justice Gorsuch suggests Trump tariffs are overreach\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, a Donald Trump appointee, appeared to voice sharp criticism of the administration's arguments about emergency powers.\n\nGorsuch noted that, because of the president's power to veto congressional legislation, Congress doesn't have much power to rein in the president with new legislation, once Congress has given more power to the president. (Congress needs a two-thirds vote to override a presidential veto.)\n\nThat, Gorsuch suggested, is a reason to be skeptical of the administration's position that Congress has ceded over to the executive branch the type of broad emergency powers the president is now invoking.\n\n\"What happens when the president simply vetoes legislation to try to take these powers back?\" Gorsuch asked. \"Congress, as a practical matter in the real world, it can never get that power back.\"\n\n\"It's a one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people's elected representatives,\" Gorsuch added.\n\n\"I disagree with that,\" Trump administration lawyer John Sauer adamantly responded. He said there was a recent example of Congress terminating the COVID-19 emergency.\n\nGorsuch responded that the president had agreed to that move from Congress.\n\n\"It takes a super-majority, a veto-proof majority, to get it back,\" Gorsuch said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nGorsuch asks whether Congress could surrender power to tax, declare war\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch asked Sauer, if the president's authority to conduct foreign affairs is unreviewable and he arguably has the power to impose tariffs, whether Congress could abdicate its power to declare war.\n\n“You say that we shouldn’t be so concerned about the area of foreign affairs because of the president’s inherent powers,” Gorsuch said. “What would prevent Congress from abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce – or, for that matter, declare war – to the president?”\n\nSauer said his broad view of executive power doesn’t go that far.\n\n“We don’t assert that here,” Sauer said. “We don’t contend he could do that.”\n\nSauer had argued that the courts should give deference and set limited restrictions on the president governing foreign affairs. But Gorsuch said he had weakened his position by acknowledging the president couldn’t claim the power to declare war.\n\n“You’ve backed off that position,” Gorsuch said with a chuckle.\n\n“Maybe that’s fair to say,” Sauer replied to laughter in the court. “That would really be an abdication rather than a delegation.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nKavanaugh asks why Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh asked the Justice Department why no other president had tried to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs.\n\nSolicitor General John Sauer said that tariffs weren't the ideal way to address the emergencies that other presidents declared under the law.\n\nPlus, there’s no question that Trump is by far more comfortable with tariffs as an economic and foreign policy tool than his predecessors, Sauer said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nKagan says Trump wants unlimited tariff authority for presidents\n\nJustice Elena Kagan questioned why presidents would ever use statutes that specifically allow for tariffs in particular circumstances if President Trump is right that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act gives presidents the ability to “blow past those limits.”\n\nSolicitor General John Sauer said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act has its own constraints, including that there has to be an emergency.\n\nKagan noted that the administration argues that courts can’t review a president’s emergency declaration.\n\n“So that doesn’t seem like much of a constraint,” she said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nThomas invites Trump lawyer to defend tariffs\n\nAfter John Sauer, the lawyer arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, was peppered with tough questions from other justices – especially liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan – Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative on the court, essentially invited Sauer to make the case for the administration.\n\nThomas said he anticipated the other side in the case, when it has a chance to speak later today, would argue that Congress never delegated its authority to impose these types of tariffs to the president. He asked Sauer to anticipate that argument and respond to it.\n\nSauer argued that there's a distinction within the law between Congress delegating its powers on domestic issues and delegating its powers on foreign issues.\n\nThomas followed up by asking Sauer to also explain why the administration believes the particular law in this case is unique. That could be an avenue for the court to uphold Trump's powers in this case, even though it has struck down emergency powers in other contexts, such as an effort by President Joe Biden to provide major student loan forgiveness.\n\n\"There's been extremely broad delegations of the power to tariff specifically, and the power to regulate foreign commerce more generally, going back to the time of the founding,\" Sauer responded.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAlito asks about court decision that found Congress sets tariff rates\n\nJustice Samuel Alito said a previous court ruling found that the Trading with the Enemy Act didn’t allow the president to set duties at will without Congress setting the rates. He asked Sauer what that meant for the statute disputed in the current case.\n\nSauer said the decision Alito cited found no power to regulate tariffs at all. But Sauer said that the administration’s power to impose “a sweeping global tariff” was supported by other high-court rulings dating to 1824.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nChief justice is skeptical of administration’s arguments\n\nIn an extended back-and-forth with Solicitor General John Sauer, Chief Justice John Roberts showed skepticism about some of the administration’s arguments.\n\nRoberts said the president’s claim of authority to impose tariffs on any product from any country for any amount of time sounds like the kind of major power that the court has previously said needs to be clearly given to a president by Congress.\n\nWhen Sauer said lawmakers did just that, Roberts noted the statute at issue doesn’t even use the word “tariff.”\n\nTariffs, Roberts said, are a tax on Americans.\n\n“And that has always been the core power of Congress,” he said.\n\nWhen Sauer disputed that tariffs are taxes, Roberts asked who pays for tariffs on an automobile. And he noted that Trump’s tariffs have raised a significant amount of money for the federal budget.\n\nSauer called that “an incidental and collateral effect of the tariffs.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nKagan, Sotomayor focus on president’s lack of taxing authority\n\nTwo of the liberal justices focused on the lack of language in the disputed statute granting the president the power to impose tariffs as taxes on imports that are projected to generate more than $3 trillion over a decade.\n\n“Crucially, what it doesn’t have here is anything that refers to raising revenue,” Justice Elena Kagan said. “It has a lot of verbs, it has actions that can be taken under the statute, it just doesn’t have the one you want.”\n\nSolicitor General John Sauer argued that Trump is imposing tariffs just to regulate or restrict the imports, not necessarily to tax them, which is “incidental.”\n\n“We’re not saying it confers a revenue-raising power, we say it confers a regulating power and that’s a crucial distinction,” Saurer said.\n\nKagan asked if there was any statute that says regulatory power provides taxing power. Congress traditionally sets taxes under the Constitution.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor noted that the regulation applies to both imports and exports, but that the president can’t impose taxes on exports.\n\n“You could agree that they couldn’t put tariffs on exportations?” Sotomayor asked. Sauer agreed.\n\n“Why are we permitting them to do it with respect to importations?” Sotomayor asked.\n\nSauer said he wasn’t sure what other statutes use to regulate and tax, but he said the disputed statute evoked a historical power to tariff.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nBarrett questions administration’s expansive definition of 'regulate'\n\nIn her first questions in the Nov. 5 hearing, Justice Amy Coney Barrett homed in on the administration’s claim that the power to “regulate” imports includes the power to impose tariffs.\n\nBarrett, a Trump appointee and one of the conservative justices whose vote could be key to the case, asked Solicitor General John Sauer to point to any other statute or any time in history when that phrase has been used to confer tariff authority.\n\nSauer said there’s a long tradition of broad delegations of power to the president to deal with foreign commerce.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSotomayor compares Trump tariffs to Biden student loan forgiveness, which Supreme Court struck down\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, suggested that the Trump administration was attempting to use emergency powers in a similar way to Biden's use of such powers in a different context – for student loan forgiveness.\n\nSotomayor may be referring to a 2023 Supreme Court ruling. In a 6-3 vote, the court ruled that the Biden administration exceeded its powers when it announced it would cancel as much as $400 billion in student loans. Sotomayor and the other two liberal justices were in the minority in that case.\n\n\"So Biden could have declared a national emergency, and global warming, and then gotten his student forgiveness?\" Sotomayor asked.\n\n\"Maybe I can articulate this way: The power to impose tariffs is a core application of the power to regulate foreign commerce,\" John Sauer responded on behalf of the Trump administration. Sauer suggested student loan forgiveness is fundamentally different.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJackson says Congress never intended to give presidents sweeping tariff powers\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson, one of the court’s three liberals, pushed the Justice Department about whether Congress intended to give presidents such sweeping tariff authority as Trump has claimed.\n\nJackson said it’s clear to her that Congress was trying to constrain presidents’ emergency powers when it passed the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nSolicitor General John Sauer disputed that. He said lawmakers did not intend to change the scope of authority, the powers, or the tools of presidents.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nJustices question president’s authority to impose tariffs\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas opened the questioning by asking the government why the “major questions doctrine” applied to the case. The doctrine holds that Congress must make clear when it authorizes “major” power to the executive branch.\n\nSolicitor General John Sauer said the president has “robust power” to act in foreign affairs under the Constitution and Trump was granted the authority to impose tariffs for national emergencies, as he did to combat fentanyl deaths through tariffs.\n\n“One would expect Congress to confer major powers on the president to address major international crises, so to speak, and foreign rising emergencies,” Sauer said. “You’d expect Congress to grant major powers to the president who has his own broad range of major authority.”\n\nJustice Elena Kagan asked Sauer which part of the Constitution granted the president the power to impose tariffs.\n\n“Tariffs is the power to impose taxes, the power to regulate foreign commerce – these are not things that are thought of as Article II powers,” Kagan said.\n\nSauer said previous high court cases found the president has broad power to conduct foreign affairs.\n\n“The court has recognized the president has broad inherent authority to address foreign situations, foreign affairs, foreign policy, including foreign arising emergencies,” Sauer said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nSotomayor voices skepticism toward Trump tariffs, calling them taxes\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, a Barack Obama appointee, appeared skeptical of the Trump tariffs in her first question during the arguments. Sotomayor suggested the tariffs were operating like a tax, which she said was a power of Congress, not the presidency.\n\n\"It's a congressional power, not a presidential power, to tax. And you want to say tariffs are not taxes, but that's exactly what they are,\" she said.\n\nJohn Sauer, who is arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, said that the tariffs are better understood as part of the president's executive powers under the Constitution, calling them \"a foreign-facing regulation of foreign commerce.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJustice Department makes opening argument\n\nThe arguments kick off with the Justice Department’s top Supreme Court lawyer making his opening pitch.\n\nSolicitor General John Sauer told the justices the president was well within his authority to impose sweeping tariffs on nearly every imported product.\n\nHe started not with a legal argument, however, but with the president’s claim that tariffs are needed to make America a “strong financially viable and respected country.”\n\nTrade deficits, Sauer said, are “country killing and not sustainable.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nProtesters pass SCOTUS as oral arguments begin\n\nAs oral arguments got underway, dozens of protesters, including many dressed like handmaids from \"The Handmaid’s Tale,\" marched between the Supreme Court and the U.S. Capitol, chanting “no Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.”\n\nJust two demonstrators have remained outside the Supreme Court, including Nadine Seiler. Seiler, 60, said she was not closely following the case, but she came because she has personally felt the impact of tariffs on her grocery bill.“Trump is using the tariffs as extortion,” Seiler said. – N’dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nBusiness owner: Tariffs are ‘crushing us’\n\nSmall-business owners and Democratic lawmakers held a news conference outside the Capitol, across the street from the Supreme Court, to argue against Trump’s tariffs.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen said that a baker in Derry, New Hampshire, said 85% of his contracts were with customers in Canada that he lost from tariffs. A manufacturer in Dover put an expansion on hold because of tariff concerns, she said.\n\n“Nobody wants to invest because they don’t know what the president’s going to do tomorrow,” Shaheen said. “All of this economic pain is on the backs of Americans who are already suffering the high costs of living.”\n\nSen. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, said tariffs are a tax that Congress should set rather than have a president arbitrarily set rates on imports.\n\n“What’s at stake here is the separation of powers,” Welch said. “That’s been hijacked not by an emergency but by a presidential whim.”\n\nDahlia Rizk, founder of Buckle Me Baby Coats in North Andover, Massachusetts, which makes puffer coats for children to wear safely in car seats, said she had trouble estimating how much tariffs would be because rates changed repeatedly.\n\nShe said she cut her order for inventory in half this year to reduce her risk. She budgeted $30,000 and had to pay $93,010.76.\n\n“Tariffs trickle down to the people, and they are crushing us,” Rizk said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nIs the government shutdown affecting the case?\n\nBecause Congress has remained at an impasse on funding for the next fiscal year, leading to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, the Supreme Court has generally closed its building to the public. But it remains open for official business, which includes oral arguments. And seats in the courtroom are available for the public and press.\n\nThe court is also livestreaming audio of the arguments as usual. Because Congress has not agreed on a budget for this fiscal year, the Supreme Court has generally closed its building to the public. But it remains open for official business, which includes oral arguments. And seats in the courtroom are available for the public and press.\n\nThe court is also livestreaming audio of the arguments as usual.\n\n− Maureen Groppe\n\nWhy President Nixon’s tariffs may come up\n\nAlthough President Donald Trump is the first president to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs, President Richard Nixon implemented something similar under a predecessor law.\n\nNixon imposed temporary tariffs of 10% under the Trading with the Enemy Act that included similar language to IEEPA.\n\nA challenge to those tariffs never reached the Supreme Court. But an appeals court sided with Nixon, although it ruled that “emergencies are expected to be short-lived.”\n\nIn today’s dispute, both sides say that the previous case works in their favor.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump calls Supreme Court case ‘LIFE OR DEATH’ for country\n\nTrump has called his tariffs crucial for the country, both to raise money to pay down the national debt and to encourage manufacturers to relocate jobs at home.\n\nBut lower courts have said he overstepped his authority by imposing the tariffs around the world. Trump argued in a social media post on Nov. 4 that the “case is, literally LIFE OR DEATH for our country” because if the justices rule against him, foreign rivals will continue charging their own tariffs or impose restrictions on imports.\n\n“Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,” Trump said .“A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs, and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nHow long will the arguments last?\n\nThe arguments are scheduled for 80 minutes, which is 20 minutes longer than most cases.\n\nBut, as with most cases, the debate is expected to go longer than the allotted time.

Even though the 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts fall under a separate statute called Section 232 of the Trade Expansion act of 1962 and are not part of this case, the court's ruling could still impact auto-related tariffs. President Donald Trump's tariffs on imported cars and car parts are costing the Detroit automakers billions of dollars this year.\n\nZajac was in Washington, D.C., that day to be admitted to the bar of the U.S. Supreme Court as a practicing attorney. Around 10 a.m., after his admittance, Zajac wandered through the court's regal hallways. He found himself seated in the fourth row of the justices' courtroom listening to the oral arguments between the plaintiffs challenging the legality of Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs and the government attorneys defending Trump.\n\n\"It was lucky happenstance,\" Zajac told the Detroit Free Press later that day. \"It was quite interesting. A lot of inquisitive questions from the justices. It was hard to tell at times who was leaning which way with their questions because they were equal in difficulty to the government and to the plaintiffs.”\n\nThe outcome of this historic case is indeed uncertain. The case is called Learning Resources Inc. v. Trump and it asks the high court to determine whether the broad tariffs ― from 10% to 49% ― Trump imposed in April across a host of countries on imported goods are illegal.\n\nWhen Trump imposed the tariffs, it triggered a stock-market plunge and a dollar selloff. So Trump paused the tariffs for 90 days. Then, some tariffs got negotiated lower with some countries. The tariffs, which are taxes importers pay on goods when they cross borders, took effect in early August.\n\nThe lower courts have already determined the tariffs are illegal, but Trump's lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court. While the justices, with a 6-3 conservative majority, have backed presidential powers in most big past decisions, the stakes are high this time because the legal case against the tariffs is strong.\n\nHere is what's happening in D.C. and how it could impact the auto industry:\n\nWhat is the court deciding?\n\nMarick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University, said the gist of this case is for the high court to review whether Trump has the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, to impose fentanyl-based tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico and the reciprocal tariffs on a slew of other countries.\n\nThe IEEPA statute gives the president selected powers to regulate international economic actions using tariffs and other tools, but only in the case of national emergencies. A group of small business owners, which have had to pay the tariffs, sued on the grounds that Trump exceeded statutory authority, Masters said.\n\nThe Supreme Court is considering three main questions with respect to the tariffs, added Josh Robbins, an attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm that defends Americans’ liberties when threatened by government overreach.\n\nRobbins listed the questions as: Does IEEPA authorize the president to impose tariffs, do the emergencies the president declared qualify as emergencies for the purposes of IEEPA, and, lastly, is IEEPA itself an unconstitutional transfer of Congress' tariff power to the president without any meaningful limits?\n\n\"The history of the act, which has been used 69 times since 1977, was to impose sanctions against very specific countries, which the United States sees as hostile relations,\" said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C. \"It has never been used before beyond that.\"\n\nHufbauer believes the ruling will come down in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\n\"The key point that the decision will make and, I think it’ll come down fairly soon, is on the major questions doctrine, which is: If Congress had meant to give the president such broad authority under that act, it would have stated it more explicitly than it did,\" Hufbauer told the Detroit Free Press.\n\nIf Hufbauer is right, there is a lot of loot at stake. During the oral arguments on Nov. 5, Zajac said it was revealed that the IEEPA tariffs are worth $4 trillion in revenue over the span of the presidency, so about $1 trillion a year.\n\nZajac said, \"When asked who pays the tariffs, the government lawyers said, 'The importer of record has to pay it.’ Whether that’s a U.S. company or a subsidiary … they glossed over it.\"\n\nIf the court rules in favor of Trump, what does it mean?\n\nMost of these experts expect the Supreme Court justices to deliver a ruling on this case by year-end, which is a fast-track for the court, but with so much money at stake, Zajac said the court has to move faster than usual.\n\nA ruling in favor of Trump's use of the IEPPA means simply he has unrestricted authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA as he has done so far this year with respect to reciprocal tariffs and fentanyl-based tariffs, Masters said.\n\nPut another way: \"A ruling upholding the IEEPA tariffs would mean that Congress gave the president nearly unlimited power to impose tariffs of any amount, on any country or industry, for any duration of his choosing,\" Robbins added.\n\nIf the court rules against Trump, what does it mean?\n\nKeep in mind that no court has ruled any emergency under IEEPA unwarranted, according to an opinion piece published Nov. 4 in the Wall Street Journal that was written by Douglas Irwin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College, and Alan Wolff, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. They write: \"Congress delegated to the president the determination of what an emergency is, so a degree of deference to his judgment is in order.\"\n\nSo if the court finds that Trump's use of IEPPA was illegal, \"it would be a kerfuffle for Trump,\" Hufbauer said.\n\nRobbins said such a ruling would remove the IEEPA tariffs and the government has conceded that it would have to refund any IEEPA tariffs it collected. That would lead to a complicated process of refunds, and there remain other levers Trump could use to continue many of the tariffs.\n\nWhat does the auto industry gain in any of this?\n\nA ruling against Trump's use of the IEEPA tariffs would not relieve the auto industry from all tariffs imposed under this administration, the experts all say. That's because Trump imposed the 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts and the 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum under that separate statute called Section 232 of the Trade Expansion act of 1962, which is not part of this case.\n\nSection 232 would remain in place regardless of the outcome of the Supreme Court's ruling in this case, the experts said. The Section 232 statute states that tariffs may be used if there’s a threat to national security, Zajac said. The goverment has already established a threat.\n\n\"There was an investigation that took place and reports that showed there’s a threat to national security due to U.S. dependence on foreign entities for cars, steel, aluminum and parts,\" Zajac said. “The president’s assessment of that report about a threat to national security, was to use the mechanism of tariffs to combat it.”\n\nBut ... wait ...\n\nBut Zajac said the Section 232 tariffs on auto parts tariffs apply only to a select set of automotive parts based on their classification.\n\n\"There are other parts that are used in autos that might fall under IEEPA,\" Zajac said. \"Therefore, if the Supreme Court decides Trump went too far, those parts might get a break.\"\n\nAn example of parts that would fall in Section 232 would be powertrain parts, engines and electrical systems. Other parts that might be IEEPA tariffs are seat cushions for a car seat, Zajac said.\n\n\"On the IEEPA list there are some seat components,\" Zajac said. \"Anyone who’s been subjected to the IEEPA tariffs, in theory, if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the plaintiffs and against the government, they’d be part of the process that is set up for all of that money to come back.”\n\nIs the auto industry watching this ruling closely?\n\n“Definitely,\" Zajac said. \"There are other things that might be subject to it ― tooling and equipment that are integral in the automotive industry and some of those might be covered by an IEEPA tariffs. It’s a very real problem, not just on parts, but the equipment to make the parts.”\n\nRight now, auto parts suppliers and their customers, some of whom are the car companies, are having \"difficult and deep conversations\" on who should absorb the added costs of some of the tariffs, Zajac said.\n\nOthers agree that the auto industry is paying attention.\n\n\"Everybody’s watching this and watching it closely because almost all auto suppliers ship parts that cross borders,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of Global Vehicle Forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.\n\nBut many are being realistic, that even a ruling against Trump likely won't get them much money back, Fiorani said.\n\n\"I don’t know how many expect to get refunds because there are so many other abilities for the president to apply tariffs that, if not through this one, he can switch to another,\" Fiorani said. \"Then, there would be more months of hearings and this could drag on and on.\"\n\nFiorani said unless the Supreme Court rules the president doesn’t have a right to impose tariffs at all, a highly unlikely outcome, tariffs will likely continue through a different mechanism. Plus, he said, \"even if they could get the refunds, the process will take months, if not years, to figure out.\"\n\nJamie L.

Diesel prices also declined, falling 3.5 cents to $3.63.\n\nAs of Oct. 14, the AAA national average stood at $3.076, while the New Jersey average hovered slightly lower at $3.010. Within the state, prices varied modestly by county:\n\nBergen County: $2.971\n\n$2.971 Union County: $3.000\n\n$3.000 Hudson County: $3.031\n\n$3.031 Essex County: $3.118\n\n$3.118 Passaic County: $3.021\n\n$3.021 Morris County: $3.026\n\n$3.026 Sussex County: $2.098\n\nNew Jersey's average is down from $3.146 a month ago and $3.015 a week ago, according to AAA. A year ago New Jersey's average was at $2.990.\n\nPatrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said the downward trend could continue. “Americans appear to be on the cusp of seeing the national average drop below $3 per gallon and potentially stay there for the first time in years,” he said. “With more than 40 states seeing gas prices decline and oil tumbling below $60 per barrel, the good news may not stop if — and when — the national average hits that magical $2.99 mark.”\n\nSome states, including Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin, may even see prices fall below $2 a gallon, a level not seen since the height of the pandemic.\n\nOil prices tumbled below $60 late last week after President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on China in response to limits on rare earth exports. The announcement sparked fears of renewed trade tensions and a potential slowdown in global demand, pushing West Texas Intermediate crude below $60 and triggering a stock market selloff.\n\nOPEC+ production increases also pressured prices. On Oct. 13, oil rebounded slightly as China clarified it would maintain rare earth exports under a new control mechanism. WTI crude went to 59 cents to $59.49 per barrel, down from $61.85 a week earlier. Brent crude went to $63.32 per barrel from $65.56.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s report for the week ending Oct. 3, crude inventories increased by 3.7 million barrels but remain about 4% below the seasonal average. Gasoline stocks fell by 1.6 million barrels and distillate supplies dropped by 2 million barrels. Refinery utilization rose to 92.4%, while implied gasoline demand climbed to 8.9 million barrels per day.\n\nThe most common U.S. gas price is $2.79 per gallon, with a median price of $2.85. The lowest averages are in Oklahoma ($2.50), Mississippi ($2.62), and Texas ($2.62), while California ($4.62), Hawaii ($4.46), and Washington ($4.41) remain the most expensive.\n\nThe largest weekly declines were reported in Ohio (-18.3 cents), Michigan (-13.9 cents) and Indiana (-13.4 cents).\n\nFor diesel, the median price stood at $3.53 per gallon, with Texas ($3.12) and Oklahoma ($3.15) recording the lowest averages.

Prices are expected to drop another 20 to 25 cents in the coming weeks.\n\nBehind the fall: Record high refining in the U.S., shrinking consumer demand and slumping crude oil prices, says Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for Internet website price tracker GasBuddy.com.\n\nCrude squirted to two-year highs of $112 a barrel in August on fears that U.S. military intervention in war-torn Syria would disrupt global supplies. With Syrian intervention less likely and thawing tensions with Iran, a far bigger oil producer, crude oil prices continue to slump. Light, sweet crude was trading at about $103.25 a barrel Wednesday. Wholesale gas prices for October delivery, now $2.69 a gallon, are 60 cents below August levels in some markets.\n\nConsumers are also getting a break because refineries in several states have switched from summer-grade blends to winter-grades that are 10 to 15 cents a gallon cheaper, says AAA spokesman Michael Green.\n\n\"How low can gas prices go? There is an aspect of this plunge that evokes the Caribbean limbo stick,'' says Kloza. \"Gasoline prices are dipping well below the limbo stick of crude oil, but at some point, it will take lower crude oil prices to hasten a return to sub-$3 gal prices nationwide.\"\n\nNationally, gasoline prices have been above $3 for 1,000 consecutive days.

Throughout the campaign and after, Trump has talked about \"unleashing American energy,\" called oil \"liquid gold\" and promised to \"drill, baby, drill.\"\n\nStill, presidents can try to influence oil production.

The statewide average cost for a gallon of regular gas dropped 15 cents last week, settling at $3 per gallon on Sunday. By Tuesday morning, that average had dropped again to $2.96 per gallon.\n\nEven better news for drivers is that prices are expected to remain low through the holidays, said Mark Jenkins, Tampa-based spokesman for AAA.\n\n“Oil and gasoline futures prices plummeted last week, after a weekly fuel report showed strong refinery activity, leading to big gains in gasoline supplies,\" Jenkins said. \"About 35% of Florida gas stations now have fuel below $3 a gallon. Nearly 10% of retailers have prices in the low $2.70s.\n\n“While prices could bounce around in the coming weeks, drivers should expect pump prices to remain low through the holidays unless oil prices suddenly spike.\"\n\nWhat are the cheapest gas prices in Volusia-Flagler?\n\nIn Daytona Beach, the cheapest cost of a gallon of regular gas on Tuesday was $2.69 per gallon at the Sam’s Club at 1460 Cornerstone Blvd., according to the online price tracker gasbuddy.com.\n\nIn Palm Coast, the lowest price was $2.97 per gallon at the RaceTrac at 5893 E. State Road 100 and Seminole Woods Boulevard, according to gasbuddy.com.\n\nWhat are the cheapest, most expensive gas prices in Florida?\n\nAccording to AAA, the most expensive metro markets are West Palm Beach-Boca Raton ($3.17), Naples ($3.10) and Sebring ($3.07).\n\nThe least expensive metro markets are Crestview-Fort Walton Beach ($2.81), Pensacola ($2.82) and Panama City ($2.83).\n\nWhat factors are influencing prices at the pump?\n\nThe main reason for declining pump prices is a weaker cost for oil, which is struggling to stay above $70 per barrel, according to AAA.\n\nThe falling price comes just a week after OPEC+ announced voluntary production cuts of about 2 million barrels daily. That move has been received with indifference by the international oil market.\n\n“Historically, crude oil tends to drop nearly 30 percent from late September into early winter with gasoline prices trailing the play,” said Andrew Gross, another AAA spokesman. “More than half of all U.S. fuel locations have gasoline below $3 per gallon.

Even at just nine-tenths of a cent, it was the biggest single-day decline in gas prices since August 2021.\n\nOf course, gas prices remain historically high. Before last week, the record high had been $4.11 a gallon, a level first reached in 2008. Last week, gas set four records in a row before prices stayed virtually unchanged through the weekend and Monday.\n\nThe drop in retail gas prices follows a sharper drop in oil prices in Monday trading as prices fell 8%. If oil prices stay at this level, there could be more meaningful relief on the way at the pump, perhaps as much as 20 cents a gallon, predicted Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Analysis, which tracks gasoline prices for AAA. But it’s not surprising the drop in gasoline prices has trailed the drop in oil prices.\n\n“Gasoline prices can go up like a rocket and come down like a feather,” said Kloza.\n\nEven if drivers get that 20 cent a gallon break at the pump, it’s not likely to last.\n\nUS demand for gasoline is likely to increase, especially with record job gains over the last year and more workers who had been working from home returning to the office.\n\nKloza said as the summer driving season approaches and the United States switches over to a more expensive summer blend of gasoline meant to fight smog and pollution, prices are likely to rise to about $4.50 a gallon.\n\nThere are two factors that could limit the rise in oil and gasoline prices: one good, one bad.\n\nThe good one would be peace in Ukraine, especially a peace that led to the lifting of sanctions on Russia by the United States and many other western nations. Hopes of peace negotiations Monday in part helped to drive down oil prices.\n\nRussia is the one of the largest exporters of oil in the world. Although relatively little Russian oil reaches US customers, oil is priced in global commodity markets. So the disruption to its flow of its oil had sent prices soaring.\n\nThe bad news that could drive down prices would be a new surge of Covid-19, forcing countries that had been opening up to reimpose restrictions on businesses and individuals. China imposed new lockdowns over the weekend because of a Covid surge. That was one of the factors in the drop in oil prices on Monday, according to analysts.\n\nThe run-up in gas prices so far this year has been historic, at times achieving the the steepest rate of increase since Hurricane Katrina hit the US Gulf Coast in 2005, devastating oil platforms and refineries in the region.

GasBuddy is a tech company that provides real-time gas price information for over 150,000 stations nationwide.\n\nThe EIA stressed that its December projections remained subject to uncertainty related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, notably the emergence of the omicron variant, which heightens unknowns about the level of energy consumption around the world in the near future.\n\n“This is a very complicated environment for the entire energy sector,” EIA Acting Administrator Steve Nalley said in a statement. “Our forecasts for petroleum and other energy prices, consumption, and production could change significantly as we learn more about how responses to the Omicron variant could affect oil demand and the broader economy.”\n\nStill, Nalley maintained that decreases in prices at the pump over the next year are expected, due to the EIA's forecast for increased crude oil production.

As a result, average gas prices have dropped to their lowest levels since 2010, with many stations in New Jersey selling gas for less than $3 per gallon.\n\nThe trend comes at a seemingly unlikely time, as tensions remain a headache in and around major oil-producing countries, including Iraq and Russia. So far, however, those conflicts have not disrupted the global oil supply.\n\nMeanwhile, several global forces have led to an ample supply of oil that has further driven prices lower. Those factors include increased oil production and flat demand in North America, economic struggles in Europe, improved fuel standards for vehicles, and fewer drivers.\n\nConsumers who spend less on gas could boost the U.S. economy if they decide to spend the money elsewhere. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of the U.S. economy.\n\n\"We're seeing the lowest crude oil prices globally in several years,\" said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at GasBuddy.com, which tracks fuel prices in the U.S. \"2010 was the last year where we spent virtually all the year below $3 a gallon. It's too early to look at 2015, but this could persist for a while.\"\n\nThe price per barrel of crude oil ended at $84.47 Thursday, a 30 percent drop from the most recent high of roughly $120 in June, according to oil-price.net. Meanwhile, the average price per gallon of regular gasoline in New Jersey fell to $2.96 Thursday, down from $3.07 one week ago, $3.24 one month ago and $3.21 one year ago. Nationally, prices fell to $3.14 Thursday, down from $3.24 one week ago, $3.37 one month ago and $3.36 one year ago.\n\nThose prices will likely keep dropping, as they usually do during this time of the year, before they typically hit bottom between Nov. 15 and Jan. 15. Beyond that, however, Kloza could not say whether prices will go up or down. He did, however, predict in August that prices would hit $3 per gallon during the last one-hundred days of this year.\n\n\"We certainly knew that the pressures were going to be put to bear and push prices lower,\" Kloza said. \"We underestimated how quickly and how dramatically it could happen.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/17"}]}

The company's Color Institute projected that the swatch most appropriate for next year is Cloud Dancer, described as \"a billowy, balanced white imbued with a feeling of serenity.\"\n\nKnown to the other chips at Sherwin-Williams as Pantone 11-4201, to the untrained it looks, well, white. Lee Eiseman, Pantone's Color Institute's executive director, and VP Laurie Pressman beg to differ, though.\n\nTheir careers, steeped literally in color, are reduced once a year to a raised eyebrow as non-design professionals wonder why on earth that shade was crowned the winner. It's a painstaking and rather technical process, actually, that determines Pantone's hue of the moment. To humor us normies, though, Pressman and Eiseman admit that the color may look like plain white – but really, it's a message that the world needs a blank slate.\n\nCloud Dancer, a white that is both warm and cool, reflects an overwhelmed feeling among consumers as the world feels louder and technology, in particular AI, encroaches further into our lives.\n\nPeople are \"feeling bombarded,\" Pressman tells USA TODAY, and are looking for a \"fresh start.\"\n\n\"If everyone's feeling this overload, there's something that's just not working right,\" she adds. \"We want to be with things that are real, and (Cloud Dancer) goes very well with this nature-based feeling … honest beauty, no spectacles, no filters.\" That the color evokes looking up to the clouds on a clear day should feel like a return to form as the world spins madly on.\n\n\"It's not too cool, it's not too warm,\" Eiseman adds. \"It's the kind of color that I can use with just about everything that I have in the room.\"\n\nShe isn't much bothered by the idea that people may say \"it's just white\" for her, any conversation about color is a win. And Cloud Dancer is a product of its epoch, just like every Pantone shade of the years that came before it.\n\n\"We have to look within the context of the time,\" she says. \"Color is about context.\"\n\nIf that rings true, the next question might inevitably be – at an incredibly tense moment in the U.S., following accusations of white supremacy bleeding into advertisements and a rise of white nationalism in politics, are the folks at Pantone at all concerned about the message Cloud Dancer might be sending?\n\nNot particularly, it seems.\n\n\"The Pantone Color of the Year selection process is driven by humanity and by the emotional resonance inherent in the color,\" Eiseman and Pressman said in a joint statement. \"Cloud Dancer is a color that is about relaxation, reflection, and creativity – the color was selected by the global team at the Pantone Color Institute for its emotional and creative resonance, not as a stance on politics, ideology or race.\n\n\"Pantone does not assign or amplify political narratives to color, so selecting or avoiding a color solely on that basis would give those narratives a weight they don’t have in this process,\" they added.\n\nWorth noting also is that Cloud Dancer is not a particularly solitary creature. It arrives arm in arm with a slate of accompanying palettes that help it shape-shift and showcase its \"versatility.\" With names like Atmospheric, Tropical Tonalites and Powdered Pastels, the palettes offer a more robust vision of Pantone's approach to the shade.\n\n\"If you have a color that is more versatile, more accessible,\" Pressman says, \"there (are) so many more different ways that I can put my own stamp on it.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/shopping/2025/12/04/shop-pantone-2026-color-of-the-year-cloud-dancer/87608089007/", "title": "Shop Pantone's 2026 Color of the Year, Cloud Dancer", "text": "Dec. 4, 2025, 4:47 p.m. ET\n\nAI-assisted summary Pantone has named 'Cloud Dancer' (PANTONE 11-4201) as its 2026 Color of the Year.\n\nThe color is described as a natural, billowy white meant to evoke tranquility and peace.\n\nCloud Dancer follows the 2025 Color of the Year, which was chosen to evoke feelings of comfort.\n\nIf Pantone's 2025 Color of the Year was designed to evoke feelings of comfort in a noisy world, Pantone's 2026 Color of the Year is designed to quite literally turn the volume all the way down—with inspired vibes of tranquility, peace and the promise of a blank slate.\n\n'Cloud Dancer' (PANTONE 11-4201) has been unveiled as Pantone's chosen hue for 2026, marking the first time ever that the brand has selected white as its designated shade.\n\nFar from a harsh, stark white though, Cloud Dancer has a billowy, natural coloring to it that feels derivative of a soft, fluffy cloud.

It was a rather soft ask, so I quietly let it go.\n\nTo be honest, I wasn’t sure how I felt about the idea of him wearing his Jewish faith so prominently in public. It is not that I was embarrassed or ashamed – just the opposite. I have always been extremely proud of my Judaism. I display a mezuzah on the outside of the door of my home, as is the Jewish custom. But wearing a Jewish star is something I had never considered for myself, much less my young son.\n\nI never bought it.\n\nThen, halfway through the eight days of Chanukah, my son somewhat sheepishly asked if I had gotten him the only thing he had asked for, a Jewish star. I admitted that I hadn’t and asked what made him want one.\n\nHe said that a lot of his Christian friends at school wore crosses, and that he wanted to wear a symbol of his own faith. He told me he is a proud Jew.\n\nRudolph and Matilda Vidor, Dana Bash's great-grandparents, who were killed in Auschwitz.

That he takes such pride in his religion – one preserved and practiced for thousands of years through countless generations of my family – made me incredibly emotional.\n\nI immediately thought of my great grandparents and aunt – Hungarian Jews who were not particularly observant but were murdered by the Nazis during World War II anyway.\n\nI thought of my grandparents, who escaped the Nazis and miraculously made it to the US only two months before Pearl Harbor. They became patriotic Americans who never took for granted the ability to practice their Judaism freely.\n\nWithout knowing enough to make those connections, my son was asking to take up that mantle because it is in his soul and in his heart.\n\nSo, I said yes. We got the Jewish star and a chain to go with it.\n\nWhat I did not say – what I was ashamed to even admit to myself – was that my young son showing the world that he is Jewish made me nervous.\n\nTeri Vidor Weinman and Frank Weinman, Dana Bash's grandparents, seen in 1939 on their wedding day while on the run in Prague.

I knew that gunmen had launched deadly attacks at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, California, because they hated Jews. I knew that antisemitic incidents were increasing on college campuses. I knew that conspiracies about Jews were among the oldest on the planet.\n\nWhat I did not know is what I learned in talking to experts and victims alike for CNN’s Special Report “Rising Hate: Antisemitism in America” – that wearing a Jewish star can actually be a tactic in combating prejudice against Jews.\n\nAmbassador Deborah Lipstadt, special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, arrived at our interview wearing a beautiful gold Star of David necklace.\n\nWhen we got to the part of the interview when I asked for some solutions to curb hate against Jews, Lipstadt – a world-renowned expert on antisemitism – said that she started wearing her Jewish star more frequently as antisemitic attacks started to rise.\n\n“I can walk into a room and someone might not know it, might not identify it,” Lipstadt said, referring to the fact that she is Jewish.\n\n“And with the rise of antisemitism, I want to just say, here I am.

The students were finished with their lessons when the teachers got word there was a shooter in the building, she told CNN’s “New Day.”\n\nOne teacher went to lock the door, but Miah says the shooter was already right there — and shot out the window in the door.\n\nShe described it all happening so fast – her teacher backed into the classroom and the gunman followed. She told CNN he made eye contact with one of the teachers, said, “Goodnight,” and then shot her.\n\nHe opened fire, shooting the other teacher and many of Miah’s friends. She said bullets flew by her, and fragments hit her shoulders and head. The girl was later treated at the hospital and released with fragment wounds; she described to CNN that clumps of her hair were falling out now.\n\nMiah said after shooting students in her class, the gunman went through a door into an adjoining classroom. She heard screams, and the sound of shots in that classroom. After the shots stopped, though, she says the shooter started playing loud music – sad music, she said.\n\nThe girl and a friend managed to get her dead teacher’s phone and call 911 for help. She said she told a dispatcher, “Please come … we’re in trouble.”\n\nMiah said she was scared the gunman would return to her classroom to kill her and a few other surviving friends. So, she dipped her hands in the blood of a classmate – who lay next to her, already dead – and then smeared the blood all over herself to play dead.\n\nMiah said it felt like three hours that she lay there, covered in her classmate’s blood, with her friends.\n\nShe told CNN she assumed at that point the police hadn’t arrived on the scene yet.\n\nShe said afterward, she overheard talk of police waiting outside the school. As she recounted this part of the story to CNN, she started crying, saying she just didn’t understand why they didn’t come inside and rescue them.\n\nMiah’s mother said her daughter is traumatized and can’t sleep.

Her mother said that’s been happening a lot, and described an earlier incident where they were at a car wash and the sound of the vacuum cleaner “completely set her off.”\n\nMiah was too scared to speak on camera, or to a man, because of what she experienced, but she told CNN she wanted to share her story so people can know what it’s like to live through a school shooting. She says hopefully it can help prevent a tragedy like this from happening to other children.\n\nAlready a “miracle baby”\n\nMiah’s mother said she was born with a tumor in her abdomen and wasn’t expected to live much past her birth. She underwent extensive surgery to remove the tumor at age three; her mother already called her a “miracle baby” and said that’s even truer now.\n\nHer mother also told CNN that the morning of the shooting, Miah had an earache and she took her out of school to go to the doctor. On the way back, they stopped at Starbucks for a treat and her mother offered to let Miah skip school the rest of the day since it was one of the last days of classes before summer break and they were just watching movies.\n\nBut Miah insisted that she wanted to return to school to see her friends, so her mother dropped her back off at school – about an hour before the shooting.", "authors": ["Nora Neus Melissa Alonso Claire Colbert", "Nora Neus", "Melissa Alonso", "Claire Colbert"], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/us/uvalde-911-classroom-call-delay", "title": "10-year-old trapped with the Uvalde school shooter repeatedly ...", "text": "CNN —\n\n“I’m in classroom 112,” the little girl tells the police dispatcher. “Please hurry.

It’s the call that should have ended any doubt or hesitation that the teenage gunman was active, roaming between the two connected classrooms, that children were trapped, injured and needed to be saved.\n\nThe entire law enforcement response has been condemned, almost from start to finish. And agencies have blamed each other in changing narratives since the massacre on May 24, for not following up on the initial attempt to go into the classroom when the gunman fired back, to treating the suspect as barricaded but not an active threat, and long waits for equipment and specialist personnel.\n\nNineteen children and two teachers were killed that day, though at least one adult and one child did not die immediately. Texas’ top cop, director of the Department of Public Safety Col. Steven McCraw, has acknowledged failures, most recently to bereaved families last week, but insisted his department as a whole did not fail the community.\n\nCNN obtained the calls from a source and is using excerpts with the approval of Khloie’s parents. CNN also informed families who lost people in the massacre that this story was coming.\n\nKhloie’s father, Ruben Torres, a former Marine, said he knew how hard it was to give good information when under fire. “That day, the things that she did were absolutely incredible,” he said of his daughter. Of the adults who responded, he said: “None of them had courage that day.”\n\nHer mother, Jamie Torres, said it hurt to know Khloie called and still waited that long for help. “All the kids didn’t have backup in there.

And known.\n\nThe news spreads beyond those who heard the initial transmission.\n\n“Supposedly one kid called as it was underway. He’s been in that room for an hour now,” an officer tells a newly arrived responder, apparently referring to the shooter.\n\n“We don’t know if he has anybody in the room with him, do we?” asks an officer in the hallway outside the classrooms. “He does,” comes the reply. “Eight or nine children.”\n\nEMT: ‘We’re taking too long’\n\nWhile some are talking about gas masks and shields and a command post, an emergency medic from Border Patrol arrives.

And again, minutes later, “Can you send a policeman in now, please?”\n\nShe is told to stay quiet, to keep her classmates – some apparently moaning in pain – quiet, and wait.\n\nShe said to the dispatcher she thought she heard police in the hallway and was again advised to stay quiet.\n\nLater, Khloie tells police how she was using her teacher’s phone, how she knew how to make the emergency call without having to unlock the phone as it was like her dad’s.\n\nShe also told of how she had time to try to help her friends while the gunman was in the adjoining classroom, where he killed all the students and wounded the teacher.\n\n“I stood up to look for Band-Aids ‘cause my friend had a big cut.”\n\nThen, fearing the shooter might come back to her room, she hid again, under a table.\n\nThe girl is on the call as officers finally force their way in to the room next door. Loud, prolonged bursts of gunfire can be heard as the dispatcher tells her: “Stay down. Do not get up. Stay down. Do not, do not move.”\n\nThe girl survives.

But on Tuesday she spoke in court to the victims shortly before the sentence was handed down.\n\n“Jeffrey Epstein should have been here before all of you,” Maxwell said at the podium, her legs shackled. “It is not about Epstein, ultimately. It is for me to be sentenced.”\n\nMaxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend, acknowledged that she had been convicted in the sex trafficking scheme but stopped short of taking responsibility.\n\n“I am sorry for the pain that you’ve experienced,” Maxwell said. “I hope my conviction … brings you closure.”\n\nJeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell sits with her defense lawyer Christian Everdell during her sentencing hearing in a courtroom sketch on June 28. Jane Rosenberg/Reuters\n\nProsecutors had asked the judge to sentence Maxwell to 30 to 55 years in prison, while the probation department recommended 20 years. Maxwell’s attorneys requested a more lenient sentence of between 4.25 and 5.25 years in prison.\n\nJudge Alison Nathan calculated that the sentencing guidelines called for about 15½ to 19½ years in prison. Yet she delivered a sentence slightly above that range, noting the victims’ disturbing testimony and Maxwell’s “direct and repeated participation in a horrific scheme.”\n\n“Miss Maxwell is not punished in place of Epstein,” she said. “Miss Maxwell is being punished for the role that she played.”\n\nNathan also said Maxwell failed to accept responsibility for her role in the crimes or show remorse.\n\n“Today’s sentence will attempt to acknowledge the harm that Ms. Maxwell has caused,” Nathan said.\n\nThe 20-year sentence represents a pivotal moment in an international sex trafficking case that stretched over decades and exemplified the ways that the rich and powerful can avoid – or, at least, delay – consequences for their actions.\n\nMaxwell was also sentenced to five years of supervised release and a $750,000 fine, which her attorney said she is unable to pay. The judge said she will be sent to a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut.\n\nEpstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to state prostitution charges, was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019 but died by suicide in prison a month later. Maxwell has been detained since her arrest in July 2020, and prosecutors said she received credit for two years of time served.\n\nUS Attorney Damian Williams praised the sentence and thanked the victims for testifying.\n\n“Today’s sentence holds Ghislaine Maxwell accountable for perpetrating heinous crimes against children,” he said. “This sentence sends a strong message that no one is above the law and it is never too late for justice.”\n\nHowever, defense attorney Bobbi Sternheim said Maxwell planned to appeal the conviction and, as she did during the trial, pushed the blame onto Epstein.\n\n“We all know that the person who should have been sentenced today escaped accountability, avoided his victims, avoided absorbing their pain and receiving the punishment he truly deserved,” Sternheim said. “Jeffrey Epstein left Ghislaine Maxwell holding the whole bag.”\n\nVictim impact statements say Maxwell facilitated abuse\n\nPrior to the sentence, four women spoke in court to describe the long-lasting effects of Maxwell’s and Epstein’s abuse. The judge granted requests from eight women in all to give victim impact statements either in writing or in person at the sentencing.\n\nAnnie Farmer, one of the victims, asked the judge to consider the lasting effects of Maxwell’s behavior on her victims.\n\n“Judge Nathan, I hope when you consider the appropriate prison sentence for the role Maxwell played in this sex trafficking operation, you take into account the ongoing suffering of the many women she abused and exploited as we will continue to live with the memories of the ways she harmed us,” she wrote. “I hope you weigh the systemic effects of the crimes she perpetrated – the ways that our family members, romantic partners, and friends have been hurt through our suffering.”\n\nAnother victim, identified only as “Kate,” said Maxwell’s “final insult” was her lack of remorse after being found guilty. She said Maxwell was “a manipulative, cruel and merciless person” and could have stopped the abuse.\n\n“You could have put an end to the rapes, the molestations, the sickening manipulations that you arranged, witnessed and even took part in,” Kate said in court.\n\nSarah Ransome, another accuser who was not part of this trial, told the court about the ramifications the years of abuse had on her, saying she suffered from alcoholism and had twice attempted suicide.\n\n“I frequently experience flashbacks and wake up in a cold sweat from nightmares reliving the awful experience,” she said.\n\nAfterward, Farmer said she was happy with the 20-year sentence and said she didn’t believe Maxwell’s statement of apology.\n\n“Her statement felt like a very hollow apology to me,” she said. “She did not take responsibility for the crimes that she committed and it felt like, once more, her trying to do something to benefit her and not at all about the harm she had caused.”\n\nShe also said she appreciated the opportunity to speak in court.\n\n“It actually felt very powerful to finally have a chance to speak and have my voice on the record and say the things that I wanted to say about how her crimes impacted myself and the people that I know and care about,” Farmer said.\n\nWhat happened at the trial\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch: Court artist responds after Ghislaine Maxwell sketches her back 01:50 • Source: CNN Watch: Court artist responds after Ghislaine Maxwell sketches her back 01:50\n\nMaxwell’s monthlong trial last year alternated between disturbing testimony from sexual abuse victims and illuminating testimony about some of Epstein’s connections to high-profile celebrities.\n\nProsecutors argued Maxwell and Epstein conspired to set up a scheme to lure young girls into sexual relationships with Epstein from 1994 to 2004 in New York, Florida, New Mexico and the US Virgin Islands. Four women testified during the trial that Epstein abused them and that Maxwell facilitated the abuse and sometimes participated in it as well.\n\nHer defense, meanwhile, said she was a “scapegoat” for Epstein’s actions and attacked the memories and motivations of the women who say they were sexually abused.\n\nThe prosecution’s case rested primarily on the testimony of the four women.\n\nJane, testifying under a pseudonym, said Maxwell organized sexual massages with Epstein and sometimes joined in the abuse.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nAfter legendary NFL quarterback Tom Brady and supermodel Gisele Bündchen divorced, the media speculation machine went into full force – everyone wanted a reason.\n\nJill Filipovic Courtesy Jill Filipovic\n\nThe guesswork is understandable (I, too, want to know why a famous and beautiful couple would split up after 13 years). And given the couple’s celebrity status, the intrusion into a painful and personal moment for them is to be expected, even if it’s also pretty ill-mannered and unkind.\n\nBut I suspect the public fascination with the Brady-Bündchen divorce comes from the fact that this couple’s split hits a perfect celebrity sweet spot: These are two people who are absolutely nothing like us, but who nonetheless seem to be splitting up over a familiar gender dynamic that is imminently relatable.\n\nBrady and Bündchen occupied a rare arena of celebrity, insofar as both are among the most recognized people in America, but both are also more often seen than heard. Sure, they did occasional media appearances, but their fame harkens back to what feels like an increasingly bygone age of American celebrity: When people were famous for incredible talent (or, in Bündchen’s case, an incredible beauty and an intuitive sense of how to make the camera capture it).\n\nIn our reality-tv-saturated era, where some of the most famous people in America are TikTok teens and self-described “housewives” and the dominant get-famous-quick scheme seems to be to radically overexpose yourself on social media, Brady and Bündchen cast a far more dignified profile.\n\nWe frankly don’t know much about their daily lives (I had to Google how many kids they have), and what we do know – the no-nightshades diet, Brady’s fake newspaper, his elementary-school bedtime – are the kind of “celebrities: they’re not like us” details that make them fascinating and somewhere between aspirational and charmingly batty.\n\nBrady’s apparent reputation as a political conservative and his previous friendliness with former President Donald Trump threatened to bring him down to mere mortal status, at least among his more liberal fans, until he sidestepped Trump’s overtures for public support. Scandal was averted, and the Brady-Bündchen unit maintained their cast-in-gold aura.\n\nBut their divorce might just bring them down to the earth in the mind of the public. The general consensus among the speculators seems to be that trouble arose when Brady announced he was retiring, but then didn’t actually retire. Bündchen’s public comments indicate a worry about Brady’s health playing a dangerous sport and a desire – after years of sacrificing so that he could thrive professionally – for him to spend more time with their family.\n\nFor a whole lot of heterosexual couples, this dynamic is a familiar and frustrating one. The woman who steps back to care for children and make sure her husband succeeds – and the husband who doesn’t quite seem to appreciate that sacrifice and continues to push professionally far past when he needs to, at the expense of his family.\n\nFor much of the Brady-Bündchen marriage, both have been at the top of their respected fields: Bündchen is one of the most famous supermodels on the planet, and Brady may be the greatest quarterback of all time. But while Bündchen visibly reworked her professional life when she had children, Brady did not. “I deliberately took a step back from modeling in 2015, as I wanted to focus more on my family and personal projects,” Bündchen wrote in her memoir, “Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life.”\n\nShe certainly didn’t stop working. But she did retire from the runway and focused more on photo shoots. She moved to Boston – not exactly a fashion hub – for Brady’s career, and then again to Florida. And it seems that while she was being patient and waiting for him to retire at a reasonable point in his career, she was also worried about the toll football was taking on his body. “Obviously, I have my concerns – this is a very violent sport, and I have my children and I would like him to be more present,” she told Elle magazine in September. “I have definitely had those conversations with him over and over again.”\n\nBrady, too, has remarked that his wife has taken on the lion’s share of managing their lives so that he can play a sport he loves – but that doesn’t seem to have changed his professional decisions. “I think my wife has, you know, held down the house for a long time now,” Brady said on his podcast last year. “And I think there’s things that she wants to accomplish. You know, she hasn’t worked as much in the last 10, 12 years, just raising our family and kind of committing to being in a life in Boston and then moving to Florida. But that’s an issue, and it’s a very difficult issue to reconcile without just saying, ‘Hey, it’s time to retire.’ And I think there’s, you know, we’re coming to the end here too, so I don’t want to miss any of the kids’ stuff.”\n\nBut Brady, unlike his wife, has continued full steam ahead. “I haven’t had a Christmas in 23 years and I haven’t had a Thanksgiving in 23 years,” he said on a recent episode of his podcast. “I haven’t celebrated birthdays with people that I care about that are born from August to late January. And I’m not able to be at funerals and I’m not able to be at weddings.” Last year, Brady said he believes he’s capable of playing until he’s 50 – at which point oldest children (he also has a 15-year-old son with the actress Bridget Moynahan) will be grown.\n\nIn her interview with Elle, Bündchen captured a sentiment I imagine feels familiar to a great many married heterosexual women who spent their 30s and 40s holding down the home front and supporting their husband’s careers, only to see their children become more independent and wonder, what’s next? “I’ve done my part, which is [to] be there for [Tom],” Bündchen told Elle. “I moved to Boston, and I focused on creating a cocoon and a loving environment for my children to grow up in and to be there supporting him and his dreams. Seeing my children succeed and become the beautiful little humans that they are, seeing him succeed, and being fulfilled in his career – it makes me happy. At this point in my life, I feel like I’ve done a good job on that.”\n\nBut, she added: “I have a huge list of things that I have to do, that I want to do.”\n\nWhen women undergo this shift in life stage and the related questions of purpose arise, it can be a big transition for a family, and they need their husbands to step up for their aspirations the way women so often step up so that men can get what they want in life. Too often, though, this give-and-take is only a take.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWe don’t know what happened behind the closed doors of the Brady-Bündchen household. And it is unlikely that this divorce materialized overnight. Rather, like most marital disunions, it’s likely the result of years of smaller misalignments, disagreements and resentments that eventually coalesced into a leaden lump of unhappiness that outweighed all the other good stuff.\n\nBut part of the human fascination with celebrity is projection and aspiration. Celebrities wind up as avatars for our own desires, jealousies, ambitions, and insecurities. We don’t know for sure why Bündchen and Brady split, and we probably never will – it’s possible that each of them might even diagnose different reasons for their marriage’s end. And so what we pull out of their public statements, and the narratives we latch onto, tell us a little bit about their marriage – and a whole lot about the still-unfinished business of equality in American marriages.\n\nNote: This article has been updated to reflect news developments.", "authors": ["Jill Filipovic"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/university-of-tennessee/2024/08/20/is-ut-texas-or-tennessee-which-sec-school-takes-title/74863432007/", "title": "University of Tennessee or University of Texas: Which is the real UT?", "text": "Updated Aug. 20, 2024, 8:22 a.m. ET\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin is not quite orange enough and not quite southeastern enough that this should even be a debate.

The money is separate from the $1,000 in federal dollars that is acting as seed money to get accounts started for newborns.\n\nUnder the program, American children born between 2025 and 2028 will be eligible for a one-time $1,000 contribution from the federal government per toddler to go into a mutual fund or index fund tied to the performance of the stock market. Parents will be able to begin contributing to the accounts in July 2026.\n\n\"This will give millions of children, middle-class families, a stake in American prosperity, a benefit from the rising stock market and a better shot at the American dream,\" Trump said as he thanked Dell and his wife, Susan Dell, for their \"extraordinary act of kindness and patriotism.\"\n\n\"This is truly one of the most generous acts in the history of our country,\" Trump said. \"I mean, you just don't hear about things like that.\"\n\n\"Trump accounts\" were created by the president's mega law popularly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill, which Republicans in Congress passed in July. They are effectively individual retirement accounts (IRAs) for children to encourage families to save and build wealth.\n\nTo qualify, a baby only needs a Social Security number. There are no income restrictions. Parents and others may contribute up to $5,000 a year into the accounts until the child turns 18. An employer may contribute up to $2,500 toward the $5,000 cap. State and local governments and private charities will be allowed to make broad contributions.\n\nFunds can't be withdrawn until the child turns 18. Qualified withdrawals, including for education expenses or credentials, a down payment on a first home or as capital to start a small business, will be taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate.\n\n\"We believe the smartest investment we can make is an investment in children,\" Dell said. \"This act has created a platform for families and friends and companies and philanthropies to contribute to these accounts to create a savings and opportunity and hope and prosperity for tens of millions of children in this country.\"\n\nDell said the $6.25 billion is expected to cover \"Trump accounts\" for children born between 2016 and 2024 who are not covered in the federal program reserved for newborns. The Dell money will go to only the accounts of households with a median income of $150,000 or less.\n\n\"I have spoken to a number of other wealthy Americans, philanthropists,\" Dell said. \"And we are confident that others will join us because we all understand the incredible impact that a gift like this can have on the lives of young Americans.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service released formal guidance on how to implement the “Trump accounts.”\n\nDell previously attended a White House event in June to hear Trump tout the \"Trump accounts\" weeks before the mega bill's passage. Dell Technologies, Salesforce, Uber and Goldman Sachs were among companies that the White House at the time said pledged to invest in accounts for the children of their employees.\n\nThe accounts were originally proposed in the \"Invest America Act,\" sponsored by Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who was on hand for Tuesday's announcement.\n\nThe White House has been working to highlight portions of the One Big Beautiful Bill set to go into effect in the coming year.\n\nBesides the \"Trump accounts,\" the law also extended Trump's 2017 tax cuts, ended taxes on tips, allocated billions in border wall funding and cut Medicaid and food stamp benefits through new eligibility requirements.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/12/03/how-do-trump-accounts-work-what-to-know-for-kids-savings/87582814007/", "title": "How do 'Trump accounts' work?

The accounts are described by financial services company Charles Schwab as a cross between a traditional individual retirement account, or IRA, and a 529 college savings account. Unlike other accounts, the Trump accounts can begin at birth and offer $1,000 seed bonus to accounts belonging to babies born during Trump's second term.\n\nBut babies born before Trump's second term will also have the chance of receiving a cash bonus.\n\nMichael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, announced Dec. 2 that he is giving more than $6 billion to the accounts, expected to cover $250 deposits to 25 million \"Trump accounts.\" The donation applies to children born between 2016 and 2024 who are not covered in the federal program reserved for newborns, born in certain zip codes to parents making a medium income below $150,000.\n\nThe administration is encouraging other billionaires and companies to follow suit.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects other contributions to follow for the new Trump accounts, which he said at a Dec. 3 New York Times Summit will help the eligible American children participate in asset appreciation.\n\nHere's what to know about the Trump accounts.\n\nWho is eligible to create a 'Trump account'?\n\nParents or guardians of children born on or after Jan. 1, 2025, through Dec. 31, 2028, can open an account.

An employer may contribute up to $2,500 toward the $5,000 cap, and state and local governments and private charities will also be allowed to make contributions.\n\nSimilar to retirement accounts, the Trump account funds are tied to a mutual fund or index fund that is impacted by the performance of the stock market.\n\nThe funds are meant to help pay for education, training or a first-time home purchase once the child hits adulthood.

HBO's hit sitcom Silicon Valley aside, the Valley is increasingly putting its money where its heart is.\n\n\"The story is that not just the big guys are giving,\" says Alison Murdock, who has done philanthropic work in the region for years. \"There has been a backlash against Silicon Valley, and nobody wants to be a jerk.\"\n\nMark Zuckerberg speaks out about mass incarceration\n\nThursday, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, launched a multimillion-dollar private preschool, K-8 school and health services for children and families in impoverished East Palo Alto, Calif.\n\nWednesday, Radha Basu, the former general manager of Hewlett-Packard's $1.5 billion channel business, announced that iMerit, the company she founded to help train and prepare millions of marginalized youth in the USA and India for the digital jobs of the future, raised $3.5 million. She's enlisted the help of Michael and Susan Dell, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.\n\n\"How can we bridge the IT industry and employ youth in skilled digital services?\" Basu says. \"Think of this as a bridge between Silicon Valley and youth.\"\n\nThe intersection of tech and philanthropy — some in Silicon Valley call it “philanthrocapitalism\" — is epitomized by e-commerce site YouGiveGoods, which lets people “e-give” tangible goods to causes and start charity drives of their own.\n\nCompany CEO Lisa Tomasi, who created the site, has worked with the NFL, Morgan Stanley and Verizon to help organizations such as Toys for Tots and SPCA shelters.\n\nThe young turks of tech lead the charge, though they learned plenty from the Hewlett and Packard families, Google, Salesforce and others before them, says Sharon Tanenbaum, a non-profit consultant in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\"San Francisco, by far, is the most generous city in the U.S. per capita,\" says Ben Nelson, CEO of Minerva Project, which provides students an Ivy League education for a fraction of the price. \"What's important is for tech millionaires to give as its billionaires have.\"\n\nIndeed, not just the mega-wealthy in tech are giving generously: Increasingly, executives from start-ups are pledging time and money to social causes.\n\nMany have learned from the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, when the tech industry was dinged for a paucity of donations.\n\nVoices: The softer side of Silicon Valley\n\nZuckerberg and Chan contributed $992.2 million in company stock to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2013.

Meta had already complied with such a request from Ukraine’s government and is now “fully blocking the ability of a number of Russian state media entities from broadcasting into Ukraine,” Gleicher added.\n\nOn Monday, Twitter (TWTR) announced that any link shared by a user to a Russian state media organization’s website will automatically receive a label warning viewers that the tweet “links to a Russia state-affiliated media website.” The social network also plans to “reduce the visibility and amplification of this content site-wide, no matter who it comes from,” said Twitter (TWTR) spokesperson Trenton Kennedy.\n\nYouTube said over the weekend it has blocked Russian state media within Ukraine, including RT — although a CNN review Monday found that YouTube still allows Ukrainian IP addresses to access content from RT’s Arabic- and Spanish-language channels, each of which has roughly 6 million subscribers. (YouTube didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nYouTube also said on Saturday that as part of its move to restrict RT and other Russian state media on its platform, it would be “significantly limiting recommendations to these channels.” On Sunday, Gleicher said Meta, too, has applied algorithmic restrictions to Russian state media that should prevent it from surfacing as prominently in users’ feeds.\n\nIn taking those steps, the platforms appeared to acknowledge public pressure from European Union officials for more aggressive action, even as these moves risk further antagonizing Russia. Meta and YouTube previously said they would temporarily prevent a number of Russian channels, including RT, from monetizing their content, but faced calls to do more.\n\n“Platforms cannot be a space for [Russia’s] war lies”\n\nOn Sunday, European Commission leaders held a meeting with the CEOs of Google and YouTube to press the companies further — with some, such as Commissioner Thierry Breton, comparing the Russian invasion to the Jan. 6 Capitol riots in the United States.\n\n“Online platforms took unprecedented steps after the Capitol Hill attacks,” Breton said Sunday, tweeting several images of the virtual meeting. “Surely Russian war #propaganda merits at least the same level of response.”\n\nIn a statement, European Union Vice President Vera Jourova said she appreciated some of the moves taken by Alphabet, the parent company of Google (GOOGL) and YouTube, and that she would remain in touch with the company.\n\n“I expect YouTube and Google to step up efforts to address Russian war propaganda,” Jourova said. “Russia has weaponized information; this is why platforms cannot be a space for its war lies.”\n\nIt is unclear whether EC officials have held similar meetings with other social media CEOs or if similar meetings are being planned. Charles Manoury, a European Commission spokesperson, said only that officials were “exploring various options” to coordinate with online platforms.\n\nTwitter declined to comment when asked whether it has met with EC officials; Meta didn’t respond to a request for comment. Alphabet didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on its Sunday meeting.\n\nRussia pushes back on Big Tech\n\nAs western officials pressure tech platforms to take a tougher stance, Russia has been pushing in the opposite direction.\n\nThe Russian government has already called for YouTube to reverse its restrictions on Russian state media channels and moved to “partially restrict” Facebook access for “fact-checking and labelling” several Russian outlets. Gleicher told reporters on Sunday that Meta’s platforms appear to remain accessible to Russian users for now, though the company is aware of indications that Russia may “throttle our platforms in-country.”\n\nRussia on Monday also demanded that TikTok censor content about the war in Ukraine as well as “related political content,” saying much of it had a “pronounced anti-Russian character.” TikTok didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn light of the pressure from Russia, tech platforms need more support from US and European government officials to stand up to authoritarian regimes, said Alina Polyakova, CEO of the Center for European Policy Analysis, a transatlantic think tank, at a Washington conference on Monday.\n\nRecent legislation passed in Russia that tries to bring foreign tech companies further under the country’s legal jurisdiction could make it much more difficult for western platforms to continue doing business there, Polyakova said. And as Russia continues to impose fines and threaten restrictions on those companies for not removing truthful information, those platforms face a difficult choice that could ultimately affect everyday Russians and their ability to protest the Kremlin.\n\n“YouTube, for example, has been the only reason why Russian opposition voices, or independent voices, have had any avenue for expression in a deeply state-controlled environment,” Polyakova said. “Do these companies just pull out and basically cede this information environment completely to the authoritarian state? It’s a really difficult situation that firms find themselves in.”\n\nThat dilemma extends beyond the big social media platforms. On Friday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister wrote to Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook urging him to “stop supplying Apple (AAPL) services and products to the Russian Federation” and called on Apple (AAPL) to block its app store in the country.

Earnings were boosted by “exceptional” results in gas trading, BP said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe result means that Big Oil — BP (BP), Shell, Total (TOT)Energies, ExxonMobil and Chevron (CVX) — has made more than $58 billion in profits for the third quarter alone. The record earnings come as growing numbers of households in Europe and North America are squeezed by decades-high inflation driven by spiraling energy and food bills.\n\nShareholders, meanwhile, are benefiting handsomely.

Shell has spent $18.5 billion on share buybacks this year, and made juicy dividend payments on top of that.\n\n“We remain focused on helping to solve the energy trilemma — secure, affordable and lower carbon energy,” BP CEO Bernard Looney said in a statement. “We are providing the oil and gas the world needs today, while at the same time, investing to accelerate the energy transition,” he added.\n\nEnergy companies have posted record profits this year off the back of soaring oil and natural gas prices linked to Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nLast week, Shell reported profit of more than $30 billion for the first nine months of the year — 58% more than it recorded for the whole of 2021 while ExxonMobil set a profit record for the second straight quarter.\n\nThe unprecedented set of earnings is fueling renewed calls in Britain and the United States for windfall taxes on energy companies to help households that are struggling to pay rising bills.\n\nBiden threatens higher taxes, restrictions\n\nOn Monday, President Joe Biden accused energy companies of “war profiteering” and said if they didn’t “act beyond their narrow self interest” and “give the American people a break” they would pay “‘a higher tax on their excess profits and face higher restrictions.”\n\nBiden did not explicitly endorse a windfall tax and the specifics of what he would consider are likely to remain vague, but key congressional Democrats have pushed different windfall tax proposals targeting oil companies for more than a year.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Ed Miliband, the opposition Labour Party’s spokesperson on climate change, said on Twitter that BP’s profits are “damning evidence” of the failure of the ruling Conservative Party to levy “a proper windfall tax.”\n\nMiliband said last week that Shell’s gigantic quarterly profit was “further proof that we need a proper windfall tax to make the energy companies pay their fair share.”\n\nThe UK government introduced a £5 billion ($5.8 billion) tax on the windfall profits of oil and gas companies in May but has so far rejected calls to extend it, although Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt has said he’s not opposed in principle and that nothing is off the table. EU governments, on the other hand, agreed a windfall tax in September that they hope will raise $140 billion.\n\nShell CEO Ben Van Beurden, who will step down at the end of this year, told journalists last week that the industry should engage with officials to ensure these taxes are well designed.\n\n“We should prepare and accept that our industry will be looked at for raising taxes in order to fund transfers to those who need it most in these difficult times,” he said.\n\nBP said that it expects oil prices to remain elevated in the fourth quarter due to the recent OPEC+ supply cut and “ongoing uncertainty associated with Russian oil exports.” It also expects gas prices to remain “elevated and volatile” due to a lack of supply in Europe “with the outlook heavily dependent on Russian pipeline flows or other supply disruptions.”\n\nSaudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil and gas company, posted a 39% year-on-year gain in third quarter profit to $42.4 billion on Tuesday.\n\n“While global crude oil prices during this period were affected by continued economic uncertainty, our long-term view is that oil demand will continue to grow for the rest of the decade given the world’s need for more affordable and reliable energy,” CEO Amin H. Nasser said in a statement.\n\n— Phil Mattingly, Betsy Klein, Nikki Carvajal and Maegan Vazquez contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/30/tech/meta-metaverse-transition", "title": "Facebook became Meta one year ago. Its metaverse dream feels as ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nEven by Facebook’s standards, 2021 was a rough year.\n\nA series of damning reports based on leaks from a whistleblower raised uncomfortable questions about Facebook’s impact on society; the company continued reeling from concerns about the use of its platform to organize the January 6 Capitol riot; and privacy changes from Apple threatened its core advertising business. Meanwhile, young users were flocking to TikTok.\n\nAt a virtual reality event on October 28, 2021, CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to turn the page. Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would change its name to Meta and go all in on building a future version of the internet called the “metaverse,” proving to all in the process that the company he launched in 2004 was more than just a social media business.\n\nOne year and billions of dollars later, the so-called metaverse still feels years away, if it ever manifests at all. And the company formerly known as Facebook remains very much a social media business — one that is facing more financial pressure than when it announced the change.\n\nA sign in front of Meta headquarters on April 28, 2022 in Menlo Park, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMeta’s Quest 2 consumer virtual-reality headset, released two years ago, is popular in its category but remains a niche product overall. Its newest headset, the much pricier $1,500 Quest Pro, is intended for enterprise customers and likely won’t move the needle with everyday consumers. And Meta’s flagship social VR app Horizon Worlds can feel like a ghost town (albeit a ghost town with laser tag).\n\nWhile some brands have since made measured bets on the metaverse, including by hiring “chief metaverse officers,” it’s not clear whether consumers actually want to work or play in it, or even know what the hard-to-define term means. The metaverse refers, generally, to a sort of virtual world that people can walk around in, as well as the idea of making the internet more ubiquitous and interconnected.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta’s core business is contracting as it confronts growing competition from TikTok and an advertising industry in retreat amid looming recession fears. The company this week reported its second-ever quarterly drop in revenue and saw profit cut in half from the prior year. It’s selling more ads but making less money on them, and user growth on its social media platforms is slowing. After hitting a $1 trillion market cap for the first time last summer, it’s now worth about a quarter of that, or less than Home Depot.\n\n“The business is not growing in 2022,” said Gil Luria, technology strategist at D.A. Davidson. “There is expectation that it will grow going forward, but that expectation may prove to be optimistic.”\n\nA bet that looked bold a year ago now looks borderline unhinged. Meta lost $9.4 billion in the first nine months of 2022 on its metaverse efforts and expects losses from the unit to “grow significantly year-over-year” in 2023. This has prompted even some of Meta’s supporters to urge it to rethink its strategy shift, and possibly slow it down. (It also prompted a tearful Jim Cramer, host of “Mad Money,” to apologize to viewers for trusting Meta’s management team and recommending that investors buy the stock.)\n\n“People are confused by what the metaverse even means. If the company were investing $1-2B per year into this project, then that confusion might not even be a problem. You would simply do R&D quietly and investors would focus on the core business,” Brad Gerstner, CEO of Altimeter Capital, a shareholder in Meta, wrote in an open letter to Zuckerberg this week. He urged Meta to “cap its metaverse investments to no more than $5B per year with more discrete targets and measures of success.”\n\nThe current pace of spending, he added, “is super-sized and terrifying, even by Silicon Valley standards.”\n\nMeta did not respond to requests for comment on this story.\n\nA sudden shift years in the making\n\nThough the name change was just announced a year ago, the shift from Facebook to Meta has been years in the making. Zuckerberg has said in the past that it’s a long-term bet for the company — not an overnight transformation. It began with Facebook’s 2014 purchase of Oculus VR, and in the years since, the company has rolled out a series of headsets that are increasingly capable, affordable and portable.\n\nMeta’s latest headset, the Quest Pro, is its first effort at combining the immersiveness of VR with the real world. It can display text and fine details in VR, track your eyes and facial features to give you a sense of connection with other people in virtual spaces, and show you a view of the world around you in color while letting you interact with digital objects — all nods toward Meta’s goal of attracting more business users.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the Oculus Rift headset available in 2016: That cost $599, but users also had to connect it to a powerful PC and use it with a sensor camera on a stand that tracked the headset. At first, that headset didn’t even come with tracked hand controllers; it initially shipped to customers with an Xbox controller and a small handheld remote.\n\nAlthough the headsets have improved dramatically, VR and AR are still nascent technologies searching for purpose and popularity. The VR headset market is still tiny compared to, say, an established gadget market like console video games. ABI Research expects 11.1 million VR headsets will ship out this year, about 70% of which it predicts will be Quest 2 headsets. That’s a drop from its estimate of 14.5 million headsets in 2021, of which Quest 2 headsets made up 85% of the total.\n\nThere’s potential for these products, some technology experts say, including in the workplace, but in the near term its adoption by everyday users remains uncertain at best.\n\n“I’m not sure this is going to translate to end-user consumers any time soon,” said David Lindlbauer, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school’s Augmented Perception Lab. (Meta is sponsoring Lindlbauer’s research into developing advanced user interfaces for AR and VR.)\n\nA headset is not a smartphone\n\nFor Zuckerberg, and Meta, that creates a unique challenge.\n\nZuckerberg successfully pivoted Facebook’s operations once before from desktop to mobile devices shortly after taking the company public, a move that helped supercharge its advertising business and ensure its dominance for much of the next decade. But smartphones were already ubiquitous at that time; if anything Facebook was a bit late.\n\nNow, the company is trying to spearhead a new technology and hoping consumers will follow its lead.\n\nMeta has positioned the shift as a sort of existential imperative for the company. After Apple’s app tracking changes hurt Meta’s ability to target ads to its users, the company doesn’t want to rely on any outside hardware or app store in the future.\n\nA visitor to the 2022 Tokyo Game Show tests the Meta Quest 2 VR headset. Stanislav Kogiku/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nBut there’s a big difference between looking at a computer or smartphone display and wearing a headset. While Lindlbauer can imagine using a headset for perhaps an hour a day, alternating between immersive views in VR and digital imagery that mixes with the physical world, “I think we haven’t hit the sweet spot yet of something I want to wear all day,” he said.\n\nMeta is also facing an enormous challenge when it comes to showing off VR content that users like the looks of and want to use repeatedly. According to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal, internal documents show Horizon Worlds has fewer than 200,000 active monthly users, a rounding error for a company with 3.7 billion monthly active users across its various services. (A Meta spokesperson told the Journal that it’s “easy to be a cynic about the metaverse” but Meta thinks it is “the future of computing.”)\n\n“They’re starting with this idea that they want to build one big space like Horizon Worlds in which everybody’s just going to show up and start building stuff,” said Avi Bar-Zeev, founder of AR and VR consultancy RealityPrime and a former employee at Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, where he worked on the HoloLens VR headset. “There’s no virtual world that was ever successful building a canvas that people would just come and start painting.”\n\nZuckerberg has personally received intense criticism for the way Meta envisions work and play interactions in virtual spaces after posting on Facebook an image of his blocky, cartoon-like avatar in Horizon Worlds — an image he later admitted was “pretty basic.”\n\n“As far as the quick-twitch, give-me-more public is concerned, the progress seen so far is a letdown,” said Janna Anderson, director of the Imagining the Internet Center at Elon University. “Meta is suffering tremendous ridicule in social media and in the overall public zeitgeist.”\n\nThe Quest Pro’s face-tracking capabilities can help make avatars’ facial expressions look more realistic: Initially, users can access this tracking in Horizon Worlds and Horizon Workrooms, Meta said, as well as in several developers’ apps such as Painting VR and DJ app Tribe XR.\n\nBut even with facial tracking, what users see when they pop in to Horizon Worlds — blocky, human-like avatars that exist only from the torso up, floating around a virtual plaza — will for now continue to contrast sharply with the image Zuckerberg portrayed during Meta’s Connect event on October 11 of his own full-body avatar.\n\nIn the meantime, investors appear to be getting fed up with the investments in the metaverse at a time when the future of its core business is also deeply uncertain.\n\n“I think kind of summing up how investors are feeling right now is that there are just too many experimental bets versus proven bets on the core,” Jeffries analyst Brent Thill said on Meta’s earnings call this week.\n\nZuckerberg, for his part, is defending the strategy shift. “I’d say that there’s a difference between something being experimental and not knowing how good it’s going to end up being,” he responded. Separately, he added: “I think people are going to look back decades from now and talk about the importance of the work that was done here.”", "authors": ["Rachel Metz Clare Duffy", "Rachel Metz", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/economy/china-cant-help-russia-sanctions-fallout-intl-hnk", "title": "China can't do much to help Russia's sanction-hit economy | CNN ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN Business —\n\nWill China help Russia cope with the fallout from economic sanctions?\n\nThat has been the big question since Russia invaded Ukraine last week. The two nations have forged close ties in recent years, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping calling Russian President Vladimir Putin his “best and bosom friend” in 2019. During Putin’s visit to Beijing last month, the two states proclaimed that their friendship has “no limits.”\n\nThat was before Russia launched its war in Ukraine, and was hit with unprecedented sanctions from Western countries. Now, China’s ability to help its neighbor is being sorely tested. Experts say Beijing’s options are limited.\n\n“China’s leaders are walking a very difficult tightrope on Ukraine,” said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a DC-based think tank.\n\nBeijing has not rushed to help Russia after its economy was slammed by sanctions from all over the world. On Wednesday, Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said that the country won’t participate in sanctions, but he didn’t offer any relief either.\n\nEarlier this week, China’s foreign minister spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart, and said that China was “deeply grieved to see the conflict” and that its “fundamental position on the Ukraine issue is open, transparent and consistent.”\n\nAnd the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a development bank backed by Beijing, said Thursday it was suspending all its activities in Russia as “the war in Ukraine unfolds.”\n\n“China’s complicated messaging suggests that Beijing will continue to blame Washington and its allies for provoking Russia,” Singleton said.\n\nHowever, “such moves will fall far short of further antagonizing the United States on account of Beijing’s desire to avoid a complete breakdown in US-China relations,” he added.\n\nClose but relatively small trading ties\n\nBefore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Putin had deepened his country’s ties with China significantly.\n\nDuring his recent visit to China, the two countries signed 15 deals, including new contracts with Russian energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft. China also agreed to lift all import restrictions on Russian wheat and barley.\n\nLast year, 16% of China’s oil imports came from Russia, according to official statistics. This makes Russia the second biggest supplier to China after Saudi Arabia. About 5% of China’s natural gas also came from Russia last year.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, buys about 70% of its semiconductors from China, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It also imports computers, smart phones, and car components from China. Xiaomi, for example, is among the most popular smartphone brands in Russia.\n\nChina has also signed Russian banks onto its Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), a clearing and settlement system seen as a potential alternative to SWIFT, the Belgium-based secure messaging service that connect hundreds of financial institutions around the world.\n\nChina and Russia share a strategic interest in challenging the West. But the invasion of Ukraine has put the friendship to the test.\n\nFriendship test\n\n“There is not yet any indication that China sees aiding Russia as worth violating Western sanctions,” said Neil Thomas, a China analyst at Eurasia Group, adding that a “flagrant” defiance of those sanctions would come with a “heavy economic punishment” for Beijing as well.\n\n“Beijing’s much-touted lifting of import restrictions on Russian wheat was agreed before the invasion and does not indicate Chinese support,” he said.\n\nWhile Russia needs China for trade, Beijing has other priorities. The world’s second largest economy is Russia’s No. 1 trading partner, accounting for 16% of the value of its foreign trade, according to CNN Business’ calculations based on 2020 figures from the World Trade Organization and Chinese customs data.\n\nBut for China, Russia matters a lot less: Trade between the two countries made up just 2% of China’s total trade volume. The European Union and the United States have much larger shares.\n\nChinese banks and companies also fear secondary sanctions if they deal with Russian counterparts.\n\n“Most Chinese banks cannot afford to lose access to US dollars and many Chinese industries cannot afford to lose access to US technology,” said Thomas.\n\nAccording to Singleton, these Chinese entities “could very quickly find themselves subject to increased Western scrutiny if they are perceived in any meaningful way as aiding Russian attempts to evade U.S.-led sanctions.”\n\n“Recognizing that China’s economy and industrial output have been under enormous pressure in recent months, Chinese policymakers will likely attempt to strike a delicate balance between supporting Russia rhetorically but without antagonizing Western regulators,” he added.\n\nThere have been reports this week that two of China’s largest banks — ICBC and Bank of China — have restricted financing for purchases of Russian commodities, in fear of violating potential sanctions.\n\nReuters also reported Tuesday that China’s coal imports from Russia have stalled because buyers couldn’t secure funding from state banks worried about international sanctions.\n\nICBC and Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.\n\nSignificant practical constraints\n\nEven if China wants to support Russia in areas that are not subject to sanctions — such as energy — Beijing may face severe restrictions, experts said.\n\nThe “financial sanctions that have been imposed on Russia by the West put significant practical constraints on China’s dealings with Russia even where they don’t restrict them directly,” said Mark Williams, chief Asian economist at Capital Economics, in a research note on Wednesday.\n\nSome commentators have suggested that China’s CIPS could be used as an alternative by Russia, now that seven Russian banks have been removed from SWIFT.\n\nBut CIPS is much smaller in size. It has only 75 direct participating banks, compared with more than 11,000 member institutions in SWIFT. About 300 Russian financial institutions are in SWIFT, while only two dozen Russian banks are connected to CIPS.\n\nThe yuan is also not freely convertible, and is used less frequently than other major currencies in international trade. It accounted for 3% of payments globally in January, compared with 40% in the dollar, according to SWIFT. Even China-Russia trade has been dominated by the dollar and euro.\n\n“In practice, because CIPS is limited to payments in [yuan], it is only currently used for transactions with China. Banks elsewhere are unlikely to turn to CIPS as a SWIFT workaround while Russia is an international pariah,” Williams said.\n\nNeither can China replace the United States in providing key technologies for Russia’s needs.\n\nLast week, the Biden administration announced a series of measures to restrict technological exports or foreign goods built with US technology to Russia.\n\nRussia imports mostly low-end computer chips from China, which are used in cars and home appliances. Both Russia and China rely on the United States for high-end chips needed for advanced weapons systems.\n\n“China alone can’t supply all of Russia’s critical needs for the military,” a senior US administration official said at a media briefing last week, according to Reuters. “China doesn’t have any production of the most advanced technology nodes. So Russia and China are both reliant on other supplier countries and of course US technology to meet their needs.”\n\nThat could lead Chinese tech companies — particularly larger ones — to exercise even more caution in potential deals with Russia.\n\n“Some small Chinese firms that do not depend on US inputs may backfill some of Russia’s demand for sanctioned US technology,” said Thomas from Eurasia Group. “But big Chinese tech firms will be cautious to avoid the fate of Huawei, which the US government stunted by cutting its access to advanced semiconductors,” he added.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/15/business/china-economy-challenges-zero-covid-omicron-intl-hnk", "title": "China is risking a big hit to the economy and supply chains with zero ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nThe Chinese government’s unwavering insistence on stamping out any trace of the coronavirus is facing its biggest test yet as authorities grapple with Omicron’s quickening spread. And it could cost the world’s second largest economy dearly this year.\n\nThe Covid-19 variant has been cropping up across China in recent days, including in major port cities like Dalian and Tianjin, prompting restrictions that could upend business operations in those places. The rest of the world is also dealing with Omicron, but China is different because of how intent authorities are on preventing any widespread outbreak by locking down cities and curbing travel.\n\nThe strict approach has so far been effective: China has recorded far fewer Covid-19 cases than many other nations during the pandemic, and its economy was the only major one to grow in 2020.\n\nOmicron, though, threatens to expose some serious flaws in that plan. The variant is much more transmissible than others, making it difficult to contain. And as the rest of the world learns to live with the virus, economists say China’s zero-tolerance strategy is likely to do more bad then good in 2022.\n\nGoldman Sachs, for example, has just slashed its projection for Chinese economic growth in 2022 to 4.3% from 4.8%. That’s roughly half last year’s growth rate.\n\nThose revisions come “in light of the latest Covid developments — in particular, the likely higher average level of restriction (and thus economic cost) to contain the more infectious Omicron variant,” Goldman analysts wrote in a research note Tuesday.\n\nMorgan Stanley is taking a similar view that Omicron could mean the costs of a zero-Covid approach outweigh the benefits. Last week its analysts forecast growth of 4.9% in the first quarter, but suspect it could slow to 4.2% “should Omicron spread to other regions and lead to multiple city-wide lockdowns.”\n\nThe analysts cited a “deeper disruption to services” as a top risk for China, if the country extends containment measures to several cities. That would mark China’s most severe and widespread attempt to contain the coronavirus since April 2020, when it lifted its massive lockdown on Wuhan, the original epicenter of the virus.\n\nThe rest of the world is also dealing with a rapid escalation of Omicron cases, but China is different because of how intent authorities are on preventing any widespread outbreak. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nThreats to supply chains\n\nAlong with the country’s precarious services sector, which is already struggling because of sporadic Covid outbreaks and antivirus measures, Omicron could deal a blow to factories and supply chains, compounding the economic threat.\n\nAn outbreak of the older Delta variant forced the industrial hub of Xi’an into lockdown earlier this year, affecting production lines of global chip makers like Samsung and Micron.\n\nAnd then there are the Omicron cases detected in major port cities. Ship congestion at Chinese ports has worsened recently as more cities implement strict Covid restrictions because of the outbreaks, or as they tighten testing policies ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday season starting January 31.\n\nThe Shekou terminal in Shenzhen, for example, has begun restricting truckers bringing in loaded containers. Starting Friday, truckers can only enter the terminal if they have bookings for export-bound containers on vessels arriving within three days, the operator said in a statement this week.\n\nThe restrictions echo those from last year, when several Chinese ports briefly shut down after infections were found amount dock workers. Those issues created backlogs of containers waiting to leave, and ships waiting to dock — and added to the pressure on strained global supply chains.\n\nSo far, there doesn’t appear to have been a lasting impact on trade. Customs data released Friday showed that exports jumped 21% in December from a year ago, exceeding expectations. The country’s trade surplus was $676 billion in 2021, an all-time high.\n\nThat indicates that China’s strategy might actually be helping: Export orders may have shifted to China from other developing countries because of the “Omicron damage to the global supply chain,” according to Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist for Pinpoint Asset Management.\n\nEven so, there are risks — especially if China imposes a nationwide lockdown.\n\n“Although China’s latest virus wave doesn’t appear to have dented exports much in December, media reports point to growing virus-linked congestion and delays at a number of major Chinese ports since the start of the year,” wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, in a Friday research note. “With cases popping up in even more port cities in recent days, including Dalian and Shanghai, the situation is likely to worsen in the near-term, pulling down shipments this month.”\n\nStaying the course, at a price\n\nChina isn’t likely to let up on its zero-Covid approach for a while. One reason: the country’s Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine isn’t as effective as others against the variant, according to recent reports.\n\n“The population has virtually no antibodies against Omicron,” wrote executives at Eurasia Group in a report published earlier this month. “Keeping the country locked down for two years has now made it more risky to open it back up.”\n\nAlong with concerns about the health of its population, a handful of significant, upcoming events will likely persuade Beijing to stay the course.\n\nThe country hosts the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, making the containment of Omicron important in the near term. Chinese President Xi Jinping is also widely expected to seek a historic third term in office when the Chinese Communist Party holds its 20th Party Congress in the second half of this year, underscoring the need for stability in the meantime.\n\nStill, the economic cost of containing an aggressive variant could be great. Analysts at Nomura wrote this week that retail sales and other services could take a big hit if there are more lockdowns, adding that the benefits of zero-Covid are “likely diminishing while costs are rising.” They forecast GDP growth of 2.9% for the first quarter, and 4.3% for the entirety of 2022.\n\nEurasia Group president Ian Bremmer and chairman Cliff Kupchan, meanwhile, labeled the failure of China’s zero-Covid policy as the top global geopolitical risk for 2022, suggesting that a breakdown could lead to larger outbreaks, more severe lockdowns and greater economic disruption.\n\n“It’s the opposite of where Xi Jinping wants his country to be in the run-up to his third term, but there’s nothing he can do about it,” they wrote in their forecast this month. “The initial success of zero Covid and Xi’s personal attachment to it makes it impossible to change course.”", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/energy/spr-explained", "title": "What is the SPR, and why does Biden want to use it to fight Russia ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe US Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a man-made underground government storage complex built inside four separate salt domes on the Texas and Louisiana Gulf coast.\n\nCombined, the four SPR locations currently hold about 600 million barrels of crude oil. They’re about to get 30 million barrels lighter.\n\nThe Biden administration, in conjunction with the 30 other member nations of the International Energy Agency’s governing board, authorized the release of 60 million barrels of emergency oil reserves to stave off price increases resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Half of that oil will come out of the SPR.\n\nThe West hopes that adding supply to the global energy market will put a ceiling on oil prices. Although Russia hasn’t cut off supply to the rest of the world – and market analysts don’t expect it to – oil prices have nonetheless surged above $100 in recent weeks. Russian oil has become toxic to many oil traders, who report trouble securing financing from Western banks to buy it.\n\nIf Russian President Vladimir Putin decides to restrict oil shipments, even by a small amount, that could send global oil prices through the roof. The SPR remains one tool in President Joe Biden’s toolbox to counteract supply constraints.\n\nBut it’s not a catch-all. In fact, it might not even make a dent.\n\nWhat is the SPR?\n\nThe SPR was created in the wake of the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, when oil-producing nations in the Middle East halted exports. The resulting oil and gasoline shortages sent energy prices sky-high, and the US economy fell into a recession.\n\nIt held a record 727 million barrels of oil in 2009, but the United States has been gradually reducing its storage over the past decade. Its maximum capacity has since been reduced a bit to 714 million barrels.\n\nIntended to insulate the United States from supply shocks, it has been used more as a political tool for presidents facing angry voters when gas prices are high.\n\nFor example, Biden released 50 million barrels in November – the largest SPR release on record – when gas prices were about $3.50 a gallon.\n\nThe Obama administration released 30 million barrels (the previous record), in 2011 when oil crept up to $100 a barrel. The George W. Bush administration released 20.8 million barrels in 2005 just before Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf coast.\n\nWhy it won’t make a big difference\n\nThe world consumes 100 million barrels of oil per day. Although 60 million barrels may sound like a lot, that’s what the world consumes in about 16 hours.\n\nOil investors, clearly unimpressed by the IEA nations’ plan, reacted by sending even higher after the announcement. Oil hit fresh seven-year highs Tuesday.\n\n“The bottom line is this is not enough to cool off the market. It’s a bit of a band-aid solution,” said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nUS crude spiked about 10% Tuesday morning to an intraday high of $105.14 a barrel. That’s the highest level since 2014. Brent crude, the world benchmark, soared about 8% to $105.40 a barrel.\n\n“You need to super-size the [SPR release] numbers,” said Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities.\n\nIn November, when the Biden administration released a record amount of oil from the SPR, prices dipped a bit – and tumbled when the Omicron variant kept people from traveling again. But within months, energy prices were right back to where they started.\n\n“We released 50 million barrels and the market ran over it like a train. I don’t know why it would be any different this time,” said Yawger.\n\nStill, energy industry executives and analysts conceded the Russia-Ukraine crisis is precisely what the SPR is designed for: to cushion the market against national security-related supply shocks. “It’s better than doing nothing,” Yawger added.\n\nBut it’s not a long-term solution. Emergency reserves can hold only a finite amount. In fact, the SPR holds the lowest amount of oil since September 2002, according to government statistics.\n\nMatt Smith, lead Americas oil analyst at Kpler, said emergency releases are arguably bullish from a market sentiment standpoint.

And as a 20-year resident of Peru, where he also holds citizenship, he doesn't seem to support the president's immigration policies.\n\nPrevost, now known as Pope Leo XIV, is committed to social justice and helping migrants, according to those who know him, mirroring the viewpoints of his predecessor, Pope Francis, who Trump feuded with over his hardline immigration polices during his first time.\n\nAnd the 69-year-old Leo has a trail of social media posts promoting opinion articles critical of Vice President JD Vance ‒ one as recent as April 14 ‒ over Vance's interpretation of Scripture and his position on immigration. A decade earlier, Leo shared a 2015 column on X, then Twitter, written by a fellow cardinal with the headline \"Why Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric is so problematic.\"\n\nThe pope's history of sharing those sentiments online suggest Leo might not hold back from criticizing Trump's actions in office if he believes it's warranted. And it raises questions about how the the next presidential-papal relationship will unfold.\n\nTrump has not addressed the social media posts shared by Leo before he became pope. So far, he's only congratulated Leo.\n\n\"To have the pope from the United States of America, that's a great honor,\" Trump told reporters on May 8, making a surprise appearance outside the West Wing shortly after 133 cardinals from across the globe chose Prevost on the second day of the papal conclave in Rome. \"I was watching and they said, 'He's from America.' And I said, 'That's great.'\"\n\nLeo, considered a surprise pick, spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru and has dual Peruvian nationality. He became a cardinal only in 2023.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Leo's past criticism of the president and vice president.\n\nBut some Trump supporters have already expressed their opposition to Leo.\n\nConservative social media influencer Laura Loomer, who has a close personal relationship with Trump, posted a string of anti-Leo tweets to her 1.6 million followers, including calling him a \"Marxist puppet\" and complaining that he's \"anti-MAGA\" and \"WOKE\" and supports \"Open Borders.\n\nWhat has Pope Leo said about Trump and Vance's positions?\n\nOn Feb. 3, Leo shared an opinion article on X written by Cuban-American author Kat Armas with the headline: \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.\"\n\nThe author took exception with comments Vance, who is Catholic, made in a Jan. 29 Fox News interview when the vice president said: \"There is a Christian concept that you love your family and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens, and then after that, prioritize the rest of the world. A lot of the far left has completely inverted that.\"\n\nOn Feb. 13, Leo shared a different article on X that also took aim at Vance's interpretation of the “order of love” to justify the Trump administration scaling back foreign aid programs.\n\n\"Mr. Vance supports a policy that does not allow migrants forced to leave their homes by violence and extreme hardship even to apply for asylum, a right legally enshrined in the U.S. Refugee Act of 1980,\" theologian Stephen J. Pope writes in the article. \"Catholic ethics values an ordered patriotic love of one’s country, yes, but not a nationalistic xenophobia that refuses to see fellow human beings in extreme need as one’s neighbors.\"\n\nOn April 14, Leo retweeted criticism of Trump and President of El Salvador Nayib Bukele's response to the deportation of El Salvadorian national Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a resident of Maryland. Trump and his administration have vigorously defended the removal of Abrego Garcia, even though Department of Justice lawyers have said it was carried out in error.\n\nThe commentary embraced by Leo is not unlike the occasional statements the late Pope Francis made about Trump's approach to immigration, including Trump's long-touted wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Francis told reporters regarding Trump, \"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. This is not the gospel.\" Trump responded that the pontiff’s remarks were “disgraceful.”\n\nBut one year later, Trump played nice and met Francis four months into his first term as part of his first trip abroad as leader of the free world. The private meeting took place on May 24, 2017 at Vatican City.\n\n\"Honor of a lifetime to meet His Holiness Pope Francis. I leave the Vatican more determined than ever to pursue PEACE in our world,\" Trump said at the time.\n\nAfter the election of Leo, Trump said he looks forward to his first meeting with Pope Leo XIV. \"It will be a very meaningful moment!\" Trump said.\n\nJust like the meeting with Francis, Trump and Leo might have to put differences aside.\n\nContributing: Reuters.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/27/shooting-minneapolis-church-school-live-updates/85847297007/", "title": "'Absolutely breaks my heart': Minneapolis community mourns after ...", "text": "Aug. 27, 2025 Updated Aug. 28, 2025, 9:32 a.m. ET\n\nEditor's note: This page summarizes news on the Minneapolis school shooting for Wednesday, Aug. 27. For the latest updates on the shooting at Annunciation Church, visit USA TODAY's coverage for Thursday, Aug. 28.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS − Two children were killed Wednesday and at least 17 people were injured when a shooter fired through the windows of a Minneapolis Catholic Church toward young students worshipping at Mass, authorities said.\n\nThe shooting occurred at Annunciation Church, which also houses a school, just before 8:30 a.m., authorities said. The shooter approached the outside of the church building and fired inside toward the children sitting in pews, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said.\n\nThe two children killed were ages 8 and 10. Fourteen of the 17 injured were children, and two of them are in critical condition, O'Hara said.\n\nThe assailant died at the rear of the church from a self-inflicted wound, according to O'Hara, who said the weapons used in the attack had been purchased legally and recently.\n\nAuthorities at an afternoon news conference identified the shooter as Robin Westman, 23. FBI Director Kash Patel said the attack is being investigated as \"an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics.''\n\nThe Mass was in celebration of the first week of school, authorities confirmed. \"The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,\" O'Hara said.\n\n'We feel the pain': Catholics grieve in wake of deadly attack during Mass in Minneapolis\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ In addition to the 14 injured children, three parishioners in their 80s were wounded in the shooting, O'Hara said.\n\n∎ The school posted a message on Facebook sharing its grief and expressing gratitude to its \"heroic staff'' and law enforcement for their efforts to protect the students after the attack began.\n\n∎ The shooting came after at least three other fatal shootings in the city in the last 24 hours that do not appear to be related to the Annunciation incident, O'Hara said.\n\n'Absolutely breaks my heart': Community gathers at vigil for victims\n\nTears dripped down Rosemary Andrade’s cheeks as she picked up a marker and wrote a message on a cross. The cross is a memorial for the eight-year-old child who died in the shooting. Another cross for the 10-year-old child who died sat next to it.\n\nAndrade, 17, remembers sitting in the pews of Annunciation Church herself. She told the USA TODAY Network on Wednesday that she was a student there for nine years. She said the shooting hit home.\n\n“Knowing I could have been in those benches, that I was once in those benches at that church, praying to God,” Andrade said. “Knowing what happened to those kids, who didn't deserve that, absolutely breaks my heart.”\n\nAndrade is among the many Minnesotans who attended a prayer vigil for the two children. Attendees sat in folding plastic chairs, on bleachers, and stood along the sides to hear Archbishop Bernard Hebda speak in the Academy of Holy Angels High School gymnasium that night.\n\n“I'm not usually that emotional, but I was genuinely shaking,” said Elaina Polding, 17, who goes to youth group at Annunciation Church.\n\nHebda spoke with the USA TODAY Network after the vigil. As the FBI investigates the attack as \"an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics,\" he stressed the importance of holding onto faith.\n\n\"We really have no other choice than to stick to our faith,\" he said. \"That's who we are, and we hope that we're always going to be a community of love that welcomes, but we have to be faithful to who we are.\"\n\nFirst lady calls for 'pre-emptive intervention' to identify potential shooters\n\nIn a rare statement on X, first lady Melania Trump called for \"pre-emptive intervention\" to identify \"potential school shooters.\"\n\n\"Early warning signs are often evident, with many individuals exhibiting concerning behaviors and making violent threats online prior to their actions,\" Melania Trump wrote, adding that being aware of those signs and \"acting quickly can save lives and make American communities safer.\"\n\n\"To prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioral threat assessments across all levels of society—beginning in our homes, extending through school districts and of course, social media platforms,\" she said.\n\nThe first lady also called the shooting a “senseless and depraved violent act,” and shared her condolences for the victims' families and friends.\n\n\"There is nothing that anyone can say to make your grief go away, but please know that you are not alone. My thoughts, love, and deepest sympathy are with you during this dreadful time,\" she added.\n\nChildren as young as 6 injured\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Hennepin County Medical Center said it received 10 of the most seriously injured victims. Earlier, the hospital reported that it had 11 patients.\n\nMost of the patients were children who ranged in age from 6 to 14, according to Dr. Thomas Wyatt, chair of emergency medicine. Four of the patients required surgery, he said, adding that the area children's hospitals treated some of the other, less critical pediatric patients.\n\nIn a later update, the hospital said one adult and five children remained in critical condition. Three other children and another adult were being treated for non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nSocial media statement taken down\n\nAt an afternoon news conference, O'Hara referenced online messages from the shooter released Wednesday that were timed to publish during the attack. He said the FBI ordered the YouTube clips to be taken down and was reviewing them.\n\n\"This manifesto appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings,\" said O'Hara, adding that police have not ascertained a motive.\n\nAsked whether the assailant had attended Annunciation school, O'Hara said investigators haven't confirmed that but are looking into it. According to public records cited by Reuters, Westman's mother, Mary Westman, had been an administrative assistant at Annunciation Church.\n\nArchived versions of the videos from the now-deleted YouTube page show the shooter displaying a handwritten journal and an arsenal of firearms and ammunition. The footage, posted hours before the shooting, alluded to a handwritten note that includes the name Robin Westman. The videos included a handwritten map of the interior of Annunciation Church. The note references severe depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nThe shooter’s firearms were marked with a variety of political slogans in silver marker in both English and Russian. O'Hara said police were processing four search warrants seeking the shooter's motive and had seized other firearms.\n\nShooter had messages on rifle magazine, DHS chief says\n\nIn a post on social media, Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the shooter had the words, \"‘For the Children’ and ‘Where is your God?’ and ‘Kill Donald Trump’ on a rifle magazine.\"\n\n\"This level of violence is unthinkable,'' she wrote. \"Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere.\"\n\nLongtime neighbor vouches for Westman family as 'great people'\n\nThe Westman family home is about half a mile southwest of Annunciation Catholic School. Terry Cole has lived in that same Windom neighborhood for more than 20 years.“We walk around the neighborhood and we can tell you who lives in every house,” Cole said, expressing surprise a member of the Westman family would be involved in such a brutal attack. “They’re great people,” Cole said.As Cole and the neighborhood move forward, the impacted families are top of mind. “It just feels so bad for both of (the victims) and for the families,” Cole said.\n\nPope Leo sends his condolences to the Twin Cities\n\nPope Leo XIV sent his “heartfelt condolences” to church leadership in the Twin Cities, according to Archbishop Bernard Hebda of Minneapolis and St. Paul.\n\nHebda said he received a telegram in which the first American leader of the Catholic Church also expressed \"the assurance of spiritual closeness to all those affected by this terrible tragedy, especially the families now grieving the loss of a child.\"\n\nThe Pontiff commends \"the souls of the deceased children to the love of Almighty God\" and \"prays for the wounded as well as the first responders, medical personnel and clergy who are caring for them and their loved ones,” according to the telegram.\n\nPope Leo imparted his Apostolic blessing on those impacted by the tragedy as a \"pledge of peace, fortitude, and consolation in the Lord Jesus.”\n\n− Amanda Myers\n\nShooter fired from outside the church\n\nThe shooter, who was not immediately identified, fired through church windows from the outside of the building. The attacker may have also gone inside the church, but investigators haven't determined whether the person also fired from inside the building.\n\nThe number of rounds fired was \"in the dozens,\" O'Hara said. The shooter is believed to have used three firearms: a rifle, a shotgun, and a pistol.\n\n\"Children are dead,\" Mayor Jacob Frey said. \"Those families are suffering immense pain right now. Think of this as if it were your own. Every one of us needs to be wrapping our arms around these families, giving them every ounce that we can muster.\"\n\nLocal business went into lockdown, says shooting hits close to home\n\nHours after Kowalski’s Markets in south Minneapolis opened for the day, Johna Green was standing outside the store when she heard gunshots ring out down the block at Annunciation Catholic School.\n\n“It was very rapid fire, probably like 20 to 30 shots total,” Green told USA TODAY, adding that she hustled her customers inside and the store went on lockdown.\n\nGreen said the shooting has hit close to home, particularly because store employees recently lost a loved one to gun violence and have a close relationship with the school. “Those kids come in here every day and get our donuts, we do donations to the school all the time,” she said. “This really hits hard for us.”\n\nBen Olson, who works down the street at Fixt Rite Auto Repair & Tire Center, said he noticed a handful of squad cars on his way into work, and by 9 a.m. a heavy law enforcement presence had engulfed the area. From his position about a block southwest of the school, he could see crowds of students and parents leaving and hear a helicopter circling overhead.\n\n“We're very concerned. A lot of us here are parents and have young children that are either just about to enter school or are already in school,” Olson said. “And us being kind of a staple in the community here, it’s very concerning because we’re very close with a lot of the neighborhood residents here and have been for quite some time.”\n\n−N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nGovernor decries 'horrific act of violence'\n\n\"I’m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence,\" Minnesota Gov. Walz said.\n\n\"There is no active threat to the community at this time,\" the Minneapolis Police Department said in an update earlier Wednesday.\n\n\"A man dressed in all black and armed with a rifle was reported at the scene,\" neighboring Richfield Police said in a social media post.\n\nStudents were in their first week of school\n\nStudents at Annunciation Catholic School were in their first week back from summer break, according to Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith.\n\n\"These kids should not be fearing for their lives,\" Smith said.\n\nThe Annunciation Catholic School has students from preschool through eighth grade, according to its website.\n\nParents rush to the site of the shooting\n\nParents were seen rushing to the school amid the chaos. Both parents and students trickled down West Diamond Lake Road as law enforcement officers blocked the street roughly half a mile from the church.\n\nMany law enforcement agencies were on the scene, including the Minneapolis Police Department, State Patrol and the FBI.\n\nNeighbor recalls hearing gunshots\n\nResident David Gartner texted his neighbor when he first heard what seemed like roughly four spurts of gunfire. “It sounded like a nail gun at first,” Gartner said.\n\nThe street was initially calm, and he said the only sign a shooting took place was moments later when police arrived.\n\nGartner has lived near the border of Minneapolis’ Windom and Tangletown neighborhoods for more than 25 years. He said nothing like this has happened in the immediate area before.\n\nNow he and his neighbors are outside waiting to learn more. “The neighbors are all out checking on each other,” he said.\n\nInterfaith chaplain to parents: 'God is always with you'\n\nInterfaith Chaplain Howard Dotson met with parents and students at the reunification point. Dotson said he arrived at the school around 9:15 a.m. and saw students coloring pictures of hearts.\n\n\"I told the children and parents, ‘God’s hedge of protection is around you. God protects your heart and mind. God is always with you,'\" Dotson said.\n\nThe chaplain said his favorite interaction was with the music teacher, who he said told him students sang songs like “Lord Prepare Me to be a Sanctuary.” Dotson said music and art can help students cope with the shooting. He would like Minneapolis to bolster its use of chaplains in crisis response.\n\n“There’s not enough chaplains,” Dotson said. “We need more chaplains, psychological first aid, because these traumatic incidents keep happening, and people need that emotional, spiritual support immediately.”\n\nFlags at half-staff to honor shooting victims\n\nPresident Donald Trump ordered all flags on government property to be flown at half-staff as “a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated,” the White House said on X.\n\nThe proclamation, which orders flags to be lowered at public buildings, on naval ships and at military posts nationwide and abroad, will be in effect until sunset on Sunday.\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nReligious leaders express shock and sadness\n\nLocal religious leaders were quick to condemn the bloodshed.\n\n\"Our hearts are shattered by the horrific act of violence that occurred at Annunciation Catholic Church and School in Minneapolis,\" Patrick M. Neary, the bishop of The Diocese of Saint Cloud, said in a statement.\n\nHe added: \"As Catholics, we believe in the dignity of every human life. That dignity is destroyed when violence becomes routine.\"\n\nThe Sisters of the Order of Saint Benedict reacted to the shooting in a Facebook post.\n\n\"Our hearts grieve with Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis and with the two families who have lost a child,\" it said. \"These acts of violence are horrific, senseless and far too frequent. Lord, have mercy on our world, and be with the students, families, staff and community in this tragic time.\"\n\n− Teagan King\n\nAnnunciation Church rampage is the latest mass shooting in the US\n\nThe deadly shooting at Annunciation Church was the 286th mass shooting in the United States, and the latest to rock the city of Minneapolis, according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive.\n\nThe organization defines a mass shooting as an incident in which at least four people are struck by gunfire, not including the shooter. This year, mass shootings have broken out in 43 states and Washington, D.C., the nonprofit says.\n\nMinneapolis has experienced at least six mass shootings this year, data shows, including an incident on Tuesday in which a gunman opened fire on a group of people standing on a sidewalk across the street from a high school, killing one person and injuring six others.\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nShooting erupts after at least 3 others in the past 24 hours\n\nThe school attack followed within 24 hours at least three other fatal gunfire incidents in Minneapolis, including a mass shooting on Tuesday afternoon in which one person died and six were injured when a gunman opened fire in broad daylight at people standing on a sidewalk.\n\nTwo other people were killed in two other shootings in the last day, according to the Minneapolis Police Department. Police said it was unclear whether the first three shootings were related.\n\n\"The level of gun violence across the city within the last day is deeply unsettling,\" O'Hara said in a statement after the third reported shooting early Wednesday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/27"}]}

It is the most endangered of the world’s 128 marine mammal species, and lives about 50 miles south of the Arizona border in the northernmost part of the Gulf of California near Puerto Peñasco (Rocky Point).\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has estimated there are fewer than 60 vaquitas left. In a statement issued Friday by the Phoenix Zoo, that number was cut by half. The vaquita, which literally translates to \"little cow,\" has been decimated over the years by gillnetting. That type of fishing method uses walls of netting to target a particular fish, but vaquitas often get tangled in the nets and drown.\n\nThe Association of Zoos and Aquariums and its members pledged more than $1 million and the Mexican government pledged up to $3 million toward the rescue of the vaquita porpoise. The Phoenix Zoo joined the fundraising campaign to help finance an international action plan to create a sanctuary in the Gulf of California that would encourage vaquitas to reproduce and thrive until they can return to a habitat free from gillnetting. Officials announced Friday that the zoo had met its fundraising goal.\n\nARIZONA ANIMALS: El Jefe is missing in action | Rare jaguar spotted in mountains of Arizona​ | 18 famous animals from Arizona​\n\nThe zoo began requesting public donations at ticket windows on March 8, and the option to \"Round Up for Conservation\" is available. So far, visitors have donated more than $12,0000 to the cause. The Phoenix Zoo also sent $50,000 from its conservation fund to the project, and an additional $15,000 from the Arizona Center for Nature Conservation Board of Trustees.\n\nPHOENIX ZOO: Animals blow up Twitter in #CuteAnimalTweetoff | Phoenix Zoo Then and Now​\n\nThe vaquita is part of the cetacean family, which includes whales, dolphins and porpoises. It has a \"dark ring around its eyes and dark patches on its lips that form a thin line from the mouth to the pectoral fins,\" according to the World Wildlife Federation. \"Its dorsal surface is dark gray, sides pale gray and ventral surface white with long, light gray markings. Newborn vaquita have darker coloration.\" A mature vaquita is about 5 feet long and weighs 120 pounds.\n\nIn 1997, there were an estimated 567 vaquitas remaining, according to a study by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Experts have cited gillnetting as the chief cause of population decline; fishermen use the technique to catch an endangered fish, the totoaba, that lives among vaquitas. The fish is highly desired by Asian markets for the purported medicinal value of its swim bladder. A single bladder can bring in $10,000.\n\nThe vaquita conservation plan would temporarily remove the mammals from their current habitat and create a “safe heaven” in the northern Gulf of California. The porpoises would be housed and cared for by veterinarians and animal specialists from the U.S. and Mexico. Implementation of this plan would take several years and cost more than $3.7 million in 2017 alone.\n\nIn May 2015, Mexico's president implemented a two-year ban on gillnettings where vaquitas live and breed, and the Mexican navy enforces the ban. As a deterrent, local fishermen and surrounding communities are compensated for the lost income, but the fisheries division of the NOAA says the illegal practice continues.\n\nRecently, dozens of fishermen angered by the gilnettings ban overturned inspectors’ trucks, burned or destroyed vehicles and patrol boats, and beat three inspectors from the country's environmental protection office in a town on the Gulf of California, the Associated Press reported.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/03/29/rarest-animal-in-the-world/72867145007/", "title": "What is the rarest animal in the world?

The act is credited with saving 99% of listed species from extinction.\n\nBut, other species remain on the brink of extinction in the U.S. and around the globe. Heat, drought and rising seas brought on by climate change are threatening many species' habitats. Rhinos, which are among the most endangered land animals, face near-unlivable climate change-related rising temperatures in southern Africa, a recent study found.\n\nWhat is the rarest animal in the world?\n\nThe vaquita is the rarest animal in the world and the rarest marine mammal. These porpoises swim in the Gulf of California and were only discovered in 1958, according to the World Wildlife Fund. They are on the brink of extinction, in part, because of the use of gillnets in illegal fishing operations, which often unintentionally trap marine mammals.\n\nThere are only about 10 vaquita remaining.\n\nBut there are still signs of hope – conservationists in northern Mexico spotted a vaquita calf swimming next to its mother in Sept. 2023, a promising sign of population growth.\n\nTwo species of rhinos are contenders for the title of rarest land mammal for different reasons. The Javan rhino is the “most threatened of the five rhino species” when it comes to poaching, according to the WWF. Only about 70 reside in the Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, Indonesia. But the Sumatran rhino, the wooly rhino’s closest living descendent, is threatened due to habitat loss. Remaining Sumatran rhinos live in “small, fragmented non-viable populations,” with low chances of finding each other to mate.\n\nWhat are the most endangered animals?\n\nHere are the top 10 species in the “critically endangered” category based on population size estimates from the WWF:\n\nOthers on the critically endangered list include the African forest elephant, black rhinos, Bornean orangutans, eastern lowland gorillas, hawksbill turtles, Sumatran orangutans, Sumatran rhinos and western lowland gorillas.\n\nWhat is the rarest fish in the world?\n\nThe Devils Hole pupfish are the rarest fish in the world. Last year, scientists counted just 175 of them swimming in a deep cavernous pool in the Death Valley National Park in Nevada. But the population has held steady in recent years, even reaching 236 during one fall count when food was more abundant. In 2013, there were only 35 fish.\n\nThese fish, who get their name from the way they “frolic about,” live an isolated life and share no common ancestry with any other species.

Matt Gaetz didn't get his way last year when he sought to give Eglin Air Force Base personnel the right to fire munitions into the Department of Defense's vast Gulf of Mexico Test Range without considering the harm that might inflict on population of the Rice's Whale, one of the world's most endangered marine mammal species.\n\nFlorida's First District congressman has again introduced legislation asking his colleagues to support Air Force exemptions to the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammals Protection Act. The exemptions would allow for testing and training activities \"that include the use of live or inert impact weapons or aerial gunnery\" that \"may result in the incidental take of the Rice's Whale.\"\n\nAn incidental taking is the unintended harming or killing of a threatened or endangered species during the performance of an otherwise legal activity.\n\nRice's Whales, also known as Gulf of Mexico Whales, are closely monitored because it is believed only about 50 remain in existence. The species, unique to the waters of America, was only identified as distinct in 2021 when researchers for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were able to confirm physical and genetic traits that set it apart from the Bryde's Whale, its closest relative.\n\nIt resides almost exclusively in a deep depression along the continental shelf running about 60 miles off the coast between Pensacola and Fort Myers. The DeSoto Canyon, as the depression is called, offers refuge for the critically endangered whale from the noise generated by ship traffic and oil drilling operations.\n\nThe whale's only chance for survival likely depends upon compliance with the provisions of the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammals Protection Act, said Christian Wagley an organizer for the conservation group Healthy Gulf.\n\n\"These laws work and the people of this nation support them, Congress doesn't need to meddle with them,\" he said.\n\nGroups like Healthy Gulf question the proposed legislation because, as was the case last year, the Air Force did not request that Gaetz introduce it and it is unclear what benefits the Fort Walton Beach Republican believes can be derived from the exemption he seeks.\n\nAs it stands now the Air Force is free at any time to request that NOAA grant an incidental taking exemption in support of national security, Wagley said.\n\nLast year, Gaetz spoke at a congressional hearing to request an Air Force general's assistance in pushing for the Eglin exemption. Gaetz said that the whale's presence in the Gulf of Mexico had brought over-water munitions testing at Eglin to a halt.\n\nThat statement wasn't true. The Air Force had stopped weapons testing in the Gulf range because its mandate to do so had expired.\n\nThe Air Force took great pains to work with the National Marine Fisheries Service last year in developing its 2023-30 letter of authorization to resume weapons testing in the Gulf in a manner that would increase protections for the Rice's Whale. A final authorization notice, written into the Federal Register, states as much.\n\n\"The USAF has agreed to procedural mitigation measures that would reduce the possibility and/or severity of impact expected to result from acute exposure to live explosives and inert munitions impacts to marine mammal habitat,\" the Federal Register document states. \"The U.S. Air Force will prohibit the use of live or inert munitions in Rice's Whale habitat during the effective period for the proposed (letter of authorization).\"\n\nThat Eglin would work as diligently as it did to help preserve Rice's Whale comes as no surprise, said the National Resources Defense Council's Michael Jasny.\n\n\"Eglin for decades has worked to serve as solid stewards of the environment,\" Jasny said. \"Real environmental leadership has been realized by Eglin.\"\n\nGaetz defended his amendment by saying Eglin is not utilizing enough of its estimated 120,000-square-mile water range.\n\n\"Since I have been in Congress, there has been no harm to Rice’s whales from munitions and missile testing at the Eglin Gulf Test & Training Range. And Eglin Air Force Base does not believe reopening the areas currently restricted would endanger the Rice’s whales,\" he said in an email. \"Therefore, my amendment is an effort to get the range fully operational again, which is vital to our national defense.”\n\nShould the Gaetz legislation be signed into law as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, it would force Eglin and the Air Force to release itself from the Marine Mammals Protection Act, Jasny said.\n\n\"This would be such a black mark,\" he said.\n\nIn a draft paper discussing the possible impacts of the Gaetz amendment, officials from NRDC wrote extensively about the ground breaking work the U.S. Navy had done in the last 10 years in shifting its stance of opposition to environmental safe guards put in place to protect threatened and endangered species to one embracing the provisions.\n\n\"The Navy ... routinely protects habitat of endangered Right Whales off the East Coast, of endangered Blue Whales off Southern California, of endangered and iconic orcas off Washington State and of the myriad populations of whales and dolphins unique to the Hawaiian islands,\" the paper said.\n\nThe paper said that \"recent efforts by anti-environment members of Congress\" to exempt Eglin Air Force Base from environmental compliance for the Rice's Whale could threaten what significant progress has been made.\n\n\"It will certainly be asked within the Navy why the Department shouldn't receive similar dispensations for its own offshore ranges,\" the paper said. \"Achieving such objectives would undermine the Navy's progress in conserving some of the country's most beloved species.\"\n\nIn the end, passage of the Gaetz amendment \"would just be setting a terrible precedent,\" Jasny said, that could ultimately undermine the integrity of the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammals Protection Act.\n\n\"Once you start putting holes in these statutes they can real quickly start looking like Swiss cheese,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2025/07/30/endangered-marine-life-extinction-jeff-corwin-congress/85377293007/", "title": "We saved elephant seals, sea otters from extinction.

They realized that their own survival is entwined with the survival of other animals. They understood the importance of keeping important species thriving, not just for environmental reasons but for economic ones, too.\n\nPeople love dolphins, whales, seals, manatees, sea otters, polar bears and other species. In 1972, their overwhelming public support for these creatures, coupled with awareness of the importance of biodiversity, led Congress to pass, and President Richard Nixon to sign, the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n\nToday, congressional leaders are working on a bill that, without major changes, would just about destroy the protection act.\n\nIn recent testimony, I shared my concern with lawmakers. I want to provide a glimpse into how the Marine Mammal Protection Act works, because I think it exposes just how extreme this new proposal is.\n\nResurgence of marine mammals is not an accident\n\nIt's important to understand that the protection act is a hugely successful law. Since its passage, not a single species has disappeared from American waters.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nPerhaps the most incredible recovery to me is the mighty elephant seal. Once diminished to fewer than 100, its population is now 10,000 strong in Central California. The elephant seal also is an important economic resource for the people of California, because tens of millions of dollars flow into the region where people go to witness these incredible creatures.\n\nAnother marine mammal, the sea otter − once critically endangered and hunted for its fur − now thrives in much of its range, from Alaska to California.\n\nThe MMPA has helped keep our oceans productive. It also has helped yield the largest wildlife-watching industry on the planet, an economic boon for coastal communities. The act sets strong standards, requiring ocean users to minimize how they affect marine mammals to achieve thriving and resilient populations.\n\nMy husband wrote 'Jaws.' We need to better protect the oceans he loved. | Opinion\n\nOur ocean is a busy place, and we use it more and more every year. Marine species today face greater challenges than ever: displaced and shifting fish stocks, habitat loss, warming waters and increased pollution.\n\nThe Marine Mammal Protection Act's authors recognized that marine mammals can thrive only when their ecosystem as a whole is managed appropriately, using the best available science. That means scientific data, rigor and challenge.\n\nProposed changes in the law would threaten marine mammals\n\nHowever, the legislation under consideration would ban the use of crucial data and scientific modeling. That would jeopardize marine mammals, especially those that are isolated or less studied.\n\nIt would slow − by 10 years − efforts to save North Atlantic right whales from entanglement in fishing gear and other threats. This vulnerable population is already on life support, down to about 370 individuals. Slowing protection could render the species extinct very soon.\n\nThe protection act aims to keep marine mammals healthy and restore them to their optimum sustainable population. But the proposed legislation would set a lower bar, just short of extinction. The new standards would merely require “survival” of a species. That would drive population decline.\n\nAt a time when the administration is slashing agency budgets and staff, the new legislation would set artificially tight deadlines for regulating harmful activities. That would essentially allow those activities automatically, undermining conservation of the Florida manatee, Alaska polar bears, the Northwest’s resident orcas and more.\n\nThe proposed changes also would do away with important “bycatch” provisions, which regulate unintentional capture of fish or marine wildlife during fishing operations.\n\nCurrently, management plans developed with input from commercial fishermen and other stakeholders protect endangered, threatened and depleted marine mammal populations from bycatch in commercial fisheries to reduce these incidental deaths to sustainable levels.\n\nThe proposed bill would make it harder for agencies to limit those losses.\n\nI’m proud of the Marine Mammal Protection Act and its legacy for our children. America has vast natural resources. Having worked in more than 100 countries, I believe no other nation on earth rivals what we’ve been blessed with here.\n\nOur extraordinary natural treasures, from fish to forests, contribute to our natural prosperity and global strength. Our shared natural treasures belong to every American to be wisely used, cared for and then passed on to future generations to harvest and cherish.\n\nWhile America’s nature is abundant, it is not unlimited. In the past, uniquely American species have been driven to extinction through negligence and exploitation.\n\nThere was robust bipartisan support to set up this system for protecting wildlife, and it’s a system that has worked wonders. We need that bipartisan approach to continue.\n\nIf we support the protection act's mission by keeping the law strong, we will ensure that Americans inherit a nation rich in natural resources from the land to the sea. But if Congress fails to support this consequential legislation, it will be a catastrophe of our own making and on our watch.\n\nJeff Corwin is a wildlife biologist, executive producer and television host, outdoorsman and fisherman.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/09/29/environmentalist-backed-proposal-force-boaters-slow-protect-endangered-north-atlantic-right-whales/69498327007/", "title": "Should NC recreational boats have to slow down for endangered ...", "text": "Gareth McGrath\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK\n\nSept. 29, 2022, 6:02 a.m. ET\n\nPutting the brakes on near-shore vessels as small as 35 feet along the U.S. East Coast might be the only way to give one of the most endangered marine mammals in the world a fighting chance to survive.\n\nThat's the proposal from federal regulators, backed by environmentalists, to help the North Atlantic right whale, an animal decimated by whalers last century and now facing the challenges of increased vessel traffic and ship strikes, fishing gear entanglements, and even climate change in its habitats from the Canadian Maritimes down to north Florida.\n\nThe whale's population now stands at 336 individuals, down from 500 in 2010, said Dr. Bill McLellan, a marine mammal expert who co-lead the UNCW Marine Mammal Stranding Program before his retirement, at an offshore wind and wildlife conference in August. Within that population, there are only 80 reproductive females. That makes the single loss of a whale, especially a breeding female, cause for concern.\n\n\"The precarious state of the right whale population requires additional management actions to eliminate the threat of deaths caused by entanglement and vessel collisions,\" said Dr. Andrew Read, a marine biologist at Duke University and director of the school's marine lab in Beaufort, last week. \"The need for action to eliminate deaths from ship strikes is particularly acute, because we know that females and their dependent calves are particularly at risk from such collisions in waters off the Southeastern U.S.\"\n\nBut charter boat and fishing captains fear the proposals, which would significantly broaden and range and scope of the speed restrictions, could decimate their business.\n\n\"This would have huge ramifications for our members and individuals who enjoy spending time on the water,\" said John Chambers, public affairs manager at the American Sportfishing Association (ASA). \"It's not that these trips are going to take longer, it's that they aren't going to happen at all.\"\n\nStabilizing the population\n\nLong a favorite of whalers due to its habit of swimming within 30 miles of shore, the right whale was decimated by hunting in the 1800s and early 1900s. A slow breeder, its numbers have been further depleted in recent decades by vessel ship strikes − especially as world trade has increased as have the size of cargo ships − and entanglements with fishing gear.\n\nJust this week, a 17-year-old right whale dubbed \"Snow Cone\" and well known to whale watchers was seen snared in fishing fear off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. Based on visual observations, scientists said they feared she is dying.\n\nLOSING BATTLE A whale and species on the brink. The end may be near for chronically entangled Snow Cone\n\nClimate change is a relatively new wild card to the challenges facing the whale, which can grow up to 52 feet long and weigh 70 tons. The warming of the oceans is moving the whale's favorite food source, zooplankton, farther north, with the whales following into waters where people, vessels and whales might find it harder to co-exist.\n\nUnder the proposal floated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), seasonal speed restrictions would be broadened to cover most of the East Coast. The speed limit of 10 knots or less within generally close proximity to shore also would be expanded to include most vessels down to 35 feet in length.\n\n\"Collisions with vessels continue to impede North Atlantic right whale recovery,\" said Janet Coit, assistant administrator for NOAA Fisheries, in a July 29 release announcing the proposed rule. \"This proposed action is necessary to stabilize the ongoing right whale population decline, in combination with other efforts to address right whale entanglement and vessel strikes in the U.S. and Canada.\"\n\nGETTING ALONG For highly endangered North Atlantic right whales, offshore wind brings a lot of unknowns\n\nPreviously, speed restrictions had been limited to the entrances to major ports − like Charleston, Wilmington and Norfolk − and only mandated for vessels 65 feet or larger.\n\nRight whales migrate along the East Coast, including off North Carolina, as they move between their summer range off Canada and New England and their winter calving grounds off the Southeastern U.S.\n\nOff the Tar Heel State, boaters operating in coastal waters between roughly Nags Head on the Outer Banks south through Wilmington and all the way to northern Georgia would face speed restrictions between November and mid- to late April. Although not the height of the summer tourism season along the North Carolina coast, the spring and fall \"shoulder\" seasons still generate plenty of business from visiting fishermen for area boat captains, hotels, tackle shops and restaurants.\n\nSince 2008, there have been 12 documented deaths of right whales from ship strikes in U.S. waters. Vessels less than 65 feet in length accounted for five of these deaths. According to NOAA, scientists have documented 54 right whale serious injuries and deaths in U.S. and Canadian waters since 2017 − although officials have said the actual number of whale deaths and injuries is probably substantially higher.\n\n\"We can no longer rely on existing safeguards while this species continues to face the threat of injury and death every day,\" said the environmental group Oceana in a statement. \"Turning the tide for North Atlantic right whales begins with more boats slowing down, regardless of size or purpose.\"\n\n'Misses the mark'\n\nOn Aug. 22, the ASA joined 11 other groups and organizations in asking NOAA to extend the comment period to allow further discussion between regulators and potentially impacted parties.\n\n\"Given the social, conservation and economic benefits of recreational fishing and boating to the nation, and uncertainty around much of the justification for the proposal, we believe more deliberation and analysis is needed to determine if conservation goals could be achieved with less restrictive measures,\" states the letter.\n\nChambers, the ASA spokesperson, said the likely significant economic impacts from the new rule on recreational boaters coupled with the relatively few incidents involving smaller boats and right whales − five interactions during nearly 5.1 million recreational trips in the impacted areas of the East Coast, according to ASA − seems heavy handed.\n\n\"We all want the whales to survive, and we're willing to do our part to make sure that happens,\" he said. \"But all of us in the recreational fishing industry believe this broad-brush approach is a little misguided and misses the mark.\"\n\nAccording to an ASA report released in May, the recreational fishing industry in North Carolina supports 455,000 jobs and generates $152 in economic impact for every pound of fish landed.\n\nBiologists, though, say the whale is running out of time, and man is running out of options to at least tilt the odds a little more in the animal's favor.\n\nDr. Robert Schick, a research scientist at Duke University, said expanding seasonal boat speed restrictions holds a real opportunity to reduce a major risk of whale lethality.\n\n\"I fully realize there’s a cost to these restrictions, but it’s especially important for us in North Carolina as we have pregnant moms migrating south to calve, and then moms with their newborns migrating north to the feeding grounds,\" Schick said. \"As such, it’s an especially vulnerable and important segment of the population.\"\n\nFacing concerns about the short window to comment on the proposed rule, which was announced Aug. 1, NOAA has extended the comment period until October 31. It was slated to close September 30.\n\nReporter Gareth McGrath can be reached at GMcGrath@Gannett.com or @GarethMcGrathSN on Twitter.

The source of their elimination is primarily human activity — the upsetting of natural evolutionary changes through habitat destruction, pollution, over-hunting and -fishing, and, potentially most devastatingly, climate change.\n\nWe can expect extinction numbers to grow at an unprecedented rate as human populations spread and the earth gets hotter. Two years ago, the United Nations sounded the alarm, warning that a million species of plants and animals around the world, out of eight million existing today, were threatened with extinction, and that climate change has accelerated the rate at which they will leave the face of the earth entirely.\n\nThe U.N. estimates that 75% of land environments and 66% of marine environments have already been altered by human activity, causing a 20% reduction in the abundance of land animals, as well as a potential reduction in fish biomass of up to 25% by the end of the century.\n\nFor the United States, the picture is less gloomy, at least for the immediate future, thanks to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), passed in 1973, which lists endangered and threatened species and provides for their protection and restoration. The law has, thus far, been a brilliant success, with 99% of listed species brought back from the edge of extinction. Most of the American animals now considered extinct, including many on the most recent list, died off before the enactment of the ESA.\n\nWhat the ESA has taught us is that we can take effective action to slow extinction rates through sound management of human activities as they affect animal populations and habitat. Without such vigilance, animal species whose existence we have come to take for granted could disappear forever.\n\nTo determine the most threatened animals in every state, 24/7 Tempo reviewed the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service’s Environmental Conservation Online System to find two animals listed as “endangered” that are native to each state.

Researchers have found that the whales have more in common genetically with Bryde's whales in the Pacific than their cousins in the Atlantic. They also have a unique call, says the chief of the marine mammal program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is petitioning to have the whales listed as an endangered species.\n\nGenetic testing has revealed that there used to be a lot more of the whales, the only species of baleen whale to live in the Gulf year-round, the NRDC spokesman tells the Mother Nature Network. \"It's possible humans were involved in the decline, through whaling or industrial activities,\" he says, noting that toxicology tests on one of the whales revealed very high levels of the toxic metals released in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the adjacent underwater canyon. The single canyon where they now live is the \"whale equivalent of a postage stamp,\" he says, and the \"massive industrialization\" of the surrounding area \"threatens them six ways to Sunday.\" (Meanwhile, a key Florida habitat for endangered species on land is getting a Walmart.)\n\nThis article originally appeared on Newser.\n\nMore from Newser:\n\n• White Woman Given Sperm From Black Donor Sues\n\n• Man Slept in Car for Days to Guard Discovered Treasure\n\n• Your Sense of Smell May Predict Longevity", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/12/09/first-right-whale-calf-of-the-season-is-born-offering-new-glimmer-of-hope/69714637007/", "title": "First right whale calf of the season is born, new 'glimmer' of hope", "text": "Updated Dec. 9, 2022, 5:51 p.m. ET\n\nJust in time for the holidays, a special gift has arrived for the North Atlantic Right Whale community: a newborn calf.\n\nThe whale population's version of \"baby new year\" was recently born to Medusa, a North Atlantic Right Whale who frequents the waters of Massachusetts and Cape Cod bays in winter and spring before summering in the Gulf of Maine.\n\nGib Brogan, a fisheries campaign manager at Oceana — an international advocacy group that works to protect the world’s oceans — on Friday reported that mother and calf were first observed on Dec. 7 by researchers with the Clearwater Marine Aquarium Research Institute in the southern reaches of the critically endangered animals' east coast habitat. The pair was swimming in St. Catherines Sound off the coast of Georgia.\n\nWith the North Atlantic Right Whales' severely precarious existence, nobody wants to see a calving season like the one in 2019, when there were no births, said Brogan, who called that season \"disastrous.\"\n\n\"I was getting a little anxious as it moved into the middle of December and we still hadn't seen a calf,\" said Brogan, who helps lead Oceana’s fight to save North Atlantic right whales from extinction and also oversees the organization's work with recreational fishermen on common conservation goals.\n\nA video the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Resource Division posted Dec. 8 on Twitter with the announcement \"THE FIRST RIGHT WHALE CALF OF THE SEASON HAS BEEN SPOTTED!\" tickles right whale observers like Brogan pink. He said the video shows what looks to be \"a very happy calf\" and a contented mother.\n\n\"I'm not much of a whale whisperer,\" Brogan said, \"but that calf looked very energetic in that video.\"\n\n'It's become an event': Right whale births are truly a cause for celebration\n\nEach year, as the North Atlantic Right Whales make their way south to what can be called their maternity ward, both professional researchers and interested casual observers watch anxiously for the births to begin.\n\n\"It's become an event, as well it should be,\" Brogan said, pointing out how critical the growth of the population is toward moving the whales away from the brink of extinction.\n\nIn October, the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium released its latest count of the critically endangered species' population. According to the most recent whale census, only about 340 of the animals — plus or minus seven — remained during 2021. And it was cause for concern.\n\nPreviously in The Times: Report: North Atlantic right whales continuing to decline\n\nWhile the population estimate is important, the more significant factor for scientists is the trend the numbers show, according to Heather Pettis, a research scientist at the New England Aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life and executive administrator of the consortium.\n\n\"With this assessment we see that the downward trend (in the right whale population) is continuing,\" she said in October. \"That's the big take home — the species is trending down, which is not good.\"\n\nSo it comes as no great surprise that Medusa's new calf is raising a collective cheer among scientists, conservationists and concerned observers alike, although there is still a good amount of finger-crossing taking place.\n\n\"Each new calf certainly provides a glimmer of hope for the future,\" said Amy Warren, a research assistant in the New England Aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, \"but it’s important to recognize the daily struggles these whales must face in our dynamic ocean.\"\n\nNorth Atlantic right whales, one of the most endangered large mammals in the world, face multiple environmental challenges, both man-made and natural. The whales are frequently victims of entanglement in traditional fishing gear that relies on ropes, and vessel strikes, which hinder their ability to thrive, reproduce and successfully raise a calf. Changing conditions in the ocean owing to climate change also affect the population.\n\n\"My hope is that we can continue working to clear their path so that each addition can bring more than just cautious optimism,\" Warren said.\n\nThe New England Aquarium provides support to survey teams in the southeast calving grounds, she said.\n\n\"As curators of the North Atlantic Right Whale Catalog, we assist with confirming individual identification of right whales and keeping track of sampling efforts,\" Warren said. \"The extensive catalog allows us to know histories of whales like Medusa, the first mom of the calving season.\"\n\nSeven times a mother, Medusa's success is increasingly rare for right whales\n\nMedusa, listed in the catalog as whale #1208, was first seen in 1981 in Massachusetts Bay. With this latest birth, she has now had a total seven calves that scientists know of.\n\n\"Three of her previous calves are still seen regularly in Massachusetts waters,\" Warren said.\n\nMedusa was last observed in Massachusetts Bay on April 19, 2021. And she was last spotted in Cape Cod Bay a few weeks prior to that, on March 21 — both sightings were reported by scientists with the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown. But the last time she was observed with a calf at her side was in mid March 2012, off the coast of Florida.\n\nThe first time Medusa was seen with a calf was in April of 1985, in Massachusetts Bay, according to data in the catalog. Other sightings of Medusa with a calf occurred in 1991, 1996, 2002-2003, and 2008, showing she was giving birth about every four to six years. The stretch between her last documented calving and this year's birth is the longest, at 10 years, which could be an indication of another concerning trend scientists are seeing in the right whale population.\n\nThe few reproductively active females left in the population are giving birth at greater intervals. Instead of a calving interval of three years, the trend is now closer to six to 10 years, according to Sarah Sharp, a marine mammal veterinarian at the International Fund For Animal Welfare, which has an office in Yarmouthport,\n\nRight whales gestate for a little more than a year, but they don't actually reach reproductive age until they are about 9 or 10 years old. That becomes additionally troublesome when the whales are likely to die as a result of entanglement and vessel strike injuries before they can reach that age.Also problematic is the dearth of females among the whales. Charles \"Stormy\" Mayo, director of the right whale ecology program at the Center for Coastal Studies, has said the number of whales have only gone down since about 2010, from a population of close to 500 animals. Part of the problem, he said earlier this fall, is low numbers of breeding females, \"therefore very low calving rates,\" combined with \"very high mortality rates.\"\n\nSharp corroborates that observation. She has noted that, as a whole, the population has more males than females in it — it is estimated there are presently only about 72 reproductively active females in the population, lower than a previous estimate of 90.\n\n'Mothers and calves need protection now': Why birthing time is a critical time for right whales\n\nCalving grounds off the coasts of northeast Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina have been designated Critical Habitat Areas to help protect the species, according to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium Research Institute.\n\n“Through aerial surveys, the CMARI team works together to protect the species,” said Dr. James Powell, president and executive director of the institute. “Recovery had been slow and steady until 2010 when we started to see a decline. Most recent population models show that the numbers are declining again for various reasons, including a slow reproduction rate, threats from entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with large vessels, and possibly other factors not yet identified.”\n\nSmall boats are also a danger to whales\n\nThe North Atlantic right whale is a federally protected endangered species under the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Clearwater Marine Aquarium Research Institute aerial survey teams work with NOAA, Georgia DNR, South Carolina DNR, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,U.S. Coast Guard Atlantic Area Command, U.S. Navy, and FWC to mitigate ship collisions and document reproductive rates.\n\nThey also provide scientific data to marine decision makers on conserving the species, assist efforts to disentangle whales from fishing gear, locate carcasses for recovery and necropsies, and assist with locating whales for genetic sampling and satellite tagging.\n\nBrogan is among many who've been monitoring the whales who are pressing for more urgent action to be taken, including enacting immediate vessel speed reduction zones for vessels of all sizes up and down the coast. Massachusetts, for one, already regulates speeds and includes smaller vessels in the restrictions, but that's not the case everywhere.\n\n\"Every time we see calves, this is a good sign because it shows there are mothers that are healthy enough to give birth,\" he said. \"But this is a species that is under chronic stress from a number of different sides. Our concern is that mothers and calves don't have enough protection from the boat traffic that's around them.\"\n\nHe noted the mothers and their young spend a lot of time at the surface, which is the danger zone when it comes to boating activity. Last year, in February, Brogan said a recreational boat that was operating within regulations struck a mother and calf pair in southern waters.\n\n\"That killed the calf, and the mother hasn't been seen since,\" Brogan said. \"It's a cautionary tale that these whales are down there. But the current regulations don't cover those smaller boats.\"\n\nWhile there are ongoing, widespread efforts to enact legislation to further regulate boating, as well as fishing, organizations like Oceana are pressing for the federal government to enact emergency rules that will protect the whales from the smaller boats now.\n\n\"These mothers and calves need protection now, sooner than next year,\" Brogan said.\n\nMedusa and her calf are far from isolated as they swim the southern waters, he pointed out. \"A good number of whales have been seen by the aerial surveys down there,\" he said.\n\nEstimated to be about 42 years old, Medusa is a great story of survival despite the many challenges right whales face. Sadly, though, stories of critical entanglements, vessel strikes and resulting deaths are too frequent, such as is the case with another well-known individual: Snow Cone, a chronically entangled female who was seen in late September struggling with her fifth entanglement just south of Nantucket. Scientists said her condition was grim and they feared she was dying, but with Hurricane Fiona advancing, they could not safely launch a rescue effort.\n\nReported in September: A whale and species on the brink. The end may be near for chronically entangled Snow Cone\n\nBrogan said that was the last time anyone saw Snow Cone — thought to be the last of her bloodline, and also to have lost both of her calves, one to a boat strike. Besides being on alert for new births, he said, \"we are on Snow Cone watch and hoping for the best.\"\n\nHoping, as always, because even the loss of just one individual is a devastating blow to a population teetering on the precipice between recovery and the point of no return. In the spirit of hopefulness, the New England Aquarium has a calving season blog, which will be updated with bios of each mom and baby as scientists there receive news from the U.S. calving ground.

It’s the first successful birth for Brave, 6 years old, and Diego, 7 years old, and the first red wolf pup born at the zoo since 2005.\n\nRoberts told CNN that while red wolves normally have litters of 4 to 6 pups at a time, smaller litters are more common for first-time mothers, like Brave.\n\nAccording to Roberts, all red wolves in the United States are owned by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and managed cooperatively with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which accredits zoos, including the Roger Williams Park Zoo. There are around 240 red wolves in American zoos and sanctuaries, all of which participate in the red wolf “Species Survival Plan” (SSP), which started in 1984.\n\nThe SSP acts as a kind of matchmaker for endangered species, taking into consideration “genetics and demographics” to determine which red wolf couples will produce the most genetically diverse offspring. Roberts explained that this matchmaking is especially crucial for species like the red wolf that have extremely small populations.\n\n“Even just one puppy is critical because now Brave and Diego’s genes are represented in that puppy,” said Roberts. “If they don’t have more litters, this little pup is even more critical. Especially when you’re talking about a small population, you want to make sure you capture everybody’s genes.”\n\nThe zoo’s staff monitors the newborn baby and mom through an infrared camera in their den – but they haven’t yet been able to determine the pup’s sex.\n\n“About five days ago, the baby started toddling out of the man-made den. It will walk 5 feet around the entrance of the den and then go back in,” said Roberts.\n\nAlthough visitors can catch a glimpse of Diego in the zoo’s wolf enclosure, the mom and pup will likely stay close to their den for a few more weeks, according to the zoo.\n\nRed wolves once roamed throughout the southeastern United States but were declared extinct in the wild in 1980, said Roberts. The remaining 14 red wolves were brought into captivity. Collaboration between zoos and conservationists led to the creation of a stable zoo population, and in 1987 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began reintroducing red wolves into the wild.\n\nThe wolves face major threats due to humans, said Roberts, “whether that’s purposeful or accidental.” Many wolves are hit by cars or shot. They also suffer from habitat loss and habitat fragmentation.\n\nThere will likely “never be a large population back to its historic range, which was much bigger than the current range,” said Roberts. “But the goal would be to have a population that is self-sustaining, living in the wild, in the southeastern US.”\n\nCurrently, there are only 12 known red wolves in the wild, which are tagged with orange collars to help people distinguish them from coyotes, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, out of a total estimated population of around 20 to 23 individuals.\n\nDespite efforts to restore the wild population, there were no known red wolf pups born in the wild in 2019, 2020 or 2021, says the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThis makes captive births like the one at the Roger Williams Park Zoo all the more important, said Roberts.\n\n“Our zoo in particular plays a really big role in conservation of native species,” she said.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/12/26/endangered-right-whales-return-to-florida-as-expanded-slow-zones-considered/69723810007/", "title": "Endangered right whales return to Florida as expanded slow zones ...", "text": "Dec. 26, 2022, 5:02 a.m. ET\n\nPlease consider supporting local journalism by subscribing to FLORIDA TODAY.\n\nAs endangered right whales make their way back to Florida waters, proposed federal slow-speed zones for ships off Florida and elsewhere in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean continue to generate controversy.\n\nNOAA and whale advocates said the slow zones reduce the risk of vessels killing the remaining few hundred whales and must be expanded. Maritime trade advocates countered that the slowdown could impact the world's just-in-time delivery economy as many ship captains are under pressure to get to port as fast as possible.\n\nFewer than 350 North American right whales remain. There's been recent good news — four live calves born this calving season — but that doesn't stop fears that the species still remains at risk of extinction.\n\n\"North Atlantic right whales are dying faster than they can reproduce, largely due to human causes,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on its website.\n\nRight whales have been undergoing what NOAA calls an Unusual Mortality Event since 2017. That resulted in more than one in five of the population being sick, injured or killed, the agency said. Researchers estimated fewer than 70 reproductively active females remain, and they produce fewer calves each year, threatening the species' prospects of recovery.\n\nHumans are still the leading cause of right whale deaths, federal biologists said, even though the whales have not been hunted commercially for more than 80 years. The primary threats to the whales are collisions with ships or boats and entanglements in fishing gear.\n\nSo as with manatees, NOAA said slowing down boats for right whales is a must to save one of the world's most endangered marine mammals. The slowdown would give both captains and whales enough time to steer clear of one another. But also as with the manatee slow zones, going slow maddens captains whose livelihoods depend on getting to their destinations on time.\n\n\"I think that vessel speed rule is going to be huge,\" said Julie Albert, the nonprofit Marine Resources Council's right whale conservation program coordinator. \"We still really don't know what the final decision is going to be.\"\n\nNOAA proposed extending the boundaries of the slow zones and lowering the size of vessel that must comply with current vessel speed limits along the East Coast. Currently, only vessels 65 feet or longer are affected by the right whale speed zones under NOAA rules. But if approved by NOAA, most vessels 35 feet or longer would be required to go 10 knots or slower (about 11.5 mph) within active proposed seasonal speed zones to reduce the risk of deadly collisions with right whales.\n\nMore: Speed kills whales, NOAA says NOAA wants boats 35 feet or longer along the Space Coast to slow for right whales\n\nNOAA hasn't announced the final specifics of the proposed new seasonal slow-speed zone, but the agency has included a zone that would run Nov. 15 to April 1, the same current timeframe that slows down vessels 65 feet and longer, but would expand the zone to extend from Port Canaveral out to sea about 5 nautical miles. The zone also would include a large swath along the mid-Atlantic Ocean. The new zone could take effect as soon as next year.\n\nRight whale calving season begins in mid-November and runs through mid-April.\n\nNOAA also is proposing the increase of the use of “ropeless” fishing gear that prevents whales from getting fatally wrapped up.\n\nStay away:Feds warn it's wrong to approach endangered right whales\n\nNorth Atlantic right whale makes endangered list:Here are some of the USA's most endangered species\n\nHearts broke in February 2021, when a sportfishing boat returning at night to St. Augustine Inlet hit and killed a baby right whale that later washed up on the beach.\n\nBut for some of those who float their 35-foot-or-longer boats in and out of Port Canaveral and other affected areas off Brevard County and elsewhere off Florida's east coast, the proposed changes are too high a price to pay in lost safety and time: to the tune of almost 16,000 vessels affected and yearly costs of $46.2 million per year, 35% borne by the shipping industry, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration estimates.\n\nOn Dec. 6, the nonprofit Oceana filed an emergency rulemaking petition with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Assistant Administrator of NOAA Fisheries Janet Coit demanding immediate action to save right whales, especially pregnant females, lactating mothers and calves during the current calving season. The whales are especially vulnerable to being hit by boats during calving season since the mothers and nursing calves spend more time swimming near the surface, increasing the possibility of boat strikes.\n\nMore: Whales and ships don't mix Feds warn it's wrong to approach endangered right whales\n\nRight whales are protected under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. Those who approach too close can face maximum penalties up to $100,000, a year in jail and confiscation of one's vessel. Under the law, people need to stay at least 500 yards (or 5 football fields) from Right whale mothers and calves.\n\nMore: Feds want ships to slow for whale NOAA wants boats 35 feet or longer along the Space Coast to slow for right whales\n\nNo right whales have been reported in Brevard yet this migratory season, but Albert and others wait to see what this season will bring.\n\n\"I don't know that anybody knows.
