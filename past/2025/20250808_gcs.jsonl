Solving that riddle would allow work to begin on recovering the species and the ecosystems harmed by their decline.\n\nAfter four years of testing the creatures and scrutinizing the results of their DNA analyses, the researchers found a bacteria always present on the sick sea stars that wasn't on healthy ones.\n\nThe study raises hopes for a brighter future for sea stars, for potential treatments and for possibly restoring the kelp forests that relied on them to keep sea urchins under control, said two of its co-authors, Melanie Prentice and Alyssa Gehman, colleagues at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia and the University of British Columbia. The study announcing the project's results was published on Aug. 4 in the journal “Nature Ecology and Evolution.”\n\nAlthough most people think of the star-shaped animals as starfish, and some of them are even named starfish, scientists call them “sea stars” because they’re not fish. They're a group of animals, including sea cucumbers and sea urchins, called echinoderms.\n\nWhat happened to sea stars?\n\nFrom a tide pool in Olympic National Park, along the Pacific coast of Washington state, the first case of sea star disease was reported in June 2013.\n\nSoon, sea stars fell ill in Sitka, Alaska, then off the coast of British Columbia and San Diego, and eventually as far south as Mexico. Sea stars that contracted the disease became lethargic, developed lesions, lost their arms and disintegrated into gooey masses within days, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe pathogen could kill a healthy group of sea stars in 24 hours, USA TODAY reported in 2013.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2017, the pathogen killed more than 90% of sunflower sea stars in one of the largest marine wildlife disease outbreaks on record, NOAA concluded. These sea stars can measure more than 3 feet from tip to tip and appear in a range of colors.\n\nOnce one of the more abundant and recognizable members of the sea star family on the Pacific coast, sunflower sea star populations plummeted offshore south of Washington State and disappeared almost entirely from the coast of Southern California. Although they are the most susceptible to the pathogen, the disease has been identified in more than 20 sea star species.\n\nVast kelp forests in the ocean also suffered because it turns out the sea stars were helping to control the voracious sea urchins that, left unchecked, decimated the kelp.\n\nWhat did the researchers do?\n\nA large group of researchers met in February 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the planet, and strategized on the science necessary to try and recover sunflower sea stars, said Prentice and Gehman, in a joint interview with USA TODAY.\n\nTheir meeting and subsequent collaboration also included The Nature Conservancy, the Tula Foundation, and researchers from the University of Washington and the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe scientists collected wild sunflower sea stars in at least six locations in British Columbia and Washington between 2021 and 2024, then conducted a set of controlled experiments.\n\nIn a fluke of history, the scientists were working to stop the spread of a deadly virus in sea stars at the same time the world was dealing with the pandemic. As they were quarantining sea stars they had collected from the wild, team members who traveled were quarantining and isolating themselves to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nSea star mystery unveiled\n\nWas there ever an \"aha\" moment? Yes, Prentice said. One day, she was looking at data on microbes they’d collected from healthy sea stars and comparing them to data sets of microbes from wasting sea stars. Just as she was about to walk into a meeting with Gehman and Grace Crandall, another colleague and study co-author, she noticed there were “tons” of vibrio pathogens in the ailing sea stars.\n\nIn their meeting, she opened her computer, showing Gehman and Crandall what she’d learned, and they started breaking down the genetic sequences of the vibrio they were seeing. The culprit was identified as Vibrio pectenicida.\n\n\"It was apparent immediately that it was in all of our wasting samples and none of our healthy samples,\" Prentice said.\n\nThey spent another year working to back up their conclusions and kept getting more evidence that it was the pathogen causing the disease.\n\nWhat is vibrio?\n\nVibrio is one of a vast array of species in the marine environment, and many are known to be pathogens. One kind of vibrio kills oysters and can be deadly to people, commonly referred to as “flesh-eating\" bacteria. Another kind causes cholera.\n\nOne thing that was particularly shocking about their moment of discovery, said Gehman, was that the group of scientists had assumed finding the answer would be complicated.\n\n“It turns out that the pattern was visual and we could really see it,\" she said. \"That was surprising, and was the moment we realized we might be able to solve this question.\"\n\nKevin Lafferty, a marine disease ecologist and senior scientist with the USGS, who was not a part of the study group, wrote a companion piece in the journal lauding the group's work.\n\n\"The research is really amazing and took so much careful, hard work,\" Lafferty told USA TODAY. Marine diseases can be difficult to diagnose. \"We just don't have a lot of expertise in marine disease.\"\n\n\"That's a huge handicap and they overcame that with a lot of hard work and modern molecular tools,\" he said. \"The fact that you can take an eyedropper of seawater and identify 100 species of bacteria is a huge leap forward for understanding microbial diseases, especially in the water.\"\n\nWhat happens now for sea stars?\n\nThis discovery \"opens up a door that wasn’t available to us because we didn’t know what was causing the disease,\" Gehman said.\n\n\"There's a lot of people who are trying to save this species,\" she said. \"There's a lot of work that can immediately take advantage of what we are doing.\"\n\nResearchers already are working on a diagnostic test akin to a COVID test that could be “really important” for testing sea stars and the water when they consider transplanting sea stars to try to recover populations, Prentice said. “It’s going to be really, really helpful in the way we think about managing the species.”\n\nQuestions remain, wrote Lafferty, the USGS scientist. The origin of the pathogen is unknown, he said. Could it be transmitted from the mollusks that sea stars eat, the way people get sick after eating oysters infected with a vibrio pathogen? Could it be transmitted from sea star to sea star or spread through aquaculture? These questions and more are expected to be part of the future research possibilities now open.\n\nBecause there are remnant healthy populations of sea stars in Alaska and British Columbia, and a few in Washington, armed with the information that identifies the disease, Gehman and Prentice said researchers hope to be able to bring some of the healthy sea stars into captive breeding programs to raise animals that can resist the pathogen.\n\nOther possibilities include finding a probiotic that could help sea stars fight off disease, similar to a method scientists use to pretreat some corals, or identifying a naturally occurring marine virus that only attacks specific kinds of bacteria, such as the virus that researchers are using to help recover abalone populations off the southern California coast.\n\n“Hopefully one day we’ll actually be out planting sea stars back into the wild where we’ve lost them,\" Prentice said.\n\n(This story has been updated to correct a typo.)\n\nContributing: Elizabeth Weise", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/asia/pakistan-cholera-heatwave-climate-india-intl-hnk", "title": "Pakistan hit by deadly cholera outbreak as heat wave grips South ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA deadly cholera outbreak linked to contaminated drinking water has infected thousands of people in central Pakistan as the country grapples with a water crisis exacerbated by a brutal heat wave in South Asia.\n\nTemperatures in parts of Pakistan and India have reached record levels in recent weeks, putting the lives of millions at risk as the effects of the climate crisis are felt across the subcontinent.\n\nCholera cases were first identified in Pir Koh, a remote mountainous town in Balochistan province, on April 17. Since then, more than 2,000 people have been have been infected and six have died, according to Dr. Ahmed Baloch, from the health department of Balochistan.\n\nResidents in Pir Koh say they have no access to clean drinking water. The lack of rain this year has caused nearby ponds to dry up, with their only source of water being a pipeline which had “rusted and contaminated the water supply,” said local resident Hassan Bugti.\n\n“Residents are forced to drink dirty water,” he said.\n\nPakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered “emergency relief measures” to curb the cholera outbreak in Pir Koh, and the military has been called in to help provide mobile water tanks to ensure clean drinking water gets to the population and set up medical camps to treat the sick.\n\nCholera is an acute diarrheal illness that kills thousands of people worldwide each year. It is easily transmitted, by consuming food or water contaminated with the fecal bacteria Vibrio cholerae. And scientists have warned of the severe impacts of climate change on human health, with rising temperatures encouraging the spread of dangerous pathogens such as cholera.\n\nThe outbreak comes as Pakistan faces a serious water crisis and an early onset heat wave that the Pakistan Meteorological Department said has been persistent across the nation since the start of the month.\n\nJacobabad, one of the hottest cities in the world, in central Sindh province, hit 51 degrees Celsius (123.8 degrees Fahrenheit) on Sunday, and 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) the day before. Average high temperatures in the city this month have been around 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nThe heat is unlikely to abate soon. While dust storms, gusty winds and scattered showers and thunderstorms brought relief to parts of the country over the past couple of days, temperatures are expected to ramp back up from Wednesday, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.\n\nPakistan’s Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman on Monday said Pakistan was among the most water-stressed countries in the world and one of the ten most vulnerable to climate stress.\n\nThe country’s major dams are at a “dead level right now, and sources of water are scarce as well as contested,” Rehman told CNN, adding, “this is an all-encompassing existential crisis and must be taken seriously.”\n\nIn the summer of 2015 a heatwave killed more than a thousand people in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi.\n\nIndia suffers under the heat\n\nThe heat wave has also been felt by Pakistan’s neighbor India, where temperatures in the capital region of Delhi surpassed 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) on Sunday.\n\nIn recent months India has experienced a severe heat wave that saw average maximum temperatures reach the highest in 122 years in northwest India in April, and countrywide in March.\n\nThe scorching heat breached the 49 degrees Celsius mark for the first time this year in Delhi, with temperatures reaching 49.2 degrees Celsius (120.5 degrees Fahrenheit) at Delhi’s Mungeshpur weather station and 49.1 degrees Celsius (120.3 degrees Fahrenheit) at Najafgarh weather station on Sunday, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). New Delhi has suffered through 14 days in May above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nA girl selling water uses an umbrella to protect herself from the sun as she waits for customers in New Delhi, India, on April 27. Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters\n\nGurgaon, southwest of New Delhi, recorded its highest temperature since May 10, 1966, with 48.1 degrees Celsius (118.5 degrees Fahrenheit) on Sunday, according to the IMD.\n\nThe IMD forecasts some relief for Delhi, with cloudy and clear skies for the next couple of days. However, it forecasts high temperatures to return in some parts of the region later in the week.\n\nIn some states, the heat has forced schools to close, damaged crops and put pressure on energy supplies, as officials warned residents to remain indoors and keep hydrated. On Saturday, India banned wheat exports – days after saying it was targeting record shipments this year – as the heat wave curtailed output and domestic prices hit a record high.\n\nIndia often experiences heat waves during the summer months of May and June, but this year temperatures started rising in March and April.\n\nIndia and Pakistan are among the countries expected to be worst affected by the climate crisis, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Experts say climate change is causing more frequent and longer heat waves, affecting more than a billion people across the two countries.\n\nDr. Chandni Singh, IPCC lead author and senior researcher at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements, said this heat wave “is testing the limits of human survivability.”\n\n“This heat wave is definitely unprecedented,” Singh said earlier this month. “We have seen a change in its intensity, its arrival time, and duration. This is what climate experts predicted and it will have cascading impacts on health.”", "authors": ["Helen Regan Sophia Saifi Asim Khan Esha Mitra", "Helen Regan", "Sophia Saifi", "Asim Khan", "Esha Mitra"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/25/asia/pakistan-floods-children-water-borne-disease-intl-hnk-dst", "title": "First came the floods.

And at night, the mosquitoes “attack,” she said.\n\n“We burn waste so mosquitoes cannot bite (the children),” Rani said. “We remain active at night so our children can sleep.”\n\nSindh has seen an acute outbreak of dengue fever – a viral infection transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, the same insect responsible for spreading Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever.\n\nIt causes flu-like symptoms, including piercing headaches, muscle and joint pains, fever and rashes, though only 25% of those infected show symptoms.

Fridnel Kedler, coordinator for the Civil Protection Agency in Grand-Anse, told the Associated Press at least 470 were dead in the hard-hit southwestern corner of the country.\n\nChristy Delafield, a senior spokeswoman with global relief agency Mercy Corps, told USA TODAY on Saturday the real death toll may never be known. \"We may never really understand the toll fully,\" Delafield said. Haitians in remote villages have already begun burying their dead, she said.\n\nHurricane Matthew lashes Charleston as weakened Cat 1 storm\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 750,000 people in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, are in need of humanitarian assistance. Of the 10.3 million people in Haiti, 1.3 million have been impacted by the storm, OCHA says.\n\nAmong the most alarming fallout of the storm was word on new cases of cholera, an infectious and often fatal bacterial disease of the small intestine usually transmitted by tainted water supplies. Haiti has been struggling to recover from a massive earthquake in 2010 and an ensuing cholera epidemic, which killed more than 7,000 people.\n\nDelafield says she is aware of four new cases of cholera. Reuters reported 17 cases were detected in Chardonnieres on the southern coast.\n\nIt has been a struggle for relief agencies to access those in need in remote sections of the island. Matthew slammed the western tip of Haiti on Tuesday with 145-mph winds in an area of rural countryside that soon became cut off from the rest of the nation when a bridge gave out, complicating relief efforts.\n\nHumanitarian agency World Vision said Saturday that access to some areas was starting to improve. Cell service was returning and government officials were starting to hear from the mayors of outlying cities with information about the conditions in their areas. The group delivered relief supplies to 1,000 households on Friday and was gearing up for more relief over the weekend.\n\nPeople keep asking, “When is this going to stop? When are we going to get a break from crisis after crisis?” said John Hasse, national director of World Vision in Port-au-Prince. \"They’re tired and discouraged. And yet, somehow, they just keep getting back up and rebuilding again.”\n\nWorld Vision's Guy Vital-Herne, working with crews in the southern part of the country, said access to clean water is a growing concern. \"Pipes have broken in homes, but people can’t leave their neighborhoods to buy clean water. In some towns, the water sources have been contaminated.\" he said.\n\nHaiti is one of the most deforested countries in the world, making it more vulnerable to windstorms and heavy rain. The sloping, mountainous areas were also at risk of landslides. The area hit hardest by the storm is populated by villages where Haitians live in shacks of wood, corrugated steel and even mud. The storm tore off rooftops and flattened others to their foundations. Hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless, Reuters reported.\n\nHurricane Matthew: Here is the latest forecast for the U.S.\n\nDonna Porstner of Americares said Saturday that the disaster relief agency was \"working non-stop\" and coordinating with the Ministry of Health in Haiti.\n\n\"Americares' emergency response teams in Port-au-Prince and Les Cayes are assessing survivors’ health needs and coordinating aid shipments,\" she said. \"So far we have delivered two shipments of medicine and relief supplies to Les Cayes, and we have more on the way.\"\n\nPorstner said drivers navigated treacherous roads to deliver the medicine and supplies such as oral rehydration salts, wound care treatments and intravenous fluids. Americares has about $1.6 million in aid on the way to Haiti, she said.\n\nThe United Nation's Population Fund said Saturday that it was concerned about the fate of more than 8,400 pregnant women who are expected to give birth in the next three months, as well as 1,200 women who would need cesarean sections. The agency was sending 252 emergency reproductive health kits to parts of the nation.\n\n\"Hurricane Matthew delivered a severe blow to Haiti's health facilities, whether by flooding these centers or blowing off their roofs and putting them out of service,\" said Babatunde Osotimehin, UNFPA executive director. “We will work to help women give birth and live, despite this tragedy.”\n\nOn Saturday, Delafield was en route to Nippes in the southern part of the country on a mission to deliver hygiene kits containing such items as toothbrushes, shampoo and laundry soap. Mercy Corps hoped to deliver 5,000 kits to those in the mountainous areas.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Programme estimates up to 80% of harvest has been lost in many areas in Haiti as well.\n\n\"Haiti has been hit time and again with major disasters,\" Delafield says. \"They just had the most severe drought in 50 years. This was the first year people had hoped for a good harvest.\"\n\nNo matter what the official numbers end up being, Delafield said the losses are overwhelming. \"People lost their homes, all their crops. They wonder how can I rebuild my home?

At those concentrations, swimmers and athletes who ingest just three teaspoons of water are almost certain to be infected with viruses that can cause stomach and respiratory illnesses and more rarely heart and brain inflammation — although whether they actually fall ill depends on a series of factors including the strength of the individual's immune system.\n\nSince the AP released the initial results last July, athletes have been taking elaborate precautions to prevent illnesses that could potentially knock them out of the competition, including preventatively taking antibiotics, bleaching oars and donning plastic suits and gloves in a bid to limit contact with the water.\n\nBut antibiotics combat bacterial infections, not viruses. And the AP investigation found that infectious adenovirus readings — tested with cell cultures and verified with molecular biology protocols — turned up at nearly 90 percent of the test sites over 16 months of testing.\n\n\"That's a very, very, very high percentage,\" said Dr. Valerie Harwood, Chair of the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of South Florida. \"Seeing that level of human pathogenic virus is pretty much unheard of in surface waters in the U.S. You would never, ever see these levels because we treat our waste water. You just would not see this.\"\n\nWhile athletes take precautions, what about the 300,000-500,000 foreigners expected to descend on Rio for the Olympics? Testing at several of the city's world-famous beaches has shown that in addition to persistently high viral loads, the beaches often have levels of bacterial markers for sewage pollution that would be cause for concern abroad — and sometimes even exceed Rio state's lax water safety standards.\n\nIn light of the AP's findings, Harwood had one piece of advice for travelers to Rio: \"Don't put your head under water.\"\n\nSwimmers who cannot heed that advice stand to ingest water through their mouths and noses and therefore risk \"getting violently ill,\" she said.\n\nDanger is lurking even in the sand. Samples from the beaches at Copacabana and Ipanema revealed high levels of viruses, which recent studies have suggested can pose a health risk — particularly to babies and small children.\n\n\"Both of them have pretty high levels of infectious adenovirus,\" said Harwood, adding that the virus could be particularly hazardous to babies and toddlers who play in the sand.\n\n\"You know how quickly an infant can get dehydrated and have to go to the hospital,\" she added. \"That's the scariest point to me.\"\n\nDr. Fernando Spilki, the virologist and coordinator of the molecular microbiology laboratory at Feevale University in southern Brazil whom AP commissioned to conduct the water tests, says the survey revealed no appreciable improvement in Rio's blighted waters — despite cleanup promises stretching back decades.\n\n\"Unfortunately, what we've seen throughout all this time is that there is a variation in the levels of contamination, but it fluctuates much more as a result of climactic conditions than due to any measures that may have been taken to try to remove this contamination,\" said Spilki, one of Brazil's most respected virologists.\n\nThe most contaminated points are the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, where Olympic rowing will take place, and the Gloria Marina, the starting point for the sailing races. In March, 2015, sampling at the Lagoon revealed an astounding 1.73 billion adenoviruses per liter; this June, adenovirus readings were lower but still hair-raising at 248 million adenoviruses per liter. By comparison, in California, viral readings in the thousands per liter are enough to set off alarm bells.\n\nDespite a project aimed at preventing raw sewage from flowing directly into the Gloria Marina through storm drains, the waters remain just as contaminated. The first sampling there, in March, 2015, showed over 26 million adenoviruses per liter; this June, over 37 million adenoviruses per liter were detected.\n\nWhile local authorities including Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes have acknowledged the failure of the city's water cleanup efforts, calling it a \"lost chance\" and a \"shame,\" Olympic officials continue to insist Rio's waterways will be safe for athletes and visitors. The local organizing committee did not respond to multiple requests for comment, though it has previously said bacterial testing conducted by Rio state authorities has shown the aquatic venues to be within state guidelines.\n\nThe crux of the issue lies in the different types of testing used to determine the health and safety of recreational waters.\n\nBacterial tests measure levels of coliforms — different types of bacteria that tend not to cause illnesses themselves but are indicators of the presence of other, potentially harmful sewage-borne pathogens such as other bacteria, viruses and protozoa that can cause cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A and typhoid, among other diseases. Bacterial tests are the worldwide standard because they're cheap and easy.\n\nBut there's a growing consensus that they're not ideal for all climates, as bacteria break down quickly in tropical weather and salty marine waters. In contrast, viruses have been shown to survive for weeks, months or even years — meaning that in tropical Rio low bacterial markers can be completely out of step with high virus levels.\n\nThat disparity was borne out in the AP's testing. For instance, in June, 2016, the levels of fecal coliforms in water samples from Copacabana and Ipanema Beaches were extremely low, with just 31 and 85 fecal coliforms per 100 milliliters, respectively. But still, both had alarming readings for rotavirus, the main cause of gastroenteritis globally, with 7.22 million rotaviruses per liter detected in the waters of Copacabana, while 32.7 million rotaviruses per liter were found in the waters of Ipanema Beach.\n\nThe testing also revealed alarming spikes in fecal coliform levels — the very measure the state government uses to determine the safety of Rio's recreational waters.\n\n\"If these were the reported values in the United States, let's say in California, there is definitely an indication of a problem,\" said Dr. Kristina Mena, a waterborne virus expert at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.\n\nAccording to California's bacterial tests standards, 400 fecal coliforms per 100 milliliters is the upper limit for a beach to be considered safe for swimming. AP's tests revealed that Copacabana Beach, where the marathon and triathlon swimming are to be held and thousands of tourists are likely to take a dip, exceeded California's limit five times over 13 months of testing.\n\nNearby Ipanema Beach, which is not playing host to any Olympic sports but is among the city's most popular tourist spots, exceeded California standards five times over 12 months, once spiking to nearly 50 times what would be permitted in California. One of two testing spots along the beach in the Olympic hub neighborhood of Barra da Tijuca once hit more than 60 times that limit over the five months testing was conducted there.\n\n\"If we had exceedances that consistently were in the thousands like I'm seeing here, there would be a high likelihood that that beach would be put on our list of impaired water bodies,\" said Rik Rasmussen, manager of surface water quality standards at California's State Water Board. That would lead to water quality warnings posted on the beach, possible beach closure, and the development of a program to root out the source of the contamination, he said.\n\nThe beaches even violate Rio state's own standards, which are much less stringent than those in California, many other U.S. states and beach-loving countries such as Australia and New Zealand. In Rio, beaches are considered unfit if bacterial tests turn up more than 2,500 fecal coliforms per 100 milliliters — more than six times higher than the upper limit in California. But Copacabana and Ipanema even violated those much higher limits on three separate occasions. The state environmental agency, INEA, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nRasmussen acknowledged that the higher thresholds might make sense in Rio, where sewage pollution has been a perennial problem, meaning that locals are regularly exposed to the pathogens lurking in raw waste from an early age and therefore build up immunities. But visitors are unlikely to have such immunities, putting them at risk for illnesses.\n\nAfter the AP's initial report on the findings of the study in July of last year, the Olympics' adviser on health matters, the World Health Organization, said it would carry out its own viral testing in Rio's Olympic waterways. The agency later flip-flopped, finally concluding that bacterial tests alone would suffice.\n\nAthletes who have trained years for a chance at Olympic glory have resigned themselves to competing in the filth.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about how dirty the water is and all the viruses,\" said Finnish team sailor Noora Ruskola. \"I'm mentally prepared for this. Some days the water is totally OK, and some days there are bad days.\"\n\nHowever, tourists are unlikely to realize the dangers: Water quality warning signs used to dot showcase beaches, but they're no longer there. Now, a brief item on the weather page of the local paper lists which beaches the state environmental agency has deemed safe for swimming.\n\nMost beach-going visitors are likely in the same situation as Raul Onetto, a 52-year-old bank executive from Uruguay recently soaking up the sun on Copacabana Beach.\n\nWhen asked whether he knew that the bacterial levels sometimes exceeded the norms in other countries and could indicate problems, he expressed disbelief.\n\n\"The water looks beautiful. I didn't know it was dirty,\" said Onetto. \"If it's dirty, the public should know it. I came 2,000 kilometers to be on a beach.\"\n\nIn Rio, the main tourist gateway to the country, a centuries-long sewage problem that was part of Brazil's colonial legacy has spiked in recent decades in tandem with the rural exodus that saw the metropolitan area nearly double in size since 1970.\n\nEven in the city's wealthy areas, sewage treatment has lagged dramatically behind, with so-called \"black tongues\" of fetid, sewage-filled water common even on the tony Ipanema and Leblon Beaches. The lagoons in the fast-growing Barra da Tijuca region have been filled with so much sewage dumped by nearby glass-and-steel residential towers that vast islands of sludge emerge from the filthy waters during low tide. That lagoon system, which hugs the Olympic Park and Athletes' Village, regularly sees massive pollution-related fish die-offs and emits an eye-watering sulfuric stench.\n\nPromises to clean up Rio's waterways stretch back decades, with a succession of governors setting firm dates for a cleanup and repeatedly pushing them back. In the city's 2009 Olympic bid document, authorities pledged the games would \"regenerate Rio's magnificent waterways.\" A promised billion-dollar investment in cleanup programs was meant to be among the games' most important legacies.\n\nOnce more, the lofty promises have ended in failure.\n\nJust over a month before the games, biologist Mario Moscatelli spent more than two hours flying over Rio in a helicopter, as he's done on a monthly basis for the past 20 years.\n\nViewed from above, Rio's sewage problem is as starkly visible as on the spreadsheets of the AP analysis: Rivers are tar-black; the lagoons near the Olympic Park bloom with fluorescent green algae that thrives amid sewage; fishermen's wooden boats sink into thick sludge in the Guanabara Bay; surfers paddle amid a giant brown stain that contrasts with the azure of the surrounding waters.\n\n\"It's been decades and I see no improvement,\" laments Moscatelli, an activist who's the most visible face of the fight to clean up Rio's waterways. \"The Guanabara Bay has been transformed into a latrine ... and unfortunately Rio de Janeiro missed the opportunity, maybe the last big opportunity\" to clean it up.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Peter Prengaman, Stephen Wade and Diarlei Rodrigues contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/08/29/vibrio-vulnificus-everlasting-threat-summertime-water-enthusiasts/923886002/", "title": "Warnings lag in Mid-Atlantic as deadly marine bacteria increases ...", "text": "As a Maryland man was losing his battle against deadly bacteria in fall 2016, a Dover man was fighting the same microscopic organism in the same Delmarva hospital.\n\nDelaware's Robert Dunn, like Michael Funk, was at war with a Vibrio vulnificus wound infection which Dunn contracted while catching crabs. Naturally occurring bacteria found in the brackish coastal waters of Delaware and elsewhere, Vibrio vulnificus is often inaccurately called “flesh-eating bacteria” for its ability to release enzymes that can rot flesh and shut down internal organs.\n\nAlways there, Vibrio multiplies dangerously in warm water and can become deadly.\n\nYet, even though doctors, scientists, fishermen, state regulators and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration know it exists and can pose a serious health threat, especially in summer, there's little notice or warning to the public when it does.\n\nAN INTRO TO VIBRIO: As Delaware coastal waters warm, risk of deadly bacteria rises\n\nDunn figures that may be because it would hurt tourism, but experts say it's because the bacteria is always there and there's nothing they can do to kill it or even accurately warn people exactly where it is a threat.\n\n“It’s not that the state is not monitoring,” said Michael Bott, an environmental scientist at the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. “It’s that we know those risk levels are associated with temperatures and salinities. The risk is always going to be there during the warmer months.”\n\nTesting every nook of the Delaware Bay and Sussex County’s Inland Bays would be nearly impossible. And if one water sample revealed low levels of Vibrio, that could mislead the public into thinking the waterway — which could have wildly different results between one end and the other — is Vibrio-free, Bott said.\n\nIn addition, testing for total Vibrios is not necessarily an accurate illustration of the true threat to public health. Within a sample, there could be cells of Vibrios, like vulnificus, that are highly infectious and others that are not. Plus, no one knows exactly how much of the bacteria it takes to make someone deathly ill.\n\nThe infections also are considered rare and particularly lethal to people who have underlying health conditions, meaning governments may not want to put their dollars into tracking, testing and warning for something that doesn't affect many.\n\nBut Dunn and others wonder.\n\n“When you’re looking at a [multi-billion dollar] tourism industry between Lewes and Chincoteague,\" Dunn said, \"they’re not going to tell some guy who is paying $1,800 for a two-bedroom condo in Ocean City or Fenwick Island that he can’t go near the water.\n\n“I believe that.”\n\nAs global warming continues to raise worldwide temperatures, some experts fear the rate of infections, which peak from June through October, could rise even more, researchers say.\n\nVibrio infections can be caused by eating raw oysters contaminated by the bacteria or when the bacteria finds its way into a cut or wound on the skin. For some, that can mean an extremely irritated cut or stomach. For others with underlying health conditions, the most serious form of the infection can quickly lead to amputations and death.\n\nIt is unclear exactly how many people are infected by Vibrio each year. Many experts say infections are likely underreported or misdiagnosed.\n\nIn Delaware, cases have reached an all-time peak in recent years, with 12 infections reported in 2016 and 2017. Nationally, cases also have been on the rise, with more than 1,200 infections and 34 deaths reported in 2014. But those officially reported numbers stand against the U.S. Centers for Disease and Control’s estimate that 80,000 illnesses and 100 deaths occur each year.\n\nAnd it's hard to tell where Vibrio strikes.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease tracks cases by the residence of the victim. If, for example, someone who lives in Maryland gets a Vibrio infection in Delaware, that case is counted as a Maryland case.\n\nThe only way to know where each case began is to individually inspect each report, meaning it's highly impractical to find out how many Vibrio infections begin in Delaware waters.\n\nBott can say for sure that there's never been a Vibrio vulnificus or Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection from eating shellfish harvested in Delaware waters.\n\nStill, in Delaware, the only public health warnings shared by the state this year went directly to hospitals. Healthcare providers are urged to be on high alert for the bug in the peak risk months of the summer and early fall, officials said.\n\n“We often have to prioritize,” said Delaware Public Health spokeswoman Jennifer Brestel. “I’m not saying Vibrio … are less important. The information is there, it just may not be popped out at the front and center.”\n\nEven if a workable warning system could be put into action, it would have to include personal responsibility, experts say.\n\nRight now, crabbers and seafood lovers largely have to track water conditions themselves and know where their food comes from, allowing them to decide whether that cocktail-laden half-shell is really worth it.\n\n“Life is not a no-risk activity,” Bott said. “This has always been around. This has always been a risk.”\n\nThe science isn’t there yet\n\nOne Saturday in late August 2016, the morning after the Dunns had enjoyed a dinner of crabs Robert caught near the Delaware Bay's Woodland Beach, the Dover couple realized something was terribly wrong.\n\nTwo hours after their early morning breakfast, Robert began vomiting and shaking uncontrollably. When his wife, Kathleen, finally convinced him to go to a walk-in clinic, he could not get out of his chair.\n\nThat’s when they called 911, and Dunn’s fight for survival began.\n\n“I’m lucky to be alive,” Robert said. “I’m a success story in the fact that I’m still here.”\n\nIt would take multiple surgeries, medications and months in hospitals and rehabilitation centers in Delaware and Maryland before Dunn could return home to Velcro shoes, walking sticks and a life of pain. He the Vibrio and septic shock, a condition in which the body starts shutting down functions to survive after an infection gets into the blood.\n\nVibrio had found its way into a cut on his hand that he didn’t even know he had and overnight caused a nasty infection near the wound that entered his bloodstream.\n\nDunn said he had never heard of Vibrio before his near-death encounter. But he did know after working for a Delaware clam company that shellfish are bottom feeders exposed to all the good and bad of the bays.\n\nProfessionals who work on the water and face the greatest risk of exposure to Vibrio are generally aware of the dangers to themselves and their customers, industry experts say. State and local regulatory agencies, as well as national trade organizations, offer Vibrio educational outreach and trainings in an industry that once thrived in the First State.\n\nWhen it comes to oysters, Vibrio parahaemolyticus causes more problems, but Vibrio vulnificus claims more lives when it gets into a wound or oysters.\n\nVibrio parahaemolyticus generally only causes symptoms of food poisoning that are overcome by otherwise healthy people. About a dozen other Vibrio species also can make people sick.\n\n“I don’t want to say it’s much ado about nothing because there are fatalities involved, but for Vibrio vulnificus, we’re talking 60 to 80 illnesses a year nationwide,” said “Vibrio evangelist” Robert Rheault. He is the executive director of the East Coast Shellfish Growers Association.\n\n“More than half of those are wound infections, and most of them are in the Gulf,\" he said. \"One of the reasons people don’t know much about it is because most doctors will never see a case in their entire career.”\n\nFor Bott, who oversees the guidelines for Delaware’s commercial oyster harvesters, observable data is key to local decision-making.\n\n“We don’t hypothesize when managing a resource like that,” he said. “You base it off actual data.”\n\nState and federal regulations protect the public by requiring shellfish be kept on ice or chilled within hours after harvest and enforcing an industry-driven prohibition on collecting oysters from the Delaware Bay in the riskier months.\n\nBut an uninformed user could negate all of that hard work by leaving a bag of oysters unchilled for too long on a summer day.\n\nIt is also easy for someone with liver problems, immune systems disorders, diabetes or high iron in their blood — the main underlying health problems that can turn an infection into a lengthy hospital stay or worse — to ignore the U.S. Food & Drug Administration-backed advisories on menus that warn vaguely of the risks of eating raw or undercooked food.\n\n“At some point, we have to take some responsibility for our actions,” Rheault said.\n\nWhen people get sick from Vibrio vulnificus or Vibrio parahaemolyticus after eating raw oysters, reports rarely specify whether the consumer was properly handling the shellfish, he said. And nearly all victims have some type of underlying health condition, he said.\n\n“There was a guy in Maryland who I suggest ... committed suicide by oyster,” Rheault said. That man had recently had a transplant and was still on medication when he ate bacteria-laden shellfish and later died. In another case, Rheault said, a man had five underlying, pre-existing conditions “that should have precluded him from eating any raw oysters.”\n\n“If you’re not a healthy person, don’t eat raw eggs or undercooked seafood,” Rheault said. “Once you pull the oyster out of the water and he’s not pumping, the bacteria inside of him will start dividing and that’s totally determined by the temperature.”\n\nVibrio parahaemolyticus, among the leading cause of foodborne illnesses nationwide, can double its population within an hour if the temperature is about 90 degrees. The more bacteria in an oyster, the greater risk that even an otherwise healthy person might spend some unwanted time in the bathroom or in a hospital.\n\nVibrio vulnificus wound infections in those with compromised health can lead to amputations or death within 48 hours or less.\n\nRheault said the “science is not there yet” to predict when and where the bacteria could pose a serious threat. To begin, samples would require costly DNA analysis to determine if the Vibrio in them is capable of making someone sick.\n\nScientists thought they had isolated a gene that would tell them whether or not a Vibrio sample was infectious. Then several recent cases of Vibrios were tested and did not show that gene, he said.\n\n“There are hundreds of strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus,\" Rheault said. \"And the thing about bacteria is they are genetic sluts. They swap genes like crazy.”\n\nWhile experts have a good idea of how many Vibrio parahaemolyticus cells are needed to make someone sick, that threshold is unknown for the more deadly Vibrio vulnificus.\n\n“Nobody is going to sign up for that study,” Rheault said.\n\nFunding for scientific studies is limited, he said. He's struggled for two decades to get the funding and resources needed to develop a simple test that could be used out on a boat while oysters are gathered.\n\n“It’s literally the proverbial needle in the haystack,\" Rheault said. \"You’re looking for a very specific gene in a field of absolutely benign Vibrios.”\n\nChanges on the horizon?\n\nAt the University of Maryland College Park, scientists who have been studying Vibrio for decades have made headway on one species: Vibrio cholerae.\n\nThey have developed a model to predict outbreaks of Cholera, an acute, diarrheal illness that kills many around the world. This year, the model worked.\n\n“We were able to predict the outbreak in Saudi Arabia,” said Dr. Rita Colwell, a distinguished professor at the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University. “If you know there’s going to be an outbreak … you can get vaccines shipped in quickly and be prepared when the first victims appear and avoid an epidemic.”\n\nColwell said she and her colleagues have also developed a model to predict when Vibrio vulnificus could cause problems in the Chesapeake Bay by using satellite data and environmental indicators such as water temperature and salinity.\n\n\"I think the biggest problem is that it's not recognized as a threat [because] it doesn't occur in large numbers,\" Colwell said. \"Something that the state health department might consider [is] having Vibrio alerts like you have asthma alerts.\"\n\nNOAA has predictive models for Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which were validated with actual samples taken from places like the Delaware Bay, said Bott.\n\nIt's a good tool that people at higher risk of infection can use to track the possible presence of Vibrios, Bott said.\n\n“At the end of the day, this comes down to taking your health in your own hands,” he said. \"Knowing your risk factor is very important.\"\n\nThere is a smattering of official warnings about the bacteria.\n\nThe state offers information online and in pamphlets handed out at beach area events such as the University of Delaware’s Coast Day. Informational signs on some state-owned lands along the Delaware Inland Bays generally warn about unspecified naturally occurring bacteria. In Maryland, fishing licenses also come with warnings about bacteria.\n\n“For Delaware, we try to post them in the public access areas,” Bott said. “You do the best you can and try to post those signs to reach the greatest amount of people.”\n\nThe lack of signs may reflect a lack of federal regulatory mechanism for testing recreational waters for Vibrio, like it does for other bacteria such as enterococcus and E. coli.\n\nPlacing signs at private docks comes with its own obstacles, and it's probably unnecessary to post warnings on ocean-side beaches where the water is often too salty or too cool to foster dangerous levels of Vibrio, officials say.\n\n“We live in a resort area and they don’t necessarily always want to have this information out there,” said Kathy Phillips, executive director of the Assateague Coastal Trust in Berlin, Maryland. “And I don’t think that’s right.”\n\nPhillips works with a team that helps Maryland test the water of popular places along the back bays of Ocean City, Maryland, for enterococcus, an indicator that other harmful bacteria may be lurking beneath the surface.\n\n“The public should be better notified, and people should be more engaged in understanding what’s in the water where they swim,” she said. Her organization has created a user-friendly application to track bacteria counts called Swim Guide. Delaware does the same through a partnership with the University of Delaware’s Citizen Monitoring Program.\n\n“The scary thing about Vibrio is we know it grows here in our coastal bays,” Phillips said. “Lots of times the water looks beautiful and it’s all sparkly, but it’s a good idea to know what’s there in the water.”\n\nWhile Vibrio can prove deadly – it claims about 27 lives across the country every year – it still is considered a rare disease.\n\nUniversity of Delaware professor, researcher and oyster aquaculture expert John Ewart has cut himself in and near the water countless times and has all the scars to prove it. Just retired, he has spent most of his career on the water, working on lobster boats and growing oysters in a small shack near the university’s campus in Lewes.\n\nBut he has never had a Vibrio infection.\n\n“Why is it that people aren’t being notified?\" he asks. \"Well, it hasn’t really represented itself as a broader danger. It’s not on an epidemic scale.”\n\nEwart remembers when Vibrio infections were largely limited to the Gulf Coast. But as water temperatures have warmed, some fish are heading into deeper waters or swimming farther north than ever before and some Vibrios are becoming more active where they once did not thrive, he said.\n\n“Probably in 10 years, or down the road with more incidents occurring, it could build to a public warning status,\" Ewart said. \"Right now it’s kind of a random hit-or-miss.”\n\nGreater risk, greater outreach?\n\nAs more retirees – who are more likely to have underlying health conditions such as diabetes than the general public – flock to Delmarva, getting the word out about Vibrio risks may be all the more important.\n\nIf the documented rise in worldwide water temperatures continues, bath-like bays may bubble with bacteria more often.\n\n“As health departments, we always try to do a more effective job of reaching people on a whole range of things that can affect their health,” said Dr. Cliff Mitchell, director of Maryland Public Health’s environmental health bureau.\n\nEven if scientists found an efficient, affordable way to track exactly when and where Vibrio could pose a threat, the only thing officials can do is warn people to stay away, Mitchell said.\n\n“You can’t spray for Vibrio,” he said. “You can’t change the salinity of the bay. Nature can do that, but we can’t.”\n\nAny warnings would be only recommendations that people can choose to ignore, just as the warnings that those with health conditions should not eat raw shellfish.\n\n“Generally speaking, we post advisories when situations occur that are unusual, when there is an increase in risk such that we feel the public ought to expect things are not normal and therefore they should change their behavior,” Mitchell said.\n\nGovernments and others know Vibrio infections can be severe and even fatal.\n\n\"We take that very seriously in the advice we give to people. But we also want people to put that risk into perspective and context,\" he said. \"That’s a good conversation for people to have with their primary care provider.”\n\nSumitha Nagarajan, Delaware’s state epidemiologist, said Delaware has a \"very good\" surveillance system. She said she would have to dig through case reports to know which species caused illnesses or why Delawareans have reported more illnesses recently.\n\n“The CDC is really who we look to as guidance for surveillance and tracking the data,” Nagarajan said. “Our protocol for how we are tracking the data and following it are in line for the CDC.”\n\nShe said Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which usually causes symptoms akin to food poisoning, is the larger Vibrio threat in Delaware. She said she knew of no reported cases from Vibrio vulnificus. Public health officials have been unable to provide a breakdown by Vibrio species, but said the bacteria has never claimed the life of a Delawarean since record-keeping began.\n\n“Because our case numbers have been low in the past, it is not something you would see a lot of messaging on,” said Brestel, public health’s spokeswoman. “You want people to pay attention when there’s an absolute risk, but also not completely frighten them. That’s the balance that we weigh. We base it off of risk.”\n\nWhile Mid-Atlantic states do not often put out public notices about the risk of Vibrio because the chances of infection are so low, Gulf Coast states that see more illnesses and deaths will sometimes warn the public when things get bad.\n\nSo far this summer in Florida, 21 people have gotten sick and three have died. That promoted health officials to reach out to local media to spread the word on the annual Vibrio threat.\n\nThe same goes for Texas, where about 90 people are infected every year. Officials recently released a general warning about the bacteria.\n\nWhile it is clear that individuals need to educate themselves on risks they face when consuming raw food or getting into wild waterways, it is also clear that hospitals need to be able to quickly diagnose Vibrio infections.\n\nIf doctors at Bayhealth Kent General Hospital in Dover had not immediately and accurately diagnosed Dunn’s infection, the outcome could have been much different.\n\n“I want people to realize how perilous your existence can be,” Kathleen said. “Your whole life can change in seconds. Not only your life, but the lives of those around you.”\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.\n\nDelaware Beach Must-Reads\n\nAs Delaware coastal waters warm, risk of deadly bacteria rises\n\nWhales off the Delaware coast: Your guide to these huge mammals\n\nBeach Nomad Brews is the first downtown brewery to join Dogfish in Rehoboth Beach", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/29"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/955843/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-22-february-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 22 February 2022 | The Week", "text": "1. Troops sent into eastern Ukraine\n\nVladimir Putin ordered troops into separatist-held parts of eastern Ukraine on so-called “peace-keeping duties” after signing a decree recognising the independence of the self-declared republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. In an hour-long speech last night, Putin raged against Kyiv’s growing security ties with the West and referred to Russia having been “robbed” during the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The UK government said it will sanction Moscow over Putin’s decision to recognise the two breakaway regions, with sources suggesting these sanctions will be “ratcheted up” in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhy the US is warning about Russian ‘kill lists’\n\n2. Experts query PM’s Covid move\n\nJust hours after Boris Johnson declared his “pride” in England leading the world by shedding its final Covid restrictions, top scientific and medical experts warned that the virus is expected to return “in more virulent and dangerous forms”, said The Independent. Professors Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance said that the pandemic was “not over” and urged people testing positive to continue to isolate. The British Medical Association described the PM’s plan for “living with Covid” as “premature”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Franklin drives flood warnings\n\nStorm Franklin has caused severe flooding in parts of Northern Ireland, with further flood warnings still in place across England, Scotland and Wales. The highest wind speeds on Monday morning reached 79mph in Capel Curig in Wales and 78mph in Orlock Head, Northern Ireland, said the BBC. Storm Franklin arrived just days after Dudley and Eunice – the first time the UK has seen three named storms in a week since the system was introduced seven years ago. Reports suggest that Storm Gladys could potentially strike on Thursday.\n\nHow storms get their names\n\n4. Colombia abortion victory\n\nColombia has decriminalised abortion during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy, a move hailed as a “historic victory” by campaigners. The South American country’s constitutional court ruled five against four to decriminalise the procedure. Prior to the ruling, abortion in Colombia was only allowed in the case of a risk to the life or health of the pregnant mother. The Guardian said the news adds to a “recent string of legal victories for reproductive rights in Latin America” following rulings in Mexico and Argentina that lowered the barriers to abortion.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n5. Fourth Covid jabs offered from March\n\nFourth jabs will start being offered to care home residents and those aged 75 and over from next month, said The Daily Telegraph, with a further rollout to millions of over-50s in the autumn. The boosters are being offered as a “precautionary” measure amid concern that immunity wanes more quickly in older and vulnerable groups, added the paper. Almost 70% of those aged 12 or over in the UK have had a booster since third jabs started being rolled out last September.\n\nWhich Covid vaccine works best as a booster?\n\n6. ‘Betamax’ police ‘stretched thin’\n\nThe head of a review of the police service will warn today that a “Betamax police force” is unsuccessfully pursuing “blockchain-enabled criminals”, reported The Guardian. In a speech at the Centre for Policy Studies webinar, Michael Barber, chair of the Strategic Review of Policing in England and Wales, will call for the modernisation of crime-fighting technology and new training for officers. In remarks which will allude to police cuts under recent governments, Barber will say that the blue line is stretched “too thin” and is focused on dealing with social issues instead of fighting and preventing crime.\n\n7. More women in FTSE boardrooms\n\nThe number of women in FTSE 100 boardroom roles has leapt to 39.1% from 12.5% ten years ago, figures from global data company BoardEx have revealed. But the Fawcett Society, a charity which campaigns for gender equality and women’s rights, said the figures did not capture the “shocking lack of diversity” revealed in its 2022 Sex and Power Index, with “women of colour, disabled women and LGBTQ people missing from positions of power”. According to The Guardian, women make up only eight of the chief executives at the UK’s top 100 listed companies.\n\n8. BBC under fire for Djokovic interview\n\nThe BBC has defended its interview with Novak Djokovic after senior insiders expressed a view that Amol Rajan’s sit-down with the tennis star amplified an anti-vax message. One senior insider told The Times that they felt Rajan had not pressed Djokovic hard enough on his “idiot beliefs” and that the involvement of a PR company meant the interview had “Cliff Richard vibes” – a reference to the BBC controversially filming a police raid on the pop star’s home from a helicopter in 2014.\n\nNovak Djovokic on vaccines, grand slams and playing tennis for ‘many more years’\n\n9. Icahn launches McDonald’s board fight\n\nThe ruthless investor Carl Icahn has acquired 200 McDonald’s shares and nominated two political activists to be added to the fast-food giant’s board. It is believed that Icahn wants to force the chain to source its bacon, ribs and sausages from meat suppliers that treat pigs more humanely. The billionaire, who is “known for striking fear into the hearts of complacent chairmen and chief executives”, appears “to be going soft in his old age”, said The Daily Telegraph.\n\n10. Billionaire must pay wife £300k monthly\n\nThe co-owner of the Chrysler Building has been ordered to pay his estranged wife £300,000 a month in what The Times called “the latest high-stakes divorce dispute in the High Court”. Michael Fuchs, 62, who is worth around £1.2b, married Alvina Collardeau-Fuchs in New York in 2012.

And it was the Manchester-based duo who made the difference with the vital goals in the second-half.\n\nRashford was given “his chance” in the starting XI for the first time at this World Cup and “really, it was his night”, said David Hytner in The Guardian. The Manchester United forward’s first goal was a “fizzing free-kick” on 50 minutes which “veered away” from goalkeeper Danny Ward into the top corner. With his second in the 68th minute, and England’s third, he “simply had too much pace and balance” as he cut inside Connor Roberts and shot through the legs of Ward.\n\nAlso making his first World Cup start, Manchester City midfielder Foden marked his return to the team by firing in Harry Kane’s cross on 51 minutes. Foden’s strike came just a minute after Rashford’s free-kick opener and killed the game off as a contest.\n\nBy bringing in Rashford and Foden for Raheem Sterling and Bukayo Saka, England boss Southgate showed his “Midas touch” again, said Sami Mokbel in the Daily Mail. It’s left the Three Lions boss with a “nice” selection problem ahead of the Senegal clash and the big question now is “how can he drop Rashford after this?”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nSpeaking after the match, Southgate was full of praise for Rashford after his two-goal display. “It’s great for him, he has trained really well,” he told the BBC. “He has been impressive since he came back to us, he could have had a hat-trick. That free kick is what he is capable of, it’s an incredible strike.”\n\nPhil Foden scored England’s second goal against Wales (Image credit: Richard Sellers/Getty Images)\n\nA ‘sobering tournament’ for Wales\n\nAfter losing to Iran in their second group game, Wales were needing a miracle to qualify for the knockout stages. However, there was to be “no more dreaming” in Qatar, said Ian Mitchelmore on WalesOnline. Against England, the Dragons “fully absorbed the harsh lessons” they had been taught on their “return to the big time”.\n\nPage’s side have always “relied heavily on the inspiration” provided by captain Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, but the “two great figures of this fine era” for Welsh football “found this World Cup a step too far”, said Phil McNulty on the BBC. Those around them were “simply not of the quality” to make up for that deficit.\n\nTaken off at half-time because of an injury, talisman Bale only had seven touches in an “anonymous display”, McNulty added. It was a “really, really sad end” to a desperately poor World Cup for Bale, said Tom Coleman on WalesOnline. For a man “who has given his all” for his country, it “shouldn’t have ended like this”.\n\nPut out of their World Cup misery by England, this was a “sobering tournament” for Wales, Mitchelmore added.

Sign up here.\n\nAmman, Jordan CNN —\n\nJordan’s king says he is prepared for conflict should the status of Jerusalem’s holy sites change as Israel prepares to swear in what is likely to be the most right-wing government in its history.\n\nKing Abdullah II told CNN’s Becky Anderson in an exclusive interview this month that there is “concern” in his country about those in Israel trying to push for changes to his custodianship of the Muslim and Christian holy sites in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, warning that he has “red lines.”\n\n“If people want to get into a conflict with us, we’re quite prepared,” he said. “I always like to believe that, let’s look at the glass half full, but we have certain red lines… And if people want to push those red lines, then we will deal with that.”\n\nIsraeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu’s incoming government is expected to be the most right-wing in Israel’s history and it includes controversial figures who were once considered to be on the extreme fringe of Israeli politics. This has caused concerns about the potential for an escalation in Israeli-Palestinian violence and for the future of Israel’s relations with its Arab neighbors and Western allies.\n\nThis year was already the deadliest for Palestinians and Israelis in nearly two decades, raising the specter of a new Palestinian uprising against Israel.\n\n“We have to be concerned about a next intifada (uprising),” said the king. “And if that happens, that’s a complete breakdown of law and order and one that neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians will benefit from. I think there is a lot of concern from all of us in the region, including those in Israel that are on our side on this issue, to make sure that doesn’t happen.”\n\nIsrael captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war but signed a peace treaty with it in 1994 under which it formally recognized Amman’s special role at the city’s holy sites. But the two have since had an uneasy relationship, with Jordan regularly accusing Israel of violating the agreement that gave it control of the sites and barred non-Muslims from praying there.\n\nJordan’s Hashemite monarchy has been the custodian of Jerusalem’s holy sites since 1924 and sees itself as the guarantor of the religious rights of Muslims and Christians in the city.\n\nTensions are highest over the compound known to Muslims as the Haram Al Sharif, which is called the Temple Mount by Jews. The site includes the Al Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam. The area is also the holiest site in Judaism. Politicians on the Israeli right often argue that Jews should also have a right to pray there.\n\nOne of the most controversial figures in Israel’s incoming government is Itamar Ben Gvir, who is set to become the national security minister and assume control over the police, including law enforcement at Jerusalem’s holy sites. Ben Gvir has a long history of inciting violence against Palestinians and Arabs. He has been convicted of inciting anti-Arab racism and supporting terrorism and has openly called for changing the status quo at the holy sites.\n\n“I don’t think those individuals are under just a Jordanian microscope. They’re under an international microscope,” the king said, responding to a question about Ben Gvir’s views. “I have to believe that there’s a lot of people in Israel also that are concerned as much as we are.”\n\nHe refused to say how Jordan would respond to changes in the status of the holy sites. “At the end of the day, the Israeli people have the right to pick whoever they want to lead them… We will work with anybody and everybody as long as we can bring people together,” he said.\n\nOf Jordan’s population of around 10 million, more than half is of Palestinian descent, including more than two million Palestinian refugees.\n\nJordan was the second Arab nation to normalize relations with Israel, after Egypt. But after a decades-long wait, Israel scored a major diplomatic victory in 2020 by gaining recognition from four more Arab states, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.\n\nIsraeli politician Itamar Ben Gvir visits Al Haram Al Sharif, known to Jews as Temple Mount, accompanied by Israeli forces in Jerusalem on May 29. Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThe nation’s relationship with Israel is heavily scrutinized at home, with many opposing further strengthening of ties due to Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael’s integration into the region is “extremely important” but it is “not going to happen unless there’s a future for the Palestinians,” the king said, pointing to the overwhelming support shown by Arab football fans for Palestinians at the Qatar FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe king has redoubled efforts to shed light on the status of Christians in the Middle East of late. In September, he proclaimed at the United Nations General Assembly in New York that Christianity in Jerusalem was “under fire,” a message the patriarchs and Heads of the Churches in Jerusalem endorsed.\n\nSome churches in the Holy Land have also been sounding the alarm about the status of Christians there. In a Christmas message this week, the Heads of Churches in Jerusalem, a grouping of Palestinian churches, issued a statement decrying the “assault” on their exercise of religion and “unwarranted restrictions” on worship. In July, the Higher Presidential Committee of Church Affairs in Palestine issued a statement condemning an attack by “extremist Israeli settlers” on the Church of the Holy Spirit and the Greek Garden, accusing the Israeli government of complicity through “inaction” in holding the perpetrators to account.\n\nIsraeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat told CNN the Heads of Churches “have full access to every governmental authority for concerns they have,” adding that acts of violence “on any community are condemned by the government and investigated with the utmost seriousness by Israeli police.”\n\n“The State of Israel remains committed to safeguarding freedom of religion and worship for all, including the Christian community, in Jerusalem and other holy sites,” he said.\n\nKing Abdullah told CNN that churches in Jerusalem face challenges from “policies on the ground,” causing the Christian community to come under pressure.\n\n“This is not a national policy, but there are those that join governments that have very extremist views towards Muslims and Christians, as there are on the other side obviously, and we have to unify against that,” he said.\n\nChristians in the Middle East are “part of our past, they’re part of our present, and they must be part of our future,” he added.\n\nJordan has become a safe haven for Middle Eastern Christians for the better part of the past two decades as neighboring countries have been embroiled in conflicts that have pushed some of the oldest Christian communities in the world to flee their homelands.\n\nIn December, the monarch launched a master plan to develop Bethany Beyond the Jordan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where Christians believe Jesus was baptized. The plan aims to build lodging, museums and amphitheatres catering to as many as 1.5 million tourists per year.\n\n“I think one of the things that people misunderstand about this place is how inclusive it is. Almost 15% of the visitors that come here are Muslim,” he told CNN. “So this is an opportunity to break down those barriers and to show how proud we are of not only our historical Christian heritage here in Jordan, but the relationship between Christianity and Islam.”\n\nPeople in the Middle East “just want to move on with their lives,” said the monarch. “So, as challenging as 2022 was, and as difficult as the dangers of 2023 are, there’s an opportunity for us to move beyond.”\n\nThat can be done through regional integration, he said.\n\n“I’ve gotten away from the feeling that politics are going to solve our problems. It’s economic dependency,” he said. “When I am invested in your success because your success is my success, at the end of the day means we can move forward.”\n\nWith additional reporting by CNN’s Mike Schwartz in Jerusalem.", "authors": ["Zeena Saifi"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}]}

With a new ...", "text": "ALBANY – Federal immigration and border officials have been blocked from accessing New York's DMV database, a move that keeps them from accessing data that can be used to help determine whether a vehicle owner has a criminal history or a warrant for their arrest.\n\nNew York's Green Light Law took effect Saturday, allowing those without legal immigration status to apply for driver's licenses in New York.\n\nBut the law also included a provision prohibiting state DMV officials from providing any of its data to entities that enforce immigration law unless a judge orders them to, leading the state to cut off database access to at least three federal agencies last week.\n\nAmong them were U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP — which patrols the U.S.-Canada border in New York — and U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.\n\nFederal officials appeared caught off guard by the change last week, which was laid out in the state law approved in June.\n\nThe information federal officers can access from the database is important to keep them and the public safe, said Mark Morgan, CBP's acting commissioner.\n\n“New York’s Green Light Law is detrimental to CBP and ICE,\" Morgan said in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\"The information we receive from New York state is vital to our missions, and blocking federal law enforcement officers from accessing it creates a significant threat to both officer and public safety.”\n\nThe data is \"vital to building out these criminal cases, identifying criminal suspects, and enhancing officer safety,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nDatabase serves as law-enforcement tool\n\nThe DMV database allows officers to quickly access information about a vehicle registration holder, including their traffic history. The data can then be used to determine whether a driver is on a sex-offender registry or has a criminal history and whether they have outstanding warrants.\n\nOfficers often run license plates through the database during traffic stops and similar encounters.\n\nNew York's Democrat-led Legislature and Gov. Andrew Cuomo approved the Green Light Law in June, allowing undocumented immigrants to use foreign-issued documents to prove their age and identity so they can apply for driving privileges.\n\nThe law reversed the state's post-9/11 policy of denying driving privileges to immigrants without legal immigration status.\n\nState lawmakers inserted the data-blocking provision into the bill a week before it passed, when immigrant organizations and Cuomo expressed concern that ICE and CBP would be able to easily obtain information about undocumented immigrants seeking a license, perhaps making it easier for them to be deported.\n\nSpecifically, the provision says DMV \"shall not disclose\" any records or information to \"any agency that primarily enforces immigration law.\"\n\nThe only exceptions are if the DMV commissioner is served with \"a lawful court order or judicial warrant,\" according to the law.\n\nEven then, the DMV has to notify the person at the center of a federal agency's inquiry within three days.\n\nDMV spokeswoman Lisa Koumjian said the state agency is bound by the law. No negotiations are underway to restore the federal agencies' access to the database, she said.\n\n\"Under the Green Light Law, no DMV data of any kind can be shared with an agency that primarily enforces immigration law, which means ICE, Customs and Border Protection and Citizenship and Immigration Services do not have access to data unless the DMV is presented with a valid judge-signed court order, subpoena or judicial warrant,\" Koumjian said in a statement.\n\nTrump's DOJ calls provision 'legally suspect'; Advocates applaud it\n\nAnu Joshi, the New York Immigration Coalition's senior director of immigration policy, said supporters of the Green Light Law are proud it has \"some of the strongest privacy protections of any such law in the country.\"\n\nAt least a dozen other states allow undocumented immigrants to apply for driving privileges.\n\n\"We should be clear that this law doesn't just protect the data of undocumented immigrants; it protects the data of all New Yorkers who are applying for a standard license,\" Joshi said Tuesday. \"It treats all New Yorkers who are applying for a standard license the same.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Department of Justice weighed in earlier this month, intervening in Rensselaer County Clerk Frank Merola's lawsuit that sought to block the Green Light Law from taking effect.\n\nTrump, a Republican, has made tough immigration policies a central piece of his presidency.\n\nThe DOJ only weighed in on the data-blocking provision, calling it \"legally suspect\" and questioning whether it violates federal law.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Gary Sharpe later dismissed Merola's lawsuit entirely without considering the DOJ questions, deciding Merola didn't have the legal capacity to sue.\n\nU.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, Saratoga County, wrote a letter Friday to Cuomo, a Democrat, urging him to restore the federal agencies' access to the DMV information.\n\nShe questioned whether citizens with enhanced driver's licenses — which allow the license holder to cross the Canadian border — would be able to re-enter the U.S. if Customs agents don't have access to the database.\n\nA CBP spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether that's the case.\n\n\"Hamstringing (Border Patrol agents') ability to effectively execute their jobs is a huge mistake and I urge you to consider the safety of all Americans by immediately reversing this decision,\" Stefanik wrote.\n\nJon Campbell covers state government and politics for the USA TODAY Network New York.

Service was swiftly restored to the popular short-form video app Sunday, although Apple and Google haven't returned it to their app stores for downloading.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social Sunday that he would issue the order on his first day as a second-term president \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\n\"The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\" Trump promised.\n\nWhether Trump's executive order can truly halt the law temporarily isn't clear. The law works by imposing a $5,000 fine on companies for each user who accesses TikTok through their services. That includes companies like Apple and Google that provide platforms to download and update apps and companies like Oracle that provide internet hosting services.\n\nTrump pardons 1,500 defendants charged in Jan. 6 attack\n\nPresident Donald Trump pardoned about 1,500 people Monday charged in the Capitol attack Jan. 6, 2021 , fulfilling a campaign pledge critics said would \"endorse attacks on democracy.\"\n\nThat figure would represent almost all of the nearly 1,600 people who were charged in the riot by the fourth anniversary Jan. 6, according to the Justice Department .\n\nAbout 1,270 people have been convicted from charges associated with the riot. More than 1,000 pleaded guilty and 260 were convicted at trials.

We hope they come out tonight.”\n\nTrump to declare 'border emergency,' send troops to the border\n\nTrump is expected to sign nearly a dozen executive orders on border security and immigration under the auspices of a national border emergency.\n\nIncoming White House officials said early Monday that the president will order U.S. armed forces to \"repel forms of invasion\" at the U.S.-Mexico border, including illegal migration and drug trafficking.\n\nThe administration is expected to suspend refugee resettlement, finish building the border wall, suspend entry of nationals from \"countries of concern\" and attempt to end the constitutionally guaranteed right to citizenship for children born in the U.S. to some foreign nationals.\n\nTrump also plans to use the military to target drug cartels as \"global terrorists\" and use the military to combat them, though officials declined to provide details on the rules of engagement.\n\nDeclaring a ‘national energy emergency’\n\nTrump on Monday said he would declare a “national energy emergency,” though what exactly that entails is not clear.\n\nTypically, when a president declares a national emergency, certain statutory powers become available that were not before, according to research by the Brennan Center. Previous presidential emergencies have included natural disasters, maritime issues, security concerns and public health emergencies.\n\nNo national energy emergency has previously been declared, but during in 1977 energy crisis, President Jimmy Carter let states declare their own energy emergencies, which allowed them to suspend certain environmental regulations.\n\nBy calling a national emergency on energy, Trump said he plans to prioritize domestic oil and gas production – even as U.S. crude oil production hit an all-time high over the past year.\n\nTrump on Monday also revoked a non-legally binding executive order by Biden in 2021 setting a target of making 50% of all new vehicles sold in the United States by 2032 electric.\n\nUS to leave Paris climate agreement for second time\n\nPresident Trump on Monday signed an executive order that begins the process of withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, which he also did during his first term in office. In addition. the White House sent a letter to the United Nations, informing the international body of the decision.\n\nThe historic 2015 deal includes almost 200 nations in a single agreement to combat global warming by lowering emissions of greenhouse gasses from fossil fuels.\n\nIn 2017 Trump said he would remove the U.S. from the agreement. Due to the agreement's terms, the withdrawal did not go into effect until November 20 of 2020.\n\nThis time around the withdrawal could take less time as the new administration is no longer bound by the original three-year commitment, according to Reuters.\n\nJust as Trump signed an order to remove the U.S. from the Pais agreement on the first day of this term, President Joe Biden signed an Executive Order to rejoin the agreement on Jan. 20, 2021, the first day of his presidency.\n\nThe U.S. formally rejoined on Feb. 19, 2021. Under Biden, in November 2021, the U.S. helped lead negotiations that set new emission reduction standards as part of the agreement.\n\nUS to pull out of World Health Organization\n\nTrump's day-one executive order to pull out of the WHO fulfills a campaign promise to reject global institutions. Health experts worry it isolates the U.S. with consequences for pandemic and disease response and diplomatic relations worldwide.\n\nHe began the process of pulling out from WHO back in 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Biden ended that effort and recommitted to the organization, which prioritizes addressing infectious diseases and providing basic health infrastructure, especially in low- and moderate-income countries.\n\nThe executive order said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO \"due to the organization’s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\" It also cited the \"unfairly onerous payments\" the U.S. has made to support the organization.\n\nFederal employees required to return to work in-person\n\nTrump signed an executive order directing department heads to require federal employees to \"return to work in-person at their respective duty stations on a full-time basis\" immediately, with exemptions allowed.\n\nOnly about 15% of federal employees work in D.C., according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The remaining 85% are spread across big cities like Dallas and state capitals like Carson City, Nevada.\n\nThey are, among others, the postal workers, the civil engineers and the Transportation Security Administration agents. They are mostly represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, a union of 750,000 federal workers.\n\nThis return-to-office mandate is expected to get major pushback from federal workers, he recently reinforced his strategy, threatening to take legal action against the AFGE's latest contract that extended remote worker protections until 2029.\n\nTrump revokes Biden order aimed at cutting prescription drug costs\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order revoking a 2022 Biden-era order aimed at bringing down the cost of prescription medications.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, Biden's major healthcare and climate package, granted Medicare the ability to negotiate lower prices for 10 frequently prescribed drugs with pharmaceutical companies, beginning in 2026.\n\nLast week, the Biden administration added another 15 drugs that treat cancer, diabetes and asthma, including Ozempic, to the list of medications up for negotiation in 2027.\n\nPharmaceutical CEOs and lobby groups have pushed Trump towards scrapping the measures. It is unclear if Trump's executive order would have any impact on the policy, since it was approved by Congress as part of the act.\n\n'Male and female' only\n\nTrump will declare that the federal government only recognizes two sexes − male and female − in a move an incoming White House official described as \"restoring sanity.\"\n\nThe State Department, Department of Homeland Security and other agencies will be tasked with enforcing the directive, which applies to passports, visas and other government documents, according to the incoming White House official.\n\nNew names from the mountains to the Gulf\n\nIn one of the orders, Trump is expected to rename the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X, formerly known as Twitter, Monday morning.\n\nLeavitt's tweet also signaled Trump would rename Mount Denali, the highest peak in North America, back to Mount McKinley. The Alaskan government had long recognized the mountain as Mount Denali, and President Barack Obama renamed it at the federal level in 2015. Trump's action will revert to the pre-Obama name.\n\nMexico, which also borders the gulf that bears its name, is unlikely to go along with the renaming. After Trump initially floated the idea, President Claudia Sheinbaum noted the body of water that separates Miami from Cancun has been known as the Gulf of Mexico since the 17th century.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, Sudiksha Kochi, Eduardo Cuevas", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/23/trump-deputizes-federal-agents-arrest-immigrants/77914576007/", "title": "Trump deputizes US Marshals, DEA, others to target immigrants", "text": "In a move that could supercharge the government's deportation forces, the Trump administration late Thursday deputized thousands more federal law enforcement officers to arrest immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nTwo agencies typically enforce the nation's complex Title 8 immigration laws: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in the country's interior, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the nation's borders.\n\nOn Thursday, Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Benjamine Huffman expanded the universe of federal law enforcement officers who can investigate and apprehend immigrants. It wasn't immediately clear how many officers would be reassigned to immigration enforcement.\n\n\"Mobilizing these law enforcement officials will help fulfill President Trump’s promise to the American people to carry out mass deportations,\" Huffman said in a statement. \"For decades, efforts to find and apprehend illegal aliens have not been given proper resources. This is a major step in fixing that problem.\"\n\nHuffman authorized Department of Justice law enforcement officials, including the U.S. Marshals, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons to do immigration enforcement.\n\nFormer Homeland Security agents said deputizing officers from other agencies could increase the ability to deport people here illegally. But they also raised concerns about inter-agency competition and the potential for widespread civil rights abuses, given the complexities of immigration law.\n\n\"They’re using it as a force multiplier,\" said Carlos Archuleta, who served more than three decades in ICE and retired as country attaché to Mexico for Homeland Security Investigations.\n\nInter-agency competition is \"definitely a concern,\" he said. \"So is exposure to civil rights violations, if you’re not familiar with the law.\"\n\nRoughly 6,000 ICE deportation agents manage a massive docket of more than 7.6 million immigrants in the country without legal status. Under the Biden administration, ICE was directed to focus on arresting those who represented public safety and national security threats.\n\nThis week, President Donald Trump and Congress – under the new Laken Riley Act – shifted the priority for immigration enforcement to more people in the country illegally, including those without serious criminal offense, mandating detention for people accused, charged with or convicted of low-level crimes.\n\nThe expanded authorities mean thousands of Justice Department officials and agents could feasibly participate in Trump's plans to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally. The ATF had about 2,500 special agents in 2022, while DEA reported 4,600 special agents on staff in 2021. There were more than 3,600 U.S. Marshals and deputy U.S. Marshals in 2020.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how many DOJ law enforcement officers would be redirected to immigration enforcement.\n\n\"Those organizations don't normally fulfill that role,\" said Pete Hermansen, a retired Border Patrol agent who served more than two decades, including as director of special operations.\n\nThose agencies have their own missions, including fighting drugs and weapons trafficking and protecting federal judges and judicial facilities.\n\nHermansen said there is clear crossover for DEA and ATF, whose investigations into drugs and weapons trafficking often lead them to criminal organizations also involved in migrant smuggling and immigration violations.\n\nHermansen couldn't recall a time when this sort of deputizing had occurred, outside of specific task forces.\n\n\"It's not standard operating procedure,\" he said.\n\n(This story has been updated to clarify Pete Hermansen's former title.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/08/07/dean-cain-joins-ice/85560269007/", "title": "Superman actor Dean Cain, who lives in Nevada, joins ICE and ...", "text": "Dean Cain known for his role as the TV superhero icon Superman, in the 1990s series \"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman,\" revealed to fans that he enlisted as an officer in the federal agency U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to an Aug. 5 video shared to Cain's social media channels.\n\n\"For those who don't know, I am a sworn law enforcement officer, as well as being a filmmaker, and I felt it was important to join with our first responders to help secure the safety of all Americans, not just talk about it,\" Cain, 59, said. \"So, I joined up.\"\n\nCain currently lives in Las Vegas. Nevada is among several states the Department of Justice recently labeled as sanctuary jurisdictions. He is also older than ICE’s previous age cap for certain law enforcement positions, which limited new applicants to 37 or 40 depending on the role — a restriction the agency lifted this week.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to representatives for Cain and ICE for comment.\n\nCain also used his minute-and-a-half clip as an informal recruitment ad to tout the \"great benefits\" of working for ICE, which reportedly include a $50,000 signing bonus, student loan repayment, enhanced retirement benefits and special pay for individuals working in field operations and law enforcement roles.\n\n\"So, if you want to help save America, ICE is arresting the worst of the worst and removing them from America's streets. I like that. I voted for that,\" Cain said. \"They need your help. We need your help, to protect our homeland and our families.\"\n\nCain's comments come amid increased scrutiny of ICE in recent months.\n\nIn June, several demonstrations erupted in Los Angeles in response to a series of immigration raids carried out by the federal agency. The raids, which sparked nationwide protests, took place as part of a directive from President Donald Trump to find immigrants living in the United States without legal status.\n\nSeveral celebrities, including Jimmy Kimmel, Kim Kardashian, Cardi B and Mark Ruffalo, have spoken out against the ICE raids and the Trump administration's involvement.\n\nCain portrayed DC Comics legend Clark Kent and his superhero alias, Superman, on \"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\" from 1993-1997. The ABC dramedy, which also starred Teri Hatcher and Lane Smith, earned five Primetime Emmy nominations during its four-year run.\n\nDean Cain's ICE video sparks fan backlash\n\nCain's announcement of his ICE employment did not sit well with some fans, who took to the comments section on Instagram to share their dismay over the actor's affiliation with the controversial agency.\n\n\"Shame on you Dean — that's the most un-Superman thing you could possibly advocate,\" @supergirl_titans wrote.\n\n\"You are such a massive disappointment and only bring shame to the red cape.

He's been going after regular people. This tarnishes my view of Dean. I'm shocked he's endorsing ICE.\"\n\nDoes Dean Cain live in Nevada?\n\nDean Cain said in a late 2023 interview with Fox News that he moved from Southern California to Las Vegas because of Nevada's lack of state income tax and overall lower taxes. He also cited the close-knit community, entertainment options and weather as reasons for relocating.\n\nCain said he was tired of California politics and encouraged other celebrities to consider moving to Nevada.\n\nIs Nevada a sanctuary state?\n\nOn Aug. 5, the same day Cain posted his ICE recruitment video on X, the Department of Justice labeled Nevada a sanctuary state. It was one of a few Republican-led states included on the list, along with Vermont.\n\nHowever, the reasons for Nevada’s inclusion remain unclear and have drawn pushback from both Republican and Democratic state leaders.\n\nWhat is a sanctuary state?\n\nA sanctuary state is one that limits how much local and state agencies cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n\nIs there an age limit to join ICE?\n\nBefore the change, X user @BillHillyFarmer pointed out in Cain’s ICE recruitment post that the agency’s age limit was 37, to which Cain replied, “Perhaps we’ll get that changed…”\n\nOn Aug. 6, ICE lifted its age limit to allow anyone older than 18 to join. After Congress approved nearly $30 billion in funding, ICE is aiming to bolster its enforcement and removal efforts, including hiring thousands of new agents. The agency had roughly 6,000 deportation agents on staff at the close of the Biden administration.

About a quarter of those working in long-term care are born outside the country.\n\n“To be honest we just don’t have a lot of folks lining up for these jobs because they’re hard,” she said. \"We need these folks that are working for us.”\n\nFor a decade, health care facilities had been designated as sensitive locations by the federal government, alongside places of worship and schools. That prevented Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, agents from taking enforcement actions there.\n\nPresident Donald Trump suspended those rules after taking office, as part of his pledge to undertake massive deportations of those who entered the country illegally. The administration has claimed to only be targeting criminals and the “worst of the worst,” but multiple news agencies have reported the majority of those being apprehended now do not have criminal records.\n\nAlthough there is not reliable data available, few long term care workers are believed to be undocumented due to the requirements imposed on facilities that accept government insurance.\n\nBut as arrests have ramped up and become less targeted, there is speculation that more foreign-born residents will avoid settings where they risk interacting with immigration agents. That could be troublesome for long-term care providers.\n\n“Most nursing homes have had a staffing crisis for many years,” said Rachel Prusynski, an assistant professor and researcher for the University of Washington Center for Health Workforce Studies. “The immigration crackdowns will make it worse.”\n\nThe Center for Health Workforce Studies and state Workforce Board have spent the last three years studying the long-term care workforce and developing policies to address the glaring gap for workers as the large Baby Boomer Generation reaches retirement age.\n\nAdults over 65 in Washington are expected to grow by 14% by 2030, according to a legislative report produced last year, more than double the state’s overall growth rate. More than half are expected to need some form of long-term care, putting an even greater demand on the industry.\n\n“Health policy and immigration policy are undoubtedly linked. There’s no way to separate the two,” Prusynski said. “People I don’t think realize how much our health system is buoyed by immigrants.”\n\nLong-term care providers have already been struggling to rebuild after the pandemic and find workers, said Patricia Hunter, Washington’s long-term care ombudsman and President of the National Association of State LTC Ombudsman Programs.\n\nLosing more staff could be consequential. Extensive vacancies can result in service delays, worse patient outcomes and decreased profitability for providers.\n\n“It’s not pretty out there at the end of the day,” Hunter said. “If you don’t have the right staffing levels, the person who suffers is the vulnerable adult.”\n\nResidents have concerns about Medicaid\n\nHunter, who is responsible for representing residents of long-term care facilities, said she has been hearing frequent concerns about Medicaid benefits, which were slashed by the so-called One Big Beautiful bill that was passed last month by Republicans in Congress.\n\nMedicaid, the state-federal insurance program for Americans with disabilities or low incomes, is expected to see nearly a $1 trillion reduction over the next decade.\n\nCuts would come specifically from the Medicaid expansion population, those who received benefits under the Obama-administration’s Affordable Care Act, said Matti-Jackson, the association CEO. The traditional Medicaid population, which includes the majority of those served by long-term care providers, would not see direct impacts,\n\nThey could though experience adverse consequences from reductions to the system at-large. The state, for example, could reduce payments to long term-care to balance the fallout from the federal bill, she said.\n\nAnother issue is older adults who need hospital care prior to coming to an assisted living or skilled nursing facility will likely see worse access. The decline in Medicaid is expected to drive more uninsured patients to the emergency room for minor issues.\n\n“We're just causing a bigger surge in impact on an already backlogged hospital system,” Matti-Jackson said. “That impacts our seniors ability to get in there and get the care that they need before they come to assisted living or skilled nursing facilities.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/22/house-passes-trump-bill-congress/83747173007/", "title": "Trump's deficit-swelling tax bill passes House vote", "text": "The Trump-backed bill is expected to add more than $3 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.\n\nIf the bill becomes law, more than 7 million people will lose Medicaid coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe bill includes temporary tax breaks for tipped wages and overtime.\n\nAnd the proposal includes $140 billion for mass deportations and immigration enforcement.\n\nWASHINGTON – Americans could see major changes to Medicaid, food stamps, border security and taxes under a sweeping Republican bill that passed the U.S. House early on May 22.\n\nThe proposal, which President Donald Trump has dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill,\" would enact Trump's major campaign promises like eliminating taxes on workers' tips and overtime and is likely to be one of the most significant pieces of legislation that will be passed during his second term in the Oval Office.\n\nIt passed the House 215-214, with all Democrats and two Republicans - Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio - voting against it after a marathon all-night debate. Republicans had only three 'no' votes to spare in the closely-divided House.\n\nAs recently as May 20, it wasn't clear House Republicans would be able to get the bill endorsed by Trump across the finish line.\n\nA handful of Republicans from primarily Democratic states were holding out on raising a tax deduction cap that would benefit their constituents, while fiscal conservatives remained concerned about the cost of the legislation, which is expected to add around $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. The tax plan has rattled stock markets in recent days as investors worry about the ballooning debt.\n\nTrump met personally with the GOP conference that morning, urging them to stop pushing for more changes and get behind the bill. \"Failure is simply not an option,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, said after the meeting.\n\nHouse vote count on Trump tax bill\n\nAfter several marathon days of negotiations, including a May 21 meeting at the Trump White House, Republican leadership made additional changes and enough lawmakers came on board to pass it.\n\n\"What we're going to do here this morning is truly historic, and it will make all the difference in the daily lives of hard working Americans,\" Johnson said in a floor speech shortly before the bill passed.\n\nApart from Massie and Davidson, three other Republicans did not vote in support of the legislation. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland, voted present, which would have effectively been an opposition vote if the rest of the lawmakers had tied. Harris is the chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, which sought greater cuts in spending in the package.\n\nReps. David Schweikert of Arizona and Andrew Gabarino of New York missed the vote entirely.\n\nDemocrats have slammed the bill as a giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of people who benefit from social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP.\n\n\"This is one big, ugly bill that House Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people under the cover of darkness,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, said on the House floor in an early morning speech before the final vote.\n\nStill, it has a long way to go before it becomes law. The bill will next go to the Senate, which has already made clear that it plans to make changes. If that happens, the two chambers would still have to hash out the details capable of winning majority votes before they can send it to Trump's desk to be signed into law.\n\nThe clock is ticking: Treasury Sec. Scott Bessent warned that the U.S. is likely to hit the debt ceiling in August, and urged lawmakers to finalize the package – which raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion – before leaving for their summer recess at the end of July.\n\nTrump urges Senate to act swiftly on bill\n\nTrump commended the House passage of the legislation and urged quick Senate action by highlighting priorities such as no taxes on tips, overtime or interest on loans for American-made cars.\n\nHe also cited tougher border security measures such as pay raises for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents.\n\nTrump chided Democrats for opposing the measure and supporting “Open Borders” and transgender participants in women’s sports.\n\n“Now, it’s time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!” Trump said in a social media post. “There is no time to waste.”\n\nWhat is in the bill?\n\nThe sweeping House bill is expected to touch many corners of American life, from their wallets and healthcare to the southern border and the national debt.\n\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered income tax rates for all income groups but disproportionately benefitted the highest earners, is set to expire at the end of 2025. The bill would make those tax rates permanent at an expected cost of more than $2 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\nNo taxes on tips and overtime\n\nThe bill would also implement temporary tax breaks for tipped wages and overtime, create a new temporary deduction for the interest on loans for American-made cars, and create a new tax deduction for people over age 65. Children under 8 years old could also benefit from a new \"Trump\" savings account seeded with $1,000 from the federal government.\n\n7.6 million would lose Medicaid\n\nMedicaid, the program that provides health insurance to more than 71 million low-income Americans, would undergo big changes. That includes new work requirements for adults enrolled in Medicaid expansion beginning in December of 2026, more frequent eligibility checks, and disincentives for states to cover unauthorized migrant children, among other provisions.\n\nCollectively, the Medicaid proposal would save at least $625 billion and cause 7.6 million Americans to lose their health insurance over the next 10 years, according to initial estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nTrump warned Republicans who wanted to squeeze additional changes out of the health insurance program, telling them \"Don't f‒‒‒ around with Medicaid,\" at a May 20 meeting.\n\nThe proposal would also implement new requirements in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, which provides assistance to around 42 million Americans. That would save up to $300 billion over the next ten years and shift more of the cost of the program to states.\n\nBig spending on border security, missile defense\n\nThe bill would put more than $140 billion toward Trump's plan to crack down on illegal immigration, including $50 billion for a border wall, $45 billion for detention centers, $8 billion for immigration officers and $14 billion for deportations.\n\nIt would also put around $150 billion toward defense spending, including $20 billion that would go, in part, to creating a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system that Trump has promoted.\n\nBlue state tax benefits, green energy, vouchers\n\nResidents of high-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey making under $500,000 will be able to claim a deduction of up to $40,000 on their federal returns for taxes paid to their state and local governments – which those holdout lawmakers pushed up from the initially-proposed $30,000. Right now, the cap on that deduction is $10,000.\n\nThe bill would eliminate several green energy provisions passed under former President Joe Biden, such as tax credits for electric vehicles and renewable energy, and would accelerate permitting for fossil fuel projects.\n\nFamilies could use new vouchers collectively worth billions dollars for education outside of public schools, such as for private schools, parochial schools or homeschooling. Meanwhile, private universities could face new taxes for large endowments.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen\n\n(This story has been updated with more information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/12/18/undocumented-immigrants-and-their-kids-anxious-trump-presidency/94312124/", "title": "Undocumented immigrants and their kids anxious about Trump ...", "text": "Niraj Warikoo, Detroit Free Press\n\nThere are up to 127,000 undocumented immigrants in Michigan, many of them anxious about Trump\n\nGroups in metro Detroit are mobilizing to educate and protect immigrants under a Trump presidency\n\nLatino immigrants and even residents who are born in the U.S. fear increased racial profiling\n\nSitting in the foyer of his home on Detroit's west side, Sergio Martinez worries about his future.\n\nBorn in Mexico, Martinez has temporary permission to stay and work in the U.S. under a program for children of undocumented immigrants, but he fears that could be rescinded under the presidency of Donald Trump as part of a broader crackdown on immigration.\n\n\"It's nerve-racking, to say the least,\" Martinez, 28, said on a recent Tuesday afternoon, a painting of Detroit's skyline that reads \"Nothing Stops Detroit\" hanging on the wall behind him. \"The undocumented community ... are scared to death right now about what this means for their families, what this means for their children at school.\"\n\nThe uncertainty of what may happen is weighing heavily on the minds of many undocumented immigrants in Michigan, who experts say are an integral part of the economy and life of many communities across the state.

The number has decreased from a peak of 150,000 a few years ago. About half of them are from Latin countries, with 40% from Mexico and 35% from Asian countries such as India, Iraq and China.\n\nAbout 6,700 in Michigan (750,000 total nationwide) are young immigrants like Martinez, born to undocumented immigrants and known as DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients who can temporarily work or study and not be deported. A study released last summer by the Partnership for a New American Economy said undocumented immigrants in Michigan are vital to the economy, paying $83 million in local and state taxes and $178 million in federal taxes.\n\nMartinez, who works as a general manager in restaurants, would like to stay in the city and help it grow but is not sure if he has a future there.\n\n\"It's still really surreal,\" Martinez said of possible changes under a Trump administration. \"I still cannot believe it.

His sometimes-conflicting remarks have led to confusion for many.\n\nTrump said he will deport \"just the bad ones,\" said Ryan Bates, director of Michigan United, an advocacy group based in Detroit. \"But we know that's not true. There aren't 3 million criminals to deport and further, we reject the notion that you can slice and dice communities into good immigrants and bad immigrants.\n\n\"Mass deportations and roundups that break apart families are inhumane, are un-American, are a moral monstrosity and an economic calamity, and we’re going to fight it every inch of the way.\"\n\nBut conservative groups that want to curb immigration, such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) — founded by John Tanton of Michigan — are urging Trump to undo President Barack Obama's approval of DACA and to crack down harder on immigration, both illegal and legal. Tanton, a retired ophthalmologist​ in Petoskey, is the \"architect of the modern anti-immigration movement,\" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\"Illegal immigration and unchecked legal immigration are detrimental to the quality of life in the United States,\" FAIR said in a report on immigration priorities released after Trump was elected. \"The American family is increasingly bearing the costs of urban sprawl, environmental degradation, traffic congestion, increased crime, overburdened health care, overwhelmed public schools and debt-ridden state and municipal governments — all results of uncontrolled immigration.\"\n\nThe city of Detroit has a more positive view of immigrants, calling itself a \"welcoming city\" and citing a 2007 law that prohibits local police from profiling based on immigration status. But it's stopping short of calling itself a \"sanctuary city.\" Trump said during the campaign he would slash aid to what he called \"sanctuary\" cities that allow undocumented immigrants.\n\nDebate over immigrants\n\nImmigrant advocates said that mass deportations could disrupt businesses across Michigan and lead to population losses; Michigan is the only state in the U.S. to have lost population over the past 15 years and has struggled to attract newcomers.\n\nThe report by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a coalition of 500 mayors and business leaders, said that undocumented immigrants in Michigan \"contribute to a range of industries that could not thrive without a pool of workers willing to take on highly labor-intensive roles.\"\n\nMore than 7% of all workers in Michigan's farm industry are undocumented, 6% of all employees in the accommodation and food services industry are undocumented, as are 3% of all manufacturing workers, the report said. About 40% of Michigan's undocumented immigrants own their homes, and 5,100 undocumented immigrants are self-employed. In 2014, they contributed about $158 million to Social Security through taxes on their individual wages.\n\nA separate report released in 2013 by the liberal group Center for American Progress said legalizing undocumented immigrants would create a $10 billion increase in gross state product in Michigan, with a half a billion increase in taxes from undocumented immigrants in Michigan.\n\nBut the conservative group FAIR said in a 2011 report that Michigan is harmed by undocumented immigrants; it says they cost taxpayers in the state about $897 million in 2010, including $377 in education costs and $143 million in public assistance.\n\nLegal immigration also could be at stake as Trump during his campaign talked of reducing the number of immigrants who should be allowed into the country.\n\nMany businesses in metro Detroit rely on high-skilled labor from legal immigrants.\n\nForeign students contribute more than $1 billion to Michigan's economy, making up 40% to 70% of graduate students in fields involving science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM fields, said Steve Tobocman, a former state representative from southwest Detroit who now heads the immigrant advocacy group Global Detroit.\n\n\"One can only imagine how talented, entrepreneurial and hard-working folks across the world will be impacted about their desires to pursue the American dream after an election that many believe was swayed by anti-immigrant rhetoric,\" Tobocman said.\n\nMartinez came to the U.S. in 1993 with his father when he was 5 years old. His father overstayed a visa, making him and Martinez illegal residents. His father worked hard, but his inability to get a driver's license stunted his growth and they lost a couple of homes he once owed.\n\nMartinez graduated from high school in Detroit and now manages some restaurants in metro Detroit. He had thought of opening his own business a couple of years ago, but the lack of legal identification prevented him.\n\n\"Immigrants from all over are entrepreneurial by nature because they open their own businesses,\" Martinez said. \"If you look at how much they can contribute, it doesn't make sense why you want to deport them.\"\n\nThe city of Detroit, which is losing population, needs all the residents it can get, Martinez said. The block he lives on near I-96 is dilapidated, with burnt-out buildings.\n\n\"Here in Detroit, we have so many vacant properties, and you'd rather deport people in your neighborhood than give them the opportunity to invest in the city, or open businesses in the city? Come on.\"\n\nDetroit's reaction to Trump\n\nHow Trump's administration will deal with immigration is unclear. Some of his picks for cabinet positions have hard-line views on immigration. But at times, Trump has softened some of his views on immigrants.\n\nScott Hagerstrom, who directed Trump's campaign in Michigan, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn cities like New York City and San Francisco, mayors have held news conferences in recent weeks, saying their cities will be sanctuaries under a Trump administration, a status that prevents local officials from enforcing federal immigration laws. Detroit officials say the city is open to all, but isn't a sanctuary in the way Trump defines it.\n\nIn 2007, the city passed a law that prohibits profiling by police by immigration statues and other categories such as race and ethnicity. The law also said that police can't ask about a person's immigration status unless officers are helping federal law enforcement investigating a crime or when arresting someone. The law helps make it easier for victims of crime or witnesses who might be undocumented to come forward to police, say immigrant advocates.\n\n\"As clearly stated in our city ordinance, Detroit police officers do not try to act as immigration officers and don't profile or investigate anyone for the purpose of determining their immigration status,\" Alexis Wiley, the chief of staff to Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, told the Free Press. \"What we do is to treat all people equally. If any person, regardless of their immigration status, is being investigated by federal authorities regarding a specific crime, our officers will cooperate with that investigation.\"\n\n\"The mayor has always made it clear that Detroit is a welcoming city for all people,\" Wiley said. \"That has not changed.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Duggan and other city officials kicked off a municipal ID program, which allows undocumented immigrants, and others, to get a Detroit ID. The lack of identification, like a driver's license, has been a challenge for many undocumented immigrants.\n\nCity Councilwoman Raquel Castañeda-López, who introduced the legislation to establish the municipal ID, echoed Wiley's views, saying that Detroit \"remains behind its commitment 150% that we are a welcoming city. We are committed to be diverse, global and inclusive.\"\n\nAt the same time, Detroit police can work with federal officials in criminal investigations, she said.\n\n\"Detroit is not a sanctuary city in terms of how Trump is defining it: We don't withhold information from federal officials,\" Castañeda-López said. \"However, we are a sanctuary city in that we won't profile people or ask their immigration status.\"\n\nOne concern that advocates say some undocumented immigrants have is that information they give to authorities for ID programs could be used later by federal officials to identify them for deportation.\n\n'Know your rights'\n\nLocal advocacy groups and others have vowed to defend the rights of immigrants and have held workshops in southwest Detroit in recent weeks educating them and offering assistance.\n\nThe Michigan Immigrant Rights Center is organizing attorneys and volunteers to provide pro bono representation for immigrants placed in deportation proceedings.\n\n\"We’ll make sure that you have training to represent individuals in immigration courts and hopefully stave deportations for hopefully fewer people than we can imagine and to keep families together, to keep communities together,\" Ruby Robinson, supervising attorney with the center, told a crowd last month at Central United Methodist Church in Detroit.\n\nAt the gathering, the church's former pastor, the Rev. Ed Rowe, called for churches to be sanctuaries for immigrants who may face deportation.\n\nThe Mexican Consul in Detroit, Juan Manuel Solana Morales, is telling Michigan's 320,000 Mexican-American residents to stay calm, releasing a video in Spanish that says: \"You are not alone. We are with you\" and offering help and a warning not to fall prey to immigration scams from unscrupulous people.\n\nThe efforts come amid an increase in hate incidents in Michigan, many of them targeting Latinos, according to state officials. In southwest Detroit, fliers from a white supremacist group have appeared in recent weeks with the headline \"Help Enforce the Law and Make America Great Again!\" They tell the public to report illegal immigrants by calling the listed phone numbers of immigration agencies, reading below: \"All of the above will be working for President Trump!\"\n\n\"The fliers are intended to strike fear into immigrant communities,\" said Adam Thibodeau, an organizer with Congress of Communities in Southwest Detroit, which works with young residents. \"The youth I work with are very disturbed, and tensions are high.\"\n\nOn a Saturday last month at Hope of Detroit Academy — where some students cried in fear the day after Trump was elected — Michigan United held a workshop to educate the public.\n\n\"Usted tiene derechos (You have rights),\" community organizer Adonis Flores, 28, told the crowd.\n\nOn a wall behind him, Flores scrawled in Spanish on posters lists of sanctuary places where immigrants could turn to in case of raids by the federal agency ICE (Immigration Customs Enforcement): churches, schools, universities, hospitals, some cities.\n\nAnother poster listed things to do: Know your rights, emergency plans, prepare important documents.\n\nLike Martinez, Flores is the son of an undocumented immigrant and a DACA recipient worried about his future.\n\nBut he's mobilizing to help others, telling the immigrants: \"I understand you're nervous.\"\n\nImmigrant fears\n\nOne of the attendees was a 45-year-old mother of four who's an undocumented immigrant living in Detroit. She spoke to the Free Press through a translator, asking her name not be used.\n\nShe immigrated from Mexico to the U.S. in 1996, and moved moving to Detroit 15 years ago. Like many other undocumented immigrants, she found work locally in a variety of places: small factories, restaurants, hotels, cleaning offices, greenhouses or nurseries.\n\nShe has four children: a 23-year-old son born in Mexico who's a DACA recipient, 18-year-old daughter at Michigan State University, and two young boys, ages 7 and 4.\n\nWhen she found out that Trump was elected, \"I cried,\" she said. \"Uncontrollably.\"\n\n\"It's very worrisome and sad,\" she added, wiping away tears. \"All the hopes we had for the future, it's like the world coming down with all of this. ... A lot of immigrants feel this way.\"\n\nSeparated from her husband four years ago, she worries their family will be broken up and that her oldest son, who acts as a father figure for her younger children, could be forced to leave along with her if DACA ends.\n\n\"When the new administration comes, what's going to happen to DACA?\" she asked. \"We're in this period of uncertainty where we don't know what actions he's going to take. They have all of our children's information.\"\n\nDiego Bonesatti, director of legal services at Michigan United, said he has been hearing similar stories since the election.\n\n\"They're all shocked that he won the election, so they're worried what he's going to do. Is there going to be storm troopers at the house? ... Some people are wanting to step up and get involved in the fight, and there's also some who are on the edge. They're not sure whether to stick around.\"\n\nAdvocates worry there will be a return to raids of schools, churches and other places that happened a few years ago in Michigan. In 2011, agents with ICE raided parents dropping off children at Hope of Detroit academy, an action that its officials later said appeared to have been inconsistent with its policies of not targeting schools.\n\nA spokesman for the ICE office in Detroit, Khaalid Walls said: “We will decline to speculate about the polices of the incoming administration. ICE currently focuses its enforcement efforts on individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety or border security.”\n\nEven those who are legal immigrants and U.S.-born citizens have expressed concerns over the years about being profiled and stopped by federal immigration agents. They fear the problem may get worse.\n\n\"People are worried about increased harassment, of racial harassment because of profiling,\" said Sally Kim, with United Hispanic Workers of Detroit. Earlier this month, the group held a packed information session for immigrants at El Nacimiento restaurant in Detroit.\n\nFor immigrants like Martinez, now is the time to stand up, saying it's important for diverse groups to stick together. In a room of his home hangs the multicolored flag representing the LGBT community, of which he is a part.\n\n\"I'm prepared to chain myself in front of a deportation bus to stop a deportation,\" Martinez said. \"I'm prepared to do anything that isn't violent. ... I'm approaching 30-years-old, and I've been living in the shadows for too long.\"\n\nContact Niraj Warikoo: nwarikoo@freepress.com or 313-223-4792.

This is “the moment for every Conservative to come together and back the new leader wholeheartedly”, he wrote.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nNicknamed “Teflon” for his ability to emerge unscathed from scandals that would sink most other politicians, Johnson’s time in No. 10 has been dominated by Brexit, Covid and scandals. Here are the highs and lows of his tumultuous premiership:\n\n24 July 2019: Johnson assumes office\n\nAfter becoming prime minister just over three years ago, Johnson promised to defy “the doubters, the doomsters and the gloomsters” by delivering Brexit within 99 days.\n\nIn a speech outside 10 Downing Street that was “infused with patriotic pronouncements”, said The Guardian, Johnson declared that “people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts”. Following three years of “unfounded self-doubt”, the PM said, it was “time to change the record”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nBrexit “broke” Theresa May, wrote Alan McGuinness for Sky News, but Johnson’s “unique blend of rhetoric and optimism” was “the perfect tonic for a party that wants to feel good about itself again”.\n\n3 September 2019: he loses his majority\n\nJohnson faced a major showdown with his own MPs as they sought to block the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe “opening gambit” in an “acrimonious” debate was the defection of Phillip Lee, a Conservative MP who crossed the floor to join the benches of the Liberal Democrats as the prime minister addressed the Commons, reported Politico. He accused the government of using “political manipulation, bullying and lies” to push through its plans on Brexit.\n\nJohnson later removed the whip from 21 rebel Tories for voting against the government. The rebels included Ken Clarke, an MP since 1970, and Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill.\n\n13 December 2019: a general election victory\n\nAfter forcing an election over the Commons stalemate on Brexit, Johnson secured a “crushing victory” as voters backed his pledge to “get Brexit done”, reported The Guardian.\n\nThe Conservatives won 364 of the 650 seats up for grabs, in what the paper noted was “the party’s best showing in a parliamentary election since Margaret Thatcher triumphed in 1987”.\n\nEqually “astonishing” were the crushing defeats in the historic Labour heartlands, said the BBC’s political correspondent Nick Eardley. “Labour, by contrast, could hardly be in a worse position,” Eardley wrote.\n\n7 April 2020: Johnson is admitted to intensive care with Covid-19\n\nJust four months after his election victory high, in what The New York Times described as a “cruel reversal” of fortunes, the PM was admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 – the first major world leader reported to have contracted the virus.\n\nThe then foreign secretary Dominic Raab deputised throughout Johnson’s illness, which briefly “plunged the country back into the uncertainty Britons thought they had left behind” after so recently emerging from the “paralysis and polarisation” of Brexit, said the paper.\n\nIn an interview with The Sun on Sunday, the PM later revealed that he needed “litres and litres” of oxygen during his three-day stay in St Thomas’ intensive care unit in London, and that it was “50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe”.\n\n13 November 2020: Dominic Cummings resigns\n\nDominic Cummings “was seen leaving No. 10 a short while ago carrying a box”, reported the BBC, as Johnson’s closest adviser and key ally quit following a dispute that also triggered the resignation of communications director Lee Cain.\n\nTheir departures would “mark the end of the Vote Leave clique’s iron grip on government”, said the Daily Mail. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg described Cummings’ exit as “a political explosion”.\n\nAlthough Cummings would frame his departure as part of a long-term master plan, insiders told the BBC’s political editor that he “jumped because otherwise he would be pushed soon”. Johnson had recently come to see that his former aide’s band of “Brexit Boys” were just “in it for themselves”, the source claimed.\n\n8 December 2020: vaccination programme begins to roll out\n\nOne of the biggest successes for Johnson and his government was the UK’s Covid-19 vaccination programme. Indeed, “Britain soared ahead of every comparable country in the weeks after the vaccines became available, with the one exception being Israel”, said Hugo Gye of the i news site.\n\nBut criticism was not far behind. “Global leadership is an unaccustomed status for a country with one of the highest rates of excess deaths in western Europe,” said the Financial Times. “Multiple missteps”, such as the much-maligned NHS Track and Trace system, meant that “cynicism” remained over the government’s handling of the pandemic, the paper reported.\n\n21 December 2020: Christmas is ‘cancelled’\n\nThe hopes of a Christmas with loved ones were “dashed” for almost 20 million people after Johnson placed London and large parts of the southeast under “draconian” Tier-4 coronavirus restrictions, said PoliticsHome.\n\nJohnson had previously promised that Britons would be allowed to form “bubbles” with two other households over the Christmas period.\n\n“I want to be clear, we don’t want to ban Christmas,” Johnson told a press conference on 16 December. “And I think that would be frankly inhuman and against the instincts of many people in this country.”\n\nBut a few days later, families were told they could not mix after all.\n\n29 May 2021: Johnson marries fiancée Carrie Symonds\n\nAfter a turbulent year, Johnson married Carrie Symonds in a secretly planned Catholic ceremony at Westminster Cathedral.\n\nOnly 30 people attended the Covid-compliant wedding, as Johnson became the first PM to marry in office for “nearly 200 years”, the BBC reported.\n\nSome “disgruntled” congregants questioned how “the twice-divorced prime minister was able to marry in a Catholic church”, said The Telegraph.\n\n19 July 2021: England’s ‘Freedom Day’\n\nAs England prepared for all social distancing rules to be lifted on what some newspapers dubbed “Freedom Day”, both Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were accused of trying to “dodge” self-isolation rules, after being in close contact with health secretary Sajid Javid, who had tested positive for coronavirus, reported the BBC.\n\nNo. 10 initially said that Johnson and Sunak would not isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involved daily testing. But the duo were forced to “perform a full reversal little more than two-and-a-half hours” later, amid widespread anger as opposition parties suggested there was “one rule for them and one for the rest of us”, reported Sky News.\n\n30 November 2021: Partygate allegations\n\nThe first allegations that Boris Johnson and Downing Street staff might have broken the government’s own Covid rules by holding parties and events during the 2020 Christmas holidays were reported by the Mirror.\n\nThe paper said that at least two parties had taken place. The PM was reported to have given a speech at a “packed leaving do” for a senior aide. And at a second event, while the rest of the country was locked down at home, officials were said to have “knocked back glasses of wine during a Christmas quiz and a Secret Santa”.\n\nDowning Street did not deny that the events had taken place, but a spokesperson insisted that “Covid rules have been followed at all times”.\n\nHowever, in a hint that further damaging revelations were to follow, a source told the Mirror that there had been “many social gatherings” in Downing Street over the holiday season.\n\n25 January 2022: Scotland Yard launches probe\n\nThe Metropolitan Police launched an official investigation into alleged Covid rule-breaking by lawmakers and officials, following a string of damaging revelations in the press and an internal government investigation conducted by top civil servant Sue Gray.\n\nNamed Operation Hillman, the police probe focused on 12 alleged incidents on eight dates between May 2020 and April 2021, and examined more than 500 documents and 300 photographs gathered by the Gray investigation.\n\nThe force sent more than 100 questionnaires to those suspected of attending parties at Downing Street and Whitehall, including Johnson, that asked for “an account and explanation of the recipient’s participation”. According to the Mirror, Johnson was thought to have attended at least seven of the parties investigated by the Met.\n\n9 April 2022: Johnson visits Ukraine\n\nIn what No. 10 called a “show of solidarity” with Ukraine amid the Russian invasion, Johnson made an unannounced visit to Kyiv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nJohnson paid tribute to “Zelenskyy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people”, adding that “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv”.\n\n“I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run,” the PM said. “We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation.”\n\nJohnson pledged new lethal aid to Ukraine in the form of “120 armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems”, as well as further economic support for the embattled nation, “taking total UK loan guarantees to £770m”, the BBC reported.\n\nIn a televised statement, he said that Ukrainians had shown “the courage of a lion” and that their president had “given the roar of that lion”.\n\n12 April 2022: fined over lockdown parties\n\nJohnson became “the first sitting prime minister to be criminally sanctioned” after the Met issued him with a £50 fixed penalty notice for attending a party for his birthday at No. 10 in June 2020, reported The Guardian.\n\nHis wife was also fined for attending the surprise birthday party, as was Rishi Sunak.\n\nAfter Gray’s long-awaited report was published in May, pressure from within the Conservative Party grew on Johnson, with a “drip feed of no confidence letters” being sent to Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 committee, along with senior Tory MPs publicly calling for the PM to go.\n\n“Veteran Tory” Bob Neill, chairman of the Commons Justice Committee, added his name to that list, “saying he did not regard the PM’s explanations as ‘credible’”, reported Sky News.\n\n6 June 2022: narrowly wins confidence vote\n\nMounting dissatisfaction with Johnson finally boiled over in June when the necessary threshold of Tory MPs submitted letters to the 1922 committee withdrawing their support for the prime minister, triggering a confidence vote.\n\nIn the end, a majority of Tory MPs backed the prime minister. But the margin of victory – 211 votes for to 148 against – was much closer than many had expected.\n\nDespite Johnson describing the vote win as “decisive” and “an opportunity to put behind us all the stuff that the media goes on about”, the BBC said: “The scale of the rebellion against him showed his authority had been weakened.”\n\nNoting the vote share in support of Johnson was lower than the 63% received by former prime minister Theresa May when she won a party confidence vote in 2018 before resigning six months later over a Brexit deadlock, the BBC’s political editor Chris Mason said: “The simple truth is when more than four in ten of your own MPs think the country would be better off without you, you have a problem.”\n\nNevertheless, under existing Tory party rules, the win meant Johnson was immune from a Conservative leadership challenge for a year.\n\n15 June 2022: ethics adviser quits\n\nA week after the confidence vote, Lord Geidt, Johnson’s ethics adviser, quit, saying he had been put in an “impossible and odious position”.\n\nGeidt had threatened to quit the previous month after concluding that there were “legitimate” questions about whether the prime minister broke the ministerial code over the lockdown parties scandal in Downing Street.\n\n30 June: the Chris Pincher affair\n\nWhat started off as a sexual harassment story featuring yet another Tory MP in the end proved to be the final nail in the coffin of Johnson’s political career.\n\nChris Pincher, the MP for Tamworth and the deputy chief whip, resigned from the government on 1 July and was suspended from the Conservative Party a day later in the wake of allegations that he groped two men in the private members’ Carlton Club.\n\nYet as more historic allegations emerged, Johnson was accused of ignoring warnings of inappropriate behaviour by Pincher before appointing him to the role of deputy chief whip in February 2022.\n\n“Under mounting pressure to reveal what he knew” before appointing him to the whips’ office, which oversees discipline within the party, Johnson and his aides repeatedly obfuscated and changed their story, said the BBC.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News’ Kay Burley, education minister Will Quince said he had been given “categorical assurance” from No. 10 that Johnson was “not aware of any serious specific allegations” against Pincher when he was appointed. But within hours, the prime minister’s official spokesman admitted that Johnson had been “aware of media reports that others had seen over the years”.\n\nIn an attempt to put an end to the growing furore Johnson issued a full apology in an interview with the BBC’s Chris Mason but it was too late, with senior cabinet ministers Javid and Sunak announcing their resignations as the interview aired.\n\n7 July: he announces his resignation\n\nJavid’s decision to quit as health secretary on 5 July triggered the deluge of resignations that ultimately toppled Johnson.\n\nIn a seismic 48 hours in Westminster, more than 50 ministers followed Javid in protest at Johnson’s decision to remain in Downing Street.\n\nHaving initially sought to stem the tide by quickly appointing replacements to the cabinet, by the morning of 7 July the game was up after it became clear he had lost the support of almost all his MPs and a flurry of junior ministerial resignations left his government struggling to function.\n\nAnnouncing his resignation outside No. 10 surrounded by his family and closest aides, Johnson delivered what politics lecturer Paula Keaveney described on The Conversation as “a bitter resignation speech” that “was followed by objections over its tone and led to calls for him to depart straight away rather than staying on until his successor is appointed”.\n\n6 September: he finally stands down as PM\n\nHaving taken the dramatic step of calling – and winning - a confidence vote in his own government in the days after his resignation announcement Johnson was able to stay on in No. 10 while a new leader was chosen.\n\nDespite the UK being in the grips of a cost-of-living crisis, the outgoing prime minister was accused of shirking his responsibilities and leading a “zombie government” by his critics, a view not helped by his decision to take numerous holidays abroad over the summer.\n\nHe departed Downing Street with the threat of an ongoing Commons inquiry into whether he deliberately misled Parliament still hanging over him.\n\nYet even with the threat of losing his Uxbridge seat and the unceremonious way he was thrown out by his own MPs, many, including perhaps Johnson himself, see this not as the end but merely a prelude to a second act.\n\n“When it comes to Johnson’s numerous misdemeanours, Conservatives seem eager to forgive and forget as soon as possible, with many not seeming to think there is anything to forgive,” said Prospect.\n\nJohnson suggested as much with his final PMQs, signing off with the phrase “Hasta la vista, baby”.\n\nGiven his extraordinary political career it would be foolish to write off such a dramatic return completely.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/23"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/954497/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-19-october-2021", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 19 October 2021 | The Week", "text": "1. Covid-19 cases near 50,000\n\nDowning Street has warned of “challenging” months ahead as the country’s daily Covid-19 cases near 50,000. The reported number of Covid cases reached 49,156 on Monday, the highest number of daily infections since 17 July and a 16% rise in new cases over the past week. Hospitalisations and deaths are also increasing, according to government data. The number of people dying within 28 days of testing positive reached 869 over the past seven days, up 11.4% on the week before. A No. 10 spokesperson said “we always knew the coming months would be challenging”, adding that the government would keep a “close watch” on the statistics.\n\nWhy does the UK have highest Covid case rate in western Europe?\n\n2. North Korea test fires missile\n\nNorth Korea has fired at least one ballistic missile into waters off the coast of Japan, according to South Korea and Japan. In recent weeks, nuclear-armed North Korea has tested a long-range cruise missile, a train-launched weapon and a missile described as a “hypersonic warhead”. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said that it was “regrettable” that North Korea had conducted the string of missile tests.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Adverts to back boosters\n\nAn advert campaign is being launched to urge older people to get a Covid booster jab as experts warn that the rollout has yet to reach millions who need a top-up. Radio and television slots will urge people to go for both their booster and flu vaccines to avoid overwhelming hospitals in the months ahead. People over 50 can get boosters six months after their second dose. According to NHS England, 3.7m of the 6.4m eligible have so far been vaccinated.\n\nWhich Covid-19 vaccine works best as a booster jab?\n\n4. Suspended MPs to face by-election\n\nMPs would face by-elections if they are suspended for sexual harassment or bullying under a government plan to be debated in the Commons today. It follows a controversy over Rob Roberts, a former Tory MP who was suspended from parliament for six weeks in May for sexual misconduct. Labour said the planned measures should also apply retrospectively, however, the government is expected to vote against the opposition amendment.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nConservatives to investigate MP who ‘invited 21-year-old intern to fool around’\n\n5. Pump grants for homeowners\n\nHomeowners are to be offered subsidies of £5,000 to help them replace old gas boilers with low carbon heat pumps. The BBC said the grants, due to be rolled out in April, are part of the government’s £3.9bn plan to reduce carbon emissions from heating homes and other buildings. The investment also aims to make social housing and public buildings more energy efficient.

Trump sues to keep presidency secret\n\nDonald Trump has filed a lawsuit in a DC District Court in a bid to keep records from his presidency secret by claiming executive privilege. The lawsuit from the former US president is an attempt to block the work of a select committee as it investigates his actions before and during the siege of the Capitol. The document claims that the House’s requests for documents from the executive branch “are unprecedented in their breadth and scope and are untethered from any legitimate legislative purpose”.\n\nHave the Republicans ‘handed the party’ to Donald Trump ahead of 2024?\n\n7. Gates sent ‘flirty’ email to employee\n\nBill Gates was asked by Microsoft executives to stop sending “flirtatious” and “inappropriate” emails to a female employee before he left the software giant a decade ago, according to The Wall Street Journal. A Microsoft spokesperson said the “flirtatious” emails were “not overtly sexual”, adding that they were, however, deemed to be “inappropriate”. Bridgitt Arnold, chief communications officer at Gates Ventures, described the claims as “false, recycled rumours”.\n\nExplained: the links between Bill Gates and Jeffrey Epstein\n\n8. Gang behind Haiti kidnapping\n\nA gang is behind the kidnapping of a group of North American missionaries near Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, according to authorities. Five men, seven women and five children were returning from a visit to an orphanage when they were abducted on Saturday. Officials say they are being held by the 400 Mawozo gang, which was previously blamed for the kidnapping of Catholic clergy in April.\n\n400 Mawozo: the Haitian gang behind kidnapping of 17 American missionaries\n\n9. One-third of music workers lost jobs\n\nMore than a third of music industry workers in the UK lost their jobs last year as venues shut, festivals were cancelled, tours were scrapped and the pandemic wiped billions off the value of the sector. UK Music, the umbrella organisation representing the commercial music industry, said the value of the sector almost halved last year due to the economic impact of the pandemic.

Tributes to ‘remarkable’ Powell\n\nTributes have been paid to Colin Powell, the first black US secretary of state who made the case for the Iraq War at the UN, who has died from complications from Covid at the age of 84. The Republican’s family said “we have lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American”. Joe Biden said Powell embodied the “highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat”. George W. Bush described him as “a great public servant”. Powell “helped shape American foreign policy in the last years of the 20th century and the early years of the 21st”, CNN said.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/10/19"}]}

Businesses are relocating here. Top Chef launched its latest season in the city, complete with footage of the Milwaukee Public Market, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Hoan Bridge and other landmarks. And while Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much these days, they both decided to hold their conventions in Milwaukee in recent years – or at least try to.\n\nWe wanted to celebrate our great city by honoring some of the things we love about it. The trouble is, there’s so much to love about Milwaukee that it was tough to decide which objects to highlight. (We settled on 100 objects; a push to do 414 was quickly shot down by editors.)\n\nSome of the objects are stunningly beautiful, like the art museum’s wings and the Basilica of St. Josaphat dome. Others are delicious – like a Sobelman’s Bloody Mary, frozen custard and cheese curds. More than a few involve beer and sports, because of course they do. And we included some things that are just so Milwaukee – like racing sausages, Kohl’s Cash and “I Closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\nWe also know Milwaukee isn’t perfect and has long faced deep problems like racism, segregation and inequality. So we also wanted to focus on the struggle for a better future by including key locations in the city, such as the 16th Street Viaduct, in an effort to honor the fair housing marches of the 1960s.\n\nNext time somebody starts trashing Milwaukee, please tell them the city’s brightest days are still ahead. And maybe send them this list of 100 objects as a reminder that Milwaukee is indeed “the good land” full of promise – and some pretty great things.\n\n—Mary Spicuzza\n\n100 objects that make Milwaukee\n\nArchitecture\n\nCulture\n\nEntertainment\n\nEnvironment\n\nFood & drink\n\nHistory\n\nSports\n\nHow did we come up with these 100 objects? Here's an explanation.\n\nWhat did we miss? What doesn’t belong? Let us know here: bit.ly/MKE100More.\n\nThe Polish immigrants who poured into Milwaukee in the late 19th century wanted a beautiful church that telegraphed their strong Catholic faith and ethnic heritage. And they were willing to do anything for it.\n\nThey mortgaged their homes to raise money. They volunteered their labor. Fr. Wilhelm Grutza, the blacksmith-turned-pastor, shipped 500 rail cars of salvaged materials from a shuttered Chicago post office. He died five weeks after the church's dedication in 1901, exhausted from overwork.\n\nIn a city dotted with steeples and infused with Catholic tradition, the Basilica of St. Josaphat stood out. Modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, its 220-foot-high copper dome was only second in size to the U.S. Capitol at the time.\n\nToday, 123 years later, the ornate basilica is still larger-than-life. It’s a tourist destination as well as a hallowed space. The faithful who gather understand they’re among tens of thousands who have knelt in the pews for prayer, and heard the acoustics echo, and craned their necks to take in the intricately decorated cupola.\n\nIt’s Milwaukee’s largest church. It’s always been an anchor of the south side. But its dome – first illuminated at night in 2019 – cemented the basilica’s place in Milwaukee’s skyline for years to come.\n\nEven as church attendance and religious belief decline, the dome is a reminder of Catholics’ indelible impact on the city.\n\nIt calls to drivers passing on Interstate 43: I’ve been here over a century, and I’m here to stay.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nMilwaukee has a contentious history with public art (Google “Blue Shirt” if you need a reminder). Ensconced in O’Donnell Park at the lakefront, Mark di Suvero’s steel-beam sculpture “The Calling” has survived several rounds of controversy with the staying power of the sun that it abstractly mimics.\n\nFunded by an anonymous donor, it is made of steel I-beams painted orange and stands 40 feet tall. After 11 argumentative public hearings and much political grandstanding, the Common Council approved the artwork, which was dedicated in April 1982.\n\n“Di Suvero certainly was aware that many people would see his work from great distances and from the windows of rushing cars, buses and trucks,” Milwaukee Sentinel art critic Dean Jensen wrote in 1982. “Through its great size, its garish color and the grammar of its simple forms, it asserts its essence quickly and directly.”\n\n“The Calling” enjoyed a bonus kerfuffle in 2001 when architect Santiago Calatrava’s gleaming white addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum opened. Killjoys wanted the di Suvero away from the Calatrava sightline. The artist responded bluntly: “If you don’t want it, take it apart and ship it to me.”\n\nAs for the architect, he told Journal critic Whitney Gould that he designed the MAM addition with “The Calling” in mind. And if you stand along Wisconsin Avenue in the right spots, you’ll see that “The Calling” and the Calatrava addition line up perfectly.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of spring, when warmer weather finally thaws the winter roads. It’s the sound of the wind blowing across your face and through your hair. It’s the sound of speed, freedom, the open road. It’s the sound of summer, long rides cross-country or a short trip to the beach.\n\nIt’s the sound of friends William Harley and Arthur Davidson’s turn-of-the-20th-century ingenuity that grew from tinkering in a backyard shed to the construction of a two-wheeled, motor-powered bike and the desire to make it go fast, then faster. It’s the sound of a business born in 1903 and raised in Milwaukee, then taking off to become an internationally known brand. It’s the sound linked to leather, and the smell of gasoline. It’s the sound of putting the pedal to the metal.\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of a Harley.\n\n-Jessica Van Egeren\n\nJune 19, 1865, is the most crucial day in African American history. On that day, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and declared that the Civil War was over and all 250,000 enslaved people in the state — the last remaining slaves in the South — were now free, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn 1997, a flag was designed to commemorate Juneteenth and was later revised.\n\nThe flag features red, white, and blue colors — from the American flag — with a white bursting star of freedom in the middle. An arc runs through the flag’s center to symbolize the new horizon of opportunity for African Americans. The blue is above the red because the red represents the ground soaked with blood from all those who came before us and fought for freedom.\n\nMilwaukee’s annual Juneteenth celebration is one of the country’s oldest — the city was one of the first in the northern states to began officially celebrating Juneteenth, in 1971.\n\nJuneteenth and its flag are significant for me as an African American. My grandparents, who lived in Mississippi, referred to it as “Jubilee Day,” and they celebrated it by enjoying strawberry soda and red velvet cake that symbolized the blood shed by enslaved West African ancestors.\n\nThis flag should be flown on Juneteenth and every day in our country.\n\n-James E. Causey\n\nIf you live anywhere in the Milwaukee area, you’ve almost definitely seen an Oak Leaf Trail sign. The over 135-mile multi-use trail traverses throughout Milwaukee County and is beloved by cyclists, runners, walkers, birders, skateboarders, rollerbladers and more. It’s a mainstay in numerous local running races throughout the year.\n\nThe Oak Leaf can take you pretty much anywhere in Milwaukee and offers beautiful views; nearly a quarter travels along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The trail’s nine branch lines connect users to dozens of county parks, beer gardens and attractions in the area.\n\nThe Oak Leaf also intersects with various other municipal trails, allowing for travel beyond the county. The northern terminus connects to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which users can take all the way to Sheboygan County.\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine the Oak Leaf without its variety of users today, it was not open for non-cycling use (or given its current name) until 1996. The trail’s origins date back to the late 1930s, when local cycling enthusiasts established an about-65-mile bike route around Milwaukee County.\n\nThree decades later, the trail was officially recognized by the county parks department. In 1976, it was christened the “76 Bike Trail” in honor of the national bicentennial.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nFor more than 150 years, few objects have represented the city of Milwaukee better than a mug of beer – the key component of gemütlichkeit, which Milwaukeeans have pursued since long before prohibition.\n\nBeer steins clutched in the hands of dozens of strangers crowded together at long wooden tables under tree canopies represents the city’s long devotion to the craft of beer brewing and community, and pays tribute to the city’s sturdy Germanic roots.\n\nGerman immigrants inspired the creation of the city’s breweries and made beer gardens the quintessential gathering spot of Milwaukee. According to the Milwaukee County Parks Department, more than two dozen breweries were in operation by 1856, making way for beer gardens along the Milwaukee River.\n\nProhibition in the 1920s curtailed such gatherings, but the idea has experienced a revival in recent years.\n\nThe city has several permanent beer gardens, including the popular Estabrook Beer Garden along the river greenway in the city’s northeast side, between Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. And the county’s Traveling Beer Garden tours bring the beer garden experience to neighborhood parks around the city throughout the summer.\n\nHere, you can fill your beer stein with Hofbrau, wash down bratwurst or a soft pretzel, and watch your neighbors polka – just like Milwaukeeans did generations before.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nMusic can bring a community together.\n\nWant proof? Just visit Washington Park’s bandshell on a Wednesday evening in the summer.\n\nYou’ll see families and friends spreading out blankets and popping open lawn chairs on the grassy amphitheater.\n\nYou’ll smell barbecue, wood-fired pizza and popcorn wafting from local vendors’ food trucks.\n\nAnd depending on the night, you’ll hear classical, jazz, reggae, opera, folk, rock, punk or a fusion of genres.\n\nThe stunning art deco bandshell is formally known as the Emil Blatz Temple of Music, named for the man who came from a brewing dynasty and donated $100,000 for its construction in the city’s largest park.\n\nAt its dedication in 1938, a crowd of 40,000 – “a mass of mothers, fathers, maidens, swains and wide-eyed children” – heard a performance from the Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra and singer Jessica Dragonette, The Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\n“If this temple of music gives you as much pleasure as it has given me in donating it, I am fully repaid,” Blatz told those who gathered on the lawn.\n\nIn the 86 years since, the bandshell has hosted musical legends like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Lily Pons, often as part of its “Music Under the Stars” program, which ran for 55 years.\n\nToday, Washington Park Wednesdays, a free concert series, carries on the tradition, providing a welcoming space for neighbors of all ages to sing, dance and listen.\n\n-Ashley Luthern\n\nWhen it comes to Frank Lloyd Wright, most Wisconsinites think of Taliesin, the architect’s home and workshop in Spring Green, the S.C. Johnson headquarters building in Racine or Monona Terrace in Madison.\n\nBut did you know there’s an entire block on the city’s south side that’s a showcase for Wright’s more modest designs?\n\nThe Burnham Block is a one-of-a-kind collection of six buildings constructed in 1916 as models for affordable housing for working-class people. The collection of single-family homes and duplexes on the 2700 block of West Burnham Street have the typical Wright touches of rich woodwork, tall vertical windows and natural construction materials, but they’re substantially smaller than the homes Wright had previously designed.\n\n“These are Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision to house every person, every American in a beautiful, artistic place to call home,” said Mike Lilek, curator for Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block, Inc., the nonprofit that owns five of the six buildings.\n\nThe organization has restored two buildings, which now function as a museum that is open for public tours. Plans are being developed for restoring the home on the northwest corner of South Layton Boulevard and West Burnham Street.\n\nYou can make reservations for a guided tour at wrightinmilwaukee.org.\n\n-Karl Ebert\n\nGreeting visitors by water from the east, the Hoan Bridge is both Milwaukee’s iconic and ironic symbol for the city’s socialist history.\n\nFormer Mayor Daniel Hoan, the city’s longest serving socialist mayor, had much of Milwaukee onboard with his policies, but when the bridge for part of Interstate 794 was erected in his honor, many were dismayed.\n\n“Where transportation was concerned, Dan Hoan was no fan of car culture,” said Phil Rocco, associate professor of political science at Marquette University. “Quite the opposite. He often bitterly complained that cars locked the city into a dynamic of ever-greater spending on ever-widening streets and that greater traffic jeopardized public safety.”\n\nThe public gets an up close and personal view of the Hoan, which opened for traffic in 1977, during the highlight of Milwaukee’s warm months — Summerfest.\n\nIt crosses over the Milwaukee Harbor, welcoming shipping, and connects downtown to Bay View and other parts of southern Milwaukee County. It’s in the foreground of many photographers’ shots of the city skyline, and is lit every night, often to honor an event or person.\n\nCoined the “bridge to nowhere” during construction, the Hoan has very much become part of Milwaukee’s image.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nYou don’t have to be the commissioner of Major League Baseball or owner of the Milwaukee Bucks to eat like them.\n\nAt Jake’s Delicatessen, 1634 W. North Ave., patrons can walk and eat in the shadow of former MLB Commissioner Allan H. “Bud” Selig and late Bucks owner Herb Kohl, who frequented the deli.\n\nJake’s Deli opened in 1955 and catered to the many Jewish families who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to the Haymarket and Sherman Park neighborhoods. In 1969, Selig bought an ownership stake in the business and held it until Wajeeh Alturkman bought it in 2021.\n\nJake’s has a modest appearance with a vertical street sign that reads “Jake’s.” Those in search of a good sandwich don’t need any further description.\n\nJake’s is known for its corned beef, but it’s the pastrami sandwich that gets people talking. Patrons have a choice to get the rye bread toasted or keep it plain, with yellow or brown mustard and their choice of cheese.\n\nIf they take a seat on the bench by the counter, the meat is cut slowly right in front of them. And a pickle spear is served on the side.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nLike its subject, downtown’s mural of Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is larger than life — covering the three-story back wall of a historic office building at 600-606 E. Wisconsin Ave. It was painted there in spring 2022 by local artist Mauricio Ramirez. The building is owned by Dan Nelson Jr., a Bucks season ticket holder and president and chief executive officer of Nelson Schmidt Inc., a marketing communications agency that operates at the building.\n\nFor Giannis fans, it’s a must-stop photo op, and perhaps Milwaukee’s best-known mural.\n\nHis legacy is still being written, but already includes being named Most Valuable Player in the 2021 NBA championship series and two regular season MVP awards in 2019 and 2020. And it will always include Milwaukee, where we’ve watched him grow from a teenager to a dominant player, an involved father and a noted fan of chicken nuggets.\n\nBucks in six!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nHow do you decide on an iconic symbol to symbolize a place that is so iconic?\n\nI’m speaking of the Milwaukee Public Museum. And, if you’re in a roomful of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, the answer is, not without a fight.\n\nThe museum has been around (in various iterations and locations) since 1851. And it’s become a go-to place for field trips and weekend excursions.\n\nSo this reporter (having been on many such field trips and excursions) suggested the rattlesnake button for MPM’s symbol. Because how could you possibly end a trip to the museum without sitting on the ledge surrounding the bison hunt exhibit, reaching your hand underneath and flicking the switch? The answer is, you cannot.\n\nAnother reporter proposed the T-Rex, which for decades has been famously munching on the remains of his fallen prey in the museum’s strikingly realistic (and scary) dinosaur diorama.\n\nAfter vigorous debate, we were outvoted by proponents of Granny, who calmly rocks in her chair on the porch of her house in the Streets of Old Milwaukee. Granted, she does live in possibly the most popular exhibit ever at the museum. And (especially impressive for someone her age), she has her own social media accounts. So who is this reporter to argue?\n\nBut MPM apparently agrees the rattlesnake button and T-Rex are iconic since they’ll be making the trek to the new museum, slated to open in 2027. Granny will be there, too.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nMost will agree that a trip (or two or several) to the Milwaukee County Zoo is necessary if you want to call yourself a true Milwaukeean.\n\nAnd many Milwaukee children (or grownups waxing nostalgic about their childhoods) will agree that a trip to the zoo is not complete without a ride on the train and a Mold-a-Rama souvenir of their favorite animal. This is universal.\n\nLess universal is choosing your favorite zoo animal. Milwaukee has had some famous ones over the years, from Gordy the groundhog to Chandar the Bengal tiger to Onassis the geriatric Giant South American River turtle.\n\nPerhaps the most famous is an animal that members of the Millennial generation and afterward never even met. But he lives in the memories of middle-age and older Milwaukeeans.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Public Library, Samson the gorilla arrived as a baby in Milwaukee in 1950 (back when the zoo was located in Washington Park). He moved to the zoo’s current location in 1959, and would for years grab the attention of delighted, fascinated and (sometimes) terrified zoo visitors when he pounded on the glass of his enclosure.\n\nSamson died of a heart attack in 1981, but Milwaukeeans can pay homage to him with a visit to the Milwaukee Public Museum, where there is a lifelike re-creation of the famous gorilla.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nIf you’ve never lived outside Milwaukee, you may be wondering why a clearly universal celebration like St. Nick’s Day — that perfectly timed mini-holiday to tide you over till Christmas with a few little treats in your stocking or shoes — is being honored in a dedication to Milwaukee things.\n\nBut Milwaukee is one of relatively few places that have been lucky enough to hold on to the tradition, along with other cities with large German or Dutch influence, such as Cincinnati; Holland, Michigan; and St. Louis.\n\nThe feast of 4th-century bishop St. Nicholas is celebrated Dec. 6. Traditionally, St. Nick is thought to go from house to house on the night of Dec. 5, leaving treats in the shoes of children.\n\nIn most places, St. Nick has become synonymous with Santa Claus, and everybody knows he brings treats and gifts just once a year — on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor kids new to the city (and their parents), now you know: Milwaukee kids get two mornings in December to wake up to find gifts.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nThe Milwaukee County War Memorial is one of the most recognizable buildings on the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nSituated just north of the Milwaukee Art Museum, the War Memorial overlooks the lake from the east side of downtown on East Mason Street, and its plaza is a popular spot for gathering to see lakefront fireworks.\n\nIts mission comes down to six words: “Honor the Dead. Serve the Living.”\n\nThe building was dedicated on Veterans Day 1957, the work of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, according to the War Memorial’s website.\n\nThe building’s design was “influenced by the abstract geometry of modern French architect Le Corbusier,” according to the Milwaukee Art Museum website.\n\nThe building is not only a memorial but a “hub for veteran activities,” the War Memorial website states.\n\nAn eternal flame memorial sits in a small pool, illuminating a black granite honor roll that includes names of Milwaukee County residents who have died while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nOn your way to a fancy night out in the Third Ward, take the right path and you’ll come across a permanent trio of massive ladybugs that look like they could be headed the same direction as you.\n\nIt’s hard to tell how massive they are, exactly: They’re perched way up on the side of the Milwaukee Building on North Water Street.\n\nAt least, it’s a hard calculation looking up at them from the sidewalk or from a car whizzing by.\n\nThe fiberglass bugs are each about 6 feet long and 3 feet deep and have been hanging there since July 1999.\n\nThey were thought up by John J. Burke to decorate the building that houses the company he started, Burke Properties, according to his obituary.\n\nNot much has been written about them, which is a testament to how many interesting things Milwaukee offers — we take even giant beetles for granted.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nThe most quintessentially Milwaukee treat, especially on a hot summer day. (But, let’s be honest: We Midwesterners enjoy a cold cone even when it’s below zero.)\n\nFrozen custard is a step up from your average ice cream because it includes egg yolks that make for a richer texture.\n\nTravel Wisconsin lists Milwaukee as the unofficial “frozen custard capital of the world,” a kind way of saying no visitor should leave the city without trying frozen custard from at least one, if not multiple, locations.\n\nMight we suggest a formal custard tasting?\n\nThree places to start: Gilles, Leon’s and Kopp’s. Each serves a couple of basic flavors every day, plus a Flavor of the Day that’s often more unique.\n\nGilles Frozen Custard opened in 1938, making it the oldest operating stand in the city, according to Travel Wisconsin. Find it at 7515 W. Bluemound Road, and don’t be shy about taking a look at the full menu of non-frozen treats.\n\nLeon’s Frozen Custard popped up just a few years later, in 1942, and is still operated by the original family, according to its website. The year-round business at 3131 S. 27th St. bills itself as a “classic 1950s-style family owned drive-in, specializing in frozen custard.”\n\nKopp’s Frozen Custard: Come for dessert, stay for dinner. With locations in Glendale, Brookfield and Greenfield, you’re never too far from the custard shop that’s also known for its massive burgers.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nYou might know it from the 1970s and 80s sitcom Laverne & Shirley, in which “Welcome Milwaukee visitors” is displayed in all-caps across the bell tower in the opening credits.Or, you might just be familiar from passing the iconic building that sits on a triangular slice of land with its north end at the intersection of East Kilbourn Avenue and North Water Street.\n\nThe Flemish Renaissance-inspired structure in the heart of downtown Milwaukee was completed in 1895, becoming a fixture of the city’s skyline. It cost about $1 million to construct, according to the city.\n\nIts atrium in the building’s center rises eight stories and serves as the site of city functions and news conferences by officials and those challenging their actions.\n\nOn the floors that ascend from the atrium are various city offices, including the Mayor’s Office and the Common Council Chambers where the 15-member council conducts its public meetings. Others include the Assessor’s Office and City Attorney’s Offices.\n\nFrom the base of the bell tower to the top of the flagpole, the building ascends 393 feet in the air. For a few years after City Hall opened in 1895, it was one of the tallest habitable buildings – if not the tallest – in the nation and world.\n\nThe tower holds the bell known as “Solomon Juneau” after Milwaukee’s first mayor, according to the city. The bell was made from church and firehouse bells from around the city and first rang on New Year’s Eve 1896.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nIn the heart of Marquette University’s bustling campus, a medieval remnant offers respite for the soul.\n\nJoan of Arc Chapel began its life as a place of worship circa 1420 in the village of Chasse, southeast of Lyon, France. Named then after St. Martin de Seysseul, it served the people of Chasse-sur-Rhône for hundreds of years before falling into disrepair.\n\nJoan of Arc, the legendary warrior and patron saint of France, is said to have prayed at the chapel in 1429. That was part of its attraction to Gertrude Hill Gavin, who bought it in 1927 and had it moved to her estate in Long Island, N.Y.\n\nMarc Rotjman, a former president of Racine’s J.I. Case Co., and his wife, Lillian, bought the chapel in 1962 and later donated it to Marquette. Over nine months, its 30 tons of stone and 18,000 terracotta roof tiles were carefully disassembled, labeled and shipped to Milwaukee. The reassembled and renamed chapel opened here in 1966. Its nave was lengthened to allow seating up to 60 people; radiant floor heating and electricity were also added.\n\nThe Gothic chapel is a striking landmark amid so many buildings centuries younger. But it continues to be an active worship site, with as many as seven Masses a week when classes are in session, including a Sunday afternoon liturgy in Spanish.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nFor many people, just balancing on ice skates is hard ... now imagine maintaining control while skating at 30 miles per hour and racing fellow skaters. That’s the sport of speedskating.\n\nMilwaukee is home to one of the top speedskating facilities in the world: the Pettit National Ice Center. The Pettit is one of only two 400-meter indoor speedskating ovals in the country and is an official U.S. Speedskating training facility. It opened in 1992 and replaced the outdoor Wisconsin Olympic Ice Rink, which occupied the site from 1967 to 1991.\n\nAll of the U.S. speedskaters to compete in the past six Winter Olympics have raced or trained at the Pettit Center. The facility has hosted the 2018 and 2022 Olympic Trials and other elite competitions. Over the years, the Pettit has been the home training facility of numerous speedskating greats, including five-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, 1994 gold medalist Dan Jansen and four-time Olympic medalist Shani Davis.\n\nThe Pettit also boasts two international-size hockey rinks and a 443-meter walking and running track. It is the home of multiple local hockey and skating clubs and offers figure skating, speedskating and hockey lessons for children and adults.\n\nThe track is a popular winter training spot for high school, college and adult runners. It hosts track practices, meets and even a 95-lap indoor marathon.\n\nBut, if you’re looking for something a little less athletically intense, the Pettit also has ample public skate hours with skate rentals ... perfect for date night or a fun family activity.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nPecan fingers, snickerdoodles, butterscotch bars and more.\n\nWisconsin residents have been making Christmas treats published in the annual We Energies Cookie Book for nearly a hundred years.\n\nEvery year, the company compiles recipes submitted by residents in a book celebrating themes like military service and hometown favorites.\n\nPicking up a copy of the book has become a Christmas tradition in many Wisconsin households. Some longtime Wisconsinites collect copies for years, passing them down through generations.\n\nThe We Energies Cookie Book was introduced in 1928, back when the company was known as the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co.\n\nThe book was sent to customers to promote the company’s appliances. Through the 1930s, the book grew in popularity and was distributed at the Public Service Building in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nThe book has gone through temporary changes over the years. During World War II, the 1942 edition had 14 recipes for wartime cookies, featuring cookie low in shortening and sugar to accommodate for rationing ingredients during the war.\n\nAfter the 1973 book, the company stopped publishing the book until 1984 due to rising energy costs. The book was published in 1991, 1998, 2002 and restored to its annual printing tradition in 2006. You can find each cookie book digitally archived at we-energies.com/recipes/archive.\n\n-Alex Groth\n\nIf you’ve dined at a Wisconsin supper club or visited a traditional cocktail lounge, chances are you’ve heard of (or enjoyed) the Pink Squirrel. In the family of ice cream drinks like the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander, the Pink Squirrel has a special Milwaukee connection: it was, as far as anyone can tell, invented at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, 1579 S. 9th St., in the 1940s.\n\nWith just three ingredients — vanilla ice cream, creme de cacao (chocolate liqueur) and creme de noyaux (almond-flavored liqueur) — the Pink Squirrel is a sweet, nutty, creamy way to drink your dessert.\n\nBoth the rosy hue and nutty flavor can be attributed to the creme de noyaux, a liqueur made from apricot, peach or cherry kernels and originally colored with cochineal.\n\nAs the story goes, Bryant and Edna Sharp opened Bryant’s as a Miller Brewing tied house in 1936. Within a few years, Bryant abandoned the beer hall approach and transformed the business into the first cocktail lounge in Milwaukee and, quite likely, Wisconsin.\n\n“People who knew him described him as quiet and serious, with a talent and passion for mixology,” a history of the bar says of Bryant Sharp. “He also was known for putting together unique flavors, which he sold to cordial companies.”\n\nIt’s only fitting that this classic ice cream cocktail can trace its roots to one of the Dairy State’s favorite drinking establishments.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nSince 1994, drivers traveling north on I-43 have seen the giant eagle and only slightly smaller dove on the wall of a National Avenue building. Back then, Esperanza Unida director Richard Oulahan commissioned artist Reynaldo Hernandez to create a mural to reflect the heritage and aspirations of the south-side community. “The Mural of Peace,” about 80 feet by 150 feet, shows both birds with an olive branch, with a bolt of lightning between them and a background of colored stripes representing flags of different lands.\n\nThe mural is painted not on the building’s cream city brick, but on nearly 300 panels affixed to it. After a few years, weather damaged some panels. Contributors to a fund drive to restore the mural included Tippecanoe Elementary students, who raised more than $566 in a penny drive.\n\nThe Walker’s Point building at 611 W. National Ave. is now the Mercantile Lofts Apartments. During its conversion to living spaces, modifications were made that created windows on that wall for inhabitants but still kept the bold colors of Hernandez’s design visible.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nThe Allen-Bradley Clock Tower, located on South 2nd Street and just north of Greenfield Avenue, has been a staple of Milwaukee’s skyline and for decades was the largest four-sided clock tower in the world.\n\nSitting atop what is now Rockwell Automation, the 283-foot-tall clock was revealed on Halloween 1962. The clockworks were built by the Allen-Bradley company, which specialized in electrical controls.\n\nThe tower is four separate clocks running on individual motors. About once a month its gears require greasing, but it’s lit by LED bulbs that rarely need to be replaced.\n\nTwice a year everyone moves their clocks forward or back an hour, usually by pushing a button. Changing the Allen-Bradley clock requires a security guard on the outside with a radio looking up at each face while someone with a special key turns four switches inside a room on the first floor.\n\nIn its early years it was referred to as the “Polish moon” because of the bright display in a predominantly Polish neighborhood. But over time more Mexican immigrants and families moved to the south side and the nickname was changed to the “Mexican moon” to recognize how the neighborhood has changed.\n\nThe clock also illuminated the fight against discrimination in labor in 1968, when the Latino and Black communities joined efforts to fight discriminatory hiring practices at the Allen-Bradley Company.\n\nThe protest was started by Father James E. Groppi. Younger Latino residents took up the cause and more activism against the company continued for another year. The march on Allen-Bradley is considered a success, given the consciousness it created and the progress Latinos in Milwaukee have made in the half-century since.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nFirst things first: The correct pronunciation is poonch-ka, says Joe Parajecki, a chef at the Polish Center in Franklin.\n\nAnd yes, they are similar to jelly-filled donuts, but they’re much richer. Ingredients like sugar, butter, eggs and yeast are put into the dough before giving them up for Lent.\n\nPaczki is traditionally eaten on Fat Tuesday in Milwaukee, though in Poland, it’s actually celebrated on the Thursday before Lent.\n\n“You can’t believe the lines in Poland to get paczki on Fat Thursday. People eat a dozen or more each,” Parajecki said.\n\nMilwaukee is one of the “capital cities of Polish America,” according to Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Two decades after the city was founded, 30 families organized the first Polish Catholic congregation in urban America.\n\nA traditional paczki is the size of a walnut and doesn’t look like a donut at all, Parajecki said. It’s sweet dough wrapped around a prune or filled with rose jam, which is “a very acquired taste. It’s like eating a jar of perfume.”\n\nPrune and raspberry are the most common fillings in America, but there are newer flavors like Nutella and lemon. Parajecki is amazed by how many people who celebrate paczki, even those who aren’t Polish.\n\nHe doesn’t care about the paczki vs. donut discussion — more important is tying it to a memory, like sitting around grandma’s table.\n\n“We’re not eating it to debate those things. We’re eating it to remember, we’re eating it to have a good time.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nYou just got through TSA at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. You’re missing a shoe, toiletries are bursting from your carry-on, and where is that boarding pass again?\n\nA sign past the security checkpoint: Recombobulation Area. An invitation and a space to put your things back in order.\n\nIt all started in 2008, when former airport director Barry Bateman told the sign shop he had a great idea.\n\nHe was told “recombobulation” wasn’t an actual word, the airport’s director of public affairs and marketing Harold Mester said. Bateman knew that.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s try to make this a little bit more fun during this stressful experience. If someone gets a chuckle when they go through the checkpoint, then we’ve done our job.’”\n\nAs far as Mester is aware, Milwaukee is the only airport to use the “recombobulation” phrase. “Recomposure” is the more technical term, but as Mester pointed out, “that’s an actual word.”\n\nThe American Dialect Society once declared “recombobulation” the most creative word of the year. And the term has inspired other branding efforts in Milwaukee, from billboards to beer.\n\nIt’s also the namesake of a blog by Dan Shafer. As he put it, recombobulation is the “opposite of discombobulation.” He is often tagged in the many selfies taken in front of the sign.\n\nThe sign represents Milwaukee’s sense of humor about itself, Shafer said.\n\n“It’s just one of those quintessentially Milwaukee types of things. It’s just quirky and weird enough and resonates with people.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nWalk into a Milwaukee supper club or bar on a Friday night and you’ll likely see bartenders lining up rocks glasses and filling each with maraschino cherries, orange slices and a dash of sugar. Next comes a shot of soda water and a muddler. Then, the brandy.\n\nThe Old Fashioned cocktail isn’t supposed to be made with brandy, but like anything in Wisconsin, we’ve taken an idea and made it our own. And boy, do we own it.\n\nDuring an average weekend at the Five O’ Clock Steakhouse on West State Street, bartenders serve more than 100 brandy Old Fashioneds, general manager Hegel Terron told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nDuring the week, the daily average probably tops at 75, he said.\n\nAt the Packing House supper club on East Layton Avenue, general manager Chris Wiken said he’s ordering two cases of Korbel brandy per week.\n\nThe vast majority of customers are asking for brandy Old Fashioneds sweet, Wiken said. But in recent years, customers are getting a bit more picky about which brandy they want – ordering Milwaukee’s Central Standard or even comedian Charlie Berens’ spirit.\n\nOn a good Friday night, the Packing House is filling a couple hundred rocks glasses with Wisconsin’s favorite cocktail. In a year’s time, that’s tens of thousands, Wiken said.\n\n“I cannot keep Korbel on hand. It just flies out the door,” he said. “Friday night is probably when we sell the most because the pairing with the fish fry is a really good pairing.”\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, there are a few ways to give yourself away. First: Order a bourbon Old Fashioned instead of brandy sweet. Second: Wear a Cardinals hat. Third: Ask for directions to the nearest water fountain.\n\nInexplicably, public water fountains here are called bubblers and pretty much only here. There are some in Rhode Island, for some reason, but the vast, vast majority of the nation adopted “drinking fountains” and “water fountains.”\n\nMilwaukee appears to be ground zero for the use of bubbler, according to UW-Madison’s Dictionary of American Regional English. Its origins are fuzzy but may be tied to its use by Kohler Co., one of Wisconsin’s most famous brands – a manufacturer of faucets among other water-related products.\n\nThe company in 1914 promoted a water fountain created by Kohler as being fitted with a “continuous flow bubbler,” according to the UW-Madison dictionary.\n\nA former dictionary editor in 2015 told Wisconsin Public Radio that “bubbler” was used especially in the southeastern area of the state starting in the mid 1910s. More than a century later, we’re still using bubblers.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nSundays in Milwaukee have a smell: buttery, fresh-baked rolls.\n\nAfter church, it’s tradition to pick up what’s known as hot ham and rolls – an end-of-weekend feast with origins in the cream city’s German or Polish roots, depending on which bakery owner you speak to.\n\nFor less than $30 at Grebe Bakery, for example, you can get three pounds of ham, 18 rolls and two pounds of potato salad.\n\nThe meal is part of Milwaukee’s identity, so much so that former Gov. Scott Walker made it part of his politico persona along with other attributes Walker promoted to assure voters he was as Wisconsin as they were.\n\nHe tweeted nearly 20 times about procuring hot ham and rolls from now-shuttered Fattoni’s deli after church in Wauwatosa during his first term as governor.\n\nBrian Schwellinger, president of Badger Ham, which provides the hams for many bakeries’ meal deals, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2021 the hot ham and rolls tradition is likely rooted in religion.\n\n“There were so many churches that the church tradition was a strong part of the community, and after service is when you had your first meal of the day,” Schwellinger said.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nThe Great Lakes may seem like an limitless resource, but the world’s largest surface freshwater system faces major threats from pollution, climate change, invasive species and overexploitation.\n\nAnd to understand and protect it, scientists need to be out on the water.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences has made its mark on Great Lakes research. It’s the only graduate school of freshwater sciences in the country and one of only three in the world.\n\nUW-Milwaukee’s main research vessel, the Neeskay, is the only research vessel out on the lakes year-round.\n\nBefore the Neeskay started powering scientific expeditions in 1970, it was an Army T-boat used during the Korean War. Its name comes from the Ho-Chunk word for “pure, clean water.”\n\nScientists use the Neeskay to study algae blooms, invasive quagga and zebra mussels, and microbes that live out in the lakes. It’s also used to deploy buoys that monitor weather and lake characteristics, like temperature and nutrients.\n\nBut the Neeskay, along with a fleet of small boats, are only just the start. The university has been raising money since 2016 to build the Maggi Sue, which will become the most technologically advanced freshwater research ship in the country.\n\nThe Maggi Sue is expected to open many doors in understanding what’s going on out in the Great Lakes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe Bucks’ mascot has delighted crowds with dunks and stunts, from the Milwaukee Arena to the Bradley Center to Fiserv Forum, for almost 50 years.\n\nBango made his debut in the team’s 1977-78 home opener — which pitted the Bucks against the Los Angeles Lakers two years after NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left Milwaukee for L.A.\n\nNamed for the call the team’s original radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, made when players made a long-range basket, Bango was the moniker chosen by fans in a contest.\n\nIn the decades since, he’s gone through several makeovers and celebrated many milestones.\n\nIn 1984, he got his first car (it’s unclear whether he was old enough to drive; we’re not sure how deer aging equates here). He got married in 2002, and welcomed Bango Jr. in 2005. Two years later, Bango and Bango Jr. first appeared in their inflatable forms. 2010 was a big year for Bango: he nailed a few new dunks and was honored as the NBA Mascot of the Year.\n\nThe next few years brought more cervid celebrations: Cartoon Network’s “Most Awesome Mascot,” a human hamster ball dunk and a featured role on the Hulu “Behind the Mask” documentary. There were also a few mishaps along the way — a torn ACL and a broken rim during a Badgers halftime show.\n\nWhether he’s wearing a sweater or a full uniform with the number 68 (for the team’s first season), doing acrobatics on the court or making appearances in the community, Bango is Milwaukee’s most dominant deer.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nOne call, that’s all.\n\nIt’s not a particularly unusual slogan. Milwaukee isn’t home to the only law firm that has used it. But say those words around Milwaukee, and you’ll get immediate recognition, and probably a smile. Is it weird that simply saying the slogan or name of a personal injury lawyer, albeit a locally famous one, can cultivate ... joy?\n\nDavid Gruber, the lawyer in question, has been using the slogan in TV advertisements since the late 1990s, born from a collaboration with a Dallas media company.\n\nHe looks into the camera and punctuates every ad with those famous four words, a catchphrase that has become the dictum around which his entire brand has been constructed.\n\nThe celebrity lawyer can be found in the first few rows of Milwaukee sporting events and has partnered with just about every major sports operation in the city, a nod to his lengthy interest in athletics.\n\nAnd it’s not hard to score a “Gruber Law Office” T-shirt at a sporting event or at street fairs around the city, the perfect giveaway to spread the Gruber gospel and let everyone around you know how Milwaukee you are.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIn Milwaukee, the herald of winter’s thaw is not that growing patch of green on a lawn or the first magnolia blossom peeling open or that last crusty pile of parking lot snow.\n\nNo: It’s the first aroma of match meeting propane, that sizzle of cold meat on hot grates, the collective tower of smoke rising above the interchange at American Family Field.\n\nIt’s spring. It’s grilling season.\n\nYou don’t have to be the one grilling to enjoy its benefits. The first sunny day in March when it’s light past 5 p.m. — that’s when it happens. The first smells of a neighbor lighting charcoal and laying down some hamburger patties.\n\n“Someone’s grilling,” you say, and you smile.\n\nGrill smells permeate the air in Milwaukee from spring to fall. On a summer day, you can drive around with the windows down and you know when the neighbors are gathering. You can be sure there’s a cold beer in a koozy and the charcoal is heating up.\n\nAnd then there’s the tailgate, that communal grilling session. Many urban ballparks have parking garages or no parking at all, thus no opportunity to truly enjoy the baseball experience. But the tailgate endures in Milwaukee. On a sunny day (or rainy or snowy, we’re hardy people), the American Family Field parking lots are packed with canopies, games of corn hole and folding chairs all huddled around one thing: the grill.\n\n-Lainey Seyler\n\nAre you a “call an ace” player or a “picker and jack of diamond” player when you sit down at the sheepshead table? And if you don’t know what those phrases mean, you probably aren’t familiar with “leaster,” “re-crack” or “schmear.” To know the card game is to speak a certain kind of Milwaukee dialect.\n\nThe trick-taking game often features five players but has its share of variants, with different rules and terminology for different parts of the state. But this isn’t a pastime that’s achieved a high level of popularity outside the state’s borders.\n\nLike Milwaukee, sheepshead’s roots are deeply German — the game is Schakopf in its native country, and the unofficial history involves disgruntled peasants inventing the game that gave kings a lower ranking. Sheepshead arrived in Milwaukee with a large population of German immigrants, many of whom worked in brewing.\n\nThe card game’s patron saint, Bob Strupp, published “How To Play ‘Winning’ 5 Handed Sheepshead” in 1983. The lifelong Milwaukeean attended Common Council meetings to advocate that the game should be declared Milwaukee’s official card game, a campaign that proved successful.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Glendale has claimed to serve as home to the largest sheepshead tournament in the world; a nurse from Kewaskum won in 2024.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere was a time when Milwaukee had earned the title as “The Bowling Capital of America.”\n\nEvolving from German “kegling,” German-Americans helped raise the game’s popularity in the states, and a city like Milwaukee with a deep German heritage was quick to adopt. But as nationwide popularity fell, Milwaukee’s bowling culture wasn’t ... well, uh, spared.\n\nThe United States Bowling Congress, which once called Greendale home, moved to Texas in 2008. The PBA Tour, once sponsored by Miller Brewing, stopped making the city a regular tour stop after 1990, bowling centers closed and WTMJ’s wildly popular “Bowling With the Champs” TV series, which made local celebrities out of top bowlers and served as a precursor to reality competition television, ended after 41 years in 1995.\n\nBut bowling’s history remains visible around the city and state. Milwaukee tavern The Holler House houses the oldest sanctioned bowling alley in the United States, and the miniature version of the sport still has a place at legendary Koz’s Mini Bowl, home to “the last duckpin bowling in the U.S.” The Vulcan Corporation in northern Wisconsin became a major manufacturer of bowling pins.\n\nAnd the PBA even returned for a stop in Wauwatosa in 2023.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIt’s the floor that made Milwaukee famous.\n\nDesigned for $27,500 by New York pop artist Robert Indiana — a man with the perfect name to match the flamboyance of the masterpiece — the MECCA floor was a controversial addition in 1977. The Milwaukee Exposition and Convention Center (known today as the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, but then abbreviated as the MECCA) served as home to the Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette men’s basketball team. Marquette basketball, known for its eclectic uniforms and the fiery personality of recently retired head coach Al McGuire, was the perfect match for the look.\n\nThe floor featured two giant Ms consuming either half of the court, somewhat hidden in the two-toned yellow paint scheme, a red bull’s eye at center court and blue lettering for “MECCA” wrapped twice around the center circle. Dark red for the lanes, dark blue for the sideline and dark green for the perimeter.\n\nThe gaudy floor didn’t quite fit everyone’s aesthetic tastes immediately (including new MU head coach Hank Raymonds), but it was a hit with plenty of fans (and Bucks coach Don Nelson). It became part of the Milwaukee color palette until the Bucks moved into the Bradley Center in 1988. The Bucks re-created the floor for a “Return to the MECCA” game in 2017, a return to the building that harbored the 1971 NBA champion and 1977 NCAA champion.\n\nIndiana rose to fame because of his “LOVE” sculpture, but the MECCA floor remains a distinctly Milwaukee concept.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere are many places around Milwaukee where you can take a drink of history, including many brewery tours.\n\nBut there is also a non-alcoholic option nestled between Wentworth Avenue and Superior Street in Bay View:\n\nThe Pryor Avenue Iron Well, a source of drinking water since 1882.\n\nOriginally drilled to provide drinking water and fire protection, it’s the last surviving public well in the city, according to the Historical Preservation Committee. The city named it a historic structure in 1987.\n\nWhile the well is just a short walk from Lake Michigan, the water actually comes from an aquifer nearly 120 feet underground.\n\nThe iron-rich water tastes a bit different than city water. The water is clear with a distinct metallic taste. Sometimes there might be a faint smell of sulfur.\n\nElevated levels of strontium, a natural element found in bedrock, were detected in 2015. But according to the EPA, the levels are only an issue for sensitive populations after drinking the water over the course of a lifetime.\n\nOverall the water is safe to drink, according to Milwaukee Water Works and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn fact, the well was a lifeline for many during the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak that ravaged the municipal water supply.\n\nSo fill a jug or take a sip from the bubbler. Just ignore the penny-like metallic notes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe drive along the Hoan Bridge offers some of the best views of the Milwaukee skyline and Lake Michigan.\n\nAnd if the wind blows in the right direction, it’s also where you can get a good whiff of Milwaukee’s signature funky scent.\n\nNo, Eau de Milwaukee isn’t hops, brats or cheese curds. It’s Milorganite, a lawn and garden fertilizer made from our very own wastewater.\n\nThe Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District started making Milorganite – named after Milwaukee organic nitrogen – at the city’s sewage treatment plant on Jones Island in 1926.\n\nThe city used a new method to treat wastewater, called the activated sludge method, which mixed microbes with sewage and air to remove 95% of the bacteria from the city’s sewage and 90% of the solids.\n\nAfter wastewater enters the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility, microbes are added that feast on the organic material. When the microbes die they settle to the bottom, leaving clean water above that is returned to Lake Michigan.\n\nWater is squeezed out of the microbes before they are dried and turned into pellets that become the nitrogen-rich fertilizer sold around the country.\n\nTurning this waste into fertilizer has kept 10 billion pounds of waste out of landfills since 1926, according to the sewerage district.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nA mark of Milwaukee’s annual celebration of Bastille Day, the 43-foot Eiffel Tower that appears each year in Cathedral Square Park is a testament to the city’s determination.\n\nThe tower has had to go through several rounds of repairs and reinforcement to keep up its yearly appearances. There have been a few years that an inflatable Eiffel Tower took the real one’s place, but it always returns, as it did in 2023 after a year of repairs.\n\nThe tower was initially built as part of an indoor department store display in the late 1980s, possibly in Minneapolis, according to a 2022 OnMilwaukee report.\n\nThe tower was never supposed to be permanent, and it definitely wasn’t meant to be assembled and disassembled each year for its appearance at the festival. But that won’t stop the tower, nor the organizers of the Bastille Day celebration, who are asking for donations to complete more repairs and restoration.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is far from the only French-themed activity of the weekend. There’s also the Storm the Bastille 5K run and walk, in addition to can-can dancers and plenty of French fare. The celebration is meant to honor the storming of the Bastille, the 19th-century French prison, an event that helped to start the French Revolution.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nGo into about any Milwaukee restaurant, tavern or even the corner bar on a Friday after work, and you’re likely to see diners enjoying fish alongside a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned.\n\nThe crisp crunch of walleye, perch, cod or maybe even bluegill, paired with some type of potato, coleslaw, tartar sauce, a lemon wedge and perhaps a slice of rye bread.\n\nFish fries are actually so popular in Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers declared Feb. 16, 2024, as Friday Fish Fry Day, honoring the history of the meal. According to his proclamation, the fish fry became popular when a large population of Catholic European immigrants settled in Wisconsin in the 1800s and needed something meat-free to eat on Fridays during Lent.\n\nThen, during Prohibition, the meal helped to keep Wisconsin’s breweries and taverns alive, too, further cementing the tradition.\n\nToday, fish fries in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin serve as a weekly opportunity to gather with friends and family at your favorite establishment, catch up and swap stories over a plate of deep-fried fish.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nA piece of Milwaukee’s baseball history, Bernie Brewer’s Chalet was once one of the crowning jewels at County Stadium. Bernie Brewer would slide out of the chalet and into a giant stein of beer after every home run or if the Brewers won the game, setting the stage for celebration.\n\nNow, the chalet is a part of another popular Milwaukee stop: Lakefront Brewery. It’s a stop on the brewery’s tour through the facility, and now it can even be booked for a romantic dinner for two, overlooking the kettles of the brewery.\n\nLakefront Brewery was born in 1987 out of something distinctly Wisconsin: some 55-gallon stainless steel drums and used dairy equipment. Jim and Russ Klisch, the founders, sold one barrel of beer to a tavern within rolling distance of the brewery.\n\nLakefront has come a long way. Now housed at 1872 N. Commerce St., the brewery has produced as many as 46,848 barrels in one year (2017) and offers 20 different beers across 30 states, and even some other countries, according to the brewery’s website. The brewery also offers tours for over 80,000 people a year, and was the first to offer beer before, during and after the tour.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, this food item may repulse you – or at least make you do a double take.\n\nBut here in Milwaukee, it’s a delicacy.\n\nWe’re talking about the cannibal sandwich: a base of rye bread topped with fresh raw beef, chopped onion and a little salt and pepper. It’s deeply rooted in the state’s history and still enjoyed today.\n\nVersions of the sandwich also exist in Germany, where it’s called mett or hackepeter. The idea is thought to have been brought over by German immigrants to Wisconsin when they arrived and began to establish cattle farms, giving them easy access to fresh meat.\n\nToday, it’s still a popular tradition served during holidays and family gatherings — though not without a little scrutiny. Eating raw meat, after all, is a health risk. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reminded residents of as much in a 2020 tweet that went viral as those unfamiliar with the sandwich gawked.\n\nBut those who enjoy it are likely to keep paying homage to their heritage. Some Milwaukee delis and butcher shops sell thousands of pounds of high-grade raw beef around the holidays to eager customers.\n\nTasty or mildly terrifying, it’s one of the city’s cultural staples.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nIf you’re looking for a home away from home, look no further than Mr. Perkins Family Restaurant.\n\nWhile the fried chicken and collard greens are rave-worthy, the real showstopper at this 55-year-old establishment is the customer service.\n\nWhen the restaurant, located on the corner of West Atkinson Avenue and North 20th Street, opened in 1969, owners Willie Sr. and Hilda Perkins created a family feeling that brings in regulars and even politicians and celebrities like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.\n\nA staple for the Black community in Milwaukee, the restaurant serves comforting southern flavors that can be hard to find here in the Midwest.\n\nWhen Willie Perkins Jr. took over in 1999, he continued creating that feeling, filling customers in on the latest news about the Green Bay Packers and the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWhen Willie died in 2010, his wife, Cherry, took over. Now, Cherry and a small team — her sister, her son and one other worker who might as well be family — continue the legacy, remembering regulars’ names and orders and creating community in addition to delicious food.\n\n-Zoe Takaki\n\nIt’s synonymous with Green Bay Packers fandom today, but the Cheesehead made its first appearance at a 1987 Milwaukee Brewers game — a completely, ahem, organic creation.\n\nThe legend is well-known now: Ralph Bruno went to his mother’s south-side Milwaukee home to help her reupholster a couch. When he took it apart, he thought the foam inside looked like cheese — so, naturally, he cut a piece into a triangle, burned some holes into it and spray-painted it yellow. It was a self-deprecating homage to an insult Wisconsin sports fans received from their neighbors in Illinois.\n\nTo Bruno’s friends’ surprise, the hats were a hit. So he made more, and sold them from a garbage bag at the next game he attended. That led to neighborhood retail sales and, eventually, the creation of Foamation Inc. — and a robust variety of Cheesehead variations including cowboy hats, baseball caps and koozies. The Packers acquired Foamation in 2023, solidifying the relationship just like a good curd.\n\nOver time, the Cheesehead has inspired song parodies and been featured in a Lil’ Wayne tribute to the Green & Gold (er, Yellow). It’s been worn or displayed by famous figures including George W. Bush, Jodie Foster, Phoebe Bridgers and John F. Kennedy Jr. And despite Chicago Bears fans’ efforts to shred them with their answer — the Graterhead — Cheeseheads are here to stay.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nTwo parallel metal tracks stretch across the roads in downtown Milwaukee, soaking up the heat of the summer and the frost of the winter. You wait a bit, a streetcar the length of two buses slides slowly toward you.\n\nYou wonder if it’s automatic, running robotically and beeping like that, until you see a conductor in the front seat and you let out the breath you’d been holding — it will stop at traffic lights and behind cars. On the side of the car golden letters read in all caps: “THE HOP.”\n\nThe Hop is a fixed-transit network that gives a ride to more than 1,000 people a day, going to various destinations in downtown Milwaukee. Its route stretches from Veterans Park to Milwaukee Public Market and expanded to the lakefront in spring 2024.\n\nThe Hop is a relatively new addition to the city, having started running in 2018. But it’s a continuation of a long history of streetcars in the city — the first electric streetcar started giving rides in 1890 and for decades was the primary form of transportation.\n\nToday, The Hop has become a staple of downtown life, whether or not you ride it.\n\n-Eva Wen\n\nIf Milwaukee was going to have a mountain, it’s fitting that that mountain would be made of the thing that keeps the city moving during its cold, icy winters: road salt.\n\nAlong with the pungent aroma of Milorganite, the gigantic salt piles are likely what most Milwaukeeans associate with the city’s Jones Island, once home to a commercial fishing village of Polish immigrants.\n\nToday, the island holds tens of thousands of tons of road salt delivered to the Port of Milwaukee for use in melting icy streets, highways and interstates across Wisconsin.\n\nIn recent years, concern has grown about excess road salt washing off of streets and into nearby bodies of water, including Lake Michigan.\n\nRoughly 2.2 billion pounds of chloride (a component of road salt) flush into the lake each year, according to a December 2021 study. And while the size of the lake helps dilute the salty pollutant, smaller tributaries aren’t so lucky. In the Milwaukee River basin alone, for example, over 100 miles of waterway are impaired by chloride, some with levels several times that which can be toxic to fish and aquatic life.\n\nMany municipalities and private businesses, including some in the Milwaukee area, have made adjustments to reduce their salt use in the name of protecting freshwater, including brining, where salt is mixed with water before being applied to roads.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nA Milwaukee sub sandwich staple, Cousins Subs began in 1972 when cousins Bill Specht and Jim Sheppard opened their first shop at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive to “bring their favorite style of sub sandwich from the East Coast to their new hometown of Milwaukee,” the company’s official story reads.\n\nCousins offers classics like the Italian Special, Pepperoni Melt and Tuna, plus specialties like Wisconsin Cheese Steak. And in Milwaukee, Cousins stands apart from national sandwich chains — not only for its local roots but its very-us offerings like Wisconsin mac and cheese, shakes and fried cheese curds.\n\nThe Cousins sandwich — carrying the slogan “Better bread. Better subs” — is so popular the company had to cancel a free sub promotion in early 2024 when restaurants couldn’t keep up with the overwhelming response.\n\n-Erik S. Hanley\n\nWouldn’t you like to go to Orlando in mid-February? Not for Disney, but for the greenery, the smell, the sense that things are alive.\n\nThat’s what you’ll find in the Tropical Dome — where you can sit in the sun with a book in hand, no matter the season. Roll up your sleeves, find a bench and relax.\n\nIn contrast, if you’re always too hot, the Desert Dome stays 50 degrees through the winter. If you have kids with you, think Show Dome and occasional choo-choos.\n\nThe three beehive-shaped Domes, aka Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory, sometimes seem the forgotten child of Milwaukee attractions. They’re fighting for their future. Yet even the common name – Domes – has a Milwaukee humility about it.\n\nWith more than 1,800 plant species, cleverly described with signage, the Domes are worth a walk.\n\nSince Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the Domes in the fall of 1965, other accolades have followed. In 2017, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave “National Treasure” status to the Domes.\n\nAnd the Domes have a characteristic that Milwaukeeans love: They’re cheap.\n\nThe priciest admission costs $9, and parking is free, unlike at the stadium, the zoo, or almost the entire downtown.\n\n-Pete Sullivan\n\nBratwurst. Polish. Italian. Hot Dog. Chorizo.\n\nBrewers fans have been cheering for one sausage or another during their race at the bottom of the sixth inning for more than 30 years. What started as a cartoon competition on a County Stadium scoreboard made its way to Miller Park (now American Family Field) as a treasured Milwaukee tradition.\n\nThe real-life Racing Sausages debuted June 27, 1993, and gave rise to live-action mascot races throughout Major League Baseball, such as racing presidents and pierogis. The idea to take the links from the scoreboard to the field came from Michael Dillon, who worked as a graphic designer with McDill Design at the time, and their first appearance was a surprise to almost everyone in the ballpark.\n\nThe matchup of 7-foot-tall encased meats was sponsored by Klement’s until 2018, when Johnsonville took the reins.\n\nThe sausages have had their ups and downs over time. Among the wurst: In 2003, then-Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Randall Simon whacked the Italian Sausage with a bat, causing the Hot Dog to tumble as well. Both finished the race, thanks to an assist from the Polish (the Bratwurst won). There was also the time in 2013 that the Italian Sausage’s casing (er, costume) was stolen (and ultimately returned) in Cedarburg. A few years later, Hot Dog took a tumble and brought Chorizo and Bratwurst along with him. And as recently as the team’s 2024 season opener, Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton narrowly missed being taken out by Bratwurst.\n\nNo matter the wiener, Milwaukee will always love its Racing Sausages.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nLegend has it George Webb first predicted Milwaukee’s baseball team would win 12 games in a row back in the 1940s – and maybe even hinted that his namesake restaurant would give out free hamburgers to celebrate the winning streak.\n\nDecades passed before his prophecy came true, but in April 1987, the Milwaukee Brewers finally pulled off the feat – and some 168,194 people lined up outside George Webb Restaurants for free burgers. It’s hard to describe how big of a deal it was to those who didn’t experience it firsthand, but trust us, there are few things us frugal Wisconsinites love more than free stuff. Combine that with baseball and burgers, and it basically felt like a street festival.\n\nWhile most people ate their free burgers, some decided to save the historic freebies for posterity. One man even had his bronzed for his father. Others threw theirs in basement freezers, only to find them decades later. (This reporter would like to apologize to her older brother, Paul, for throwing out his 20-year-old frozen burger instead of bronzing it.)\n\nThe Brewers did it again in 2018, and for only the second time in Milwaukee history people lined up to celebrate and claim their free burgers.\n\nEven when it’s not promising free burgers, George Webb is a beloved burger joint open 24 hours a day. Still, any long Brewers winning streak definitely starts to feel like a free-burger watch party.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nBob Uecker didn’t sign a broadcasting contract with the Milwaukee Brewers until 2021.\n\nBefore then, it was handshake agreements with owners Bud Selig and Mark Attanasio.\n\nUeck tries not to take himself too seriously. It’s part of the reason why he is such a revered figure among Americans, specifically Milwaukee natives and Brewers fans.\n\n“Mr. Baseball” being the butt of the joke is why the “Uecker seats” named in his honor are considered the best worst seats in baseball. “I must be in the front row,” Uecker said to a stadium usher in a mid-’80s Miller Lite commercial who told him to move to where his ticket was located — way up high.\n\nUecker seats used to be sold for as little as $1, but there was a catch: Fans would need to wait hours before first pitch at the box office to get their hands on the tickets, and the seats were less than desired — up in the nosebleeds with an obstructed view, but near Uecker’s statue.\n\nUecker, 91, has been speaking into his microphone for the Brewers radio broadcast since 1971. He wouldn’t want to hear it, but his mic serves as a symbolic gold standard for not only sportscasters but also the entertainment figures we allow into our living rooms.\n\nHe’s been a regular guest on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1984 and had roles in Hollywood films — his delivery of “Juuust a bit outside” in the 1989 cult classic film “Major League” (filmed at County Stadium) endures today.\n\nUltimately, the reason he finally signed a contract with the Brewers was because he lost benefits from the Screen Actors Guild.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nWhen she was a teenager, UW-Milwaukee professor Chia Youyee Vang remembers how her mother and aunt wrapped a long, purple cloth into a turban around her head. Then decorated with a black-and-white striped ribbon, it was one piece of the elaborate traditional clothing Vang would wear to celebrate the Hmong New Year.\n\nToday, the phuam txoo suab is more hat than headwrap. It’s often sold pre-wrapped, and it might be embroidered with silver coins or shiny beads. At annual New Year celebrations at Wisconsin State Fair Park, it’s a common headpiece for girls and women.\n\nThe headwrap’s evolution parallels Milwaukee’s Hmong community in some ways. Today’s young generation fuses American culture with the traditions of their parents and grandparents, who fled Laos as refugees in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nOlder immigrants worry about language and culture fading. But they also see their descendants blossoming: earning degrees, running businesses and buying homes in neighborhoods across the area.\n\nMilwaukee County is home to about 13,000 Hmong, census data shows. That’s nearly one-third of all Asian residents in the county.\n\nLike the Germans, Poles and Italians before them, the Hmong have made their mark on Milwaukee. The ways they’ll express and share their traditions with the city will only become more intricate as their roots deepen.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nOpening a box of Italian cookies from Peter Sciortino Bakery has an undeniable sweetness – like a mix of happy family memories and buttery goodness.\n\nSince Peter Sciortino and his wife, Grace, opened the bakery in 1947, it has grown into a beloved fixture on Brady Street. It opened just one year after Glorioso’s Italian Market, another legendary business that still calls Brady Street home. Both first became institutions as Italians began moving north from the Third Ward to the east side neighborhood decades ago, and have since become a tradition for families throughout Milwaukee.\n\nThe aroma of fresh-baked bread and cookies typically surrounds Peter Sciortino Bakery, and inside, cannoli is made fresh with each order.\n\nLuckily the cookies are sold by the pound, so there’s no need to choose between cimino, biscotti, amaretti, chocolate mezza luna, or any of the other varieties – just make sure you get a big enough box to try as many as possible.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nWhere Russell Avenue meets Superior Street in Bay View, an understated brown sign pays homage to one of the most significant sites in Milwaukee’s history: a 19th-century iron mill where a march for an eight-hour work day turned deadly.\n\nThe historical marker recalls the events of May 5, 1886: the Bay View Massacre.\n\nThat year, labor organizations nationwide were demanding an eight-hour work day, and they wanted it by May 1. Many Milwaukeeans were working 10-hour days, six days a week for paltry wages, Milwaukee historian John Gurda noted in his book “The Making of Milwaukee.”\n\nAs companies balked at the demand, strikes grew. By May 3, about half of Milwaukee’s men were on strike, Gurda found. They marched through the city, urging more workers to join them. Panicked officials called in militia from across the state after police were unable to “quell the disturbance,” the Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\nOn May 4, tension mounted at the Bay View mill where executives refused the eight-hour demand. Militia forcefully dispersed a crowd of protesters.\n\nOn the morning of May 5, about 1,500 marchers returned to the mill. When they were about 200 yards out, the militia fired. Among the seven dead was a 12-year-old boy.\n\nThe next day, streets were deserted. Local officials conferred about how to prevent “socialistic agitation,” deciding to arrest as many demonstrators as they could, the Journal reported.\n\nLabor leaders, meanwhile, had public opinion on their side. They turned their focus to winning elections.\n\nThat year, the labor-backed People’s Party of Wisconsin won elections up and down the ballot, with priorities including progressive taxes, child labor restrictions, and arbitration of labor disputes, Gurda wrote. While socialist leaders initially supported that party, they later split and ran their own candidates, launching Milwaukee’s socialist era in 1910.\n\n-Rory Linnane\n\nYou just moved to Milwaukee. You are sitting in your bungalow in Bay View and staring at the blank walls. You are a full-fledged grown-up, so those leftover posters from your college dorm don’t cut it anymore.\n\nFor generations, the Milwaukee neighborhood posters have provided an easy and classy way to decorate your new space. They were unveiled in 1983 by the City of Milwaukee’s Discover Milwaukee program, with colorful, eye-catching artwork by Jan Kotowicz of local landmarks, like the lower east side’s Oriental Theatre and Washington Park’s bandshell. Wait, what is Pigsville? Thankfully, local historian John Gurda provided illuminating text on the back of the posters about each neighborhood. The posters even popped up in “Wayne’s World” to lend authenticity to Alice Cooper’s Milwaukee-centric cameo.\n\nBest of all, the posters follow the egalitarian spirit of the city. The original run of 21 neighborhoods initially cost just $2 apiece. Now there are 39 options available from Historic Milwaukee, Inc., including one with all the neighborhoods, for only $10. There’s no excuse for those blank walls.\n\n-Ben Steele\n\nAmerica’s Black Holocaust Museum is the first and only museum of its kind in the U.S. It’s an unflinching look at more than 400 years of slavery, dehumanization, lynching and mass incarceration of Black Americans.\n\nThe dream for the museum began as a small collection in Dr. James Cameron’s basement. In 1930, when he was 16, Cameron narrowly survived a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He spent the rest of his life in Milwaukee collecting photos, artifacts and books that shed light on the histories of African Americans. He regularly welcomed guests into his home to learn this history.\n\nThe museum moved to its first official location in the Sultan Muhammad Islamic Center. Its grand opening was Juneteenth Day in 1988.\n\nCameron passed away in 2006. The museum subsequently moved buildings and briefly closed, and now resides at 401 W. North Ave., part of a redevelopment project in the heart of Bronzeville called the Griot — a West African term for “storyteller” — in honor of Cameron.\n\nThe museum starts in Africa in 300 CE, long before Europeans arrived, and ends with issues impacting Black people today, like police brutality and mass incarceration — covering the 16 generations of slavery in the U.S., reconstruction, 100 years of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA tree with branches stretching along the ceiling pays homage to the powerful song “Strange Fruit,” made popular by artist Billie Holiday, that fearlessly protested the widespread lynchings of Black Americans.\n\n-Gina Castro\n\nPabst Brewing Co. shut down its Milwaukee operations in 1996. But the huge “Pabst” sign that’s stretched far above West Juneau Avenue for several decades has remained a constant — even as the former brewery was redeveloped over the past decade or so into offices, housing, a craft brewery and other new uses.\n\nThe sign is attached to an iron footbridge that is anchored by Pabst’s former malt house, now The Malt House apartments, and the old brew house, now the Brewhouse Inn & Suites. The glowing red sign has undergone repairs in recent years, with the iron bridge’s restoration being completed this spring, according to Erin Stenum, manager of the neighborhood improvement district at the former Pabst complex, now known as The Brewery. Ein Prosit!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nThe soundtrack to most city parks includes the ping of a bouncing basketball, the tinny reverb of a faraway stereo or the sizzle of a grill fired up for sausages.\n\nYou’ll hear those at Burnham Park, too, but there’s another layer to the score: the soothing hum of a handful of taco trucks parked just outside, and the chatter from hungry hoards waiting in the wings for a carne asada taco, a lengua huarache or a cooling horchata on a hot summer night.\n\nThese food trucks are part of the fabric of Burnham Park. Beyond the neighborhood, the south side is dotted with family-owned fleets carrying specialties all their own, parked on Historic Mitchell Street, West Lincoln Avenue, West Becher Street and across the neighborhoods tucked in between.\n\nYou could stop at one to satisfy a craving or you could go on a full expedition, grabbing an al pastor taco shaved straight off the spit at La Guelaguetza (go on Wednesdays to nab ’em for a dollar each), head to Marta’s Tamales Food Truck for a juicy pambazo dipped in red pepper sauce, and finish at Isa’s Ice Cream for a creamy scoop of mango or passionfruit nieve de garrafa to round out the night.\n\nThey’re the tastes of the neighborhood and the passion from a piece of Milwaukee with undeniable flavor all its own.\n\n-Rachel Bernhard\n\nThey only surface for one week.\n\nBut for that one week, they’re everywhere.\n\nThey are the ribbons worn by Northwestern Mutual agents during the company’s annual gathering in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nEach summer, the Milwaukee insurance and financial services company brings more than 12,000 employees and agents together for a week of meetings and events; ground zero is usually the Baird Center and Fiserv Forum, but they can be seen all over downtown.\n\nAnd every agent wears a nametag lanyard with attached ribbons denoting sales goals achieved, landmarks passed, accomplishments reached.\n\nSome agents have two or three ribbons. A few sport a ribbon that goes down to the floor.\n\nTo outsiders, the ribbons might look like scout badges or sashes from a secret society — swag from a party they weren’t invited to.\n\nTo the agents, the ribbons are an expression of how far they’ve come in the business — and where they rank among their colleagues. After the week’s meetings are over, they’re put away.\n\nIn a way, they’re like cicadas: They swarm the city for a brief period, and then they’re gone.\n\nBut we know they’ll be back.\n\n-Chris Foran\n\nJust over a year after moving to Milwaukee, I arrived at Wolski’s Tavern with a singular goal: Get that damn sticker. You know the one. The ubiquitous capital-letter “I CLOSED WOLSKI’S” sticker plastered on dive bar bathroom walls and 20-somethings’ water bottles.\n\nEven if you don’t know what Wolski’s is, exactly, it’s still likely you know about the stickers. The fantastic marketing strategy has worked wonders for the more-than-a-century-old bar.\n\nWhen we arrive that night, we sit outside despite the evening’s light rain. I find myself tiring long before 1 a.m. But the lure of the sticker provides energy as the night goes on.\n\nAs 2 a.m. passes, a man urinates off a tree-shielded wall and an employee yells it’s time to go. A sloppy early-20s crowd, a few stray middle-age folks and I begin to filter inside. The crowd lingers, holding glass beer mugs and Miller High Lifes.\n\nTen minutes later, another call to leave rings out. This time, people form a line to a door guarded by a young doorman holding a stack of stickers. One in front of me doesn’t take it, but later reverses her decision. The doorman teases she can’t have one, and receives a kiss on the cheek when he concedes.\n\nI give him a nod and thank-you, taking my prize.\n\nI closed Wolski’s — now I just need to find where to put the sticker. Any ideas?\n\n-David Clarey\n\nIn Milwaukee, seemingly every component of the gooey globules known as cheese curds — pieces of young cheese that during the cheesemaking process become separated from the whey — is as malleable as the cheddar itself.\n\nA simple scan of the city’s pubs, bars and even fine-dining restaurants is evidence of an oft-repeated Wisconsin stereotype: It’s the cheese curd capital of the world. And per usual, Milwaukee isn’t going to skimp on the party.\n\nRestaurants generally buy fresh curds of white or yellow cheddar — in rarer cases, mozzarella or pepper jack — before adding their own personality via batters, sauces and names. Milwaukeeans take pride in experimenting with curd coatings: they might be buttermilk-battered, pancake-battered, beer-battered, honey lager-battered, Lakefront Riverwest Stein-battered, or slathered in an ambiguous “house-made batter.”\n\nThose curds are then “fried up squeaky clean” (at the Wicked Hop), turned into “mini explosives” disguised as curds (at Safehouse Milwaukee), or transfigured into “little pillows of cheesy heaven” (at Joe Mama’s Bar). Many restaurants serve up half-pound portions; some, like Steny’s, offer a full pound of cheese.\n\nNotably, the Journal Sentinel didn’t come across any menus advertising curds served with ketchup. But various varieties of tomato, like marinara sauce and tomato jam, made appearances. Many menus experiment with ranch varieties like buttermilk, garlic, chipotle or jalapeño, or specialty sauces like buffalo blue cheese aioli, maple syrup, Bloody Mary buffalo, or sweet and spicy pineapple.\n\nAs Brothers Bar and Grill puts it, the final step is up to you: transporting the morsels “from the cheese curd capital of the world to your mouth!”\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nRyan Putskey isn’t fazed by calls to the Oriental Theatre asking if “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is “appropriate.” Or, calls telling him it’s not.\n\n“To be fair, it can be kind of graphic. But, I mentioned this to the cast — it’s been like this for probaby 40 years,” said Putskey, the theater’s longtime caretaker.\n\nA quick Google search confirms the historic East Side theater gets national kudos for its longstanding commitment to Rocky Horror. In some tellings, the Oriental takes the crown for the longest single run of the movie since its release in 1975.\n\nPutskey humbly said that’s a point of contention: the Oriental’s tradition dates back to January 1978 — before its rival for Rocky Horror longevity, the Clinton Street Theater in Oregon — but has logged fewer individual shows.\n\nRegardless, Rocky Horror devotees consistently show up for the movie and live stage performance at midnight on the second Saturday of each month to call out virgins in the audience and throw toast at the stage. They never tire of watching the transformation of an under-sexualized engaged couple, Brad and Janet, as they wander into a castle and are soon seduced by a mad scientist from the planet Transsexual and his Frankenstein-esque creation, Rocky.\n\nThose details aren’t unique to Milwaukee. But the Oriental’s minaret towers and lioness statutes add an otherworldly, in-person touch to the celebration of madness, weirdness and sexuality that demands to be taken seriously.\n\n“You’ll consistently be there with — and I say this will all due respect to all of them — a bunch of weirdos,” Putskey said.\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nNobody has to be from Cleveland to know that the city has been the subject of more than a few one-liners over the years.\n\n“Attention Cleveland, your river is on fire!”\n\nOr ...\n\n“In Cleveland, Velveeta cheese can be found in the gourmet section of the supermarket.”\n\nBut here’s a burning question, why did Cleveland become the butt of a zinger of a gag in Milwaukee’s Bay View, of all places?\n\nIn 1978, while having lunch with his assistant, now retired photographer and artist Mark Gubin decided to have some fun with air travelers flying into Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport.\n\nRealizing that low-level planes coasted over his studio and home (the former Bay Theater) in the path of a runway, he painted “Welcome to Cleveland”on his roof.\n\nWas there any specific reason behind the Cleveland tomfoolery, these 6-foot high letters that have given more than a few air travelers an uneasy, eerie (or Erie) feeling?\n\nNope, it was just Gubin’s wicked sense of humor, the right time to welcome visitors to the wrong place.\n\n“I never did it as any kind of thing to help my business or anything like that. It was just plain madness. You need that in the world,” Gubin told former Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl in 2015.\n\nThe internet, cyberspace and social media have helped Gubin’s prank reach a sort of rock star quality.\n\nNow 46 years later, the gag certainly hasn’t gotten old … it’s still flying.\n\n-Emmett Prosser\n\nIn the 1980s, many members of the Forest County Potawatomi tribe lived in poverty.\n\nNo more.\n\nToday, members of the tribe receive tens of thousands of dollars in dividends.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Potawatomi Casino in the Menomonee River Valley happened.\n\nWhen it first opened around 1990 at 1720 W. Canal St., the facility was a large bingo hall with a few hundred slot machines of questionable legality and little outside regulation.\n\nThe tribe’s reservation is in northern Wisconsin, making the Milwaukee casino the nation’s first off-reservation tribal casino. The land where the casino is located is believed to have once been a Potawatomi village, according to a Milwaukee Public Museum history of the tribe.\n\nIn its initial years, the tribe shared its gaming revenue with the Indian Community School and a non-Indian management company. Those deals have since expired.\n\nToday, the casino is a major Milwaukee tourist attraction and an unmissable part of the city’s skyline. It rakes in more than $400 million in gambling winnings a year. A chunk of those winnings goes to members of the tribe in the form of per-capita payments estimated to be more than $70,000 per member.\n\nThe gambling hall draws nearly 6 million visitors a year and the 784,000-square-foot casino offers a range of ways to win or lose money, including about 3,000 slot machines, sports book, craps and a variety of table games including poker and blackjack.\n\nAnd since 1999, The Forest County Potawatomi Foundation has donated about $75 million to Milwaukee-area nonprofits, according to a spokesperson for the tribe.\n\n-Cary Spivak\n\nDo you know where you were in 1880?\n\nThat’s a trick question — you were surely not born, but if you were, you could’ve been among the first to munch on some of the finest sausage to come out of Milwaukee at that time.\n\nLuckily, you still can enjoy it. That’s because Usinger’s Famous Sausage has stood the test of time since founder Fred Usinger moved to Milwaukee from Germany and started his own successful sausage shop in 1880.\n\nIn the nearly century and a half since, the company has grown to have a wide shipping network while retaining its beloved place in Milwaukee, with its vintage-style building, tasty and bountiful meats and a rather helpful staff. Don’t forget about the storied elves — prominent in local advertisements and in the deli’s window displays, the company touts them as the invisible makers of its beloved sausage.\n\nUsinger’s sausage earned a spot in the Milwaukee Public Museum’s Streets of Milwaukee exhibit and in an episode of “Top Chef.” There’s even an annual Fred Usinger Day on Feb. 23.\n\nPerhaps a 1980 ad in the Milwaukee Journal put it best: “In 1880, Milwaukee got its first electric street lights, its first native mayor, and its first taste of Usinger’s sausage. It was a very good year.”\n\nIt was a very good year, indeed. And, thankfully, those tastes have continued for 144 years.\n\n-David Clarey\n\nWisconsin’s oldest continually operating gay bar wasn’t always easy to spot. When June Brehm opened This Is It! at 418 E. Wells St. in 1968, Milwaukee’s LGBTQ+ scene operated under the radar, and closeted patrons made use of the bar’s rear entrance to avoid being identified.\n\nToday, This Is It! welcomes patrons with a concrete facade adorned with a diamond pattern in the colors of the rainbow.\n\nDrag superstar and Wisconsin native Trixie Mattel became a co-owner with George Schneider in 2021.\n\nNot only is This Is It! a Milwaukee institution — it’s one of the country’s oldest LGBTQ+ bars. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin recognized Brehm and her son Joseph for their contributions to Wisconsin’s LGBTQ+ community, and the bar became the site of the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display in 2019.\n\n“This Is It! is not Milwaukee’s favorite gay bar, it is Milwaukee’s favorite bar,” Mattel said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Everyone in town has a personal story or anecdote, or sometimes even a night they can barely remember. The exterior has rainbow accents that invite all walks of life into the space, and remind people to come in and act right. It reminds people that even if you’re homophobic, not in this (expletive) building you’re not.”\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nA symbol of Milwaukee’s proud brewing history, bottles of Miller Lite can be seen in the hands of drinkers at dive bars and tailgates across Milwaukee.\n\nIt’s probably the most ubiquitous of the Miller beers — Miller Chill, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life and Miller 64 Extra Light — in a town where the Miller name still looms large (literally — the large red Miller sign can be seen by anyone driving into downtown from the west on Interstate 94).\n\nIn 1973, Miller Brewing bought a low-calorie “Lite” brand of beer from Chicago-based Meister Brau Inc. and turned it into what’s now known as Miller Lite. From there, the company advertised the beer with the help of sports stars like Mickey Mantle, John Madden and Bob Uecker with the popular line “Tastes great … less filling.”\n\nToday, Miller Lite and other Miller beers are under the MolsonCoors’ list of brands.\n\nIn 1996, Miller acquired the naming rights to the Milwaukee Brewers’ yet-to-be-built stadium, which opened in 2001. It was called Miller Park until the naming rights agreement expired in 2020 and American Family Insurance took over, renaming the stadium American Family Field.\n\nBut naturally, Miller Lite can still be found for sale at the stadium during Brewers’ games.\n\n-Alec Johnson\n\nCathedral Square is home to many summer festivals.\n\nThere’s Jazz in the Park, Bastille Days and the dazzling Christmas tree display that wash Cathedral Square in lights at night.\n\nBut on the corner of Kilbourn and Jackson stands a metal plaque that marks a little-known event that occurred more than a century and a half ago. Passersby rarely stop to note the significance of that historical marker, erected in 2001 by the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\nIt tells the story of Joshua Glover, an escaped slave from Missouri. Glover found refuge and freedom in Wisconsin until he was captured and jailed under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. His imprisonment stirred nearly 5,000 anti-slavery demonstrators who stormed the Milwaukee County Jail — which stood on present-day Cathedral Square — to break Glover out on March 10, 1854.\n\nBut Glover was still a wanted man.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act called for the recapture of freedom seekers or escaped slaves like Glover to be returned to their owners. Glover was on the run for years fearing recapture by his slave owner, a man named Benammi Stone Garland.\n\nWith the help of Wisconsin’s Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses manned by abolitionists who offered safety and shelter to runaway slaves, Glover eventually made his way to Canada and to freedom.\n\nGlover’s story is also depicted on a mural on the I-43 overpass on Fond du Lac Avenue.\n\n-LaRisa R. Lynch\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Milwaukee at least twice. Now, Milwaukee honors King’s legacy with a statue in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nKing’s first recorded speech in Milwaukee was in August 1957 at the Grand Avenue Congressional Church, now the Irish Cultural & Heritage Center on West Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nHe returned during a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement in January 1964, where he spoke to over 6,000 at the Milwaukee Auditorium (now the Miller High Life Theatre).\n\nIn the biggest showing of support for King, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people marched on Milwaukee just a few days removed from his assassination. The march was considered the largest civil rights demonstration in the city’s history.\n\nKing’s Milwaukee sculpture is located at North King Drive and West Vine Street.

And the term “March Madness” — describing the unpredictability of upsets and bracket busters — was not widely used until the ’80s.\n\nIt was legendary coach Al McGuire’s last game leading Marquette. He came into the game with a 25-7 record, after sneaking into the tournament, to the Tar Heels’ 28-5 record.\n\nOne of McGuire’s key strategies was to not give North Carolina any lead. If they led, the Tar Heels were sure to do the dreaded Four Corners Offense, a “stall offense” where the players would pass the ball to kill time.\n\nThe teams could take 10 minutes for one possession — there was no 30-second shot clock to keep the game moving. There was no 3-point line.\n\nDespite the fact basketball was played so much differently then, it is still remembered each year when Marquette plays in the NCAA tourney — as the only time Marquette men’s basketball won it all.\n\nIf anyone needs any reminding, the original trophy is in the Walk of Champions display at Marquette’s Al McGuire Center.\n\n-Cathy Kozlowicz\n\nCue the “Happy Days” theme song. The Bronze Fonz, a life-size statue that pays tribute to Arthur Fonzarelli, is a pillar of the city’s downtown RiverWalk.\n\nThe set-in-Milwaukee sitcom ran in the ’70s and ‘80s, but Fonzie — played by Henry Winkler — remains a beloved Brew City icon.\n\nVisit Milwaukee had spearheaded an effort that raised $75,000 for the statue, and artist Gerald Sawyer brought it to life. The statue arrived in 2008 with a lot of fanfare, including a parade, the king of cool himself, other castmates and the stars of “Happy Days” spinoff “Laverne & Shirley.”\n\n“It is a great honor,” Winkler said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview. “You cannot be blase about that, no matter how much time goes by.”\n\nWhen the statue disappeared to undergo routine maintenance a couple years back, it caused quite the stir. About 40 people attended a ceremony marking its return.\n\nWant to see the Bronze Fonz for yourself? It’s located on the east side of the RiverWalk just south of Wells Street. And while you’re there, you might want to snap a pic. The statue is one of the city’s most selfied landmarks.\n\n-Hannah Kirby\n\nTomatoes are just one of the many vegetables you’ll find planted at Alice’s Garden, one of the city’s best-known community gardens, on the city’s north side at North 21st Street and West Garfield Avenue.\n\nBorn out of an abandoned highway project, the 2-acre garden is located along a larger, 3-mile corridor where entire blocks of houses were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the Park West Freeway. The project cut through the city’s west and north sides, displacing several thousand residents and disrupting the community’s economy. Ultimately, the highway was never built, largely because of sustained neighborhood opposition. In its wake, large swaths of empty land were left.\n\nOut of that empty land sprang Alice’s Garden, now a thriving community garden and gathering place. The garden is there to reconnect city residents to the land and to oft-lost traditions of growing fresh, healthy food.\n\nGardeners come from all ethnicities and cultures, and their plots often speak to their heritage. In a Native American’s garden might be corn, beans and squash, known as “the three sisters” for how they are planted close together, for mutual benefit. A Black gardener might grow black-eyed peas, collard greens and okra in homage to past ancestors.\n\nNot only is the garden a place to cultivate food, but also relationships. Walking paths lined with herbs invite visitors for a stroll. Kids race across the grass or sit on picnic blankets for monthly storytimes. The pavilion shelters people sharing fellowship and a meal.\n\n-Sarah Volpenhein\n\nOne sign that summer is here in Milwaukee is the volleyball nets going up at Bradford Beach. Once the weather gets nice, it’s common to see people of all skill levels bumping, setting and spiking at the city’s largest beach during the afternoons and evenings pretty much any day of the week.\n\nFrom late May until September, the beach is home to more than 30 volleyball nets. The nets are currently managed by Volley Life, a local company that organizes beach volleyball clinics, tournaments and leagues.\n\nIn 2016, the beach hosted the USA Volleyball Junior Beach National Championships, and, at the end of this summer, it will host the Badger Region Beach Championships.\n\nBut, you don’t need to be a former high school volleyball star to join in on the summer fun.\n\nVolley Life has multiple leagues nearly every day of the week encompassing skill levels from those just learning the game to experienced players competing for prize money. When leagues are not playing, nets are open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nThe nickname “Cream City” might make some think of milk.\n\nBut Milwaukee’s popular moniker does not stem from the dairy or beer typically associated with Wisconsin. It has to do with brick.\n\nLook around and you’ll see them. The light-colored, yellowish bricks are the main material in a number of old buildings across the city: the former Schlitz brewery, Holy Trinity Church (now known as Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church), the Woman’s Club of Wisconsin and other industrial buildings and row houses.\n\nThe so-called cream city bricks were first used in the Milwaukee area in the 1830s. The material came from a clay found in the Menomonee River Valley filled with magnesium and lime. When put to fire, the clay produced a yellowy, cream-colored brick.\n\nThe bricks were widely exported and made it to major U.S. cities like Chicago and New York. But they remain a distinctly Milwaukee look and give the state’s largest city its name: Cream City.\n\n-Lawrence Andrea\n\nA hidden gem in Milwaukee’s premier lakefront property, Lake Park, is a 2,000-year-old ancient Indigenous burial mound.\n\nIt is a large conical mound about 40 feet in diameter and 2 feet high overlooking Lake Michigan near Lake Drive and Locust Street.\n\nThe mound was built by Indigenous people during what archaeologists call the Middle Woodland Culture between 300 B.C. and 400 A.D.\n\nMilwaukee was once home to hundreds, or even thousands, of these ancient mounds, but they were destroyed by development. The Lake Park mound is the last one left in the city.\n\n-Frank Vaisvilas\n\nFew signs bring as much joy as the one that reads “MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MARKET.”\n\nThe large red neon sign hovers above the market’s west entrance, beckoning to passersby and serving as a de facto billboard for downtown and the Third Ward. It glows at night, and casts a shimmering reflection even on the rainiest of days. Get off that concrete freeway, it tells visitors. (Who among us hasn’t driven past the sign and wondered why they’re still on I-794 instead of walking through the public market, stopping by the lakefront, or visiting one of the city’s many festivals?)\n\nThe sign alone has basically become a local landmark. And the market itself, which opened in 2005, is a sleek space full of natural light and packed with local vendors selling an impressive range of goods – including cheese, spices, wine, fresh fish on ice, flowers, chocolate and Milwaukee merch.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Market sits at the corner of what was once known as Commission Row, a stretch of Broadway that was once packed with Italian fruit and v", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/23"}]}

One avid traveler from the Bay Area called the ordinance “absurd” and “arbitrary” after renting a home in the city earlier this year.\n\nA regular user of online listing sites such as Airbnb and VRBO, Shirin Oloumi-Knerr says she enjoys going on ski weekends with her husband and three other couples they frequently travel with. Many times, this means making the drive up the twisting mountain roads of the Sierra Nevada and renting a house together at Lake Tahoe.\n\n“We felt like staying in one house was the best way to cook meals together and hang out in larger common spaces that were still private,” Oloumi-Knerr said.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhile visiting in February, however, Oloumi-Knerr noticed something about the South Lake Tahoe house they were staying at.\n\nThe property was peppered with warning signs threatening steep fines, not just for noise but also what she considers “harmless, arbitrary acts” such as parking on the street and hot tub use. In addition to paying a minimum $1,000 fine, Oloumi-Knerr says she was shocked to find out that property managers also get fined $1,000 by the city for renter violations, but the fine is typically passed on to guests.\n\nThis means vacation home renters essentially get fined twice to the tune of $2,000 total.\n\nFor Oloumi-Knerr, the thought of paying that much money for simply parking on the street or using the hot tub at the wrong time was dumbfounding.\n\n“I’m a government lawyer — rules and regulations are my bread and butter,” Oloumi-Knerr said. “However, these rules seem to have no rhyme or reason and have the potential for abusive enforcement.”\n\nOloumi-Knerr’s concerns reflect an ongoing battle being waged around Lake Tahoe’s shores as the Airbnb economy continues to disrupt traditional lodging and send more tourists to residential neighborhoods.\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe is just one of many cities around the nation playing catch up to the phenomenon with their laws. After years of community debate and public meetings, South Lake Tahoe approved its updated vacation home rental or VHR ordinance in November, with the law officially taking effect on Dec. 22.\n\nINTERACTIVE MAP: Complaints and citations against vacation home rentals during the first 3 months of South Lake Tahoe’s updated VHR ordinance. The red points represent complaints that resulted in a citation. Yellow points resulted in no citation. (Data provided by city of South Lake Tahoe. Map by Brian Duggan, RGJ)\n\nThe intent behind the change was to control the explosive growth of the vacation home rental industry, particularly from what critics view as its encroachment on residential neighborhoods. At the top of the list of priorities is curbing incidents of bad behavior by tenants, including the loud noises, trash and occupancy issues that can arise when short-term rental properties are used by large groups or partiers.\n\nA Reno Gazette Journal analysis of complaints filed against nearly 200 properties from Dec. 22 to late March, however, found the ordinance has primarily been used to cite South Lake Tahoe visitors for parking violations.\n\nReveling partygoers, meanwhile, were few and far between even with Christmas and New Year's included.\n\nFindings of the RGJ investigation include:\n\n• About a third of the complaints turned out to be violations: Of the 186 complaints made by neighbors against properties for allegedly violating the city’s vacation home rental ordinance, 74 — a little over a third — were deemed by code enforcement to be violations. At least one in five complaints were false alarms.\n\n• The law is being used to enforce hefty parking violations: Parking accounted for 51 percent of all complaints made by callers and 60 percent of all violations cited by enforcement officers. The total fines levied for parking during the first three months of the updated VHR ordinance added up to about $90,000.\n\n• Noise, the second-highest complaint, accounted for just a fifth of all complaints: Out of those 47 noise complaints, 10 were determined to be violations, with only three being tied to partying. The rest were deemed by enforcement officers to be within reason and not too loud.\n\nWith parking accounting for the bulk of violations that vacation home rental users are being cited for, the trend raises questions about whether the stricter ordinance is unfairly punishing visitors for minor issues instead of focusing on more serious offenders.\n\nOne person who isn’t a fan of the ordinance’s one-fine-fits-all approach is Oloumi-Knerr, who feels it places needless stress on visitors, who have to worry about unwittingly breaking its rules. Oloumi-Knerr says she has such \"strong negative feelings\" toward the ordinance that she has decided to cross off South Lake Tahoe in her list of places to stay when visiting the area.\n\n“First, it doesn’t make me feel welcome in the neighborhood,” Oloumi-Knerr said. “I don’t want to place myself in a situation where I could be otherwise acting legally but am violating a local, unreasonable and expensive ordinance.”\n\nThe birth of Tahoe’s strictest vacation rental law\n\nIt’s an early Tuesday morning in March and South Lake Tahoe resident Peggy Bourland was packing her things in a hurry.\n\nReached by phone while preparing to leave for Los Angeles, a rushed Bourland says she only has an hour to get ready and does not have time to talk. Once the subject of vacation home rentals came up, however, an exasperated Bourland couldn’t help but vent her frustration.\n\n“This issue goes back 15 years,” Bourland said. “We’re looking for a remedy … to halt this runaway train that’s sort of happening with the issue of additional vacation home rentals without a lot of restriction.”\n\nThe anger felt by residents such as Bourland stems from what they see as the increasing encroachment by vacation home rentals into their neighborhoods. As more visitors turn to rentals, a larger chunk of the tourist crowd is being funneled from areas such as downtown to the city’s residential neighborhoods.\n\nThis can especially add up during busy seasons. Each year, about 3 million people visit Lake Tahoe. That tops Yellowstone Park and rivals visitor numbers for the Grand Canyon, said nonprofit advocacy group, the Tahoe Fund. Meanwhile, the resident population of Lake Tahoe year-round is about 53,000. Throw in visitors into the mix and its total population can swell up to 300,000 on peak days, according to the Tahoe Fund.\n\nThe issue with population goes beyond just hard numbers, according to critics of vacation home rentals. Bourland blames the influx of investor-owned, short-term rental properties for a significant drop in the residential population of South Lake Tahoe.\n\nCensus Bureau numbers back Bourland’s claim about a population decline.\n\nThe residential population of South Lake Tahoe fell by 9.3 percent from 23,609 in 2000 to 21,403 in 2010, according to the Census Bureau. The numbers increased slightly to 21,717 in 2016 but are still below the numbers from nearly two decades ago.\n\nThose in the vacation home rental industry question the link between VHRs and the population decline. Bourland, however, strongly believes that the explosion in vacation home rentals is further tilting the demographic balance of the city’s residential areas toward visitors.\n\nThe longtime resident, who started living in Tahoe in 1972, says it’s ironic that more tourists are staying in residential neighborhoods while more full-time residents end up staying in motels because they can’t find or afford housing.\n\n“Residential housing is being absorbed by mostly out-of-town investors who buy so-called second homes to turn them into investments as vacation home rentals,” Bourland said. “Our neighborhoods have fewer full-time residents and (our) sense of community is being eroded.”\n\nThe frustration felt by some residents regarding VHR use culminated in the formation of the Tahoe Neighborhoods Group three years ago. The organization, which counts Bourland as a member, has been strongly pushing for stricter regulations to curb the growth of vacation home rentals in Tahoe. Issues cited by residents include parking, trash and noise violations by rental users.\n\nHEAT MAP: Hot spots for South Lake Tahoe neighborhoods that receive the most complaints against vacation home rentals. Areas that have more concentration of complaints are highlighted by brighter colors. (Data provided by city of South Lake Tahoe. Map by Brian Duggan, RGJ)\n\nSuch concerns were cited by South Lake Tahoe as one of the driving forces behind beefing up the city’s VHR laws. Initially created in 2005, the city’s ordinance for vacation home rentals has been modified several times, said Tracy Sheldon, a public information officer for the city of South Lake Tahoe. The most recent change called for stricter enforcement of the ordinance as well as steeper penalties for violations.\n\n“This was a response from city council to concerns, specifically from vacation rental management companies and community citizens, requesting that the enforcement be stepped up — which it has — and also for the fines to be increased,” Sheldon said.\n\nAlthough opinions vary about the merits of the change, there is consensus on one thing: Area property managers and officials from around the basin who spoke to the Reno Gazette Journal agreed that South Lake Tahoe’s ordinance is in a league of its own.\n\n“It’s by far the strictest in the basin, no question,” said Steve Teshara, CEO of the Lake Tahoe South Shore Chamber of Commerce.\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe’s ordinance specifically has five main areas of focus, said Lauren Gresh, a Tahoe-based operations manager for international vacation rental management company Vacasa. Those are noise, parking, occupancy, hot tub use and trash. The ordinance, for example, imposes limits on a rental’s number of occupants based on the number of rooms and parking spaces. It also prohibits hot tub use by vacation home rental users from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m., as well as parking on the street and unpaved surfaces at all times.\n\nMost of the requirements are clearly targeted at curbing nuisances in residential neighborhoods, Gresh said. This includes noise and overcrowding as well as excessive parking, which can arise when people rent homes to hold parties during events like spring break or New Year’s.\n\nVisitors can’t simply claim ignorance about the rules as the ordinance requires signage to be clearly posted on VHR properties. One key change since December is that violators no longer get a warning. Any violation automatically earns a fine.\n\nGresh says the penalties are no joke, with renters potentially facing double the $1,000 minimum if their actions cause a property owner to be fined as well.\n\n“This is very important and we want all our guests to be fully aware of what these regulations are so there are no surprises and they plan accordingly when they come up here,” Gresh said. “If they want to have friends over, for example, they need to book a house that can accommodate that amount of occupancy or they risk getting a violation.”\n\nDespite being the strictest around the lake basin, Tahoe’s vacation rental ordinance still is not the toughest in the nation, said Greg Holcomb, government relations manager of the Vacation Rental Management Association.\n\nCalifornia communities such as Santa Monica, for example, have outright bans on short-term vacation rentals, Holcomb said. Then there are places such as Cannon Beach in Oregon, which has a lottery system in place for people who want to acquire a VHR license.\n\nGenerally, major metropolitan cities — places such as San Francisco, New York, Chicago — have the most onerous and complicated ordinances for vacation rentals, Holcomb said. The Vacation Rental Management Association blames the confusing nature of some of these rules for the low compliance rates seen in the larger metros that have tough laws for vacation home rentals.\n\n“A stricter set of regulations doesn’t mean that the community is solving the problems they are hoping to solve,” Holcomb said. “Creating onerous rules is due to current policies failing and the community not addressing the actual core issues, they are simply throwing more hurdles for property owners.”\n\nA question of fairness\n\nAs a young boy, Stu Roberson remembers leaving the hustle and bustle of the Bay Area with his family and making their way through the pine tree-dotted landscapes of the Sierra Nevada each year.\n\nFor the Robersons, those winding mountain roads always led to the same destination: Lake Tahoe.\n\nIt was on the sandy shores of a rented house in Agate Bay that Roberson caught the Tahoe bug. Today, the 59-year-old and his wife own two Tahoe properties that they rent out and also manage several others as part of their business, RnR Vacation Rentals.\n\nRoberson and his wife officially became Tahoe residents this year as well. With some Tahoe locals voicing strong opposition against vacation home rentals owned by out-of-state residents, the change in residency is a good move for the Robersons in more ways than one.\n\nAlthough Roberson rents out his own houses to visitors and manages vacation rentals for others, he is not completely opposed to South Lake Tahoe’s vacation home rental ordinance. The law, for example, is great at dealing with problem renters or simply encouraging vacation rental users to be on their best behavior.\n\n“The good part is that (the regulations have) given us some teeth,” Roberson said. “The ordinance is great at holding people accountable.”\n\nAt least four of the nearly 200 complaints filed against South Lake Tahoe vacationers during the first three months of the updated ordinance actually were filed by property owners or managers who were worried that their renters were not following the rules, the Reno Gazette Journal found.\n\nIn some cases, however, Roberson believes that the tough, shotgun approach employed by the ordinance goes too far. A closer look at the city’s beefed-up ordinance shows three key changes that can cause property renters and vacationers to pay a high price — literally — for even minor violations.\n\nOne is the addition of a cap that limits the number of vacation home rental permits issued by the city to 1,400. Critics claim the caps violate their property rights, including the ability to rent out their houses in a market that has a long history of vacation home rental use.\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe already issued 1,398 permits by late March, according to spokeswoman Sheldon. Sheldon also confirmed that the city has no plans to raise the permit limit, dashing the hopes of people such as Roberson.\n\nVacation rental advocates were hoping that the 1,400 limit was just a starting point that can be tweaked based on demand. Barring an increase in the cap, applicants will have to wait for openings that are created when existing permits are either not renewed by a current holder or taken away for violations.\n\nRoberson says he does not fully agree with the need for permit caps but understands the reason behind them.\n\n“On one hand, I do believe in a free market but, on the other hand, we do need to think about how far we want this to go,” Roberson said. “Do we want all residential areas to be vacation home rentals? I don’t think anybody wants that.”\n\nRoberson would like to see new permit reviews done on a monthly basis instead of a quarterly basis. As the waiting list for open slots grows, it adds a lot of uncertainty for applicants because they have no idea when they are likely to get a permit, Roberson said.\n\nThe cap is also being blamed for causing unintended consequences, including some of the very issues it is trying to prevent.\n\nPrior to the limit on permits, South Lake Tahoe’s vacation home rental market essentially self-regulated its numbers, Roberson said. Once word of a potential cap came out, however, the city saw a surge in applicants who were trying to get ahead of the change in the law, Roberson said.\n\nBourland of the Tahoe Neighborhoods Group confirmed the increase.\n\n“We have 259 more vacation home rentals than we did when the debate started 3 years ago and these are in residential neighborhoods,” Bourland said. “There’s been a couple of very rigid well-intended ordinances that haven’t really resulted in any reduction of numbers (for vacation home rentals).”\n\nA second concern — and a big one for folks such as Roberson as well as vacationers — involves the larger fines. After Dec. 22, the minimum fine for violating the ordinance was raised to $1,000 each for the renter and property owner. Because of a one-size-fits-all approach to fines, the harsh punishment often does not match the violation, Roberson said.\n\nIt’s one thing to fine visitors who knowingly bring in way too many people and cause a racket in the neighborhood, Roberson said. Hitting a visitor with a hefty fine for parking on the street for a few minutes, on the other hand, seems unnecessarily heavy-handed, he said. Punishing vacationers for street parking seems even more unfair when residents and long-term renters are not subject to the same rules, according to Roberson.\n\nThe issue is compounded by the fact that vacation home rental contracts typically make renters responsible for paying the fines incurred by property owners due to a vacationer’s violations. This means visitors end up paying double the fine.\n\nRoberson recounted one time when a customer briefly parked in the street during breakfast and quickly got reported to code enforcement by a neighbor within minutes.\n\n“Our poor customer had to pay a $2,000 fine because he parked in front of the street, which everyone else can do,” Roberson said. “This wasn’t someone who was making a lot of noise or was being a troublemaker — this was exactly the type of person you want visiting Lake Tahoe.”\n\nOf the 45 vacationers fined for parking from Dec. 22 to late March, 10 did not exceed the limit for the number of cars allowed on the property, the RGJ’s analysis found. Instead, they were mostly parked on the street or the dirt, which is considered a violation.\n\nOne example involves a case from Dec. 28 on a property that allowed parking for three cars. At the time, one car was parked on the street, another car was parked on the driveway and a third was parked in the dirt next to the driveway. The occupants, who were unloading at the time, were fined $1,000 as was the property owner, according to the citation report.\n\nAlthough vacation rental owners can pass fines to their renters, they are not completely off the hook from violations. If a property gets three violations or “three strikes” in two years, the owner of that property loses their permit permanently. Roberson called the punishment too severe, especially if the offenses involved minor violations such as street parking. In contrast, long-term rentals are not subject to the same “three-strikes rule.”\n\n“If you had three citations in any two-year period, you lose your permit … not just until you reapply, you lose it for life,” Roberson said. “That’s a pretty severe consequence, particularly if it was the result of having a neighbor who was just fed up (about having vacation home rentals in the neighborhood).”\n\nA neighborhood civil war\n\nRoberson says he understands the frustration felt by some residents with vacation home rentals. If people are making too much noise or a specific property seems to be a serial offender and always has issues, such cases should be shut down, he said.\n\nAt the same time, Roberson feels that the new laws have “generated a bit of a posse out there” and given the most disgruntled neighbors license to go around and actively search for incidents to report. In some cases, the gap between a violation and the arrival of a code enforcement officer is so short that it is almost certain whoever made the call was actively monitoring the house, Roberson said.\n\nTeshara, who advocates for a balanced approach to regulating vacation home rentals, was critical of what he described as “militant anti-VHR people” who have an ax to grind. Although some complaints against vacation home rentals have merit — he has experienced some of those challenges with visitors himself — some of them go too far, Teshara said.\n\n“We know there are some people who specifically target a vacation rental (or owner) in their neighborhood to make sure that person loses their license,” Teshara said. “It’s a bit of a harassment situation.”\n\nThe Reno Gazette Journal found at least one instance where a neighbor was specifically targeting one rental property. On Feb. 19, a South Lake Tahoe code enforcement officer responded to a complaint about a property on Sky Meadows Court having too many cars, too many people and an incorrect sign.\n\nIn the ensuing report, the officer wrote about waking up a “peaceful church group,” who admitted to having one too many cars. As a result, the officer had to issue them a $1,000 citation for parking. The officer noted, however, that the property had the proper number of occupants and the correct signs. According to the report, the officer also was stopped by the neighbor who made the complaint upon arrival.\n\n“(Complainant) flagged me down and said, ‘I don’t have a problem with renters, but with the owner,’” the officer wrote down.\n\nThe same house also was reported on Dec. 30 for having too many people. The property was occupied by the owner at the time and did not receive a citation. Properties on Sky Meadows Court have received 6 complaints in the first two months after the updated ordinance came into effect. Only one of those complaints resulted in a violation.\n\nConcerned about what it considers to be extreme positions among the anti-vacation rental crowd, the Lake Tahoe South Shore Chamber of Commerce decided to join forces with other groups to form the Sustainable Community Alliance. The group is particularly worried about the possibility of a wider ban on vacation home rentals in South Lake Tahoe.\n\nTeshara criticized the city for acting too slowly and allowing the raw emotions felt by residents to fester over the years.\n\n“They sort of let the issue become a very emotional one and that was unfortunate,” Teshara said. “I think there’s still a balance that can be struck between vacation home rentals and a complete ban and that’s what the Sustainable Community Alliance is all about.”\n\nThe city, meanwhile, says it has been very open to the community with its process to improve its vacation home rental ordinance.\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe says it made a strong effort to ensure that it received input from everyone and that both sides of the issue were well represented as the ordinance was being updated. The city pointed to the support it received from not just citizens but vacation rental management companies for the new regulations.\n\n“Our changes to the ordinance were made in response to specific requests from both groups,” Sheldon said. “Many, many public meetings were held on this.”\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe also pushed back against criticism that describes the updated ordinance as an anti-Airbnb law. The ordinance specifically focuses on the management of VHRs and the conduct of the people who rent them, not the online platforms that are driving the Internet-fueled vacation home rental boom, the city said.\n\n“Airbnb is not a vacation rental management company,” South Lake Tahoe’s Sheldon said. “There has been some confusion with the ordinance regarding Airbnb and VRBO but those are tools used for advertising and not tools used to manage properties.”\n\nAt the same time, homeowners who use online sites to list their properties but do not have a VHR permit from the city will be issued a citation, Sheldon said. Many professional management companies also use sites such as Airbnb and VRBO to list their properties.\n\nLack of consensus in vacation rental industry\n\nThe response from the industry to South Lake Tahoe’s stricter vacation home rental ordinance has been mixed so far.\n\nTwo heavyweights in the vacation home rental space, HomeAway and Airbnb, struck a conciliatory tone when asked by the Reno Gazette Journal about the ordinance. HomeAway, which acquired VRBO in 2006, sounded especially positive about the stricter regulations.\n\n“We applaud South Lake Tahoe’s pursuit of common-sense vacation rental regulations and the creation of a dedicated Vacation Home Rental team within the city government,” said Eric Donovan, a Washington, D.C.-based spokesman for HomeAway. “We look forward to continuing productive conversations with our local vacation rental owners and managers, neighborhood leaders and policymakers regarding the rollout of rules that benefit local homeowners, the South Lake Tahoe economy and the community at large.”\n\nAirbnb, while not criticizing the change, offered a more measured response.\n\n“We are committed to promoting travel and tourism to South Lake Tahoe and to making sure that the local economy upon which it relies, is able to prosper,” said Jasmine Mora, a spokeswoman for Airbnb. “We want to work with cities on reasonable rules that promote responsible tourism and also allow families to visit South Lake Tahoe year-round.”\n\nNot everyone in the industry, however, was as conciliatory. The Vacation Rental Management Association, a Washington, D.C.-based vacation rental advocacy group that represents a large number of members from 23 countries, gave a blistering response to the South Lake Tahoe ordinance.\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe’s cap, in particular, “seems arbitrary and will lead to confusion in the long-term,” VRMA government relations manager Holcomb said.\n\nHolcomb also raised concerns about the wording of the city’s occupancy rules, which states that occupancy will be calculated based on the number of people present at the property “at any given time.” The language essentially allows the city to fine an operator if a property is at maximum capacity and a delivery person, housekeeper, maintenance guy or neighbor walks into the house, Holcomb said. An RGJ analysis of all complaints made during the first three months of the law, however, showed that code enforcement officers did not cite properties for violations during two instances when a cleaning staff member was at a property.\n\nHolcomb admitted that there has been a trend not just in the United States but around the world to create regulatory frameworks around vacation homes and short-term rentals. In most cases, however, those regulations don’t include excessive fines and punishments that do not fit the purported crime, Holcomb said.\n\n“The lack of warnings and an excessive fine structure is criminalizing travelers and property owners,” Holcomb said.\n\n“Our members, who have been community staples for decades, are now strapped with difficult-to-navigate regulations like these that hinder their ability to conduct business and generate tourism and economic activity for vacation destinations like South Lake Tahoe.”\n\nOthers, meanwhile, contend that the ordinance does not go far enough. Fed up with what it sees as an inadequate response by the city of South Lake Tahoe, Bourland and the Tahoe Neighborhoods Group decided to launch a petition that seeks to phase out vacation home rentals that are outside of South Lake Tahoe’s tourist core within three years. The initiative, which requires signatures from 10 percent of the city’s registered voters in order to make the ballot for the November elections, makes exceptions for long-term rentals and properties that are owned by full-time residents.\n\nThe problem with the city’s VHR ordinance is that it does not address the root of the issue, which is allowing “incompatible uses” for vacation homes in residential neighborhoods, Bourland said.\n\n“The city seems to believe that higher fees and steep code enforcement fines will solve the problem (but) these are merely Band-Aids,” Bourland said. “The real problem is that we have transgressed on our zoning laws to provide special use permits for businesses to operate in residential zones.”\n\nPlaying catch up\n\nIdeally, it would be great to have a more uniform set of ordinances for vacation home rentals around Lake Tahoe to make things less confusing for visitors, according to representatives of several Tahoe counties.\n\nWhat works for one county, however, will not necessarily work for another. Although Placer County has no plans to emulate South Lake Tahoe’s ordinance, for example, the latter’s tougher stance is understandable, said Jennifer Merchant, deputy county executive officer for Placer.\n\n“North Lake Tahoe is geared more for families and outdoor recreation so we’re not as heavy on nightlife as South Lake Tahoe,” Merchant said. “Every single one of our own jurisdictions has a slightly different market as well.”\n\nThere’s another big reason why it would be tough to come up with uniform standards around the lake: money.\n\nPlacer County, for example, collected $18 million from transient occupancy taxes in its last fiscal year for short-term rentals, which includes vacation homes. The taxes are generated by room stays of 30 days or less. Placer directly invests 60 percent of its revenue from transient occupancy taxes into capital improvement, transit and other projects requested by visitors and locals alike, Merchant said.\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe also generates significant revenue from the industry. Of the $1 million in transient occupancy tax that the city collected in December, about $406,000 came from vacation home rentals managed by individuals and professional managers.\n\n“It’s fair to say that we get those phone calls from people (complaining about vacation rental users) but it’s hard for a community that’s really built on a tourist economy to turn away tourists,” Merchant said. “We have other secondary markets but tourism is our key economic driver.”\n\nPlacer also has a long history of allowing people to vacation rent their houses, with many homeowners relying on the rental income to pay the property’s mortgage. Instead of passing a separate ordinance for vacation rentals, Placer will continue to handle complaints through its nuisance laws.\n\nWashoe County, another area that borders Lake Tahoe, is taking a similar approach by handling vacation rental issues through its existing regulations. The bigger problem facing Washoe involves rental owners who don’t pay taxes, said Bob Webb, a Washoe County planning manager.\n\n“Now that we have a web-based exchange economy, we’re playing catch up a lot of times,” Webb said.\n\nA spokeswoman for another Tahoe county agreed. Eldorado County, which is where South Lake Tahoe is located, is working on changes to its own ordinance. There has been a lot of confusion about which ordinances apply to which areas ever since South Lake Tahoe's updated regulations were passed, said Carla Hass, Eldorado County communications director.\n\n“Airbnb wasn’t even in existence when our ordinance was first written, so there’s a little bit of catch up for us,” said Carla Hass, Eldorado County communications director.\n\nFor some vacationers, they say South Lake Tahoe’s ordinance simply goes too far by essentially turning visitors into second-class citizens. Being fined for behavior that is OK for residents and long-term renters remains a point of contention for those opposed to the tougher law.\n\n“A quiet soaker watching the sunrise gets a $1,000 fine,” Oloumi-Knerr said. “This is a hot tub that is on the home’s private property, and yet its use is controlled in a way that could lead to absurd results.”\n\nFor groups such as the Lake Tahoe South Shore Chamber of Commerce, comments such as Oloumi-Knerr’s are a major source of concern. The last thing any of the cities and counties in Lake Tahoe want is to develop a reputation of being unfriendly to visitors, particularly since the area is heavily dependent on tourism dollars, Teshara said.\n\nTeshara says he has heard his fair share of incidents involving tourists who excitedly arrive at their vacation rental, only to be fined within minutes while unloading because they parked their car on the street. This is especially a problem in neighborhoods that do not have clearly delineated streets or parking areas, Teshera said.\n\nBourland, meanwhile, placed the blame for such issues on the city, not the members of the Tahoe Neighborhoods Group.\n\n“One thousand-dollar fines for sometimes minor infractions is how the city has chosen to attempt to control the issue,” Bourland said. “Once again (it’s) a Band-Aid rather than addressing the real issue of allowing incompatible uses.”\n\nClassifying vacation home rentals as incompatible and taking them out of residential neighborhoods, however, is not a balanced approach, Teshara said. If anything, it’s the kind of move that can lead to unintended consequences, he said.\n\n“If you ban vacation home rentals, the city budget will take a significant hit,” Teshara said. “The same people who say ‘well, we don’t like them so get rid of them,’ they’ll be the first ones to complain when city services are cut.”\n\nDespite her less than ideal experience during her last visit, Oloumi-Knerr continues to be a fan of visiting Lake Tahoe. At the same time, she does not want to stress out again about potentially running afoul of South Lake Tahoe’s laws.\n\nInstead, she plans to take her business somewhere else where she can park on the street or enjoy watching the Tahoe sunrise in peace while relaxing in a hot tub.\n\n“If the rules were based on common sense, I could follow them without fear (but) it’s not clear to me what the purpose of this ordinance is,” Oloumi-Knerr said. “Now that I know it’s a South Lake Tahoe ordinance, I’m firmly a North Lake Tahoe fan.”\n\n— This story is part of a Reno Gazette Journal series on Lake Tahoe’s struggles with the explosive growth of vacation home rentals and how it is splitting the popular tourist destination’s community.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/oregon/2023/11/13/oregon-drinking-water-green-peter-reservoir-drawdown-south-santiam-lookout-point-reservoir/71518500007/", "title": "Extreme reservoir drops tax Oregon drinking water, tourism", "text": "This story was updated at 10 a.m. Tuesday\n\nLarry Nelson was taking a shower this fall when his water abruptly stopped.\n\n“I knew what happened right away — my well had gone dry,” said the 74-year-old Vietnam veteran, who lives east of Lowell along Lookout Point Reservoir. “The same thing had just happened to my neighbor.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/china/china-covid-sanya-lockdown-tourists-intl-hnk-mic", "title": "China Covid: Sanya lockdown traps thousands of holidaymakers ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nKnown for its sandy beaches, luxury resorts and duty-free shopping, the city of Sanya on China’s tropical Hainan island has long been a popular getaway for Chinese middle- and upper-class families.\n\nSince the weekend, however, what began as a leisurely escape has become a stress-filled travel nightmare for tens of thousands of holidaymakers, who are trapped in a sudden lockdown imposed by authorities to curb a spiraling Covid outbreak.\n\nDriven by a highly infectious Omicron subvariant – which authorities blame on contact with overseas seafood dealers at a fishing port – the outbreak has infected more than 1,200 people in Sanya since August 1. It has also spread to a dozen other cities and counties in Hainan, infecting more than 200 others.\n\nThat is a major outbreak by the standards of China’s zero-Covid policy, which aims to swiftly snuff out local flareups with snap lockdowns, mass testing, extensive contact tracing and quarantine.\n\nOn Saturday, the Sanya government hastily locked down the city of a million people, including some 80,000 tourists. Visitors wishing to leave must show five negative Covid tests taken over seven days, and authorities did not specify when the measures would be lifted.\n\nPublic transportation was suspended, people’s movements inside the city were restricted to emergency services, and transport links were halted.\n\nMore than 80% of flights leaving Sanya were canceled on Saturday, according to data from flight tracking company Variflight. All trains departing from the city were also canceled, state broadcaster CCTV said Saturday.\n\nThe mass, sudden flight cancellations led to scenes of chaos at the airport on Saturday, when some passengers who had already boarded were ordered to deplane, according to state media reports.\n\nA video widely circulated on Chinese social media shows a local official trying in vain to placate dozens of frustrated travelers outside the airport police station.\n\nSpeaking into a megaphone, the official promised the government would provide free food and hotel accommodation to travelers stranded at the airport, as a ring of police officers stood around him and pushed back the crowd.\n\n“I want to go home! Go home! Go home!” the crowd chanted in response.\n\nResidents queue up in heavy rain for Covid tests on August 8 in Sanya, 'China's Hawaii.' Sha Xiaofeng/VCG/Getty Images\n\nForced stays\n\nChina’s borders have been closed to international tourists since the start of the pandemic, meaning tourist hotspots like Sanya rely even more on domestic travelers.\n\nThe Sanya government said Saturday that tourists with canceled flights could book discounted hotel rooms. But for some families, the forced week-long stay may still come at a heavy price – especially as the Chinese economy has been battered by zero-Covid.\n\nOn Sunday, state-run news website The Paper reported that a family of 13 from the southwestern city of Chengdu would need to spend about $26,600 for an extra week at their five-star hotel, including charges of more than $100 per person for lunch and dinner buffets.\n\nThe report caused a stir on Chinese social media, with a related hashtag attracting 270 million views on China’s microblogging site Weibo as of Monday afternoon. Many comments expressed sympathy toward the family, while others questioned why they didn’t move into a cheaper hotel. After the outcry, the family said they were able to access cheaper food options at the hotel.\n\nOther social media posts by trapped tourists in Sanya accused some hotels of raising their prices to cash in on the forced stays. At a news conference Sunday, the Sanya government vowed to look into the complaints.\n\nIt said more than 3,200 tourists stuck at the airport on Saturday would be given seven days of accommodation and food. And about 5,000 workers had been sent to Hainan from other parts of the country to help with a mass Covid testing drive, officials added.\n\nA medical worker conducts Covid testing for a child on August 7 in Sanya. Visual China Group/Getty Images\n\nWhen will it end?\n\nFor many stranded tourists, the biggest concern is whether they will be allowed to leave after seven days. They fear the lockdown could be extended if the number of infections rises despite the restrictions.\n\nSchools in China are due to reopen after the summer break in three weeks, and some companies may not allow employees to work remotely for weeks on end.\n\nOn Monday, Sanya airport canceled all of its 418 flights, according to flight-tracking site Variflight.\n\nAmong the tourists stuck were Shanghai residents who had gone to Hainan for summer holidays after enduring a grueling two-month lockdown in the Chinese financial hub earlier this year.\n\nA foreign resident of Shanghai who arrived in Sanya on July 26 said he had to leave his hotel last Thursday because it was requisitioned by the local government as a quarantine facility. The hotel only gave him a day’s notice and left him to figure out alternative accommodation, he said.\n\nOver the past five days, he has waited in long lines for six Covid tests, he said.\n\n“This situation going forward is unsustainable,” said the tourist, who requested not to be named over fears of a nationalistic blowback. “It’s a little bit like Russian roulette on where you go, and whether or not that area is gonna get locked down.”\n\nFor many travelers mindful of the country’s Covid restrictions, Hainan had been considered a safe place because in the past it has reported very few cases.\n\nOther tourist hotspots have recently been struck by abrupt lockdown too. Last month, more than 2,000 tourists were trapped in the resort town of Beihai in southern China, after a lockdown was imposed over 500 infections.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/11/02/seals-maryland-winter-migration/814521001/", "title": "Have you spotted a seal? Meet Maryland's winter visitors: Column", "text": "Sandi Smith\n\ncolumnist\n\nAs the cold weather begins to set in, many of our migratory visitors begin their seasonal pilgrimage. Flocks of various bird species can be seen gathering and flying over our Coastal Bays, some leaving, others coming.\n\nMany migratory visitors that travel through our waterways go unnoticed by us. One winter visitor however, we will begin to see very soon: our beloved seals.\n\nSeal sightings in Delmarva, both in the bays and ocean, are a normal occurrence during the winter months. Seals are semiaquatic animals, which means they spend a portion of each day on land. Seals need to “haul out” for a variety of reasons; to rest, pup, or molt (shed). Young seals may haul out for up to a week.\n\nThe seals we see on our Delmarva beaches are typically young seals that have come ashore to rest or because they are in distress.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAlthough seals are not typically thought of as a local species, they probably have been visiting longer than we think. The Maryland Coastal Bays Program partnered with the Marine Animal Rescue Program seven years ago and created a program to provide public outreach regarding seals and their natural behaviors.\n\nThrough these programs, we learned the majority of residents had no idea seals were migratory visitors; however, there were a few residents that had a seal encounter. One encounter was in the ocean while surfing and the other was in the bay while duck hunting; both encounters occurred in the 1970s.\n\nSince 2011, seal sightings have become more common in our estuary, which means human encounters with seals are becoming more common as well. Seals have an appealing, even adorable, presence and appearance. Like the Assateague ponies, one can’t help but want to get closer to touch or feed them.\n\nBut human contact does more harm than good. Seals are large, wild animals and can be extremely dangerous. They will bite, and serious infections can be transmitted to you or your pet. Seals can carry viruses such as herpes and rabies.\n\nShould a seal happen to bite a person or dog, the seal will have to be destroyed to ensure the seal did not have rabies.\n\nIncreased contact with people eventually leads seals to habituate to humans. Habituated seals are more likely to suffer from negative human interactions and are less likely to avoid dangerous situations.\n\nFor instance, feeding seals encourages them to approach boats looking for handouts. This behavior has resulted in injuries from boat propellers.\n\nSeals are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. It is against the law to touch, feed or otherwise harass seals. Harassment occurs when your behavior changes their behavior.\n\nThe rule is to keep at least 40 yards away, about four car lengths, to give them their space. Avoid being noisy and report a seal haul out to MARP by call 410-576-3880 or 1-800-628-9944.\n\nIf you are fortunate to be out on the water this winter, keep your eyes peeled. Seals are likely to surface unexpectedly. If you see any on an island, please stay at least 50 yards away. This goes for non-motorized vehicles as well.\n\nClose approaches should be avoided, as they may elicit an alarm response, causing seals to rapidly enter the water. An exhausted seal is vulnerable to predators and illness. It is also suggested to limit viewing time to 30 minutes or less to minimize the stress placed on the seal.\n\nWith the help of citizens, MCBP, MARP, Ocean City Animal Control, and other partners, the message is getting out and is creating a source of information on local seal habits to aid scientists in the conservation of this significant and majestic species.\n\nMCBP’s Seal Steward program has become an integral component of this initiative. When a seal hauls out and is deemed healthy by the MARP response team, the seal stewards take shifts watching the seal, ensuring beach goers keep a safe distance.\n\nThey also provide specific information on the seal they are watching.\n\nMCBP and MARP will conduct seal steward training on Tuesday, Nov. 7, beginning at 5:30 p.m. at the West Ocean City Fire Department, 10124 Keyser Road, second floor. If you are interested in participating, email sandis@mdcoastalbays.org or call 410-213-2297 ext. 106.\n\nIf you spot a seal on the beach, we encourage you to please call MARP. If you see one in the bay, unless you think it’s in distress (please call MARP), we ask you to report it to MCBP either by registering it online at www.mdcoastalbays.org or by calling 410-213-229 ext. 106.\n\nWe hope and encourage our community to responsibly enjoy and protect our winter visitors.\n\nSandi Smith is the development and marketing coordinator with the Maryland Coastal Bays Program.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/31/us/millennials-turning-40-shoichet-cec", "title": "Millennials like me turned 40 this year. And everything you think you ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor years I believed a lot of what I heard about millennials – those avocado-toast eating, latte-guzzling, selfie-taking narcissists who still live in their parents’ basements and can’t get their lives together.\n\nThen I realized something that surprised me: I’m a millennial, as are many of the people I know and love.\n\nI’d long assumed my friends and classmates were older and wiser than this much-maligned group. But when I started covering demographics for CNN, I learned that 1981 is the birth year many researchers identify as the beginning of the millennial generation.\n\nI was born in 1982. And this year, I turned 40. So did millions of other millennials in the United States.\n\nThat’s right: The generation long portrayed as young and naïve is entering middle age.\n\nIt’s a notable milestone, and a good opportunity to point out something important: the Myth of the Millennial is very different from the reality many of us are living.\n\nMyth 1: We only think about ourselves\n\nBack in May, my husband went out of town on a trip, and I was solo parenting our infant daughter for the first time. “I can do this,” I thought, trying to reassure myself. “It won’t be that hard.” Then one night, my daughter’s first two teeth started to poke through her gums. After watching on the baby monitor as she thrashed in her crib for what probably was only a few minutes, but seemed like an eternity, I ended up holding her in my arms for the rest of the night to comfort her.\n\nMillennials like me are too busy juggling our responsibilities at work and caring for others at home to be as self-obsessed as we’ve been portrayed all these years.\n\nIn the scheme of tough things new parents can go through, this was nothing major. But I was exhausted. And so was she.\n\nAs the sun rose, we sat bleary-eyed on the floor of her room together. Her pajamas were covered with the cherry-flavored Children’s Tylenol she’d spit out when I tried to give it to her the night before. But for a few minutes that morning, we were playing and she was smiling and it seemed like we’d made it through a marathon and finally could relax.\n\nThen my phone rang with devastating, unexpected news.\n\nMy mom had died that morning.\n\nI was shaken, stunned and sobbing. I looked at my daughter playing beside me. There were so many questions I wish I’d asked my mom about how to take care of her. Instead of calling my mom that day to ask for advice, I would race to Michigan to help plan her funeral.\n\nSuddenly, the same year I became a mother had become the year when I lost a mother, too.\n\nIt was less than two months before my 40th birthday.\n\nMillennials famously appeared on the cover of TIME magazine nearly a decade ago beneath the headline, “THE ME ME ME GENERATION,” cementing our self-obsessed image.\n\nThis Time cover from 2013 reinforced stereotypes about millennials as entitled and self-absorbed. From TIME\n\nBut for me and many others, what it really means to be a millennial these days is something quite different. We are the newest sandwich generation, feeling growing pressure between raising young children and caring for aging family members – or at least wanting to care for them, given all they’ve done to care for us, but struggling to know what to do.\n\nMillennials like me are too busy juggling our responsibilities at work and caring for others at home to be as self-obsessed as we’ve been portrayed all these years.\n\nLike every generation before us, we’re growing up. But the Myth of the Millennial has long been off the mark.\n\nFor years, for example, headlines have blared that millennials aren’t having kids. The reality, though, is more complicated, according to Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center.\n\n“Women are having children later. But when we look at completed fertility, we haven’t seen that they’re necessarily having fewer children, just starting later,” Parker says. “It represents a lag, not necessarily a completely different way in approaching family life.”\n\nJason Dorsey, who’s written several books about millennials and made a career out of helping Corporate America better understand them, says the memes about selfish millennials simply don’t match up with reality.\n\n“The oldest millennials tell us they’re being pulled in three different directions,” says Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics. “They’re often taking care of a child or children. They’re frequently taking care of a parent or parents. And they’re trying to navigate their jobs. And so that pull, there’s a lot going on there, and it’s a very stressful time.”\n\nMy husband captured this moment on my 40th birthday this year, as I fed my daughter while we watched July 4 fireworks. Caring for her has changed the way I look at my life. Catherine Shoichet/CNN\n\nPast generations have entered this life stage, too, Dorsey says. But this time around, one thing is different.\n\n“What’s new is to do it at 40 years old,” he says, “with so many people having very young children.”\n\nMany middle-aged millennials like me are feeling this pressure even in our most joyous moments. And Dorsey says there’s plenty of research to be done still about how this shift is changing our society.\n\nHow will this shape the kind of parents we become, or the way we approach our jobs, or the choices we make in other parts of our lives?\n\nMyth 2: We all share the same experiences\n\nIt’s not necessarily surprising that for years I didn’t realize I was one of the more than 72 million millennials in the United States.\n\nSome experts argue that analyzing our society using generation labels is just about as reliable and scientific as using your horoscope.\n\nThey contend that many more factors can shape someone’s life than the year they were born – race and socioeconomic status, for example. And when you label and analyze a whole group of people without digging much into those details, important nuances about social change end up getting lost.\n\n“Drawing arbitrary lines between birth years and slapping names on them isn’t helping,” Philip N. Cohen wrote last year in a Washington Post opinion piece. The professor of sociology at the University of Maryland has been leading a group of academics pushing for the Pew Research Center and others to stop promoting generational labels altogether.\n\nAvocado toast has become an increasingly popular restaurant offering and a symbol of millennial culture. Adobe Stock\n\nI can see their point.\n\nSome of my younger millennial friends, who are in their late 20s, have looked at me wide-eyed when I talk about the videotapes I watched growing up, or what it was like hearing that delightful, high-pitched, staticky tone that meant your home computer was oh-so-slowly connecting to the internet via dial-up. Major events that shaped our world happened at very different points in our lives. I was in college on 9/11; they were in elementary school. I was in grad school and looking for work during the Great Recession; they were still living with their parents.\n\nSome argue that the split between us is so big that older millennials like me should actually get our own category (sometimes combined with younger members of Generation X). Our so-called micro-generation has been dubbed the Xennials, the Oregon Trail Generation, and – most recently, and controversially – Geriatric Millennials.\n\n“It’s important not to label those within a 20-year span as being the same,” says Erica Dhawan, a researcher, author and consultant who coined the “Geriatric Millennial” term in a piece for Medium last year. Like me, she says she just never felt like the millennial label suited her.\n\nAll the criticism of the millennials – we said it about every generation, but it was just amplified by the internet and social media. Lindsey Pollak, author and consultant\n\nTo make things even more confusing, there’s no concrete definition of when the millennial generation begins and ends. The 1991 book credited with introducing the term states that millennials were born in 1982. Widely cited definitions on the Pew Research Center’s website describe millennials as those born between 1981 and 1996. Other researchers have floated theories that millennials were born in the late 1970s and even up to the early 2000s.\n\nThe way we talk about groups of people born in any given period – and the names we use to describe them – can change over time. “Gen Y” used to be a more common way to label our generation, before “millennials” gained momentum.\n\nNo matter what name or definition you use, there’s a sizable age gap between the older and younger members of our generation, and a wide range of life experiences we’ve all had.\n\nCan there still be value in looking at things this way?\n\n“It’s a useful lens, but it’s not the only one,” says Parker of the Pew Research Center, “and it’s important to take into account all the other factors that are causing these differences rather than just being part of a generation.”\n\nNow that I know I’m a millennial, I’m not ready to give up the label just yet. But I do want to help set the record straight and shed these persistent stereotypes about our generation (full disclosure: I do love avocado toast).\n\nMyth 3: We don’t want to own homes\n\nThe question haunts my husband and I – popping up in conversations with friends, loved ones and even strangers.\n\n“Are you thinking of buying a house?”\n\nFor years that milestone didn’t matter much to either of us. We’ve house-sat, and rented, and focused our energy and finances on doing things we enjoy together in our free time.\n\nBut now that we have a daughter, buying a house feels like something we should have done already. It also feels like something that’s increasingly out of reach, as housing costs remain high and mortgage rates skyrocket.\n\nA real estate sign outside a home in Morgan Hill, California, on October 4, 2022. Housing prices in the US soared during the pandemic, making it harder for millennials to buy homes. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWe’re not alone in feeling like we’re behind in taking this big step, according to Kevin Mahoney, a financial advisor in Washington who specializes in helping millennials.\n\n“People are really stressed about not being homeowners,” he says. “One thing I try to communicate to them is, it’s OK to rent. You’re buying yourself flexibility. You’re buying yourself time to figure out what you want your next 20 years or next 10 years to look like.”\n\nDespite frequent handwringing over millennials not buying homes, Mahoney also points out that plenty are. One reason for America’s housing crunch, he says, is that more millennials are now entering the housing market.\n\nIt’s gotten harder to buy a house if you don’t already own one, which makes it really hard to buy a house if you’re in your 20s or 30s and have rented for years. Gray Kimbrough, economist and professor\n\nOlder millennials aged 32-41 made up a quarter of homebuyers this year, according to a National Association of Realtors report, and millennials have been the largest share of homebuyers since 2014.\n\nBut as CNN has reported, many millennials are worse off than their parents.\n\nAnd millennials are less likely to own homes at this point in their lives than previous generations. There’s a good reason for that, says Gray Kimbrough, an economist and adjunct professor at American University who’s repeatedly taken to Twitter to dispel myths about millennials.\n\nHasbro in 2018 issued a cheeky Millennials edition of its classic Monopoly board game.

Back in 2007, he appeared on a “60 Minutes” segment ominously titled, “The Millennials Are Coming.”\n\nReporter Morley Safer didn’t pull any punches in the piece’s introduction: “A new breed of American worker is about to attack everything you hold sacred: from giving orders, to your starched white shirt and tie.”\n\nHe went on to warn that “the workplace has become a psychological battlefield and the millennials have the upper hand,” describing a generation that can “multitask, talk, walk, listen and type, and text.”\n\n“They talked about us like we were space aliens,” Dorsey recalls.\n\nThis 2007 \"60 Minutes\" segment described millennials as \"a new breed of American worker (that) is about to attack everything you hold sacred.\" CBS\n\nI missed that segment when it came out; I was a newspaper reporter at the time, likely scrambling to cover breaking news on the weekend night shift that started my much-longer-than-40-hour work week.\n\nI think I would have found the premise problematic even then, but now, with the clarity of hindsight, the “60 Minutes” story seems almost cartoonish – another chapter in a tale as old as time. “Anxious Older Generation Worries Naïve Younger Generation Is Destroying Everything” could have been an equally fitting title.\n\nConsultant and author Lindsey Pollak, who advises companies on how to navigate multigenerational workplaces, thinks the rise of social media is partly to blame for millennials’ longstanding bad rap. Pollak says our generation came of age under a microscope unlike any generation before us.\n\n“All the criticism of the millennials – we said it about every generation, but it was just amplified by the internet and social media,” she told me.\n\nMillennials have not been uniquely more likely to job-hop earlier in their careers. Actually, they’re switching jobs less. Gray Kimbrough, economist and professor\n\nDorsey says that during his presentations, details about millennials often surface that surprise many people in the room.\n\n“It turns out they’re the largest generation in that company’s workforce,” he says.\n\nHe finds that many employees had bought into the stereotype and assumed millennials were slackers or flakes. But actually, he says, millennials are often among a company’s most successful workers and managers. And by the end of his presentation, all of them are raising their hands.\n\nKimbrough tells me millennials have been staying in jobs for just as long as previous generations.\n\nYoung professionals navigate Manhattan streets on March 31, 2022, in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\n“Obviously people earlier in their careers shift jobs at a higher rate than people later in their careers,” he says. “Millennials have not been uniquely more likely to job-hop earlier in their careers. Actually, they’re switching jobs less. There’s actually been a big decline in job-switching since about 2000.”\n\nIt’s been more than 12 years since I’ve switched jobs. And I’m hoping to stay in this one for many more.\n\nLike me, many of my friends have been working for their employers for more than a decade. Others would have stayed, but found themselves the victims of corporate restructuring.\n\nRepeatedly weathering economic crises is an important piece of millennials’ story, too.\n\n“So many times, millennials tell me they finally feel like they’re on the right track,” Dorsey says, “and then something happens that’s beyond their control.”\n\nMyth 5: We’re forever young\n\nI remember when my dad turned 40. The mere idea of it seemed ANCIENT to me. His coworkers taped black crepe paper around his photo and hung it around the office. I was 9, and gave him a framed poem I’d written about how he shouldn’t feel bad about getting old.\n\n“The gears in your head are still turning around,” I wrote, “and your brain still works, as far as I’ve found.”\n\nSo, yes, the idea that now somehow I’m 40 is something I’m still trying to wrap my head around. On most days, I still see myself as a young adult finding my way in this crazy, confusing world.\n\nBut when I commiserate with my husband about our ever-growing list of weird aches and pains, about how we don’t really like going to loud restaurants anymore, and about The Way Things Used To Be, I realize I’m not quite ancient, but I’m definitely more middle-aged than I’d care to admit.\n\nYes, the youngest millennials are in their mid-20s. But the oldest are approaching middle age. Shutterstock\n\nStill, when I first read last year that the oldest millennials were starting to turn 40, that detail jumped out at me. The concept seemed so surprising. For so long, we’ve seen the same picture painted of millennials over and over.\n\n“People talk about millennials as though it’s this universal term for young people…which it’s not,” Pollak says.\n\nSometimes, when I look at my daughter, this idea really sharpens into focus as I feel my age hurtling toward me like a ton of bricks.\n\nShe’s so much younger than I was at this point in my parents’ lives. Or, put another way, I’m already so much older than my parents were when they were raising me. I was nearly 39 years old when my daughter was born. My husband had just turned 41. When she graduates from high school and heads to college, we’ll both be nearly 60. And if she waits as long as we did to have kids – if she decides that’s right for her – we could be 80 when we become grandparents.\n\nThinking about things this way fills me with anxiety and a tinge of sadness.\n\nWe’ve grown up seeing ourselves … as the young upstarts, as the disruptors, as the people around whom culture, and especially youth culture, are shaped. Of course we’re going to feel fed up about the fact that we’re now middle aged. Amil Niazi, writer\n\nWriter Amil Niazi, who turned 40 this year and has two young children, describes it perfectly – talking about how she finds herself constantly doing this kind of math and “getting hung up on the numbers.”\n\n“Now that I have these tiny, sweet, loving kids, all I want is more time with them, to hit pause, not on their growing and changing, but on me and the version of myself as a parent that I am right now,” she wrote in a recent piece for The Cut, where she’s also explored how hard and confusing it is to be middle-aged. “To pause the back and knee pain that grows a little more sharply every year, to halt the gray hairs and the high cholesterol, skip over the inevitable medical scares and exhaustion that seem to envelop more and more of my days.”\n\nAs I struggle to come to terms with entering my 40s and think lofty thoughts about being an aging millennial, my daughter brings me back to earth by pointing to the woman on the cover of \"Look Great Over 50\" and shouting, \"Mommy!\" Catherine Shoichet/CNN\n\nNiazi, like me and so many other middle-aged millennials, has been coming to terms with what it means not to be young anymore.\n\n“My entire life … the cultural story has always been about our youth. And it’s always been about us as this sort of young disruptive generation that was too spoiled, that had arrested development, that was upending family life, retirement, housing, employment,” Niazi told me. “We’ve grown up seeing ourselves that way, as the young upstarts, as the disruptors, as the people around whom culture, and especially youth culture, are shaped. Of course we’re going to feel fed up about the fact that we’re now middle aged.”\n\nRecently, I stopped by a bookstore with my daughter to pick up a few gifts.\n\nShe’s almost 18 months old and walking now, and as soon as I put her down she bounded over to the magazine section, where there were plenty of things to explore right at her eye level.\n\n“Mommy!” she exclaimed as she gleefully pointed at the cover of a magazine and plucked it off the rack.\n\nA beaming brunette looked out at me from beneath the title, “Look Great Over 50.”\n\n“She does look pretty great,” I thought to myself, “but OVER 50?!”\n\nMaybe my daughter was just sharing her joy at browsing in the bookstore? Surely, she couldn’t think I was more than a decade older than I am already.\n\nBut as she wandered around the magazine section for the next 20 minutes, she kept coming back to that one, saying “Mommy” every time.\n\nI almost corrected her. “Oh, that isn’t Mommy,” was on the tip of my tongue when I realized it doesn’t matter if somehow she does see me on that magazine cover.\n\nThere is so much I’m still trying to figure out, so much all of us – millennials and non-millennials alike – are struggling with as we make our way through life.\n\nAs Niazi notes, the math is truly daunting. And as this year so painfully reminded me, we never know how much time we’ll have with the ones we love.\n\nWith all this uncertainty, there is one thing I know: My daughter and I are so lucky to be together right now, sharing an evening in a bookstore – something I did with my parents, and something I’d always dreamed of doing if I ever had a child of my own.\n\nAs I watch her toddle down the aisles of the store, I feel so proud of how happy and curious she seems to be.\n\nHer generation doesn’t even have a name yet – or at least not one we know will stick. No matter what we call them someday, I can’t wait to see what they do.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

If you come up Biltmore Avenue and turn left on Meadow Road, there's a brand new, little hotel, and one is looking back at the trees, hills, river, where the estate gate is — and along the river bank at piles of scrap and junk! What is this? How can it be so close to Biltmore Village? And more importantly to the river? I think it is the little river whose name starts with S, the one that likes to flood. Aren’t there environmental restrictions? And anyway, right near Biltmore Village, shouldn’t the riverbank be a lovely park or such? Asheville is supposed to be a destination, and this is a nice new little hotel — almost all the plates in the lot are visitors! I can see the Biltmore gate! Are they doing anything to rid the area of this eyesore and likely environmental hazard?\n\nMy answer: If you look at this as the city's largest potential modern art display, you gain a whole new perspective.\n\nReal answer: \"My reply is, 'We’ve been there 80 years,'\" said Vonna Cloninger, CEO and owner of Biltmore Iron & Metal. \"I’m the third generation in the business, and now the fourth is there.\"\n\nBiltmore Iron & Metal is a metal recycler, and Cloninger acknowledges it's not beautiful to look at. But she also notes that the business helps keep an enormous amount of scrap metal out of mountain yards and woods, and a couple dozen folks employed.\n\nThe scrap yard is quite visible, especially from the McDowell Street bridge. But Cloninger notes that before the Biltmore Village McDonald's went up, the yard was largely blocked by vegetation, at least from the street level.\n\nAnd while I joke about it being artwork, there is some truth to that.\n\n\"It’s all in the eye of the beholder,\" Cloninger said. \"We are an arts supply place for all of the artists in Western North Carolina.\"\n\nAnswer Man: Buncombe County Sports Park has percussion instruments? Other improvements?\n\nA lot of metal artists scour the place for potential items they can utilize.\n\nThe business also employs about 25 workers, and it offers good pay and benefits.\n\n\"One guy retired from here and he'd been with us for 52 years,\" Cloninger said. \"Our employees are longtime employees. I’m their mom. My husband and both sons work there.\"\n\nAnd here's a fun fact regarding the metal recycling industry:\n\n\"Prices have never been higher,\" Cloninger said, noting that they were deemed an essential business during the pandemic. \"We were the busiest over the last year than we've ever been. All the people were at home, cleaning out their yards, and they got money for the metal. We were thanked every day for being open.\"\n\nAnswer Man: 3 Chick-fil-A restaurants on Tunnel Road? Tax cheat hotline?\n\nThat represented money in pockets for a lot of folks who were out of work or enduring curtailed work hours, she said.\n\nAs far as the environmental aspect, Cloninger stressed that she's \"a staunch environmentalist\" and helped write laws on the books for her industry. By the way, Cloninger noted she's also one of the first women in the country to own a scrapyard.\n\nThe Biltmore Iron & Metal site comprises about 10 acres, and Cloninger said over the years they've been \"offered a lot of money\" to sell. While the site possibly could be developed for a hotel or other use, she said it would require a lot of fill dirt to raise it up out of the flood plain of that \"S\" river, the Swannanoa — possibly as much as 52-55 inches.\n\n\"There's nothing hazardous or polluted going into the Swannanoa River,\" Cloninger said.\n\nThe river does flood, but that usually does not inundate much of their property. Mostly, they take in steel, and they don't take in hazardous materials. If Biltmore Iron & Metal were not complying with environmental regulations, \"We'd be shut down,\" Cloninger added.\n\nI also touched base with the state North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality and Public Information Officer Josh Kastrinsky. He works in the Division of Energy, Mineral and Land Resources.\n\n\"I checked around with several divisions – there are no records for the property with either Division of Air Quality/Division of Waste Management,\" Kastrinsky said via email.\n\nThe Energy, Mineral and Land Resources Division did find some violations of a storm water permit in 2018, Kastrinsky noted. The documents show the state wanted \"further cleaning and removal of metal waste\" form a basin on site, and the facility was under a notice of violation.\n\nThe state found \"soil around the vehicle draining area was discolored due to release and spill of oil/coolant,\" and, 'The oil containment structure showed visible signs of overtopping.\" Also, \"storm water basins were not maintained and were observed to be overgrown,\" the report noted.\n\nCloninger corresponded with the state, and Biltmore Iron & Metal took steps to remedy the problems.\n\n\"We have built two storm water ponds on my property for handling storm water coming down from Biltmore Avenue,\" Cloninger said. \"I can tell you that’s expensive. I can also tell you we meet all environmental laws — federal, state, EPA, the whole works.\"\n\nAsheville Fire Department spokeswoman Kelley Klope said she \"searched records for 1 Meadow Road (Biltmore Iron & Metal's address) and did not find any reports of hazardous materials.\"\n\nAnswer Man: Pratt & Whitney site sediment issue? New interchange to bump another project?\n\nAs far as hotel guests or other visitors being scarred by seeing a scrapyard, Cloninger says the hotelier has not relayed any complaints to her. Also, it's important to remember that locals need good jobs.\n\n\"It's usually the tourists who'll complain,\" Cloninger said.\n\nThe upshot of all this? Don't look for Biltmore Iron & Metal to sell out anytime soon!\n\nThis is the opinion of John Boyle.

The ex-president has also launched a bevy of insults at Harris and assailed her for flip-flopping on fracking and border security, even as he has reversed himself on several issues in the campaign, including immigration visas, cryptocurrency, electric vehicles, banning TikTok and Florida's abortion rights ballot initiative.\n\nTrump is meanwhile telling voters that he'd prevent foreign wars, as Harris chastises him for comments he made last year about acting like a dictator on the first day of his administration. Harris told her supporters last week in Savannah, Georgia, that after a recent Supreme Court ruling, Trump would effectively be immune from prosecution no matter what he does in the White House.\n\nA brief period of respite before the busy season settled over both campaigns ahead of the upcoming push.\n\nFollowing several hurried days on the trail, which saw him visit Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in quick succession, Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, took the weekend off from campaigning.\n\nHarris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, did the same on Saturday and Sunday. The pair visited Georgia at the end of August. They’ll hit the same battleground states that Trump did last week in a series of campaign stops on Monday.\n\nFor Harris, it’s a visit to the labor-heavy city of Detroit and on to Pittsburgh, where she’ll hold her first joint campaign event with President Joe Biden since he left the Democratic ticket. Walz will be in Milwaukee.\n\nThen, it will be up to the vice presidential picks and top campaign surrogates to do the heavy lifting for several days, as Trump and Harris prepare for a consequential face-off.\n\nFollowing Election 2024? Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nThe candidates are expected to meet for the first time on Sept. 10 at a debate hosted by ABC News in Philadelphia, even though a potentially deal-breaking dispute over whether the mics will be muted in between turns has continued.\n\nBoth have reasons to debate. Trump has been slipping in the polls; Harris is still introducing herself to voters.\n\nLabor Day weekend has typically served as the symbolic start to the general election, with campaigns shifting their task from voter registration to voter persuasion, and, eventually, voter turnout operations.\n\nWith polls showing tight contests in the swing states, all three efforts could be critical.\n\nThe swing states in 2024 are generally considered to be Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Although Republicans have also said they will contest Minnesota and Virginia, neither is considered a toss-up and now that Harris and Walz are on the ticket, Democrats' numbers are improving in the blue-leaning states.\n\nVoting will begin soon in some of those states as absentee ballots begin to go out in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin this month. North Carolina will start sending its absentee ballots on Sept. 6. Early voting begins in September in four states, including Minnesota and Virginia.\n\nFor both campaigns, it’s the Blue Wall\n\nPennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes are viewed as essential to both campaigns’ paths to victory, although both sides are mapping alternative routes.\n\nVance and Trump each went to Pennsylvania last week. Harris visited on two separate occasions in August and is sending Walz this Thursday and Friday.\n\nHarris on her most recent trip went with Walz and their spouses to the western part of the state. They landed in Pittsburgh and took a bus tour through deep-blue Allegheny County into the more rural Beaver County, which Trump won, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe approach is one that Harris' campaign intends to build on, with bus tours that go beyond the major cities, in other battleground states.\n\n“You have to hold the margins in counties you might lose a bit. Lose, you know, 60-40 instead of 70-30 for example,” Dan Kanninen, battleground states director of the Harris-Walz campaign, said. “You want to go expand the gains that Democrats have made in the suburbs with independents and moderate Republicans on issues like abortion or on Jan. 6.”\n\nTrump has ramped up his campaigning in recent weeks to try to blunt Harris’ momentum, blanketing the battleground states with rallies and other appearances.\n\nHe held events every day during the Democratic nominating convention in Chicago, crisscrossing the country. In addition to Pennsylvania, Trump made two appearances last week in Michigan and one in Wisconsin.\n\nThe three so-called “Blue Wall” states were Democratic bulwarks for decades until Trump won them in 2016 on his way to winning the presidency.\n\nBiden got them back in 2020, and now the Trump and Harris campaigns are engaged in a struggle. The states represent the easiest pathway to victory for Harris, even as her campaign touts another route through a group of western and southern states that includes Georgia and North Carolina and is known as the Sun Belt.\n\nHarris has a slight lead in all three Rust Belt states, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average, but is trailing slightly or tied in the southern battlegrounds.\n\nShe has closed the gap with Trump and turned Pennsylvania into a statistical tie.\n\n“What I think Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz have done really effectively is build the coalition back together,” Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro told reporters during a roundtable hosted by Bloomberg News during the Democratic convention.\n\nHarris is going to the right places, he said of her visit to the western part of his state. “The fact that she showed up there, talked about issues on their minds, really, really gives me a lot of hope and optimism,” Shapiro said.\n\nTrump is hammering a familiar message on trade protectionism in the Rust Belt, a region that has been hard hit for decades as manufacturing jobs moved overseas. The northern swing states have large electorates of white, working-class voters who have been receptive to Trump’s messaging on the economy and immigration.\n\nDuring his rally Thursday at a steel plant in Michigan, Trump promised to restore the American auto industry – historically centered in the Detroit area – to its past glory.\n\n“We’re going to get the auto workers’ jobs back like it was 30 years ago,” he said.\n\nThe powerful United Auto Workers union has endorsed Harris, prompting Trump to lash out at the union president during the rally. He also brought an autoworker up on stage who started a Facebook group called Autoworkers for Trump 2024.\n\nTrump won the state by just 10,704 votes in 2016. Biden beat him there by 154,000 votes in 2020.\n\nMichigan Republican Party Chair Pete Hoekstra told USA TODAY it feels “a whole lot like 2016” in Michigan right now.\n\nIn 2016, Trump railed against NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which helped him win over blue-collar voters.\n\n“We were getting a lot of interest from union workers, a lot of interest from UAW workers, and we ended up doing very, very well,” Hoekstra said about 2016.\n\nTrump renegotiated NAFTA as president. Now he’s promising more tariffs and zeroing in on a new target his supporters believe will resonate with blue-collar workers – the push under the Biden-Harris administration for more electric cars. Trump argues the focus on electric vehicles will kill the auto industry and pledges to have the federal government reverse course if he wins.\n\nHoekstra said it’s a “powerful issue” in Michigan and talked about appealing to union workers, who he views as a key swing vote in 2024.\n\n“In 2016 we did well, better than average, with those voters,” Hoekstra said. “We’ve lost some of them because they went to ‘Union Joe in 2020’ but we’re going to get those back.”\n\nTrump campaign battleground state spokeswoman Rachel Reisner argued that Harris’ record doesn’t play well with blue-collar Americans in swing states, pointing to her past opposition to fracking for oil and natural gas – which she has reversed course on – and high levels of inflation and undocumented immigration during the Biden administration.\n\n“Her record has been very anti-working-class America,” Reisner said.\n\nHarris has stressed the economy in recent visits – and her support there from the auto workers union. She says she'll go after price-fixing on food and groceries if she's elected and expand tax credits for the middle class.\n\nShe points to legislation she cast the deciding vote on, and Republicans are trying to repeal, as evidence that she would prioritize reducing the price of prescription drugs. She has also said that with congressional approval she would offer first-time homebuyers $25,000 in assistance to help them make their down payments.\n\nTrump, she says, will give tax breaks to the wealthy, and she has equated his proposed tariffs on imported goods to a national sales tax.\n\nHarris has the endorsements of an array of powerful unions, including the National Education Association, the United Steelworkers, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees and the Culinary Union in Nevada.\n\nShe makes a point of bringing up Biden, who enjoyed strong support from labor before he dropped out, in front of union-friendly crowds.\n\nAfter reminding the audience that he’d walked the picket line in Michigan last fall, Biden was met at the Democratic National Convention with chants of “Union Joe.”\n\nBiden ran into trouble during the Michigan primary, though, with uncommitted voters for continuing to arm Israel in its war in Gaza against Hamas. Harris sent her campaign manager to the state in August for a new round of listening sessions with Arab American and Muslim leaders.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told USA TODAY during the convention that Harris has “the opportunity to have a new start” on the Middle East as the nominee.\n\n“I actually feel pretty good about Michigan. I think Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are in some ways tougher fights,” the Harris campaign surrogate said. “She’s got to do it all.”\n\nTo win those states, the Pennsylvania-born congressman said, “We’ve got to win the economic argument.”\n\n“We’ve got to make the case that we are the party that’s going to reindustrialize America and reenergize the working and middle class.”\n\nTrump was in Wisconsin for a town hall Thursday with Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who endorsed the former Republican president.\n\nAnother former Democrat, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also endorsed Trump recently. Trump’s campaign is touting the endorsements in swing states as a sign it is reaching out to a broad range of voters.\n\nRepublicans hosted their convention in Milwaukee, and Harris sought to tweak Trump during the Democrats’ convention by hosting a rally at the same arena. Walz’s home state of Minnesota borders Wisconsin, making it an easy state for him to repeatedly visit over the final stretch of the campaign.\n\nHarris has been tapping into Biden’s appeal there. He’ll visit on an official trip this Thursday, after laying low for the past several weeks.\n\nHillary Clinton failed to visit the state in 2016, as several of Harris’ top staffers are painfully aware. Wisconsin tipped the election in Biden’s favor four years later, when he reclaimed the blue wall.\n\n“Wisconsin makes beer, cheese, brats and presidents. Our ticket knows it. Our voters know it. The Republicans know it –they put Donald Trump in Wisconsin for the Republican National Convention for that exact reason,” Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler argued. “As Trump said, I think if we win Wisconsin, we win the whole thing.”\n\nCampaigns tout war chests, offices, staff size\n\nOf the advantages Harris’ campaign touts is a strong war chest of $540 million and an early investment in staff and offices.\n\n“We are in a position to play hard and aggressively across all the battlegrounds. By contrast, the Trump campaign did not do that,” said Kanninen, battleground states director of the Harris-Walz campaign.\n\nHarris has more than 312 offices and 2,000 staffers in battleground states, according to the campaign, and made a $150 million television ad buy in August. Harris' campaign says it has $370 million in TV and digital ads reserved after Labor Day.\n\nThe Trump campaign says it has “hundreds” of paid staffers in the battleground states and nearly 400 GOP offices funded by the former president’s operation, but it didn’t specify how many of those are new and how many existed previous to the campaign.\n\nTrump campaign political director James Blair posted on X, formerly Twitter, that there are 21,000 trained “Trump Force 47 Captains,” in the battlegrounds, referencing the campaign’s volunteer program.\n\nKanninen said that as Trump was busy defending himself unsuccessfully against 34 felony counts in court, Democrats were putting together a robust operation, which Harris took over from Biden.\n\n“I know they talk about building some paid component at the end here. That's never very effective, as compared to a volunteer-driven organization that has time to build relationships and trust, which is what we've been doing,” he said.\n\nMuch of Trump’s get-out-the-vote operation is being handled by outside conservative groups, which isn’t traditional and puts the effort outside the campaign’s direct control.\n\nHoekstra of the Michigan GOP said he might not be able to hold the groups accountable or exercise control over them, but he believes that having more organizations participate in GOTV is a good thing and is confident in their leadership.\n\n“These are talented people,” he said. “I’m going to stay in communication with them as much as I can legally, but I’m going to let them run because they’re quality people.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/06/04/north-oregon-coast-reopens-13-state-parks-beach-access-friday/3143998001/", "title": "North Oregon Coast reopens 13 state parks, beach access, on Friday", "text": "One of Oregon’s most popular areas for outdoor recreation and tourism is reopening on a wider scale Friday.\n\nA total of 13 parks on the northern Oregon Coast will reopen, marking the end of an extended closure to limit the spread of COVID-19 to coastal communities.\n\nIn addition, two of the largest parks will allow camping beginning on Tuesday for those who made previous reservations.\n\nThe parks reopening for day-use include:\n\nOpenings near Astoria\n\nFort Stevens (including limited camping)\n\nDel Rey\n\nSunset Beach\n\nDelaura Beach\n\nOpenings near Manzanita\n\nNehalem Bay (limited camping)\n\nTolovona\n\nArcadia Beach\n\nHug Point\n\nOswald West\n\nOpenings near Tillamook\n\nBob Straub\n\nMunson Creek\n\nSymons\n\nSitka Sedge\n\nNot all parks on the northern Oregon Coast are opening.

Those measures led to Oregon eventually shutting down all state parks in late March.\n\nThe Northern Coast, likely the most popular tourist destination in the state, is among the last regions to reopen along with the Columbia Gorge.\n\nBoth areas have close proximity to Portland along with vulnerable populations fearful of COVID-19 spread into the community.\n\nHowever, as the counties have been given permission to reopen from Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, officials are slowly allowing people to return.\n\nState officials have stressed that people should avoid overly crowded areas and try to bring all of their supplies, to limit stops.\n\n“We’re happy to be serving people again at north coast state parks,” Havel said. “Care while visiting is still very important, and folks need to turn away from lots that look full and pack out their trash. Be careful, bring a bag, have fun.”\n\nCoastal communities have slowly lifted bans on visitor's staying overnight, but limits on occupancy, such as hotels only being allowed to fill 60 percent of rooms, have remained in place at many locations.\n\nState officials and locals hoping to avoid a massive influx of outsiders may be helped by the the weather.

Over the past decade, the city has averaged 57 such days.\n\nIn 2023, it happened 58 times. The peak was 82 days in 2016.\n\nThe lowest totals were 11 in 1974 and 15 two years later.\n\nMoisture matters\n\nThrough May, Savannah was 3 degrees warmer than normal, according to data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\nJune has offered a warm start to this summer season. Average temperatures were already about 2 degrees above normal before this week's heatwave took hold.\n\nExperts predict that trend will continue along the Georgia coast and across the state as pollution from the burning of fossil fuels continues to trap heat in the atmosphere.\n\nOverall, summers in Savannah are about 2 degrees warmer than they were a half-century ago.\n\nThat may not sound like a significant change, but factors driving the trend, including more exposure to extreme heat, can have an outsized impact on everyday life.\n\nWith every degree the temperature climbs, so does the risk of potentially deadly heat-related illness.\n\nChildren, adults older than 65, pregnant women and people living with illness are particularly susceptible.\n\nOutdoor workers and athletes are also at elevated risk – as are thousands of summer visitors walking historic Savannah’s streets, squares and riverfront.\n\nAnd as those summer tourists soon discover, coastal Georgia’s persistent humidity can make uncomfortable conditions downright unbearable.\n\n\"In general, the highest humidity tends to focus within the first 5-15 miles of the coast, especially when we have south-southwest winds, said Ron Morales, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Services Charleston office.\n\nAtlantic breezes coming more directly inland, meanwhile, bring cooler air..\n\nBut when the wind does move from the south and southeast, it picks up moisture as it passes over marshlands, making the air more humid, Morales explained. That was the case Monday, as breezes blowing parallel to the Georgia coast drove up humidity levels on an already hotter-than-normal day, sending heat-index readings to near 110 degrees in some areas.\n\nThe pattern illustrates how moisture magnifies the impact of even small temperature increases, especially in areas like Savannah.\n\nFor example, an air temperature of 94 degrees with 40% humidity results in a heat-index reading of 97. Bump the humidity up just 10% with the same temperature and the heat index is 103. Go up another 10% and the index climbs to 110.\n\nCharting heat and humidity together more effectively gauges the potential risks of being outdoors.\n\nHumans cool themselves by using excess heat to convert beads of sweat into vapor. But as moisture in the air increases, it slows down evaporation of sweat, so the cooling effect is minimized.\n\nThat’s why just a few degrees can make a big difference in the body’s ability to protect itself from extreme heat.\n\nIns and outs\n\nHotter conditions outside also increase energy demand for cooling inside.\n\nGeorgia Power established its all-time peak generation load of nearly 18,000 megawatts on Aug. 9, 2007. Savannah (99 degrees) and Atlanta (103 degrees) set all-time records for that date that still stand.\n\nEvery degree of summer warming can increase electric bills by 3% to 4%, the company says.\n\nWith summer temperatures expected to continue to rise and an unprecedented manufacturing boom under way, Georgia’s grid faces enormous capacity challenges.\n\nThe potential temperature extremes – and growing unpredictability – related to climate change add still more complexity for utilities.\n\n“We incorporate seasonal planning to address both summer and winter conditions into our ongoing, detailed analysis of the state’s energy needs, including peak load and energy forecasts, to best serve our customers and appropriately plan for generation needs during periods of increased demand,” said Georgia Power spokesman John Kraft. “Additionally, long-term planning and investment in our transmission and distribution systems plays an important role in reliability during such events.”\n\nIn the heat of the night\n\nSavannah is warming more between sunset and sunrise than it is in the light of day.\n\nRising temperatures after dark aren’t as dramatic as sizzling summer days, but trend is still significant.\n\n“When nights don’t cool off enough relative to peak daytime temperatures, people have a harder time cooling off,” Climate Central explained in its recent report on summer warming.\n\nThat can make it difficult for someone to recover from exposure to extreme conditions.\n\n“Sweltering nights can prolong heat stress and related health risks during the hottest time of year,” Climate Central added. “Heat is the deadliest weather-related hazard in the U.S., and warming nights worsen heat-related health risks.”\n\nThey also can affect our ability to rest, according to research published this month in the journal Sleep Medicine Review.\n\n“Rising ambient temperatures induced by climate change pose a serious threat to human sleep and therefore human health, performance, and wellbeing,” the researchers concluded. “In hot sleeping environments, heat production can exceed heat loss beyond tolerable levels, increasing core body temperature and disturbing the natural sleep-wake cycle with increased wakefulness.”\n\nSteamy conditions after sunset also add stress on an electric grid already trying to keep pace with daytime demand.\n\n“When summer nights stay warmer, air-conditioning units tend to run longer, meaning customers use more energy, making energy efficiency more important,” Georgia Power’s Kraft said. “It also further indicates the need for a diverse mix of energy sources so that we can continue to provide power around the clock, for instance after solar resources stop producing and after battery storage systems have discharged.”\n\nUninterrupted availability and a projected surge in demand are driving Georgia Power’s plans to make natural gas a bigger contributor to that mix, a move blasted by critics who point out that 60% of the company’s energy generation is still from fossil fuels.\n\nKeeping it cool\n\nWith Savannah already feeling the heat, Kraft offered these tips to keep summer utility bills from soaring along with the temperature:\n\nClose blinds or shades to keep out the afternoon sun.\n\nSet the thermostat to 78 degrees or higher, or use programmable thermostats.\n\nRun fans to help feel cooler at a higher thermostat setting.\n\nAdd insulation to the attic and weather stripping around doors and windows.\n\nEnsure heat pumps or air conditioners are working efficiently by changing the filter, making sure vents and return-air registers are clear and having the unit serviced by a reputable technician.\n\nProtect yourself\n\nThe best way to beat the climbing summer heat is to avoid it by staying in an air-conditioned space. But that’s not always possible.\n\nThe Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency offers these hot-weather safety tips:\n\nLimit exposure to the sun.\n\nDrink plenty of fluids and replace salts and minerals in your body.\n\nLimit intake of alcoholic beverages.\n\nClosely monitor local news outlets NOAA Weather Radio for the latest information.\n\nDress in loose-fitting, lightweight, and light-colored clothes that cover as much skin as possible. Protect your face and head by wearing a wide-brimmed hat.\n\nStay on the lowest floor, out of the sunshine if air conditioning is not available.\n\nCheck on family, friends and neighbors who do not have air conditioning and who spend much of their time alone.\n\nNever leave children or pets alone in closed vehicles.\n\nAvoid strenuous work during the warmest part of the day.\n\nHottest of the hot\n\nHere are the highest temperatures on record for Savannah, according to the National Weather Service:\n\n105 July 20, 1986 July 12, 1879\n\n104 July 20, 2000 July 19, 1986\n\n103 July 29, 1993 July 9, 1986\n\n102 June 23, 2022 May 26, 2019\n\n101 July 3, 2019 May 28, 2019\n\nEditor's note: This is part of an occasional series of stories about the impact of rising summer temperatures tied to climate change in coastal Georgia.\n\nJohn Deem covers climate change and the environment in the Savannah region.

Gun owners are up in arms about gun and ammunition stores being ordered to close.\n\nAnd a Madison Heights couple says they're stuck in their Lexington cabin, unable to return to their home in Oakland County, because they were at their vacation house when a no-travel order took effect.\n\n\"Never in the modern history of the United States — even in war time — has such an invasive action stripping citizens of fundamental rights been taken by a government order,\" Plymouth attorney David Helm argues in a lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nWhitmer is facing mounting pressure to ease her stay-at-home order, which aims to stop the spread of a virus that as of Saturday had infected 30,700 statewide and killed more than 2,300. Michigan is third in the nation in terms of total COVID-19 deaths behind New York and New Jersey.\n\nBut critics argue the stay-at-home order, under which more than 1 million residents have filed for unemployment, goes too far: They want to go boating, visit friends, open their businesses and travel across the state. At least seven lawsuits were filed in Michigan this week, arguing, among other things, that the order infringes on individuals' property rights, their rights to freely associate with one another and to freely travel across the state.\n\nEven President Trump joined the fray on Friday by tweeting, \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN!\"\n\nIn addition to lawsuits, Republican legislators have introduced bills that would strip powers away from the governor. Four northern Michigan sheriffs also have vowed that they will not strictly enforce some of Whitmer's orders, calling them \"vague and overstepping,\" such as the no-motorized boating order.\n\nWhitmer, though, isn't backing down. Her order is about saving lives and protecting the vulnerable, she says, stressing it's not time yet to reopen the economy.\n\n\"As much as I want that day to come quickly, my number one priority is saving lives in our state,\" Whitmer said at a news conference Friday, during which she said she hopes to loosen restrictions on May 1, when the stay-at-home order is set to expire.\n\nBut, the governor stressed, the economy will not \"open all at once,\" only gradually over time.\n\n\"We will re-engage our economy when it's safe,\" Whitmer said Friday. \"We're not there yet ... The rate of infection remains high, especially in certain parts of our state. And the threat of a second spike that overloads our hospitals is still very real if we don't get this right.\"\n\nUnder Whitmer's stay-at-home order, Michigan residents are prohibited from leaving the house except for essential purposes, such as shopping for food and medicine and getting exercise. It orders all businesses deemed nonessential to stop calling their employees in to work. And it bans travel to cottages up north and boating.\n\n'Social distance is working'\n\nAccording to Michigan's chief medical executive, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the growth rate in new COVID-19 cases has plateaued in Michigan: On Saturday, the state saw 768 new cases, marking the fourth time this week that confirmed cases were below 1,000.\n\n\"These are positive signs and it means that social distancing is working,\" Khaldun said Friday.\n\nBut still too many are dying, the state's top doctor said.\n\n\"A plateau in cases still means there are a lot of cases and deaths occurring, and we have to be mindful of this as we move forward with our response,\" Khaldun said.\n\nWhitmer credited the public for flattening the curve, saying \"the vast majority of Michiganders have been doing their part.\"\n\n\"The stay home order has worked because you have made a commitment,\" Whitmer said. \"It’s making a difference.\"\n\nAnd it needs to continue, the governor said.\n\n\"We're still seeing more than a thousand new cases every day and more than a hundred new deaths every day. Every unnecessary trip to the gas pump could put someone’s parent, grandparent, brother, daughter, son at risk,\" Whitmer said.\n\nKhaldun echoed that and encouraged the public to continue \"abiding by the governor's stay home, stay safe order.\"\n\n\"It's working,\" Khaldun said. \"And it’s the most important thing we can all do to keep Michiganders safe and to save lives.\"\n\nGun rights. Boats. Cottages\n\nAs the governor urges Michiganders to continue staying home, thousands of residents are crying foul, claiming certain provisions of her order make no sense, are vague and go too far.\n\nIn lawsuits filed across the state, plaintiffs raise several issues, including:\n\nWhitmer's order unfairly prohibits someone from traveling to their cottage where they can enjoy peace and solitude, and have little to no chance of spreading the virus.\n\nLandscaping businesses that operate only outdoors and have \"little to no chance\" of spreading COVID-19 are not allowed to be open under the order, yet places like hardware stores, marijuana businesses and abortion centers are deemed essential.\n\nKayaking and canoeing are allowed, but not the use of motorized boats.\n\nGun shops have been deemed nonessential, which Second Amendment advocates allege is intentional.\n\n\"This deliberate action shuts down gun stores in order to deny citizens ... access to their Second Amendment rights ... However, the order permits individuals to travel to buy food for a pet, marijuana or gum at a grocery store, among other items,\" states one federal lawsuit challenging Whitmer's stay-at-home order.\n\nThat lawsuit was filed Wednesday in federal court in Grand Rapids by the American Freedom Law Center, a national public interest law firm that is suing Whitmer and several county prosecutors, alleging parts of the stay-at-home order violate freedom of association rights and the right to bear arms.\n\nAFLC co-founder and senior counsel Robert Muise, who is also a named plaintiff in the case, argues:\n\n\"Americans love freedom and despise tyranny. We cannot risk losing our liberty during this time of crisis. If we don’t stop this now, I fear that it will become the ‘new norm.' \"\n\nOn Friday, the Michigan United Conservation Clubs also announced plans to sue the governor over the motorboat prohibition, saying that while it is \"very sensitive to the public health crisis,\" keeping waterways open to recreational boaters\" could be vital to Michiganders' mental health and well being during this time.\"\n\nThe motorboat prohibition also has drawn the ire of four northern Michigan sheriffs from Benzie, Manistee, Mason and Leelanau counties, which collectively have 21 COVID-19 cases. The sheriffs have vowed not to enforce certain provisions of Whitmer's order, calling it vague and overreaching.\n\n“While we understand her desire to protect the public, we question some restrictions that she has imposed as overstepping her executive authority,\" the sheriffs announced this week. \"She has created a vague framework of emergency laws that only confuse Michigan citizens.”\n\nWhitmer was not rattled by their criticism.\n\n\"Four sheriffs out of 83 sheriffs, making a point, that's fine,\" Whitmer said on \"Good Morning America\" on Friday. \"All I ask is let's not get overly political here. Let's focus on the public health.\"\n\nShe added:\n\n\"I know that there are a lot of businesses and people that are hurting right now. But the fact of the matter is, it's better to be six feet apart right now than six feet under.\"\n\nContact Tresa Baldas: tbaldas@freepress.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/18"}]}

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAt least some of the cost of these new taxes will be passed on to consumers, with the lowest-earning households expected to be dealt the biggest blow, according to a Wednesday analysis from Yale Budget Lab.\n\nHouseholds with an average disposable income of roughly $43,000, among the lowest in the country, would see disposable income drop 2.3% from the tariffs announced Wednesday versus 0.9% for the highest-earning households with disposable incomes above $500,000.\n\nWhen accounting for all 2025 tariffs, disposable income is expected to drop 4% for the lower-earning households compared with 1.6% for the highest-earning.\n\nWhy low-income households would pay more\n\nThe products that would get more expensive for these households include food, clothing, energy, and electronics.\n\n\"A tariff is what we call a regressive tax because it pinches families at the bottom more than it does families at the top,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab.\n\nLower-income households are more exposed to tariffs relative to their incomes because they spend a greater share of their income, Tedeschi said.\n\n\"If you tax consumption, then you’re burdening those families more,\" he said.\n\nIn dollar terms, higher-income households get hit harder by the tariffs announced Wednesday: An average of $4,600 per household per year for those in the top tenth and $1,700 for those in the middle. That $1,700 represents a larger share of the middle-income household's disposable income.\n\nThe impact of tariffs would escalate over time for wealthier households as prices on assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate decline, the Yale Budget Lab analysis showed.\n\nWhite House blames tariff 'fear mongering'\n\nThe Trump administration is betting any short-term pain will be worth it.\n\nWith deregulation and government cutbacks, it has positioned the president’s tariff agenda as a growth engine propelling an American resurgence.\n\n\"These tariffs are going to give us growth like you haven't seen before,\" Trump said.\n\nPeter Navarro, Trump’s senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said Sunday that tariffs will bring in $6 trillion in revenue in the next decade.\n\n\"Fearmongering about President Trump’s America First economic agenda isn’t going to change the fact that industry leaders have already made trillions in investment commitments to make in America and that countries ranging from Vietnam to India to the UK have already begun to offer up trade concessions that would help level the playing field for American industries and workers,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nAmericans will adjust to Trump tariffs, economist says\n\nThe Budget Lab analysis showed the American economy will be smaller in the long run due to tariffs, but Tedeschi said Americans will adjust.\n\n\"We find new products that we can buy. Businesses change their supply chains, they move production. Life goes on, and we all make adjustments to our economic lives to accommodate tariffs,\" he said.\n\nBut in the meantime, any household that can’t put off a big-ticket purchase this year will feel the brunt of the tariffs, according to Tedeschi.\n\n\"Consumers have a little more time on durable goods, but we’re talking months, not years,\" he said.\n\nTrump’s 25% increase on vehicles and parts produced outside the United States took effect Wednesday and is expected to significantly increase the prices of new vehicles.\n\nBracing for higher prices, some car buyers are moving up their purchases.\n\nMiranda Marsh, an engineer from San Diego, said she could have held off until summer but bought a new car in March to avoid price hikes and panic-buyers.\n\n“I bought quickly once I found a dealer that had the model and trim I wanted on their lot.

For the latest news, view our story for Thursday, April 3.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday declared sweeping tariffs of 10% on imports from all countries amid warnings from around the world that retaliation would follow, fueling tensions in a global trade war.\n\nThe much-anticipated announcement fulfilled the president's vow to hit back against countries he says have treated the U.S. unfairly.\n\nTrump has long threatened reciprocal tariffs against countries around the world, but the president on Wednesday announced a different plan: The U.S. will charge dozens of nations half of their current tariff rate and other fees on American imports.\n\nAmong the most prominent countries hit by the reciprocal tariffs are China at 34%, Japan at 24%, the European Union at 20%, India at 26%, Vietnam at 46% and Taiwan at 32%.\n\n\"Reciprocal,'' Trump said. \"That means they do it to us and we do it to them.’’\n\nTrump's universal tariffs on will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. and his reciprocal tariffs will hit on April 9 on new imports of foreign-made goods.\n\nTrump says tariffs will force other countries to lower their own rates on U.S. goods and services, creating a more balanced economic playing field for U.S. exports and a strong incentive for companies to manufacture goods such as cars inside the U.S. to avoid paying the tax. However, some analysts warn that the costs of tariffs will be passed along to American consumers.\n\nEven before the announcement, nations pledged to fight back. Canada said it was preparing countermeasures and China, Japan and South Korea were working on a unified retaliation. The EU said it would \"calibrate our response.\"\n\nThe announcement came the same day Trump was rebuked by the Senate, where four Republicans crossed party lines to pass a resolution 51-48 to end the emergency declaration enabling tariffs against Canada. The resolution has virtually no chance to be approved in the GOP-controlled House and, even if it did, would have to be signed by Trump to become policy.\n\nThe tariffs are the latest in a series of levies Trump has announced since taking office in January. They include 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, on imported automobile and automobile parts and on goods from Mexico and Canada. All those levies have fueled vehement objections from the targeted countries and industries.\n\nStock market ends choppy day: Mostly up before Trump tariff announcement\n\nFour Republicans cross Trump in vote to stop Canada tariffs\n\nThe resolution to end the emergency declaration enabling Trump’s tariffs against Canada, put forward by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., was intended to get Republicans on the record regarding the policy.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., co-sponsored the measure and was joined voting in favor Wednesday by fellow Republicans Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, drawing Trump's ire even before the vote.\n\nThough highly unlikely to pass the House, the resolution is the first official marker of a handful of Republicans’ stance on the controversial tariffs, which have raised widespread concerns about significantly hiking the cost of goods.\n\nTrump contends he imposed the tariffs on Canada to pressure its government into curtailing fentanyl traffic across the northern U.S. border. Canadian officials, mystified by Trump's targeting, have said fentanyl seizures by U.S. agents at the northern border made up less than 0.1% of total U.S. seizures of the drug from 2022 to 2024.\n\nLow-income households would feel tariff pain the most\n\nSome economists predict Americans will feel the pain from Trump’s tariffs, at least in the short term, and low-income Americans most of all.\n\nIf the administration rolls out tariffs as high as 20% on a broad range of goods and trading partners retaliate, the lowest-earning households with an average disposable income of about $43,000 would see that figure drop by as much as 5.5% − $2,365 − compared to 1.9% for the highest-earning households with disposable income above $500,000, according to a new analysis from Yale Budget Lab.\n\n“A tariff is what we call a regressive tax because it pinches families at the bottom more than it does families at the top,” Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told USA TODAY.\n\nLower-income households are more exposed to tariffs relative to their earnings because they spend a greater share of them, Tedeschi said. In dollar terms, higher-income households get hit harder: An average of $9,500 per household per year for those in the top tenth and $3,800 for those in the middle. The impact of tariffs would escalate over time for wealthier households as prices on assets such as stocks, bonds and real estate decline, the Yale Budget Lab analysis showed.\n\n− Jessica Guynn, Bailey Schulz\n\nTrump touts tariffs, others skeptical\n\nLast week, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on imported passenger vehicles, light trucks and some auto parts. For imported cars protected by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, only the foreign parts that make up the vehicle will be subject to the tariff. Before that, the Trump administration slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariffs on imports from China.\n\n“We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth,” Trump said. He said the tariffs will \"spur growth like you haven’t seen before.”\n\nMoody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi was less bullish on tariffs, telling CNN \"there’s no good case here ... It's just dark variations on a dark theme.\"\n\nFinancial markets sink in after-hours trading\n\nAfter rising early Wednesday, U.S. stocks took a dive in after-hours trading following Trump's announcement.\n\nThe broad S&P was down 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6% lower and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slid more than 2.4%. For the day's session, the S&P 500 added 37.90 points, 0.7%, to close at 5,670.97. The Dow gained 235.36 points to hit 42,225.32, up about 0.6%, and the Nasdaq tacked on 151.16 points or 0.9% to close at 17,601.05.\n\nInvestors had hoped the tariffs would be targeted, narrow and levied on a handful of countries. Over the weekend, however, Trump said his reciprocal tariffs would “start with all countries.” Reports also said he was pushing his advisers to be more aggressive.\n\nThe markets have experienced wild swings in recent weeks, but all three major stock indexes closed the first three months of the year lower. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq had their worst first-quarter performance since 2022.\n\n\"I’ve never seen anything like this. There’s so much uncertainty.

Trump’s tariffs are expected to significantly increase the prices of new vehicles.\n\nHigher prices for new cars are also expected to raise used-car prices, though it’s unclear when consumers can expect price hikes with lots still lined with cars and trucks that were not subject to the tariffs. Data from car-shopping app CoPilot found supply on dealership lots has dropped “significantly” since March 23, especially among foreign-manufactured vehicles.\n\n“I think you’re starting to see a little more panic and concern about the tariff,” said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations and a transportation industries specialist.\n\n− Bailey Schulz, Jessica Guynn\n\nTrump still open to talks on tariffs\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, trying to stem any anti-tariff tide, said the global levies will be followed by the tax breaks Trump promised during his presidential campaign. If his plan passed Congress, tips, overtime and Social Security would not be taxed, and purchasing an American car would draw a tax deduction.\n\nAnd White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that Trump could potentially negotiate lower tariffs with companies or countries if they change policies.\n\n“Certainly the president is always up to take a phone call, always up for a good negotiation, but he is very much focused on fixing the wrongs of the past,” Leavitt said.\n\nLittle Slovakia among nations facing biggest hit from 'sledgehammer'\n\nThe German car industry is likely facing the biggest hit of any nation from the \"tariff sledgehammer,\" economists at the Dutch financial firm ING report. Major manufacturers such as Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes and Porsche are likely to be hit hard, ING said, adding that although many German production facilities operate in the U.S., they also build in Mexico and Canada.\n\nBut in terms of impact on the people, Slovakia, with a population of less than 6 million, could be hit the hardest.\n\n\"Slovakia, home to several car plants, is most exposed in terms of total U.S. export volume,\" economists Rico Luman and Inga Fechner wrote. \"Notably, 73.2% of its total exports to the U.S. consist of cars and car parts.\"\n\nCan Trump's Canada tariffs be reversed? Senate votes day before rollout: Live updates\n\nWhy is Trump calling today 'Liberation Day'\n\nTrump has referred to April 2 as \"Liberation Day\" since he assumed the nation's highest office in January. The president has pledged to enact reciprocal tariffs on major trading partners as well as scores of other nations that contribute to the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit.\n\nTrump is trying to use tariffs as a way to force other countries to lower their own tariffs on U.S. goods and services, and to create a strong incentive for companies to manufacture goods such as cars inside the U.S. to avoid paying the tax. The administration has already announced 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, on imported automobile and automobile parts and on goods from Mexico and Canada.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that April 2 \"is a liberation day for our country because we’re going to be getting back a lot of the wealth that we so foolishly gave up to other countries.\"\n\nMass layoffs at HHS: Latest news on the moves at CDC, NIH and FDA; live updates\n\nTariffs 101: Who pays for them?\n\nTariffs are primarily levied on imports, typically to protect industries in the country levying them. Tariffs make imports more expensive, thus making local goods cheaper by comparison. Tariffs also can provide income that can be used to support local industries, fund public programs or cover government expenditures.\n\nAnd they can serve as bargaining tools to win concessions from trading partners.\n\n\"While tariffs may seem to penalize foreign producers by making their goods or services less competitive, the reality is that U.S. consumers and businesses ultimately bear the cost,\" the Wilson Center scholars Diego Marroquín Bitar and Valeria Moy write in a \"Tariffs 101\" analysis.\n\nE.J. Antoni, a public finance economist and senior fellow at the conservative Committee to Unleash Prosperity, disagrees, saying in his opinion piece for Fox News earlier this month that economic history tariffs are always at least partly paid for by exporters, not just customers.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/04/05/what-is-trump-approval-rating-what-polls-say-president-trump-approval-rating-doge-tariffs-trade-war/82868753007/", "title": "What is Donald Trump approval rating after tariffs went into effect?", "text": "How are the exploding trade war and worst U.S. stock market drop in years affecting presidential approval ratings?\n\nLaunching a historic global trade war, President Donald Trump announced at least 10% tariffs for 'all' countries with much higher rates for some countries or trading blocs on Wednesday. China was among the hardest hit with a 54% total tariff, to which they have since responded with retaliatory 34% tariffs on US goods.\n\nTrump's presidential approval ratings remained steady over the first two months despite the adminstration's chaotic start, even reached his all time highest rating in either of his terms. But a dip, a drop or a plunge is now showing the temperature of the American public's opinion has soured.\n\nThe most recent Harvard CAPS/Harris poll found 49% of registered voters approved of Trump’s job performance, compared to 52% last month in same poll. Although the drop, he is still polling higher favorability over the 46% that disapprove.\n\nThis poll also found that 54% of voters think Trump is doing a better job than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, noting that this figure is also lower than his 58% job approval last month over Biden.\n\nBill opposes union negotiating limits: Fitzpatrick says Trump order cutting union contracts 'weakens' national security\n\nAccording to the most current Reuters/Ipsos poll, 42% of approve of Trump's job performance compared to 45% just a couple weeks prior. His overall rating remains higher than his first term and higher than what Biden polled during most of his administration.\n\nWhen asked about the general direction of the country, only 22% of those polled felt things were heading in the right direction while 61% felt they are off on the wrong track, although on the direction of the national economy and politics scene, the polls showed a more wait and see attitude — 30% right direction, 53% wrong track and 17% said they didn't know. Employment and jobs and inflation teetered in similar percentages.\n\nTrump is still getting higher marks on the direction of his immigration policy with 48% approval versus 44% that disapprove. On the topic of how Trump was handling Russia 48% disapproved and, on Ukraine, 46% disapproved, with many still not sure yet.\n\nOn the topic of tariffs, the poll asked \"In general, when the U.S. charges tariffs on imported goods, American workers come out ahead\" and the response was that 45% disagreed, while 31% agreed and 14% were unsure.\n\nAs for Vice President JD Vance, he has a 41% favorable view versus 49% unfavorable and special government agent Elon Musk showed a 39% favorable versus 57% unfavorable.\n\nHere's what the most current polls show about Trump's presidential ratings right now.\n\nWhat is Trump's current presidential approval rating?\n\nIn the Economist/YouGov poll, Trump's favorability stood at 48% versus 49% unfavorable. Meanwhile Vice President JD Vance's favorability polled at 43% versus 46% unfavorable and House Speaker Mike Johnson had a 30% favorability versus 37% unfavourability.\n\nThis poll included approval ratings on some high profile Democrats as well, such as Minority Leader Chuck Schumer with a 24% favorability compared to a whopping 50% unfavourability.\n\nOf those polled, an overwhelming majority prioritized inflation and prices, followed by jobs and the economy and then healthcare above other issues.\n\nThe national NBC News poll shows Trump's approval rating at 47% with more registered voters seeing the US as heading in the right direction than at any point since early 2004. However, the majority of Americans still say the country is on the wrong track and he holds a higher rate of 51% that disapprove of his performance as president right now, according to the report.\n\nThe poll shows that despite the slightly higher disapproval numbers over Trump's overall presidential job performance, the margin is closer than at any other point during his first term. Other noteworthy results of the poll include an increased number of Republicans identifying with MAGA, more Americans \"have come around\" on his deportation-focused immigration policies and they like the general concept behind the Department of Government Efficiency and Trump's efforts to cut government jobs and spending.\n\nOne poll result in particular showed that voters are evenly split on the 2026 midterm elections as a divided Democratic party, facing record-low popularity, is trying to figure how to respond to Trump. That record low shows just 27% of registered voters viewing the Democratic party positively, among a total that included 59% of self identified Democrats.\n\nRealClear Polling which encompasses 13 different pollsters, including those mentioned above, shows Trump's overall favorability dropping to 47.6% versus 49.8% that disapprove, as of today.\n\nNote: Polls are constantly changing and different pollsters ask different varieties of the population.

He said beyond the auto tariffs, which auto executives and critics say could have a devastating effect on Michigan, he would impose what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on other countries around the world, raising taxes on imports from countries that impose higher tariffs on American imports than the U.S. does on theirs.\n\nTrump called the tariffs \"our declaration of economic independence,\" arguing they will bring jobs back into the U.S. and help America sell more of its products overseas, while also raising federal revenue.\n\nTrump said his administration had calculated \"the combined rate of all their (other countries') tariffs, nonmonetary barriers and other forms of cheating\" charged against U.S. products and would put in place a tax worth approximately half of that on those countries' imports, though that amount varied depending on the country involved. \"They rip us off; it's so sad to see,\" Trump said of the European Union in one example.\n\nHe said those \"reciprocal tariffs\" would begin at a baseline of 10% to start being charged at midnight on Saturday. But he added many countries will pay more than that for imports into the U.S. An eight-page list released by the White House showed tariff rates ranging from a high of 61% on Libya and 50% on products from Lesotho in Africa and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a self-governong French territory on an island near Newfoundland, down to 10% for most trading partners, including the United Kingdom and Brazil.\n\nThose additional tariffs over 10% were set to go into effect in a week on April 9, the White House said in a fact sheet.\n\nThe tariff on China was set at 34%, apparently in addition to those already being levied against imports from that country, as well as 26% on India, 24% on Japan and 20% on the European Union.\n\nBut the list did not include reciprocal tariff rates for Canada and Mexico, which Trump had initially set at 25% earlier this year, arguing that illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs from those nations constituted an emergency and demanded it. He later delayed its implementation. But there had been questions raised when Trump announced those tariffs and tariffs on imported autos about whether barriers to taxes on some or all products covered under the existing North American trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico would be honored or not.\n\nThe fact sheet put out by the White House said that the new reciprocal tariffs don't affect those earlier announced by Trump against Canada and Mexico and that products compliant with the trade agreement between the three nations — known as the USMCA — would not be subject to any additional tariff. But it remained unclear to what extent under the previously announced orders the Trump administration considers finished autos, components and parts crisscrossing the nation's borders to be \"USMCA-compliant\" and therefore tariff-free. Items considered noncompliant would face a 25% tariff, the fact sheet said.\n\nMeanwhile, 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which are also hitting automakers and other manufacturers, also remain in place.\n\nTrump has repeatedly brushed off concerns that a worldwide tariff scheme could potentially touch off a global trade war and suggested higher prices are acceptable in the short term if they lead to more U.S. manufacturing. Economists, however, generally expect other nations to retaliate against U.S. tariffs and agree that, ultimately, tariffs on imported goods are taxes effectively passed on to consumers, raising prices on all affected products.\n\n\"I have always said that when used strategically, tariffs are a critical tool to bring back jobs and support American workers and industries,\" said U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor. \"However, the key word is ‘strategically.’ I’m concerned about the chaotic and immediate implementation of these wide-reaching tariffs. Changes don’t happen overnight, and companies need stability and time to make adjustments. We must bring manufacturing capacity, supply chains, and jobs in critical areas including steel, autos, and pharmaceuticals back to America, and we need to renegotiate USMCA. I will work with anyone to achieve these goals.”\n\nA week ago, Trump signed an executive order ahead of what he had taken to calling this Wednesday's \"liberation day\" set of tariffs against other nations, imposing a 25% tax on all cars and light-duty trucks imported into the U.S.\n\nThose auto tariffs — which auto industry officials and analysts said could cripple manufacturers and drive up costs in a widely integrated market — are scheduled to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Thursday, though some automakers had hoped there could be a delay or last-minute exemptions put into place. Trump also said last week he would also impose a 25% tariff on imported auto parts no later than May 3 and made no public pronouncement on Thursday that he would back off that.\n\nHitting Canada and Mexico with additional tariffs — especially on autos and auto parts — could have a devastating effect on North American automakers, especially General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, otherwise known as the Detroit Three, who have a web of supply chains and assembly networks that crisscross the borders with both countries. While UAW President Shawn Fain has supported the tariffs, saying Trump is right that they could reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing jobs, analysts have said they could add thousands to the cost of a new car and result in enormous sales declines in the U.S.\n\nGM and Ford did not immediately issue any statements regarding Trump's White House remarks on Wednesday. Stellantis issued a statement saying it \"continues to assess the effects of the recently announced U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles and will continue to engage with the U.S. administration on these policy changes.\"\n\nGlenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, an association that works to promote and expand the industry, remarked that while the White House said USMCA-compliant goods remained exempt for now, he remained concerned about \"the prospect of a significant rise in the price of vehicles for sale,\" saying that would \"reduce demand and hurt the automotive industry and its workforce, all of which have an outsized impact on Michigan’s economy.\"\n\nThere were other signs that some were uneasy with the president's broad tariff push.\n\nOn Wednesday night, the Senate voted 51-48 to pass a resolution that would theoretically terminate the emergency authorization Trump claimed in threatening to impose tariffs on Canada, noting that country's long-standing alliance with the U.S. and the fact that the Northern border sees comparatively little illegal immigration or drug flow into the U.S. The resolution carried little more than symbolic value since the Republican-led U.S. House had already passed a rule blocking any such joint resolution from being voted on in that chamber. But it did serve to show some Republican opposition to the Canadian tariffs, with four members of the president's party in support.\n\nSens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, both of Kentucky, voted in favor of the resolution, as did all Democrats, including Sens. Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.\n\nNo such opposition was present at the White House, however, where a retired UAW worker from Macomb County, Brian Pannebecker, was invited to speak briefly, saying he brought several UAW members with him.\n\n\"I’ve watched plant after plant after plant in the metro Detroit area close,\" said Pannebecker, who has long been a vocal supporter of Trump's in Michigan. \"Donald Trump's policies are going to bring product back into those underutilized plants. There's going to be new investment, there's going to be new plants built,\" he said.\n\nReaction to Trump's announcement was decidedly mixed. Some Republican members of Michigan's congressional delegation applauded it, with U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain, of Bruce Township, a member of House GOP leadership, saying America has for too long been taken advantage of by its trading partners and that \"President Trump made it clear today that we will no longer put American workers at an unfair disadvantage.\"\n\nOthers, however, were less supportive. U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-Bay City, said Trump’s tariffs \"will raise costs on working-class Michigan families at a time when we can least afford it,\" and U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Birmingham, who served as the de facto chief of staff to the Obama administration task force that designed the rescue of GM and what was then Chrysler in 2009-10, said while targeted tariffs can protect American workers and companies, Trump \"has made one announcement after another on tariffs,\" leaving businesses and workers \"grappling\" with what they mean.\n\n\"Consistency is key for the U.S. auto industry and our world-class workers who rely on these jobs,\" Stevens said.\n\nJennifer Safavian, president and CEO of Autos Drive America, a trade group that includes international automakers doing business in the U.S., including Toyota, Honda, Suburu and others, said Trump's tariffs \"will have a tremendous impact on the entire U.S. auto industry,\" noting its members \"have spent the last 40 years building the highly-integrated supply chains that power North American auto manufacturing.\n\n\"It is impossible to rebuild those supply chains in a matter of weeks, especially with the added financial burden of tariffs,\" she said. \"While we share the president’s goal of bringing more manufacturing to the United States, we must do so in a way that protects American manufacturing jobs, supports suppliers, provides affordable options for consumers, and allows the industry to remain competitive.”\n\nIn Canada, others expressed concern.\n\n“The world is waking up today to a reality that Canada has been living with for months,\" said Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. \"Businesses around the world have had their uncertainty expanded, the effects of which will undoubtedly boomerang to Canada as well. This chain reaction of tariffs and counter-tariffs will have a real and distressing economic impact on Americans, Canadians and the global economy.\"\n\n(This story was updated with new information and to correct the spelling of Brian Pannebecker's name and the territorial status of Saint Pierre and Miquelon.)\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

Here is how it ...", "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump's long-promised plan to shake up the economy arrives Wednesday as he prepares to unleash his most significant round of tariffs yet. He already has slapped duties on imports that have roiled markets and ignited a global trade war.\n\nTwo months into his White House return, Trump has imposed tariffs on goods from neighboring Canada and Mexico as well as China, all steel and aluminum imports, and foreign cars and auto parts. He's threatened several other countries including traditional allies in the European Union with other steep tariffs ‒ even on European wine.\n\nYet Trump has circled April 2 as the true culmination of his \"American first\" trade policy as he seeks to boost domestic manufacturing by making it more expensive for companies to ship products into the U.S.\n\nThat's when Trump is set to announce his reciprocal tariffs, which is expected to target all nations with a focus especially on the largest contributors to the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit. Duty collections from the tariffs will begin Thursday.\n\nHere's what to know ahead of what Trump has called \"the big one.\"\n\nWhat are reciprocal tariffs?\n\nTrump has said his administration's suite of reciprocal tariffs will apply to nations that charge fees on U.S. exports, promising to match those countries' duties with tariffs of the same rate.\n\nOn Feb. 13, Trump signed a memorandum that directed U.S. trade officials to go country by country and put together a slate of tailored counter measures.\n\nWhy is Trump pushing reciprocal tariffs?\n\nTrump has said the reciprocal tariffs will offset trade practices of other nations that his administration deems unfair, while encouraging companies to make products in the U.S. to avoiding having to pay the new fees.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. imported $1.2 trillion more in goods than than it exported, a record trade deficit that Trump is aiming to shrink with his action.\n\nTrump has complained the U.S. has allowed other nations to levy tariffs on U.S. exports without any consequences.\n\nWhat is the 'Dirty 15?'\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said the Trump administration beginning April 2 will apply a reciprocal tariff number to each country based on what they charge on U.S. exports.\n\nHe said the countries most impacted will be the 15% of nations that contribute most significantly to the U.S. trade deficit and impose the largest tariffs.\n\n\"There's what we would call the 'Dirty 15,'\" Bessent said on Fox Business, adding they have substantial tariffs and other unfair trade barriers. \"It's 15% of the countries, but it's a huge amount of our trading volume.\"\n\nThe White House has not released a list of the \"Dirty 15\" countries. But the countries with the largest trade deficits with the U.S. are China, the EU, Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Canada, India, Thailand, Switzerland, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and South Africa, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIs Trump narrowing the tariffs?\n\nBessent's remarks suggests the Trump administration could be narrowing the scope of the reciprocal tariffs from what Trump originally proposed.\n\nAnd although Trump this week imposed tariffs on the auto industry, his administration is likely to exclude other sector-specific tariffs that Trump has previously discussed, according to recent reports from Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThis includes 25% tariffs on all semiconductor, microchips and pharmaceutical imports that Trump has said he intends to impose but has yet to carry out.\n\nAsked on Friday if he expected to put any exemptions in place for life-saving medicines, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while flying to South Florida, \"Well, we'll be announcing it soon. But we have to bring pharmaceuticals, drugs and pharmaceuticals, back into our country.\"\n\nThe uncertainty continues a whiplash pattern when it comes to Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs, which he’s frequently threatened, only to quickly pull back, in multiple instances.\n\nWhy is Trump suddenly changing his tone?\n\nAmid growing economic anxieties at home and abroad, Trump this week downplayed the scale of the tariff rates in store for other nations ‒ a noticeable change in his tone after building the tariffs up for weeks.\n\n\"We’re going to make it very lenient,\" Trump reporters Wednesday in the Oval Office after signing the new auto tariffs. \"I think people are going to be very surprised. It’ll be, in many cases, less than the tariff that they’ve been charging us for decades.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed that sentiment Thursday, telling reporters, “He thinks that some of these numbers would be more conservative than many people are expecting.”\n\nCould the tariffs push the US into a recession?\n\nEconomists worry large-scale reciprocal tariffs could further hurt a weakening economy and lead to higher prices for consumers. Tariffs are taxes on imports that companies typically pass down to customers.\n\nMark Zandi, Moody's chief economist, told USA TODAY that broad-based reciprocal tariffs left in place for several months would create \"the fire for a recession.\"\n\nHe pointed to several consequences of the new levies: higher costs for low- and middle-income earners, a new tariff tax for U.S. businesses, retaliatory tariffs from other nations, and stock market struggles that would wipe out significant wealth of high-income earners critical to consumer spending.\n\n\"If I'm right, as that becomes evident, I do think it's likely there will be a pivot and backtrack on the tariffs and a declaration of victory,\" Zandi said. \"So I don't know that we'll ultimately ever get to a recession, but we're going to get awfully darn close.\"\n\nAt the same time, Zandi said it's hard to speculate too much given the uncertainty from Trump's on-and-off again record with tariffs.\n\nHow is Wall Street reacting to a tariff plan that Trump calls 'Liberation Day'?\n\nAhead of what Trump is calling \"Liberation Day,\" the stock market plummeted Friday as investors sold off in response to Trump's trade policy and concerns about inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 700 points, or about 1.7%., its largest drop since March 10. The S&P 500 was down more than 100 points.\n\nStock market gains that followed Trump's November election victory have been wiped out as Trump executes his trade policy.\n\nFriday's selloffs came after news that inflation in February was 2.5% higher than a year ago, according to the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, The Fed's preferred inflation measure. While that was in line with economists' forecasts, the important so-called core PCE, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, rose 2.8%, more than expectations for 2.7%.\n\nHow will other countries respond to the tariffs?\n\nTrump's reciprocal tariffs are likely to escalate a global trade war that is already building even before the announcement.\n\nCanada and China hit back at Trump's recently imposed tariffs with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, while the European Union has threatened to do the same next month.\n\nAnd Canadian Prime Minister Mike Carney responded to Trump's 25% tariffs on automobiles this week by saying the U.S. is \"no longer a reliable partner\" and vowing his nation will seek to do more business with other countries.\n\nAutomobiles that fall under the umbrella of imports protected in the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement ‒ a trade deal orchestrated by Trump in his first term ‒ won’t be subject to the full tariff rate. Instead, the U.S will only levy tariffs on the foreign parts that make up vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico.\n\nDespite those carve-outs, Carney said Canada will announce new retaliatory tariffs next week, saying, “Nothing is off the table as we defend our workers and our country.\"\n\nLeaders of Germany and France have also urged the EU to respond with retaliatory tariffs.\n\nWhat will Trump do if countries retaliate?\n\nTrump said Friday the U.S. will \"absolutely\" respond to any additional tariffs from Canada with more retaliatory tarrifs.\n\n\"Many countries have taken advantage of us ‒ the likes of which nobody even thought was possible, for many, many decades,\" Trump said. \"That has to stop.\"\n\nStill, Trump said he had a \"very good\" phone call with Carney Friday.\n\nTrump also told reporters many leaders of other nations agree with his argument on tariffs. \"Many of them actually apologize. They said, 'Look, we have taken advantage (of the United States).'\"\n\nTrump did not identify the names of these leaders.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/09/trump-tariffs-more-countries-trade-war-expands/84518951007/", "title": "Trump hits 7 more countries with higher tariffs", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump notified seven more countries they would be hit with tariffs of at least 20% or more on August 1, in a series of letters to foreign leaders.\n\nIn separate July 9 letters to each targeted country, Trump said he would impose 30% tariff rates on imports from Libya, Sri Lanka, Iraq and Algeria. He said Moldova and Brunei would face 25% tariffs, while the Philippines would be hit with a 20% rate.\n\nTrump announced new rates for Cambodia, Thailand, Bangladesh, Indonesia and other countries earlier in the week. He also put higher tariffs on imports from Japan and South Korea.\n\nThe new notices bring the total number of countries for which Trump has hiked tariffs this week to 21. He sent letters to 14 countries on July 7. He told reporters later that day that he was open to negotiations with countries prior to August 1.\n\nBut he said of the deadline and process, \"As far as I'm concerned, we're done.\"\n\nTrump insisted at a Cabinet meeting the next day that the August 1 collection date for the tariffs was firm.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on July 7 that dozens of these letters would be sent to countries in the next few weeks.

The higher rates are part of the \"reciprocal\" tariffs that Trump imposed in early April and then paused for 90 days.

These countries are the United States’ largest trading partners, providing more than two-fifths of the foreign goods consumed in the U.S., according to a USA TODAY analysis of Census trade data. The three countries are hitting back. China has imposed up to a 15% tariff on certain U.S. products. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that his country will introduce a 25% tariff on U.S. goods, while Mexico plans to announce its retaliatory tariffs on Sunday.\n\nWhat is a tariff?\n\nA tariff is a tax on goods received or imported from another country. Tariffs usually make goods from other countries more expensive and are intended to encourage people to buy goods made in their own country. Here's how tariffs in the U.S. work and how they may impact you:\n\nCan't see the above graphic? Please click here to reload the page.\n\nWhat is the status of the proposed tariffs?\n\nThere is currently a 20% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports as of March 4.\n\nAn initial 10% tariff on Chinese imports went into effect Feb. 4, but the North American countries were spared for 30 days after Canadian and Mexican officials negotiated with Trump and agreed to improve border security.\n\nAs part of its announcement on Feb. 4, China's foreign ministry said it was starting an anti-monopoly investigation into Alphabet Inc.'s Google. It also included PVH Corp., the holding company for brands including Calvin Klein, and U.S. biotech company Illumina, on its \"unreliable entities list,\" a designation that can damage a firm's competitiveness by subjecting it to fines and making it harder for foreign employees to get visas. China's commerce ministry accused the firms of \"discriminatory measures against Chinese enterprises,\" without elaborating.\n\nAs part of Trump's executive orders imposing tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, he also halted the \"de minimis\" trade loophole that allows low-value packages to come in duty-free from China and other countries, Reuters reported. Retailers Shein and Temu may raise prices, as together they account for more than 30% of packages shipped to the U.S. under \"de minimis,\" according to Reuters. The U.S. Postal Service announced it will continue accepting all inbound mail and packages from China and Hong Kong from Feb. 5, quickly reversing the suspension that went into effect Feb. 4.\n\nRead more: China hits back with levies on US products after Trump's tariffs take effect\n\nHow many imported goods will be impacted in the US?\n\nThe U.S. relies heavily on goods from Canada, China and Mexico, which accounted for 40% of all our imports in recent years.\n\nIf the proposed tariffs on goods from Mexico take effect, Americans may have to pay more for certain fruits, vegetables and alcohol products. Tariffs on Canadian goods could lead to higher prices for steel, lumber and grains.\n\nHow could these tariffs affect you? What industries will be most affected?\n\nAs the prices rise on imported goods, the price of domestic goods may also rise due to reduced competition. There could also be a scarcity of imported goods because they may become too expensive to import. Jobs in industries that rely on imported goods, like automotive manufacturing and residential construction, could also face losses. Some of the hardest-hit sectors include toys, fuel, transportation, electronics, footwear, and food.\n\nUSA TODAY analyzed the trade data published by the U.S. Census Bureau and looked at trade values across commodity sectors based on classifications from a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nA staggering 74% of U.S. imports of toys and sports equipment came from China ‒ so did 40% of imported footwear and headgear. Even when toys are designed in the U.S., most of them are manufactured in China. Eight out of 10 toys sold in the U.S. are made in China, according to the Toy Association, an industry group based in New York City.\n\nElectronics ‒ a category of goods already experiencing high tariff rates ‒ may face even greater impacts, with 44% of imports coming from China and Mexico combined.\n\nCanada supplied 51% of the U.S.'s imported fuel and, together with Mexico, supplied 44% of the U.S.’s imported vegetable products, making these essential commodities potential flashpoints for rising costs. According to the Congressional Research Service, Canada and Mexico accounted for over 71% of U.S. crude oil imports, with Canada alone contributing nearly 60%. Crude oil is liquid petroleum extracted directly from the earth and can be used for burning as fuel or for processing into chemical products.\n\nHere's a list of the top product categories imported into the U.S. from each country threatened with tariffs:\n\nMexico\n\n◾ Transportation equipment (32%)\n\n◾ Vegetable products (28% by itself and 44% combined with Canada)\n\n◾ Prepared food (22% by itself and 42% combined with Canada)\n\n◾ Machinery (21%)\n\n◾ Electronics (18% )\n\nChina\n\n◾ Toys (74%)\n\n◾ Footwear and headgear (40%)\n\n◾ Electronics (25% by itself and 44% combined with Mexico)\n\n◾ Textiles and clothing (25%)\n\n◾ Hides and skins (21%)\n\nCanada\n\n◾ Fuel (51%)\n\n◾ Wood products (39%)\n\n◾ Animal products (23%)\n\n◾ Metals (21%)\n\n◾ Mineral products (21%)\n\nCONTRIBUTING Kim Hjelmgaard, Kinsey Crowley and Shawn J.

A recent survey from the National Association for Business Economics found one in four companies plan to delay hiring or investments over the next six months.\n\nJob gains averaged just 35,000 over the past three months after figures for May and June were revised down by 258,000. In the same period last year, job gains averaged nearly 123,000.\n\n“Clearly the tariffs, the policy, is starting to bite into the labor market,” Elizabeth Crofoot, senior economist and principal researcher at Lightcast, told USA TODAY.\n\n-Bailey Schulz\n\nTariff uncertainty contributed to weak jobs report, White House acknowledges\n\nA top White House economic adviser acknowledged that \"uncertainty\" over President Trump's tariffs contributed to the weaker than expected jobs report.\n\nCouncil of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran argued on MSNBC that July's number was \"decent\" but admitted that downward revisions to May and June \"are not great.\" He chalked those up to seasonal factors such as teachers on summer break and cited Trump's border policies, which he said were eliminating jobs held by foreign workers.\n\n\"Finally, there was, you know, some uncertainty over tariffs, as we were negotiating,\" he said.\n\nThe uncertainty was needed to create leverage, he said. \"But that uncertainty is now resolved, the trade deals are in place, the One Big Beautiful Bill is law, both the trade deals and the tax bill have very powerful incentives to create an economic boom in America.\"\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nDoes the Fed get an early peak at the monthly jobs report?\n\nNot really.\n\nAccording to Willam Poole, former chief executive of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, the Fed has “a minimal advantage, if any, in terms of knowledge of facts.”\n\nIt is so minimal that it doesn’t really matter, he wrote in an article posted on the Richmond Fed’s website. What data Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell receives also comes after the Fed’s monetary policy meeting and decisions have been made.\n\n“The Fed chair gets the unemployment report through the chair of the CEA (Council of Economic Advisers) late Thursday afternoon, just a few hours before the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the data publicly on Friday at 8:30 a.m.” Eastern time, he said. “This same \"advantage\" of a few hours is true of all the data released by federal statistical agencies.”\n\n-Medora Lee\n\nStock sell-off continues\n\nU.S. stocks remained negative as investors responded to Trump's tariff blitz and a disappointing July jobs report.\n\nAt 12:26 p.m. ET, the blue-chip Dow fell 0.99%, or 438.66 points, to 43,692.32; the broad S&P 500 slipped 1.16%, or 73.52 points, to 6,265.87, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 1.58%, or 334.17 points to 20,788.28.

President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order increasing tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% from 25% on all products not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.\n\nThe White House cited what it said was Canada's failure to stop fentanyl smuggling and a failure to address U.S. concerns about trade barriers.\n\n\"Team Canada is still in Washington working on a deal and they're going to be there until we either have a conclusion of a good deal for Canada or that it's time to take a pause and walk away,\" said Volpe, president of Canada's national Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association.\n\nCarney wants a new deal to reset bilateral relations, saying Trump's move to impose tariffs had irrevocably upended the decades-old trading and security ties between the two neighbors. The talks though have so far produced little.\n\n-Reuters\n\nCoffee catastrophe? Brazilian beans will head to China, analysts say\n\nThe Trump administration's steep import tariff on Brazilian coffee looks set to reshuffle trade routes for beans from the world's top grower and exporter, benefiting China and incentivizing traders to look for indirect routes into the U.S.\n\nA 50% tariff on some Brazilian products, including coffee, will begin on August 6, the Trump administration said this week. The move will challenge commodities traders and Brazilian coffee exporters to find buyers for the roughly 8 million bags sold to U.S. coffee processors every year.\n\nAt around 25 million bags per year, the U.S. is the world's largest coffee consumer. A third of that comes from Brazil, through bilateral trade that was worth $4.4 billion in the 12 months ended in June.\n\n\"The global coffee trade flow will be reshuffled. The pain will be felt from Sao Paulo to Seattle - from origin to roaster, to cafe chains, grocers, and morning commuters,\" said Michael J. Nugent, a senior U.S. coffee broker and owner of MJ Nugent & Co.\n\n-Reuters\n\nPoor jobs report boosts chances of a rate cut\n\nThe much weaker-than-expected report is likely to trigger a Federal Reserve rate cut, economists said. The CME FedWatch tool that tracks the market's odds the Fed will change interest rates at upcoming meetings shows an 83% chance of a rate cut in September.\n\n\"This payroll report kicks the door wide open for a September rate cut,\" said Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments. \"Although the effects of tariff pass-through still lie ahead, the Fed will not want to wait too long to begin its cutting cycle.\"\n\n-Medora Lee\n\nSwiss aren't neutral over Trump tariffs on luxury watches and chocolate\n\nThe Swiss watch industry has been suffering from weak global demand and sales lately. A decision by the Trump administration to impose a 39% tariff on Switzerland may add to their hard time.\n\nThe Swiss government said it viewed the White House's new tariffs with \"great regret\" and said it \"continues to strive for a negotiated solution.\"\n\nOnly Laos and Myanmar (also known as Burma), at 40%, and Syria, at 41%, fared worse than Switzerland in Trump's fresh avalanche of tariffs.\n\nThe Alpine country now has until Aug. 7 to work out a trade deal with the United States or chocolate, jewellery and, yes, watches, will be subject to levies more than double the 15% rate for most European Union imports into the United States. Switzerland's pharmaceuticals sector was not included in the tariffs.\n\n-Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nMorning stocks down on tariff and unemployment news\n\nAt 9:46 a.m. ET, the blue-chip Dow fell 1.33%, or 588.22 points, to 43,542.76; while the broad S&P 500 slipped 1.62%, or 102.73 points, to 6,236.66, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 2.13%, or 449.35 points to 20,673.10.\n\n-Medora Lee\n\nTrump defends tariffs, says he’s open to future deals\n\nIn an interview with NBC the evening of July 31, Trump said his aggressive tariff plan will rake in “hundreds of billions of dollars, and very quickly.”\n\nOpponents have raised concerns about potential price increases from the heavy tariffs. The president dismissed those warnings. “The only price that’s spiked is the hundreds of billions of dollars coming in,” Trump said.\n\nThe new rates will go into effect in seven days. Trump told NBC it is “too late” for countries to reach an agreement to prevent those duties.\n\nBut, he said, “It doesn’t mean that somebody doesn’t come along in four weeks and say we can make some kind of a deal.”\n\n-Savannah Kuchar\n\nUnemployment up on weak U.S. jobs report\n\nU.S. employers added a disappointing 73,000 jobs in July as payroll growth slowed amid President Donald Trump's sweeping import tariffs, an intensifying immigration crackdown and massive federal layoffs.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose from 4.1% to 4.2%, the Labor Department said Friday.\n\nBefore the report was released, economists had estimated that 105,000 jobs were added in July.\n\n-Paul Davidson\n\nDem senator: Trump will ‘turn on a dime’ if economy sours\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, told CNN he anticipates the economy will take a heavy hit from Trump’s tariffs – and that if conditions sour too much, the president may shift positions.\n\n“If the stock market and the jobs report and the inflation numbers over the next couple of weeks all head in the wrong direction,” Coons said, “I suspect you’ll see Trump turn on a dime and change his tariff policy and position.”\n\nHigher prices will be the “inevitable outcome,” the Delaware senator said.\n\n“It’s the opposite of what he ran on, which was lowering costs.”\n\n-Savannah Kuchar\n\nChina and Mexico not part of Trump's tariff blast\n\nNot included in Trump's order are two of the United States' largest trading partners, China and Mexico.\n\nTrump and Chinese officials have discussed extending a 90-day tariff truce that the two sides struck in May in which both countries held off on imposing massive, triple-digit tariffs on imports on one another.\n\nTrump on July 31 said he's giving Mexico another 90 days to come to a long-term agreement with the United States to avoid higher tariffs. In the meantime, Mexican imports will still be levied with a 25% tariff that Trump imposed over the flow of fentanyl from the country.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nTrump tariffs put a new spin on the Canadian Old-Fashioned\n\nAn Old-Fashioned without Kentucky bourbon?\n\nOh, Canada.\n\nStarting in February, bars and liquor stores in Canada removed bourbon and other U.S.-made spirits and wines from their shelves to protest President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and his unwelcome suggestion that our northern neighbors become the 51st U.S. state.\n\nTrump’s overtures have not gone over well in French-speaking Quebec or the other Canadian provinces. Canadians have found all kinds of ways to let the American president know what he can do with his scandaleux proposition. Some are proudly flying their country’s red-and-white Maple Leaf flag. Others are wearing T-shirts that declare “Canada Is Not For Sale.”\n\n-Michael Collins\n\nTrump wants the Fed board to sideline Powell in long-running interest rate spat\n\nPresident Trump said the Federal Reserve board should seize control if Fed Chair Jerome Powell continues to refuse to lower interest rates.\n\n\"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell, a stubborn MORON, must substantially lower interest rates, now. if he continues to refuse, the board should assume control, and do what everyone knows has to be done!\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe U.S. central bank held interest rates steady on July 30 and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments after the decision undercut confidence that borrowing costs would begin to fall in September, stoking Trump's ire.\n\nThe latest policy decision was made by a 9-2 vote, which passes for a split outcome at the consensus-driven central bank, with two Fed governors dissenting for the first time in more than 30 years.\n\n-Reuters\n\nFed dissenters say unemployment fears drove votes to lower interest rates\n\nThe two Federal Reserve governors who favored an interest rate cut at the U.S. central bank's policy meeting this week said on Friday they did so largely due to rising concerns about the job market, amid expectations that any price increases related to trade tariffs will not lead to lasting price pressures.\n\n\"With economic growth slowing this year and signs of a less dynamic labor market, I saw it as appropriate to begin gradually moving our moderately restrictive policy stance toward a neutral setting,\" Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman said in a statement. \"In my view, this action would have proactively hedged against a further weakening in the economy and the risk of damage to the labor market,\" she said.\n\nGovernor Christopher Waller said in a separate statement that \"with underlying inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate.\" Waller said the job market is nearing stall speed and the Fed's rate target should be closer to its neutral level.\n\n-Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/02/5-takeaways-on-president-trumps-massive-round-of-tariffs/82764986007/", "title": "5 takeaways from President Trump's massive round of tariffs", "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs Wednesday affecting all U.S. trading partners and imports, plowing ahead on a risky economic strategy that promises to further accelerate a global trade war and raise anxieties about higher consumer prices at home.\n\nTrump hailed the massive tariffs as a \"declaration of economic independence,\" arguing the far-reaching duties will rejuvenate the nation's declining manufacturing sector.\n\n\"We're standing up for the American worker, and we are finally putting America first,\" Trump said during a Rose Garden ceremony before signing the tariffs through an executive order.\n\nBut many economists worry the large-scale tariffs ‒ Trump's most expansive tariffs to date and larger than most experts expected ‒ could further hurt a weakening economy, send the stock market plummeting and even lead to a recession.\n\nHere are five takeaways form Trump's long-awaited tariffs.\n\nA 10% baseline tariff for all countries\n\nTrump's tariff plan includes a 10% baseline tariff on goods from all countries, a dramatic shift in current U.S. trade policy.\n\nTrump declared a national emergency on trade in the U.S. ‒ which imported $1.2 trillion more in goods in 2024 than it exported ‒ as legal grounds to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to issue the tariffs.\n\n\"We import virtually all of our computers, phones, televisions and electronics. We used to dominate the field, and now we import it all from different countries,\" Trump said, adding that a single shipyard in China produces more ships every year than all U.S. shipyards combined.\n\n\"Chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic problem, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" he added.\n\nThe baseline tariff applies to about 185 countries in all, even the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands, remote external territories of Australia in the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean that have more penguins and seals than people and no apparent trade activity.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for your wallet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\n\nReciprocal tariffs target about 60 additional countries\n\nTrump said he is imposing additional tailored tariffs on about 60 countries that contribute the most to the U.S. trade deficit and have placed the most barriers on U.S. exports.\n\nA White House official called the countries \"the worst offenders.\" Rates of the targeted tariffs have been set at about half what these countries charge on U.S. exports.\n\nSoutheast Asian countries are among the nations hit with the highest reciprocal tariffs, led by Cambodia, 49%; Laos, 48%; and Vietnam, 46%.\n\nNew duties for other major U.S. trading partners include an additional 34% tariff on goods from China, a 20% tariff on goods from nations in the European Union; and a 26% tariff on goods from India.\n\nFor China, the 34% tariff is on top of recently imposed 20% tariffs on Chinese goods, meaning Chinese imports are effectively hit with a 54% tariff.\n\n\"For years, hard working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense,\" Trump said. \"But now it's our turn to prosper.\"\n\nRussia, North Korea, Cuba and Belarus are exempt from the tariffs. The White House cited previously imposed sanctions on each that \"preclude any meaningful trade with these nations.\" Trump recently threatened sanctions on imports from Russia if President Vladimir Putin does not end the war in Ukraine.\n\nTrump's universal 10% tariffs are set to go into effect at 12:01 am EDT Saturday, and his reciprocal tariffs will begin April 9. Trump's previously announced 25% tariffs on foreign automobiles and auto parts, will also kick in this week.\n\nMexico and Canada exempt from new tariffs\n\nNeighboring Mexico and Canada are exempt also from Trump's latest tariffs, but the 25% tariffs that Trump previously levied on both countries will remain intact.\n\nTrump levied those tariffs last month as retaliation to the flow of fentanyl from both countries and migrants from Mexico. He later agreed to exempt goods that fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal Trump signed in his first term.\n\nImports from Canada and Mexico that are compliant with the USMCA will continue to see no tariff, according to the White House, while non-USMCA compliant goods will be hit with a 25% tariff.\n\nNon-compliant energy products from these countries and potash ‒ key ingredient to make fertilizer used by farmers ‒ will face a lower 10% tariff.\n\nEconomists fear economic downturn\n\nSome economists expressed alarm at the scale of Trump's across-the-board tariffs, saying they're even larger than expected and warning that an economic downturn could result.\n\n\"Those are really big tariffs, and if fully implemented, I think they'll drive the economy into a ditch,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, told USA TODAY.\n\nZandi said the tariffs are a tax increase that will result in higher prices for consumers and weakened profits for companies that import goods. How the economy responds will depend whether Trump moves fully ahead on the duties or agrees to various carve-outs, exemptions and relief for farmers, he said.\n\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has deployed a whiplash approach to tariffs, threatening tariffs on some nations, only to pull back after receiving concessions. Trump's order imposing the tariffs includes \"modification authority\" that allows Trump to increase or decrease the tariffs rates.\n\n\"If you take those numbers at face value, I just don't know how the economy can digest that. I think that would be the prescription for a downturn,\" Zandi said. \"They're on the very high end of what I anticipated.\"\n\nRetaliation expected from U.S. trading partners\n\nTrump's massive round of tariffs is expected to trigger retaliatory tariffs from key U.S. trading partners, further igniting a global trade war.\n\nAhead of Trump's announcement, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen signaled plans for a significant response from Europe in a speech to European Parliament members.\n\n“Europe holds a lot of cards, from trade to technology to the size of our market. But this strength is also built on our readiness to take firm countermeasures if necessary,\" von der Leyen said. \"All instruments are on the table.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned other nations that if they respond by raising tariffs on U.S. exports, the Trump administration will hit back.\n\n\"My advice to every country right now is do not retaliate,\" Bessent said in an interview with Fox News following Trump's announcement. \"Sit back. Take it in. Let's see how it goes. Because if you retaliate, there will be escalation.

Economists predict they will lead to higher prices on affected goods in the U.S. and abroad, with the EU and countries such as Mexico that expect to the be the hardest hit vowing to increase fees on American exports.\n\nThe markets were up slightly ahead of Trump's announcement, which hit immediately after trading hours came to a close, following a turbulent month in which stocks rose and fell in dramatic fashion as the Republican president and his administration openly discussed their potential plans.\n\nTrump said the new tariffs are meant not only to offset tariffs imposed on U.S. exports but \"non-trade barriers\" that make it difficult for U.S. companies to sell products in countries. The president accused other nations of manipulating their currency, subsidizing their exports, stealing U.S. intellectual property and imposing exorbitant value-added taxes to hurt U.S. products.\n\n\"In many cases, the friend is worse than the foe in terms of trade,\" Trump said.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said it's estimated that tariffs will cost American families an estimated $5,000 more in consumer goods.\n\n\"It's creating huge problems in the whole economy,\" he said. \"So we're going to fight these tariffs tooth and nail. Trump's done a lot of bad things − this is way up there.\"\n\nTrump declared a national emergency on U.S. trade as grounds for the new 10% blanket tariff and the companion reciprocal tariffs.\n\nSome of the reciprocal tariff rates include a 34% duty on goods from China, 20% on goods from the EU, 49% on imports on Cambodia and 37% on goods from Bangladesh.\n\n\"We import virtually all of our computers, phones, televisions and electronics. We used to dominate the field, and now we import it all from different countries,\" Trump said, adding that a single shipyard in China produces more ships every year than all U.S. shipyards combined.\n\n\"Chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic problem, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" Trump said.\n\nThe new tariffs are in addition to the the previous 25% duties Trump put on imports from Canada and Mexico. Trump imposed and later amended the tariffs to exclude automobiles and goods covered under a free trade agreement he negotiated with the countries during his first term. He also put a 10% tariff on Canadian energy and potash imports.\n\nAn earlier hike on China of 20% also remains in place, meaning goods from China will now be 54% more in expensive in total. Trump's prior tariffs on aluminum and steel, foreign cars and light trucks and some imported auto parts are also still in effect.\n\nTrade barriers have traditionally been opposed by free-market conservatives, and Trump's sweeping announcement has made for strange bedfellows between the establishment and libertarian wings of his party and Democrats, who are working to rein in the president's ability to unilaterally impose tariffs. The U.S. Senate planned to hold a vote on Wednesday evening on a measure that aims to undo the national emergency that Trump used to impose tariffs on Canada.\n\nTrump campaigned during the 2024 election on blanket tariffs of 10-20%. He has floated varying rates on individual nations and the EU since then, in addition to across-the-board tariffs on every nation with which the U.S. has a trade deficit.\n\nTariffs are taxes on imports that companies typically pass down to customers. Trump has argued steep tariffs are needed to combat the nation's growing trade deficit and boost U.S. domestic manufacturing that has depleted in recent decades.\n\n\"It will all happen very quickly,\" Trump said. \"With today's action, we are finally going to be able to make America great again ‒ greater than ever before.\"\n\nBut many economists worry large-scale reciprocal tariffs ‒ which are expected to trigger retaliatory tariffs from U.S. trading partners ‒ could further hurt a weakening economy, send the stock market plummeting and lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\nThe U.S. had an overall trade deficit of $918.4 billion — an increase of $133.5 billion — in 2024 with foreign nations, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It's largest deficits were with China, $295.4 billion; the EU $235.6 billion; Mexico, $171.8 billion and Vietnam, $123.5 billion. The U.S. had a trade deficit of $63.3 billion with Canada and a gap of $45.7 billion with India.\n\nU.S. trading partners have already promised to respond forcefully to Trump's tariffs. The European Union has said it will introduce countermeasures in mid-April in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs. It set April 13 as a rough target date. Those tariffs are expected to hit cookware, gym equipment, boats, beef, eggs, bourbon and motorcycles among other U.S.-made imports.\n\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Tuesday that Europe still hopes to strike a deal with the Trump administration — but it was also looking to forge and expand trade deals with other nations.\n\n“Europe holds a lot of cards, from trade to technology to the size of our market. But this strength is also built on our readiness to take firm counter measures if necessary,\" von der Leyen said in a speech to European Parliament members. \"All instruments are on the table.\"\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that her country was waiting to see what Trump unveiled and respond in kind with a \"a comprehensive program, not a tit-for-tat on tariffs.\"\n\nRead more: Trump's tariff chart, mapped", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/02"}]}

You pick the news you want, we deliver.\n\nDanny will hopefully see his room come next summer at the vacation house in Falmouth run by the charity Tommy's Place, a former inn that is being renovated to become a getaway for sick children and their families.\n\nThe cost to sponsor a room, and make it fully his, is $25,000, not including the costs to turn it into something befitting Danny's vision of a proper room, but he did get a little help from his friends in the Marshfield Police Department on Monday. They donated $4,000 as part of their no-shave October. The police made Danny an honorary officer in 2019.\n\nOn Sunday, he got a little help from the drive-in at the Marshfield fairgrounds where his pick, \"The Goonies,\" earned the charity $600. Danny only got about halfway through the film before it scared him a little too much.\n\n\"It was getting very creepy,\" he said.\n\nWhen Danny was 4, doctors diagnosed him with pineoblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer that can spread in the brain and along the spinal cord. Despite his struggles against cancer, he has remained friendly, dancy, talkative. Marshfield Selectman Chris Rohland even read a proclamation to the boy, announcing Nov. 1 through 7 as his week, as he has inspired residents of the town by his brave face and dancing.\n\nMarshfield Lt. Arthur Shaw and Officer Jon Toomey are raising money to reach at least the $25,000 sponsorship goal for Danny's room at the Tommy's Place house by offering a chance to win a one-week stay at a house that sleeps 12 on Martha's Vineyard next September.\n\nIn years past, Marshfield police officers have raised money for Cops for Kids with Cancer, a charity that gives $5,000 to families of children with cancer. Last year, they raised almost $100,000, Shaw said. In 2018, they raised $75,000 for the charity.\n\nTickets for the chance to win vacation home cost $100 each and are being sold through local restaurants, including Haddad's Ocean Cafe, the Cask 'n Flagon and the Bridgwaye. Tickets are also being sold through Tommy's Place by email, at tommysplacefalmouth@gmail.com. Many local restaurants are also fashioning dishes in Danny's honor.\n\nShaw said in years past, much of the fundraising has taken place during the raffle itself, usually a big party at a restaurant. With social distancing requirements this year, and the announcement of tightened restrictions on gathering sizes, the main fundraising will have to be done through the raffle instead.\n\nTommy's Place is the result of efforts by Tim O'Connell, of Quincy, who lent his vacation rental house on Martha's Vineyard to the family of a child battling cancer. That led to the germ of an idea to turn a property into a vacation home for sick children and their families which eventually became Tommy's Place. Each room should feel completely different, like walking into a new world, inspired by the memory of whomever it is named after.\n\nO'Connell said he hopes he can finish renovating the former inn by next summer so Danny has a chance to help decorate it but he is largely at the mercy of his donated help. He is also trying to find the funds, or the donation, for an electrician.\n\nReporter Wheeler Cowperthwaite can be reached at wcowperthwaite@patriotledger.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/29/business/coke-new-flavor", "title": "Coke has a new flavor.

This time, it got some help.\n\nThe latest product out of Coca-Cola Creations — Coke’s innovation platform, which brought us starlight and pixel-flavored sodas — is a collaboration with Marshmello, a masked DJ and electronic music producer.\n\nIf you think the artist worked with Coke to develop a marshmallow-flavored beverage, you’re wrong. Instead, the new flavor has notes of strawberry and watermelon, Marshmello’s favorites.\n\n“For our third Coca-Cola Creations drop, we sought to add an unexpected remix of flavors to a great Coca-Cola taste,” said Oana Vlad, senior director of global strategy at the company, in a statement announcing the collaboration Wednesday.\n\n“We created a vibey blend of my favorite flavors in this all-new mix,” Marshmello said in a statement. “I think it tastes amazing and I hope fans love it too.”\n\nCoca-Cola's new flavor was created in collaboration with Marshmello. The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThe new flavor, which also comes in a zero-sugar variety, will be available for purchase starting on July 11 in the United States for a limited time. It will be offered in other countries later this summer.\n\nIt’s vital for Coca-Cola (KO), which has discontinued beloved but outdated drinks like Tab, Odwalla and Honest Tea, to get young consumers excited about its core product, Coke. Coca-Cola (KO) Creations, which launches digital experiences along with the limited-edition flavors, is designed to help do that.\n\nSo far, the flavors have been … abstract.\n\nStarlight was “inspired by space,” the company said in February, describing it as having “notes reminiscent of stargazing around a campfire, as well as a cooling sensation that evokes the feeling of a cold journey to space.”\n\nByte, the second flavor, “makes the intangible taste of the pixel tangible,” said Vlad when it launched in April.\n\nCompared to space and pixels, strawberry and watermelon are perfectly mundane. And the idea of partnering with artists on products featuring their favorite flavors is not new, at least in the fast food world.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) has had success with its celebrity meals, versions of artists’ preferred orders that are available for a limited time. The burger chain has teamed up with Travis Scott, BTS and Saweetie, among others. Burger King has followed with its own celebrity deals.\n\nFor Coca-Cola, this is the first time a beverage has been created with an artist, the company said.\n\nThe new flavor is getting the full Coca-Cola Creations digital treatment.\n\nOn July 9, ahead of the launch, it will appear on the gamer Loserfruit’s Twitch channel.

There, “AI technology will transform their emotions while listening to Marshmello’s latest track into a personalized piece of digital art,” according to the company.\n\nFor Starlight, there was a holographic concert by Ava Max.

New York Times trial will be an 'excruciating ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.\n\nThe next few days will not be very enjoyable for The New York Times.\n\nThe trial over Sarah Palin’s defamation lawsuit against the newspaper is finally underway after a short delay prompted by Palin’s positive Covid-19 test. A quick recap: Palin sued the paper in 2017 over an editorial that incorrectly linked the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords to a map circulated by Palin’s PAC that showed certain electoral districts under crosshairs. The Times corrected the error and apologized for it, and a judge initially dismissed the case. But a federal appeals court revived it and, as a result, a trial will now take place.\n\nThe case is, at its heart, about the limits of First Amendment protections and the standard set in the landmark New York Times vs. Sullivan case. Specifically, the standard that a public figure must prove an outlet operated with “actual malice” when it published defamatory information. Palin has argued The Times did, and The Times has said it made an honest error.\n\n“At issue is the elasticity of the protections that allow news organizations to present tough coverage of public figures,” Washington Post’s Erik Wemple wrote recently. “Or, to put things a bit more sharply, the case will help demarcate the line between really bad journalism and libelous journalism.”\n\nPalin’s lawyers didn’t comment ahead of the trial, but The Times did. A spokesperson for the paper told me before the trial started that it hopes to “reaffirm a foundational principle of American law: public figures should not be permitted to use libel suits to punish unintentional errors by news organizations.”\n\n“We published an editorial about an important topic that contained an inaccuracy. We set the record straight with a correction,” the spokesperson told me. “We are deeply committed to fairness and accuracy in our journalism, and when we fall short, we correct our errors publicly, as we did in this case.”\n\nPalin’s odds\n\nI reached out to renowned First Amendment attorney Ted Boutrous (full disclosure: Boutrous has represented CNN in previous cases) before the trial to ask him for his legal opinion of the case. He told me that he believes Palin “faces an enormously steep uphill battle” and “is likely to lose.”\n\nBoutrous summarized his reading of the case like this: “I don’t think she can possibly prove that the newspaper or its journalists acted with actual malice or that she suffered any harm from the original version of the editorial, which was quickly clarified and corrected. This lawsuit has always seemed to me to be part of a disturbing trend in recent years of high-profile political figures misusing libel suits as political stunts intended to chill speech on matters of public concern — exactly what the First Amendment forbids.”\n\n‘An excruciating experience’\n\nJeffrey Toobin, CNN’s chief legal analyst, also agreed that Palin is likely to lose in trial. But he stressed that doesn’t mean it’s going to be rainbows and unicorns for The Times in court. “Even though I expect The Times will ultimately win this case, the trial is likely to be an excruciating experience for everyone associated with it at The Times,” Toobin told me. “Because the simple fact is the story was wrong. And no journalist wants to be in a position of defending a story that was wrong.”\n\nWho will be in that position for The Times? James Bennet is expected to take the stand on Tuesday and editorial board member Elizabeth Williamson, who wrote the draft of the Palin editorial, testified last week. Times researcher Phoebe Lett and fact checker Eileen Lepping took the stand Monday.\n\nTo the Supreme Court?\n\nIf Palin loses in district court, she can attempt to take her case all the way up to the Supreme Court. Diminishing press protections by overturning New York Times vs. Sullivan, after all, has been a stated goal for many on the right for some time. And, as Toobin pointed out, “Palin is the perfect plaintiff and The New York Times is the perfect defendant for the right to mobilize against First Amendment protections for the press.”\n\nWhether it would ever make its way to the court, and whether it would side with Palin, is another story. “It very much remains to be seen whether the current judiciary is ready to cut back on First Amendment protections,” Toobin told me.\n\nBoutrous said if Palin loses her case in district court and attempts to get the Supreme Court to “use her case as a vehicle for overturning” the landmark case, she’ll still likely fail: “I don’t think the Court will do that because the Times decision is such a cornerstone of First Amendment jurisprudence and it has been endorsed over and over again by Justices across the political spectrum for many years, even though two Justices recently urged that it be revisited.”\n\nA potential to backfire against the right\n\nThe reporting from mainstream news sources tends to be a lot more buttoned up than reporting in right-wing media. Fox, for instance, is wrapping itself in the First Amendment as it defends itself from lawsuits against voting technology companies Dominion and Smartmatic.\n\nWhich is to say that the attempts to reduce press freedom on the right could backfire in enormous ways. “Fox needs those protections more than The New York Times at the moment,” Toobin pointed out. “The New York Times made a single mistake and behaved responsibly. Fox was the gateway for a torrent of lies that nearly destroyed these companies and has never appropriately apologized.”", "authors": ["Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/tech/washington-tiktok-big-tech", "title": "Washington moved fast to crack down on TikTok but has made little ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn a matter of days, the United States is expected to ban federal employees from downloading or using TikTok on government-issued phones or tablets, marking the country’s broadest crackdown on the short-form video app to date.\n\nThe looming ban is the result of a bill that’s moved through Congress in the final days of the year with lightning-fast speed and bipartisan support. It’s gone from being just another proposal from a Republican lawmaker to being unanimously adopted in the Senate, backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and added to a massive year-end congressional spending package. The proposed ban has support from the White House, which already blocks TikTok on its devices.\n\nThe TikTok measure, while limited in its impact on the app’s wider US user base, highlights how quickly lawmakers can act when a combination of national security fears, bipartisan anti-China suspicions, and more targeted proposals cause the legislative stars to align.\n\nBut in fast-tracking the bill, Congress can’t help but draw attention to its notable lack of progress on regulating American tech giants more broadly — despite years of reports, hearings and proposed legislation.\n\nThe stark difference between the two illustrates how simple narratives, well-funded lobbying and genuinely thorny policy questions can make or break a bill. It also hints at how a select few Big Tech companies continue to maintain their dominance in the market and their centrality in the lives of countless US households.\n\nWashington finds a different tech villain\n\nThe tech industry’s largest players have faced a kitchen sink of allegations in recent years. From knee-capping nascent rivals; to harming children and mental health; to undermining democracy; to spreading hate speech and harassment; to censoring conservative viewpoints; to bankrupting local news outlets; Big Tech has been made out as one of Washington’s largest villains.\n\nBut over the course of this year, TikTok has once again emerged as an even bigger target, two years after the Trump administration threatened to ban the application in the United States amid rising tensions with China. And one reason why is the relatively straightforward case that US policymakers have put forward for banning the app.\n\nThe central allegation against TikTok is that the company poses a potential national security risk. US officials have worried that the Chinese government could pressure TikTok or its parent company, ByteDance, into handing over the personal information of its US users, which could then be used for Chinese intelligence operations or the spreading of Chinese-backed disinformation.\n\nThere’s no evidence yet that that has actually happened. Still, policymakers and security experts have said China’s national security laws make it a possibility — identifying a kernel of risk that fits into a broader anti-China narrative linked to issues including trade, human rights and authoritarianism. Those concerns were renewed after a report this year suggested US user data had been repeatedly accessed by China-based employees. TikTok has disputed the report.\n\nIn recent weeks, numerous states have leapt on the bandwagon, further increasing the pressure on Congress to act. More than a dozen states have now banned TikTok on state government devices, from Maryland to South Dakota.\n\nTikTok has insisted it maintains robust security controls on its data and that it prioritizes user privacy. It has also taken steps in recent months to wall off US user data from other parts of its business, both technologically and organizationally. But earlier this year, it acknowledged that China-based employees can access TikTok user data and declined to commit to cutting off those data flows in general.\n\nSince 2020, TikTok has been negotiating with the US government on a possible deal to keep the app running in the United States. But those talks have so far proven fruitless, giving an opening to policymakers in Congress and at the state level to seek restrictions on TikTok.\n\n“We’re disappointed that Congress has moved to ban TikTok on government devices—a political gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interests—rather than encouraging the Administration to conclude its national security review,” said Brooke Oberwetter, a TikTok spokesperson.\n\nCongress has moved swiftly on a bill that would ban federal employees from downloading or using TikTok on government-issued phones or tablets. But it's been far slower to take meaningful action on American tech giants. Sarah Silbiger/Reuters\n\nTikTok’s head of public policy, Michael Beckerman, has called the ban affecting government devices a “political approach that doesn’t have any real impact on national security.”\n\n“We think a lot of the concerns are maybe overblown,” Beckerman told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Tuesday, “but we do think these problems can be solved” through the ongoing government negotiations.\n\nAmerican tech giants better at playing defense\n\nTikTok has significantly expanded its Washington presence in recent years.\n\nIn 2019, ByteDance had 17 lobbyists and spent $270,000 on lobbying, according to public records gathered by the transparency group OpenSecrets. By the end of last year, its lobbyist count had more than doubled and the company had spent nearly $5.2 million on lobbying.\n\nThat pales in comparison, however, to the full force of Big Tech’s lobbying machine, which has become one of the largest in Washington.\n\nMeta was the biggest internet industry lobbying giant last year, spending upward of $20 million. Next was Amazon at $19 million, then Google at almost $10 million. Combined, that’s roughly $49 million in lobbying — almost 10 times what was spent by TikTok’s parent, which nevertheless clocked in at number four on the list.\n\nTech giants have repeatedly deployed their CEOs to Capitol Hill, who in some cases have made arguments citing the threat of Chinese competition. They’ve also leaned on help from trade associations they’re members of and relied on advertising campaigns to make the case against some of the biggest legislative threats to their business.\n\nOne of those bills, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICOA), would erect new barriers between tech platforms’ various lines of business, preventing Amazon, for example, from being able to compete with third-party sellers on its own marketplace. That legislation was a product of a 16-month House antitrust investigation into the tech industry that concluded, in 2020, that many of the biggest tech companies were effectively monopolies.\n\nFor much of this year, supporters of AICOA insisted the legislation had enough votes to pass, and they called on Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to bring it to a floor vote. But between intense tech lobbying and doubts about whether the bill did in fact have the votes, it never received the floor time its supporters wanted. The same fate awaited other tech-focused antitrust bills, such as one that would have forced Apple to allow users to download iPhone apps from any website, not just its own app store.\n\nFor a brief moment this month, lawmakers seemed poised to pass a bill that could force Meta, Google and other platforms to pay news organizations a larger share of ad revenues. But the legislation stumbled after Meta warned it could have to drop news content from its platforms altogether if the bill passed.\n\nTime and again, Silicon Valley’s biggest players have maneuvered expertly in Washington, defending their turf from lawmakers keen to knock them down a peg.\n\nAn easy win for Congress\n\nBut it isn’t just lobbying that has made some of these bills difficult to pass. It’s much more challenging to impose sweeping regulations on an entire industry than it is to pass a bill governing how the US government handles its own technology.\n\nThe TikTok bill banning the app from government devices is seen as having a limited potential impact on the company’s wider US user base, which skews younger. A ban on public employees’ use of the app likely wouldn’t reach the many teens or other young people with whom the app has grown increasingly popular.\n\nWith at least 100 million US users as of 2020, and likely more by now, TikTok has become almost “too big” to ban outright, some analysts have said.\n\nPolitically speaking, in light of TikTok’s deep foothold among US consumers, a ban affecting government devices also represents low-hanging fruit for policymakers who enjoy clear legal authority over official devices and don’t have to worry about triggering a consumer backlash that a broader ban might invite.\n\nBy contrast, decisions about the rules government might impose on tech platforms have called into question how those regulations may affect different parts of the economy, from small businesses to individual users to the future of the internet itself.\n\nIn some cases, as with proposals to revise the tech industry’s decades-old content moderation liability shield, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, legislation may raise First Amendment issues as well as partisan divisions. Democrats have said Section 230 should be changed because it gives social media companies a pass to leave some hate speech and offensive content unaddressed, while Republicans have called for changes to the law so that platforms can be pressured to remove less content.\n\nThe cross-cutting politics and the technical challenges of regulating an entire sector of technology, not to mention the potential consequences for the economy of screwing it up, have combined to make it genuinely difficult for lawmakers to reach an accord.\n\nIt’s no wonder, then, that when Congress sees an easier victory within its grasp, lawmakers take it.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/29/economy/china-politburo-gdp-target-property-crisis-intl-hnk", "title": "Politburo meeting: China's top leaders have gone silent on the ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nChina’s top leadership has gone quiet on the growth targets it had set for the year, as the world’s second-largest economy continues to battle a largely self-inflicted economic slowdown.\n\nIn early March, China’s government had said that the country would target gross domestic product growth of about 5.5% this year. While that would be China’s lowest official target for economic growth in three decades, economists have said that it is looking increasingly impossible to reach.\n\nOver the last few months, the Chinese economy has been hammered by rigid Covid lockdowns, a crackdown on the private sector and an intensifying property crisis. Growth slowed to only 0.4% in the second quarter, while youth unemployment soared to an all-time high.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping claps hands during the Second Plenary Session of the Fifth Session of the 13th National People's Congress on March 08, 2022, at the Great Hall of the People, in Beijing, China.

At a key meeting of top leaders on Thursday, no mention of GDP targets was made, and analysts have said that this is a sign that the government thinks it might not be able to meet its goals after all.\n\nInstead, the country will now “strive to achieve the best possible results,” according to a statement after the Politburo — China’s top decision making body — convened Thursday to assess the latest status of the economy and set the policy tone for the second half. The government will also focus on stabilizing employment and prices, the statement added.\n\nThe meeting was chaired by President Xi Jinping, and attended by other members of the Politburo. The group of 25 top officials oversee the ruling Communist Party.\n\nThe tone of this meeting was in sharp contrast to the previous Politburo meeting in April, when policymakers vowed to “strive to meet economic and social targets” for this year.\n\n“Given China only grew 2.5% in the first half, the original [annual] target of around 5.5% is too high,” said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Capital, in a report late Thursday.\n\n“In today’s meeting, policymakers used the new phrase: ‘strive to achieve the best result.’ It means that they no longer view 5.5%, or even 5% as achievable for this year,” he added.\n\nBetty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ, also said Friday that policymakers are “prepared to miss the growth target.”\n\nNo flexibility on zero Covid\n\nDespite slowing growth, the top leadership didn’t suggest flexibility on zero-Covid policy at the meeting, which is a major drag on China’s economy.\n\nThe policy has a particular “political significance,” the Politburo statement said.\n\nAnalysts now think that China will adhere to its rigid Covid strategy till next year.\n\n“The Politburo vowed to stick with the zero-Covid strategy, and for the first time it explicitly mentioned politics is a particularly important factor to consider when handling the relationship between Covid controls and socio-economic development,” said Nomura analysts in a report on Thursday.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping (bottom) is applauded by members of the government as he arrives for the closing session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at the Great Hall of the People on March 10, 2022 in Beijing, China.

President Xi Jinping is expected to seek a historic third term in power at the meeting. If successful, he would be re-elected as the president in the parliamentary session in March 2023.\n\nProperty crisis and financial risks\n\nHowever, policymakers on Thursday acknowledged the economy is facing significant challenges and called on greater efforts to tackle a recent mortgage crisis.\n\nIn recent weeks, thousands of disgruntled homebuyers have threatened to stop paying mortgages for unfinished homes if construction is not completed in time. The boycott came as as a growing number of projects have been delayed or stalled by a cash crunch among property developers.\n\n“[We] must stabilize the real estate market,” the Politburo statement said.\n\nIt emphasized that local governments should take the responsibility to ensure pre-sold homes are completed and delivered to homebuyers.\n\n“In other words, it’s not very likely for the central government to set up a mega fund to buy out the majority of unfinished projects,” Hu from Macquarie Capital said.\n\nThe Politburo also discussed efforts to maintain the overall stability of the financial system, resolve risks related to local rural banks, and severely crack down on financial crimes.\n\nIn recent weeks, massive protests have erupted across central China, as thousands of depositors couldn’t access their savings at several rural banks in Henan and Anhui provinces.

Now, in an era of growing concern over privacy, he believes it’s time for us to reclaim our personal data.\n\nThrough their startup Inrupt, Berners-Lee and CEO John Bruce have created the “Solid Pod” — or Personal Online Data Store. It allows people to keep their data in one central place and control which people and applications can access it, rather than having it stored by apps or sites all over the web.\n\nUsers can get a Pod from a handful of providers, hosted by web services such as Amazon (AMZN), or run their own server, if they have they the technical know-how. The main attraction to self-hosting is control and privacy, says Berners-Lee.\n\nNot only is user data safe from corporations, and governments, it’s also less likely to be stolen by hackers, Bruce says.\n\n“I think we’ve all come to realize that the value of the web is embodied in the data available on it,” he adds. “In this new world of you looking after your own data, it doesn’t live in big silos that are lucrative targets for attackers.”\n\nInrupt’s platform is being tested by the UK’s National Health Service and by the government of the Belgian region of Flanders. The latter plans to use Pods to let its citizens choose how to share their personal data.\n\nIn October, the BBC introduced an experimental service using Pods for “watch parties,” where multiple friends stream a program at the same time. When the watch party ends, the user can see the data that has been generated, including which program they watched and who else joined, and choose whether to delete or edit the information — or let the BBC use it.\n\nIn a blog post, Eleni Sharp, an executive product manager for BBC Research and Development, described it as “a radically different approach to data management.”\n\nOwning your data\n\nLaunched in 2017, Inrupt reportedly raised $30 million in December 2021 and Berners-Lee says it will help deliver the next iteration of the web — “Web 3.”\n\nPaul Brody, Global Blockchain Leader at consulting firm Ernst and Young, believes Web 3 could change the way we use the internet. “You’ll hear people talk about Web 3 and decentralization as being very similar in ideas and goals,” he says.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This startup could help you control your personal data 00:52 - Source: CNN This startup could help you control your personal data 00:52\n\n“Owning your own data and really controlling your own commerce infrastructure is something that Web 3 will enable.

Opened by 27-year-old south Florida native William Francis, Slicers Hoagies, located on the southeast corner of Livingston and Pine Ridge roads, was designed to provide a homey and friendly atmosphere.\n\nThe message above the door says it all: \"Arrive a customer, leave a friend.\"\n\nAnyone who makes a hoagie like that is a friend in my book.\n\nDiners won't find glitz and glam at Slicers. Service is fast. Fountain drinks are self-serve. Cleanup? You're on your own. But it doesn't need any of that nonsense. It would get in the way of good sandwiches.\n\nA display of menu items is done up in chalk on the other side of the prep table, with containers of fresh veggies facing up behind the glass. The atmosphere feels young and hip, with skateboards and graffiti art across the walls.\n\nAt first customers might think it's wallpaper, but then they'll notice that each letter looks slightly different. Miami muralist Renda Writer spent 14 hours writing \"SLICERS HOAGIES\" in red and black spray paint across the walls of the restaurant. It's totally rad.\n\nHoagies can be ordered as a small 8 inch or large 12 inch. Deli sandwiches are served cold, and the \"specials\" menu comes toasted, with interesting flavor combinations like cool ranch Doritos in the \"Double Dip\" and Nacho Doritos in the \"Duh Durc.\"\n\nFor dinner on a recent Sunday evening visit, Francis suggested \"The Twang\" and the \"Phil Billy\" off the specials, and we were quickly convinced.\n\nHoney dijon sauce, sliced chicken breast, onion, white American cheese and crumbled Mesquite BBQ chips make up The Twang ($9.50), all of its toppings wedged between a white roll; \"roll\" is the appropriate term for hoagie bread, I've learned.\n\nAnd that's where Slicers shines.\n\nThe downfall of most sub and sandwich shops is hard bread. Even toasted, the rolls at Slicers were soft and fluffy, and those alone will bring us back for a second, third and fourth trip.\n\nStaff told us The Twang tastes a little like Chick-fil-A, with the chicken breast and sweet and smoky flavors. We didn't quite pick up on Chick-fil-A, though. The chips added a nice crunch, the mesquite flavor coming through strong. We would have liked a little more honey dijon.\n\nThe Phil Billy ($8.70) , meanwhile, was the most memorable item we sampled. Smeared with a slightly spicy sriracha mayo, the roll was stuffed with roast beef, locally grown greens, onion, pepper jack cheese and hot pepper relish. We also added sweet peppers.\n\nWithin a few minutes the bottom roll was a bit soggy from the drippy relish, but we couldn't complain. The Phil Billy was an interesting take on a classic Philly cheese steak, spicy without the watery eyes and runny nose. We've thought about it a lot since then.\n\nThe Slicer ($7.35), the quintessential basic sub sandwich, with ham, turkey and roast beef, was exactly what it should have been. We completed the ensemble with mayo, white American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and banana peppers. It was fresh and filling, with more of those tasty soft rolls.\n\nSlicers adds plenty of meat, which they slice ready to order in front of the customer. A layer goes on the bottom and a layer goes on the top, gently wrapping the vegetable toppings in a cozy meat blanket. Again, Slicers comes on top of other popular sub shops, which often let the toppings overpower the meat.\n\nSlicers' salad menu offers all the same deli meats, but in chopped salad form. The buffalo chicken salad ($8.25) featured shreds of the smoky chicken lunch meat, with either spring mix or iceberg lettuce and choice of veggies, cheese and dressing. I found myself picking through the cucumbers, tomatoes, banana peppers and lettuce to find the good parts — the chicken and white American cheese. I could have just snacked on those.\n\nI've had better salads, but have I had a better hoagie? I don't think so.\n\nSlicers Hoagies", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/tech/ftc-warning-tech-health-data", "title": "FTC warns tech companies against misusing health data, following ...", "text": "Washington CNN Business —\n\nTech companies and data brokers that misuse or misrepresent how they handle Americans’ personal data, including reproductive health information, may find themselves on the hook with the Federal Trade Commission, the agency warned this week.\n\nOn Monday, the FTC renewed its vow to investigate or sue companies that use Americans’ digital data in unfair or deceptive ways, following an executive order by the Biden administration that explicitly called for it and other agencies to consider steps to protect abortion-seekers. Since the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, civil liberties experts have warned that Americans’ extensive digital footprints could give away whether they have visited an abortion clinic or sought information on how to access an abortion, prompting questions about the security of that data.\n\n“The misuse of mobile location and health information – including reproductive health data – exposes consumers to significant harm,” the FTC said in a blog post. “The exposure of health information and medical conditions, especially data related to sexual activity or reproductive health, may subject people to discrimination, stigma, mental anguish, or other serious harms.”\n\nIt added: “The Commission is committed to using the full scope of its legal authorities to protect consumers’ privacy. We will vigorously enforce the law if we uncover illegal conduct that exploits Americans’ location, health, or other sensitive data.”\n\nIn particular, the FTC said, regulators will closely scrutinize corporate claims that Americans’ data has been or will be “anonymized,” in light of substantial research showing that it can be trivial to reverse-engineer a person’s identity from anonymized datasets. The FTC said it has also sued companies in the past for collecting more data than consumers have consented to providing or that retain user data for indefinite periods of time.\n\nLast year, the FTC settled with Flo Health, the maker of a fertility app used by more than 100 million consumers, for allegedly sharing pregnancy and other data with Facebook and Google despite saying the information would only be used to facilitate the app’s normal function. (In a statement at the time, Flo said the settlement was “not an admission of any wrongdoing.”)\n\nThe FTC’s warning is a reminder that digital information ostensibly collected for one purpose may wind up being used for others through the country’s sprawling and loosely regulated data economy, in which personal data is constantly bought and sold, or chopped up and repackaged with other information.\n\nAccording to a 2014 FTC report, some data brokers may hold thousands of pieces of information on every consumer in the United States. FTC Chair Lina Khan has said the agency is considering drafting new regulations to rein in what she has called a “commercial surveillance” industry that profits from intrusive data collection and sharing, while Congress is currently considering a bill that could enshrine a baseline data privacy right for all Americans at a national level for the first time in US history.\n\nMonday’s warning is in some ways routine; the FTC has prosecuted numerous data security and privacy cases over the past decade, and courts have broadly supported the agency’s authority over data breaches and leaks. But the FTC statement takes on greater significance as policymakers and digital rights groups have sounded the alarm over the novel risks that geolocation, search and other data may pose to abortion-seekers in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/07/01/these-6-items-are-actually-on-us-fastfood-menus-now/86463356/", "title": "These 6 items are actually on U.S. fast-food menus now", "text": "Daniel B. Kline\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWhen you hear that Restaurant Brands International's (NYSE: QSR) Burger King has introduced fried macaroni and cheese covered in Cheetos dust, it's reasonable to question whether someone is playing a prank on you.\n\nThat product, like Yum Brands' (NYSE: YUM) Taco Bell Doritos Locos Taco, may sound preposterous, but it's actually real. In fact, while Burger King's Mac n' Cheetos is new, the Doritos Locos Taco has been an enduring hit that kicked off by selling more than 450 million units in its first year after being introduced in 2012. It has remained a hit since that early success, not only becoming a permanent part of the menu, but also spawning a number of spinoff versions based on Doritos flavors.\n\nIt's that type of potential hit that drives fast-food chain and other eateries to try increasingly ridiculous ideas. Of course, it's much more likely that a new product will be more like McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) ill-fated Hula Burger, which replaced the burger patty with a pineapple slice, or Sonic's short-lived Pickle O's than a Doritos Loco Taco-like hit.\n\nBut because the rewards are potentially so high chains keep trying. Below are six out-of-the-ordinary food items that are now on fast-food menus in the U.S.\n\nA cheeseburger for people who wanted a sub\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhile Mac n' Cheetos may well be the most ridiculous item mentioned in this story, Burger King has another contender. The chain sells what it calls an Extra Long Cheeseburger. Sold on a hoagie/sub/hero roll, the sandwich is basically a regular cheeseburger with all the normal fixings, but sold in a different shape. Perhaps it's an effort to win back customers who go to Subway not because it has some lower-calorie choices, but because it offers longer sandwiches.\n\nMcDonald's goes way beyond the burger\n\nFor the second year in a row, after a decade on hiatus, McDonald's has brought its lobster roll back to select restaurants on the East Coast. While a chain that sells something called a McNugget with a seafood menu consisting entirely of the not-sure-what-fish-it-is Filet-O-Fish seems like a dubious choice for lobster, it began selling it June 20.\n\nDespite the general skepticism about McDonald's selling such a high-end protein, the chain insists its lobster rolls are \"100% North Atlantic lobster meat lightly tossed with mayonnaise in a stainless steel bowl, layered on crisp leaf and shredded lettuce and served chilled on a home-style toasted roll.\"\n\nAvailable through mid-August at participating McDonald's restaurants in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, parts of Connecticut, and in the Albany, N.Y., area, the lobster roll costs $8.99.\n\nTaco Bell loves snack chips\n\nNot content to just offer a variety of tacos in Doritos-based shells (varieties now include a Cool Ranch as well as a Fiery version) Taco Bell also offers something called a Beefy Fritos Burrito. The item, which appears on the chain's dollar menu, contains seasoned beef, nacho cheese sauce, and Fritos corn chips.\n\nIf you order one online the chain also offers the ability to customize your Beefy Fritos Burrito with \"pizza sauce\" among a list of much more logical choices.\n\nWho can argue with bacon?\n\nStuffing things in the crust of pizza has become a recent trend. Pizza Hut, another Yum Brands company, has made doing that an art form taken to amazing extremes. In the past that has included crusts stuffed with hot dogs, but now the chain has decided to offer bacon stuffed-crust pizza.\n\nThere's no subtlety here — it's a pizza crust filled with cheese and bits of applewood smoked bacon. That seems a bit excessive when you consider you are already eating a pizza, but it's hard to argue with adding bacon to anything.\n\nShould chicken come in shapes?\n\nIt's possible that Burger King's Chicken Fries actually seem less ridiculous because they have been around for a while. But just because the American public has become used to the idea of chicken fingers made even more portable by selling them in a french fry-like shape does not make the concept any less novel.\n\nChicken Fries are now a permanent BK menu item and various versions have been offered including buffalo, spicy, and even a circle-shaped take on the concept, which looked more like an onion ring than a french fry.\n\nThat experiment did not last very long, but Burger King has shown its willingness to experiment, so it's possible the Chicken Fry will continue to evolve going forward. That may mean new shapes, flavors, or perhaps an expansion of the accompanying dipping sauce line which includes BBQ, honey mustard, ranch, zesty, buffalo, and sweet & sour.\n\nHave your (funnel) cake and eat it, too\n\nGenerally reserved for fairs, funnel cake is fried batter covered with powdered sugar and maybe whipper cream and/or hot fudge or other sauces. Dairy Queen, a Berkshire Hathaway company, has taken that old-time favorite and given it its own spin. The fast-food and ice cream chain has introduced Funnel Cake a la Mode, which it's not calling a special item. Instead, Dairy Queen seems so sure of the new treat that it immediately declared it a permanent addition to the menu, in its launch press release.\n\nThe company describes the Funnel Cake a la Mode as \"a hot, crispy, golden brown funnel cake that's dusted with powdered sugar and served with a side of cold, creamy signature DQ soft serve, all drizzled with a choice of hot fudge, caramel or strawberry topping.\"\n\nThat may just be the perfect capper for a day filled with Chicken Fries, snack chip-based Mexican food, pizza with bacon-stuffed crust, and oddly shaped burgers. Of course, that assumes you still have a taste for dessert after you have eaten a fast-food lobster roll.\n\nSPONSOR CONTENT: A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity\n\nThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Had Letter lost, Congress’ oversight powers would have been dealt a generational setback by the courts – a perennial fear of lawmakers and lawyers from both parties. Though Letter had the backing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, current and former Democratic aides said that he often butted heads with some House Democrats, who were frustrated by the slow-moving courts and cases that outlasted the Trump administration.\n\n“There were some very tense conversations,” one senior Democratic aide told CNN. “We felt like this very powerful oversight tool, if we lost, was gutted.”\n\nEventually, Letter’s big bet on the court system paid off. House Democrats secured testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn, brought about the criminal conviction of witness Steve Bannon for contempt, convinced a federal judge to agree Trump may have committed a crime after the 2020 election, obtained Trump-related accounting records, and, after a determination from the Supreme Court last month, finally got their hands on Trump’s tax returns.\n\nIn doing so, Letter enshrined key congressional oversight powers, bolstering Congress’ ability to pursue information and dismantling sweeping arguments aimed at shielding Trump from congressional scrutiny.\n\nHis victories, however, are bittersweet for Democrats. Come January, those newly won powers will be in the hands of a Republican House majority, which has promised to launch a series of aggressive investigations into the Biden administration. Thanks to Letter’s legal wins, GOP subpoenas will come with more enforcement power, potentially aiding them in future fights to compel testimony from administration officials or even President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\n“I’m sure that there will be an instance during the time that Republicans control the House that they will benefit from the work that Letter has done in the last four years,” said Tom Spulak, who served as House general counsel under Democratic leadership in 1994 and 1995.\n\n‘Not a TV lawyer’\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal lauded Letter’s role at a news conference last week following his committee’s vote to make Trump’s tax returns public. The Massachusetts Democrat said he talked to Letter nearly every week for the three-plus years the case was ongoing, while heeding the House counsel’s advice not to talk about Trump’s returns on cable TV or to fundraise off the case.\n\nThe approach kept the tax returns case on the backburner for years, while the House took other, more challenging cases seeking similar information through the courts.\n\n“Not being an attorney, I scrupulously followed the advice of Doug Letter — who by the way, was not a TV lawyer. He’s argued four times in front of the Supreme Court, and he’s the one that counseled me repeatedly,” Neal said. “At one point I called him in Italy to get an update while he was on vacation. That’s how assiduously we pursued the merits of the case.”\n\nLetter, typically bursting with energy on days he argued cases in court, leaves his position January 3 with the end of the current Congress and will take a new job with Brady, the gun violence prevention nonprofit.\n\nHouse Democrats’ choice of Letter in late 2018 as their top lawyer immediately stood out. One, because he came to the House from the Justice Department, which would be lawmakers’ opponent in many of the Trump-era disputes. Secondly, because he was a top litigator, a sign the House wouldn’t be afraid of going to court.\n\nBefore 2019, it was very unusual for the House to sue – and a risk. The executive branch over decades had found ways to expand and support presidential powers, yet prior House general counsels had typically avoided testing congressional power with judges, especially in appeals that could set precedent. The conventional wisdom was that if tested, the courts could cut back Congress’ power.\n\nInstead, Congress and the executive branch mostly stuck to negotiations over subpoenas, which is formally known as the “accommodations process,” the historical norm.\n\nThe calculus for Congress shifted dramatically once Democrats took over the House in 2019 and Trump made clear he would stonewall the chamber’s subpoenas and sue lawmakers if needed.\n\nIn practice, that also meant Letter was involved in every step of the process of investigations, according to aides, reviewing language in letters sent to witnesses, news releases that committees issued, and what committee chairs said about the subpoenas publicly. The committees’ actions – including providing extra “accommodations” that Democrats were sometimes frustrated by – were all taken with an eye toward future litigation.\n\n“Doug’s function is to make sure that the only subpoenas that get issued are ones we are prepared to defend in court,” said a senior Democratic aide. “It became clear very quickly we were going to have to defend a lot of subpoenas in court, and so it was his job a lot of the time to say no.”\n\nAmong the most difficult decisions for Democratic oversight was the one to pursue Trump’s tax returns. Neal’s hope of trying to find common ground with Republicans on potentially bipartisan issues like infrastructure and tax reform was at odds with the pressure he was feeling from the left to go after Trump’s tax returns. He chose to seek them in April 2019.\n\nThe IRS rejected the request – which came after Trump, as a presidential candidate, broke political norms by refusing to release his returns voluntarily – and the House filed a lawsuit to obtain them, starting the long and winding legal road that concluded last month, nearly two years after Trump left office and just weeks before Democrats are set to lose control of the House.\n\nThe pace of the court process was frustrating at times for Democrats. “We can’t go out there and say Doug is holding up this process,” said one aide familiar with the discussions. “I think there was little bit of not understanding the political realities that members have and the pressures they get from the public. But that wasn’t his job.”\n\nLetter declined to speak to CNN for this story.\n\nPushing back on sweeping Trump legal arguments\n\nAn early, striking indication of Letter’s willingness to go to court came with the House decision to sue over McGahn not appearing for testimony before the Judiciary Committee, after the Mueller report made clear that McGahn was a central witness to Trump trying to stop the Russia investigation.\n\n“There was a sense of, ‘this is the last bastion of democracy,’” said a former Justice Department official and close observer of the House’s work during Letter’s tenure.\n\nWhile McGahn had spoken at length to special counsel Robert Mueller for his criminal obstruction investigation, the House took McGahn and the Trump administration through multiple rounds in court before securing his testimony in a settlement after Biden took office. The litigation, where Letter personally argued several rounds, left a trail of mixed results for the House.\n\nThe House went on to try a different approach to enforce its subpoenas, looking to federal criminal prosecutors rather than lawsuits for enforcement help.\n\nThe select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol made several criminal contempt referrals to the Justice Department when witnesses refused to turn over documents or show up for testimony. Of four recalcitrant witnesses, DOJ declined to prosecute two who served close to the former president but charged Trump advisers Bannon and Peter Navarro criminally.\n\nBannon was convicted at trial, sentenced to four months in jail, and is appealing – a consequential outcome that may sway other private citizens to try harder to accommodate congressional requests. Navarro heads to trial in January.\n\nLetter also argued a case before the Supreme Court in 2020 where Trump tried to block a House subpoena for his financial information from the accounting firm Mazars USA.\n\nColleagues of Letter worried that the argument went badly for Congress, yet the House ultimately won the case, albeit with a twist: The Supreme Court said Congress could subpoena information about Trump, but also laid out a specific test lawmakers had to meet to do so.\n\nThe battles over the reach of presidential secrecy continued after he left office, with the House prevailing over a Trump bid to block the January 6 committee from obtaining his presidential records from the National Archives.\n\nThe House also convinced a trial-level judge to give it access to emails from John Eastman, a Trump elections attorney. In doing so, the judge agreed with House accusations that Trump and Eastman had taken part in the planning of a crime. The House’s legal arguments were some of the boldest a congressional body has ever made in court and laid the foundation for the January 6 panel’s unprecedented criminal referrals of Trump. When the House committee released its final report last week, it recommended changing the law so the House could sue to enforce subpoenas – a weakness Letter’s years of work in court had made apparent.\n\n“This period will be remembered as one of the most significant in history, not just because of the unprecedented obstruction by the Trump administration but because the House committees were able to challenge that,” said Dave Rapallo, the longtime Democratic staff director on the House Oversight Committee who is now a law professor at Georgetown University.\n\nRepublicans can build on House Democrats’ gains\n\nRepublicans set to take control of House committees said they plan on launching numerous investigations into Biden’s administration as well as his family. Many of those probes may benefit from the court decisions Letter won for congressional investigators.\n\nGOP Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who’s slated to take over the House Oversight Committee, criticized the Democrats’ aggressive subpoena approach in a recent interview with CNN’s Pamela Brown. Comer has made clear he plans to investigate Biden, questioning the extent he was involved in his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings, but said he didn’t plan to subpoena the president because of the complications.\n\n“The Democrats sent out subpoenas like junk mail, and that’s why it’s hard to get people to come in,” Comer said. “I will be disciplined with subpoenas.”\n\nOthers predicted Republicans will be more aggressive than Comer lets on.\n\n“The Republican Congress is going to use every tactic and precedent set by the January 6 Committee,” said Robert Driscoll, a defense attorney in Washington who recently sued the House to block a subpoena.\n\nRepublicans’ choice for general counsel will signal what role they see the courts playing in their oversight work while in the majority.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who’s fighting for the votes to become speaker in January, is still considering possible candidates for the job, according to a source close to congressional investigations, but that lawyer and their strategy likely won’t be secured until the speakership is settled.\n\nSave for the election of the speaker himself, the source argued, the general counsel selection will be the most consequential choice for the new GOP conference.", "authors": ["Katelyn Polantz Jeremy Herb Tierney Sneed", "Katelyn Polantz", "Jeremy Herb", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/11/10/obamacare-oversight-republicans-issa-house/3464979/", "title": "New tool in GOP battle against Obamacare: hearings", "text": "Gregory Korte\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCongress has held five hearings since Oct. 1%3B two more are scheduled this week\n\nRepublicans say close oversight is part of members%27 duty\n\nDemocrats say GOP%27s %22obsession%22 with Obamacare is preventing anything else from getting done\n\nWASHINGTON — Republicans have tried 46 times to repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act. They've challenged it in court and at the ballot box, and even shut down the government in an attempt to delay it.\n\nTheir most recent tactic has also been their most effective: congressional oversight.\n\nCongress has held five hearings on the law since the health insurance exchanges launched on Oct. 1. Two more hearings are scheduled for this week. There have been four subpoenas, and dozens of requests for information that have yielded nearly daily revelations.\n\nAmong them: that the HealthCare.gov website broke down after only 1,100 users tried to create accounts; that paper applications for insurance were stuck in the same process as the online applications; and that there were only five documented enrollments in the District of Columbia's exchange in October.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee has issued two subpoenas in the past 10 years. Both were related to the Affordable Care Act — including a subpoena last week for raw data on enrollments through federal exchanges.\n\nThe ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Sandy Levin, D-Mich., complains that the GOP's \"obsession\" with Obamacare is preventing anything else from getting done.\n\n\"I'm all in favor of oversight. This isn't oversight to make things better. This is oversight to make sure things get worse,\" he said.\n\nSarah Swinehart, a spokeswoman for the Republicans on the committee, said the oversight is part of members' representational duty.\n\n\"Everybody has constituents. Everybody's getting questions,\" she said. Whereas the debate over heath insurance was theoretical before, \"now it's part of people's lives, and these decisions are starting to affect everyone,\" she said.\n\nUnder Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the Oversight Committee has become known for politically polarizing investigations into a Mexican \"gun walking\" operation, the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of political groups – usually but not always conservative – for extra scrutiny.\n\nThose investigations have often lasted a year or more. But the Affordable Care Act is a law with various provisions rolling out over several years, giving Republicans dozens of opportunities to hold continuing oversight.\n\n\"How often is it that government adds a gigantic new entitlement program?\" said Issa spokesman Frederick Hill. \"If there's a road map, it's where the program unrolls.\"\n\nIn January, for example, the committee will likely look into people who thought they had signed up for health insurance but are not getting the benefits they were promised, Hill said.\n\nWith the administration slow to release information, congressional investigators switched to another tactic: compelling contractors and insurance companies to release their records. But Hill said the administration has shut down one fruitful source of information: notes of the daily \"war room\" meetings involving government officials and contractors trying to fix the problems.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said those notes were not an official record of the meetings, but were one contractor's notes. A spokeswoman would not confirm whether HHS had instructed the contractor to stop taking notes.\n\n\"We continue to work diligently to cooperate with Congress,\" said HHS press secretary Joanne Peters. She said officials have testified at more than two dozen hearings since 2010, and provided thousands of pages of documents.\n\nWednesday, the oversight committee will hold a hearing on the problems with the HealthCare.gov rollout. Witnesses include five top government information technology officials, including the White House's chief technology officer, Todd Park, who was subpoenaed.\n\n\"They can't wait two weeks or three weeks for him to testify?\" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the ranking Democrat on the committee. He accused Republicans of deliberately trying to tie up top administration officials on Capitol Hill so that they won't be able to fix the problems. \"It pains me to say this, but it's about trying to make sure there's another roadblock to making it work.\"'\n\nAngela Canterbury, the director of public policy for the Project on Government Oversight, said congressional hearings also have a way of focusing attention on problems. \"There's a legitimate need for some scrutiny and some pressure,\" she said. \"You want to get attention to the issue. Yes, some of these hearings are highly charged and political, and those are the ones that get into the newspapers.\"\n\nIndeed, political scientists say, congressional oversight is increasingly about publicity for publicity's sake. \"Oversight has become unhinged in the current political system. It's not about solving problems,\" said Matthew Dull, an associate professor at Virginia Tech's Center for Public Administration and Policy. \"It's about an audience. It's about politics. It's about agenda-setting.\"\n\nBut the current crop of House Republicans didn't invent aggressive, publicity-seeking oversight, Dull said. He quotes from an doctoral dissertation written in 1885 that rings just as true today: \"Congress cannot control the officers of the executive without disgracing them,\" wrote a young political scientist by the name of Woodrow Wilson.\n\nFollow @gregorykorte on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/22/president-trump-files-lawsuit-over-house-cummings-subpoena-financial-records/3537682002/", "title": "President Trump files lawsuit over House demand for financial records", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump and his private business filed a federal lawsuit Monday to block the House from obtaining financial records from the company’s longtime accountant.\n\nThe 14-page complaint, which reads like a cross between a campaign ad and a traditional lawsuit, accuses House Democrats of having “declared all-out political war” with “subpoenas are their weapon on choice.” It asks a federal court to prevent the Trump Organization's accounting firm, Mazars USA, from being forced to turn over financial records to congressional investigators.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest salvo in a series of investigation that are continuing into Trump and his businesses in the aftermath of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. That probe ended without a finding that Trump had committed a crime, but federal prosecutors and a half-dozen congressional committees are conducting separate investigations of the president and his business.\n\nTrump's lawsuit Monday came in response to a subpoena issued last week by the House Oversight and Reform Committee for Mazars, the longtime accountant for Trump and his businesses, seeking eight years of financial documents.\n\nTrump lawyers argued that the subpoena was invalid because it lacked “a legitimate legislative purpose.\" The lawyers asked for the subpoena to be ruled invalid and for an order to block Mazars from producing the requested information.\n\n\"We will not allow congressional presidential harassment to go unanswered,\" said Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president.\n\nOversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., has said the committee sought Trump’s financial documents to determine whether Trump has accurately reported his own finances.

It is the first court test of how much information the half-dozen committees conducting investigations of Trump and his businesses might be able to obtain.\n\nTrump and his namesake businesses filed a lawsuit last month asking U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to revoke a subpoena issued by the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Trump's lawyers accused the Democratic-controlled committee of abusing their power and said there was no legislative purpose for the request.\n\nMehta cited three possible reasons Tuesday to block the subpoena: that Congress has no general authority to investigate the president’s private life, that it can’t investigate for the sake of exposure; and that Congress can’t encroach on the powers of the other two branches.\n\nMehta didn't indicate whether he found those reasons sufficiently persuasive to block the House subpoena. But he suggested history might not be on the president's side, saying courts had not found that Congress overstepped its subpoena authority since 1880 and questioning Trump's lawyers about the basis for previous investigations of presidents.\n\nTrump’s personal lawyer, William Consovoy, argued repeatedly that Congress was seeking the president's financial information for what is essentially a law-enforcement purpose – which was outside its authority – rather than to work on legislation. The subpoena sought Trump’s financial records to look for inconsistencies in his financial disclosure forms, and whether he misstated his holdings for loans that could leave him beholden to foreigners.\n\n“That is law enforcement,” Consovoy said. “Are you complying with federal law?”\n\nAt one point, Mehta asked whether Congress could investigate if the president was engaged in corrupt behavior in office.\n\n“I don’t think that’s the proper subject of investigation as to the president,” Consovoy said, although executive agencies could be investigated.\n\nMehta sounded incredulous, asking whether Congress could have investigated Watergate, which led to President Richard Nixon's resignation, and Whitewater, which led to President Bill Clinton's impeachment. Consovoy initially said he’d have to look at the basis for those investigations.\n\n“They were inquiring as to violations of criminal law,” Mehta said. “It’s pretty straightforward – among other things.”\n\nConsovoy said the question is whether the legislation the committee cited was a valid reason for the subpoena.\n\n“That is still law enforcement,\" Consovoy said.\n\nBut Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House, argued that Congress has broad investigative authority.\n\n“His main client, President Trump, has taken the position really that Congress and particularly the House of Representatives is a nuisance and we’re just getting in his way when he’s trying to run the country,” Letter said. “The problem with that is that this is a total and basic and fundamental misunderstanding of the system that is set up by the Constitution.”\n\nLetter acknowledged under questioning by Mehta that hypothetically Congress might overstep by asking for the president’s blood or for his diary as a 7-year-old. But Letter said Trump’s lawsuit is so far outside the bounds of past Supreme Court decisions that he has “no chance for success” and urged a quick decision in the case because of Congress’s limited term.\n\n“These are totally legitimate things for Congress to look into,” Letter said.\n\nLetter said any delay in the decision in the case would undermine the House's authority to pursue investigations.\n\n“President Trump has no chance of success here on the merits of his claim,\" Letter said.\n\nConsovoy replied that limiting Congress' power only when it pries so deeply as to seek presidential blood or a childhood diary is “unbridled.\"\n\n\"That's simply unimaginable,\" he said.\n\nMehta said at the start of the hearing that he wouldn’t rule right away, but would try to do so quickly. He said he would give both sides until Saturday to submit additional information.\n\nAnother subpoena fight between Trump and Congress is scheduled to be heard next week in federal court in New York.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest salvo in a series of investigations that are continuing into Trump and his businesses in the aftermath of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. That probe ended without a finding that Trump had committed a crime, but federal prosecutors and congressional committees are conducting a variety of separate investigations into the president and his businesses.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee held Attorney General William Barr in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for Mueller's unredacted report and its underlying evidence, a prelude to pursuing the documents in court. The House Ways and Means Committee subpoenaed Trump's tax records. The House Intelligence and Financial Services committees jointly subpoenaed Trump's business records from Deutsche Bank. And the Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., as part of its Russia inquiry.\n\nTrump’s central argument in trying to block access to the Mazars documents is that congressional oversight applies only to the development of legislation. Without any legislative purpose, Trump contends the committee’s request represents political warfare.\n\n“The Democrat Party, with its newfound control of the U.S. House of Representatives, has declared all-out political war against President Donald J. Trump. Subpoenas are their weapon of choice,” the president’s lawsuit said. “There is no possible legislation at the end of the tunnel.”\n\nOversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., has said the committee sought Trump’s financial documents to determine whether Trump has accurately reported his own finances. Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who entered prison for three years this month for crimes including lying to Congress, told the committee in February that Trump routinely inflated his holdings to obtain loans and reduced his estimates to avoid real-estate taxes.\n\n“Trump’s attacks on the committee’s investigations amount to nothing more than political histrionics and hyperbole,” the committee said in its reply to the lawsuit.\n\nThe committee argued that it was investigating numerous constitutional, conflict of interest and ethical questions. For example, the committee noted $75 million in debt connected to Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago and $50 million in assets of Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. Those figures were listed in Trump’s government financial-disclosure forms beginning in 2015, but not in a 2012 statement from Mazars that Cohen provided the committee, according to the committee response.\n\nThe committee said its legislative jurisdiction includes the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, “which requires federal officials to publicly disclose financial liabilities that could affect their decision-making,” and legislation the House approved this year called HR 1, which would require the president to “divest of all financial interests that post a conflict of interest.”\n\nConsovoy argued that at least HR 1 was unconstitutional because of the demands it put on the president, and shouldn't be considered justification for the subpoena.\n\nMore about President Donald Trump's legal battles with Congress:\n\nPresident Trump and his businesses ask a court to block Congress from obtaining accounting records\n\n'Slow-motion constitutional car crash': Trump, Congress battle over investigations with no end in sight\n\nPresident Trump still facing swirl of investigations even after Robert Mueller's probe has ended\n\nLike what you're reading?: Download the USA TODAY app for more", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/24/trump-congress-broad-fights-over-investigations-and-subpoenas-mcgahn-census/3552103002/", "title": "'We're fighting all the subpoenas.' Congress and Trump prepare to ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – After weeks of clashes, Congress and the White House seem to have finally figured out what they're fighting over: Everything.\n\nAnd they're setting up a series of legal battles that could reshape the boundaries of presidential power and legislative oversight.\n\nA request for President Donald Trump's tax returns? The Treasury secretary called it \"unprecedented\" with \"serious consequences\" for taxpayer privacy. Testimony from a White House staffer about security clearances? The administration blocked his appearance. Requiring documents and testimony from a former White House counsel? The administration is considering asserting executive privilege to prevent it.\n\nEvery administration has fought with Congress, but seldom like this. Lawmakers are seeking information that would shed light on Trump's personal affairs, and the White House has responded with personal attacks. Instead of battling over one or two issues, lawmakers have made clear that they intend to dig widely into the president's conduct. The White House has signaled it will fight them on every front.\n\n\"We're fighting all the subpoenas. These aren't like impartial people. The Democrats are trying to win 2020,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"The only way they can luck out is by constantly going after me on nonsense.\"\n\nThe disputes appear headed to federal courts, a prospect that could embroil all three branches of government in a test of presidential power. Trump himself has already launched one such fight, suing to block his longtime accountant from providing financial records to congressional investigators.\n\n“This is a massive, unprecedented, and growing pattern of obstruction,\" Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Maryland Democrat who heads the Oversight and Reform Committee, said Wednesday.\n\nThe atmosphere is so combative that routine requests have become skirmishes. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross refused to testify this month at the House Appropriations Committee and in late March at the Senate Appropriations Committee, where he was expected to face questions about adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.\n\nMark Harkins, a senior fellow in the government affairs institute at Georgetown University and former House Democratic staffer, called Ross' refusal \"astounding.\"\n\n\"What is unusual is the number of different fronts,\" Harkins said. \"The personal nature of the current bout of congressional oversight, such as wanting tax returns and financial records prior to serving in office, is what distinguishes the current bout of friction.\"\n\nTrump emerged from the shadow of Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry only to find a cascade of other investigations.\n\nMueller found that Trump hadn't conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. But Mueller's report revealed in startling detail the Russian government's \"sweeping and systematic\" efforts to help Trump win, how his campaign welcomed the help and how Trump sought to impede the investigation.\n\nDemocrats, who regained control of the House in January, are using their newfound political power to explore everything from the Trump administration's policies to the president's conduct before he took office. They have issued formal demands for his tax returns and other financial records.\n\nThat is what provoked Trump in February to call the investigations \"unlimited presidential harassment,\" tweeting that lawmakers would be \"looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so.\"\n\nCongress looks into Trump finances\n\nA half-dozen House committees are examining Trump's finances for evidence of corruption and foreigners who might influence him. Those inquiries accelerated after Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, accused the president in sworn testimony this year of inflating his assets to obtain bank loans, participating in a financial conspiracy and encouraging him to lie to Congress.\n\nBased on Cohen's testimony, the House Oversight and Reform Committee issued a subpoena for Trump's business records turned over to his accountant before he was elected in 2016. But Trump and his businesses filed a federal lawsuit Monday against the committee, to block another subpoena to Trump’s longtime accounting firm Mazars USA that sought financial documents.\n\nCongress has sued the past six presidents to get information when their requests went unanswered, Harkins said, but it is unusual for the president to file a lawsuit himself to block their demands.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee requested Trump’s tax forms from the Internal Revenue Service by Tuesday, but the panel hasn’t received them. In a break with more than 40 years of tradition by presidents and nominees, Trump has refused to release his returns.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin replied Tuesday that it would make a final decision by May 6, but he accused the committee of seeking the returns not for the stated purpose of drafting legislation but \"to publicly release the president's tax returns.\"\n\nNo cooperation despite subpoenas\n\nOne of the latest fights erupted Tuesday when Carl Kline, the White House personnel security director, refused to testify at the House Oversight and Reform Committee about security clearances – despite a subpoena. Cummings said he would consult with the House counsel and lawmakers to set up a potential vote for contempt.\n\nSecurity clearances became controversial because of reports that Trump personally ordered that a security clearance be provided to Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and a senior adviser, despite concerns about his meetings with foreign nationals. Kline is accused of retaliating against a whistle-blower, who told lawmakers how about 25 clearances were granted despite problems with people's background checks.\n\n“To date, the White House has refused to produce a single piece of paper or a single witness in any of the Committee’s investigations this entire year,” Cummings said Tuesday. “The White House now seeks to stonewall this otherwise routine congressional process.”\n\nThe administration blocked another request for information on Wednesday, saying it would not allow a top official to testify about the administration's plans to add a citizenship question to the census. Lawmakers had planned to depose John Gore on Thursday, but Barr said Gore wouldn't appear unless another lawyer could accompany him to advise him about confidentiality interests of the executive branch.\n\nSimilarly, lawmakers are pressing for full Mueller report, so far without success. The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed the complete Mueller report – and former White House counsel Don McGahn, who was described in the report as resisting Trump's efforts to stymie the inquiry. Several committees continue to explore the president's attempts to thwart the federal investigation into Russian influence in the election, despite Mueller pressing no charges.\n\nLike what you're reading?: Download the USA TODAY app for more\n\n“President Trump and this administration are engaged in unprecedented stonewalling and once again using the legal system to conceal every area of his life as well as his wrongdoing and improprieties from the American people,\" said Ashley Etienne, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. \"This level of secrecy should alarm all Americans.\"\n\nOne of Trump's personal lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, who represented Trump during the Mueller investigation, said he supports the White House's aggressive approach. Giuliani called the Democratic congressional elections \"patently political.\"\n\n\"I would fight all those subpoenas,\" Giuliani said. \"I haven't seen one yet that has a legislative purpose.\"\n\nBroad sweep of inquiries unusual\n\nConflicts between Congress and the White House are expected between equal branches of government, according to academic experts. But the wide variety of conflicts and the personal nature of some of the requests are different with Trump.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama's Attorney General Eric Holder fought with the Oversight Committee over a gun-running case and former President George W. Bush's Justice Department was investigated over the firing of U.S. attorneys. Former President Bill Clinton was impeached after an investigation gathered evidence about his sexual relationship with a White House intern (the Senate did not remove him from office).\n\nBut Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and professor of political science at George Washington University, said the difference today is the wide variety of the conflicts, such as when the House Judiciary Committee requested documents from 81 people and organizations. The disputes have also resulted in subpoenas, which themselves represent the failure of negotiations to provide information voluntarily, she said.\n\n“There’s certainly precedent for these sorts of fireworks when the administration doesn’t want to comply, particularly during a period of divided government, with an investigation run by the other party,\" Binder said. “I would say just generally that the Trump administration’s relationships with the Hill have been so fraught that we shouldn’t be surprised that they are coming to a head in this way, where past administrations might have had an incentive not to blow everything up at once because they wanted to get something else done.\"\n\nAs Democrats press their subpoenas and Trump resists, the fights seem likely to land in federal court, where fights over information have been known to drag on for years with uncertain results.\n\n\"In the past, the Supreme Court has given wide latitude to Congress in what it can obtain in its role in overseeing the executive branch,\" Harkins said.\n\nTrump tweeted again Wednesday that he has done nothing wrong and that he had allowed everyone to testify to Mueller's investigators, including McGahn. But he said he would not permit his former White House lawyer to go before Congress. \"I say it's enough,\" he said.\n\nContributing: John Fritze, David Jackson and Eliza Collins\n\nMore about congressional requests from President Donald Trump:\n\nPresident Trump still facing swirl of investigations even after Robert Mueller's probe has ended\n\nDeadline for Trump's tax returns to Capitol Hill: White House said returns won't be released\n\nPresident Trump and his businesses ask a court to block Congress from obtaining accounting records\n\nReports: Trump ordered son-in-law Jared Kushner be granted top-secret security clearance\n\nGet the USA TODAY app: If you like this story, consider downloading the app.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/politics/mueller-memo-barr-trump-obstruction-russia", "title": "DOJ must make public internal memo Barr commissioned analyzing ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Justice Department must make public an internal legal memo commissioned by then-Attorney General William Barr in 2019 to analyze whether he should charge then-President Donald Trump with obstruction related to the Russia investigation, a federal appeals court ruled on Friday.\n\nThe ruling from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals comes in a case brought by a government watchdog group that is seeking to get the unredacted version of the memo.

He will not be influenced by anybody,” said Greg Andres, a former member of Mueller’s team.\n\nAndres, who has known Smith since the late 1990s when they started at a US attorney’s office together and ultimately became co-chiefs of the office’s criminal division, said it’s the breadth of Smith’s experience that will enable him to withstand the public scrutiny and make tough judgment calls.\n\n“He will evaluate the evidence and understand what type of case should be charged or not. He has the type of experience to make those judgments,” said Andres.\n\n“He understands the courtroom. He understands how to try a case. He knows how to prove a case,” he added. “Particularly in these circumstances it will be critical to understand what types of evidence is required to prove the case in court.”\n\nIn a statement following his announcement, Smith pledged to conduct the investigations “independently and in the best traditions of the Department of Justice.”\n\n“The pace of the investigations will not pause or flag under my watch. I will exercise independent judgment and will move the investigations forward expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictate,” Smith said.\n\nOne former colleague highlighted that Smith has prosecuted members of both parties.\n\n“He’s going to be really aggressive,” the person said, adding that “things are going to speed up.” Smith, they said, “operates very quickly” and has a unique ability to quickly determine the things that are important to a case and doesn’t waste time “hand-wringing over things that are real sideshows.”\n\nIn court, Smith comes off as very down-to-earth and relatable, this person said, characterizing that as a good attribute to have as a prosecutor.\n\nSmith also will not care about the politics surrounding the case, they said, adding he has very thick skin and will “do what he’s going to do.”\n\nA career prosecutor\n\nSmith began his career as an assistant district attorney with the New York County District Attorney’s Office in 1994. He worked in the Eastern District of New York in 1999 as an assistant US attorney, where he prosecuted cases including civil rights violations and police officers murdered by gangs, according to the Justice Department.\n\nAs a prosecutor in Brooklyn, New York, one of Smith’s biggest and most high-profile cases was prosecuting gang member Ronell Wilson for the murder of two New York City police department detectives during an undercover gun operation in Staten Island.\n\nWilson was convicted and sentenced to death, the first death penalty case in New York at the time in 50 years, though a judge later found he was ineligible for the death penalty.\n\nMoe Fodeman, who worked with Smith at EDNY, called him “one of the best trial lawyers I have ever seen.”\n\n“He is a phenomenal investigator; he leaves no stone unturned. He drills down to get to the true facts,” Fodeman said.\n\nFodeman, who is still friends with Smith, said he is a “literally insane” cyclist and triathlete.\n\nBeginning in 2008, Smith worked for the International Criminal Court and oversaw war crimes investigations under the Office of the Prosecutor for two years.\n\nIn 2010, he became chief of the Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department, where he oversaw litigation of public corruption cases. Lanny Breuer, the former assistant attorney general for the DOJ’s Criminal Division who recruited Smith, said his onetime employee was “a terrific prosecutor” with a “real sense of fairness.”\n\n“If you are going to have a special counsel, in my view, and you want someone who is going to be fearless, but fair, and not going to be intimidated and not overly bureaucratic, that’s Jack – he is all of these things,” Breuer told CNN.\n\n“Smith brings cases quickly. … He doesn’t sit on cases. He is a person of action,” Breuer added.\n\nAfter his stint at the Public Integrity Section, Smith was appointed first assistant US attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee in 2015.\n\nThough he is not widely known in Washington, DC, legal circles, Smith is described as a consummate public servant.\n\nAbout a decade ago, he hired waves of line prosecutors into the Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department, supervising dozens over his years in charge there.\n\nBrian Kidd, whom Smith hired at the unit, recalled how his boss walked him through every step of a complicated racketeering case against corrupt police officers.\n\n“He was not going to tolerate a politically motivated prosecution,” Kidd said. “And he has an incredible ability to motivate the people working with him and under him. He’s incredibly supportive of his team.”\n\nSmith handled some of the most high-profile political corruption cases in recent memory – to mixed outcomes.\n\nHe was the head of the public integrity unit when then-Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell was indicted in 2014, and was in meetings with the defense team and involved in decision-making leading up to the charges, according to a person familiar with the case.\n\nMcDonnell was initially convicted of receiving gifts for political favors, but then his conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court.\n\nSmith was also at the helm of the unit when the DOJ failed to convict at trial former Senator and vice presidential candidate John Edwards.\n\nA Republican source familiar with Smith’s oversight of the investigation into former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay commended Smith’s non-biased approach, saying that he ultimately made a “just” decision to conclude the investigation without alleging DeLay committed any crime.\n\nIn recent years while working at The Hague, he has not lived in the United States. He’s no longer on the US Triathlon team but is still a competitive biker.\n\nSmith took over as acting US Attorney when David Rivera departed in early 2017 before leaving the Justice Department later that year and becoming vice president of litigation for the Hospital Corporation of America. In 2018, he became chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague, where he investigated war crimes in Kosovo.\n\n“Throughout his career, Jack Smith has built a reputation as an impartial and determined prosecutor, who leads teams with energy and focus to follow the facts wherever they lead,” Garland said during the announcement on Friday. “Mr. Smith is the right choice to complete these matters in an even-handed and urgent manner.”\n\nSmith interviewed as part of Republican-led IRS probe\n\nIn May 2014, the House Oversight Committee interviewed Smith behind closed doors as part of the Republican-led investigation into the alleged IRS targeting of conservative groups. Then-Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa launched the probe following a 2013 inspector general report that found delays in the processing of applications by certain conservative groups and requesting information from them that was later deemed unnecessary.\n\nRepublicans sought testimony from Smith, who at the time was Public Integrity section chief, due to his involvement with arranging a 2010 meeting between Justice Department officials and then-IRS official Lois Lerner, the official at the center of the IRS scandal. The meeting had been convened to discuss the “evolving legal landscape” of campaign finance law following the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, according to a May 2014 letter written by Issa and Rep. Jim Jordan, the Ohio Republican who is expected to be House Judiciary chairman next year.\n\n“It is apparent that the Department’s leadership, including Public Integrity Section Chief Jack Smith, was closely involved in engaging with the IRS in wake of Citizens United and political pressure from prominent Democrats to address perceived problems with the decision,” Issa and Jordan wrote in the letter seeking Smith’s testimony.\n\nSmith testified that his office “had a dialogue” with the FBI about opening investigations related to politically active non-profits following the meeting with Lerner, but did not ultimately do so, according to a copy of his interview obtained by CNN.\n\nSmith explained that he had asked for the meeting with the IRS because he wanted to learn more about the legal landscape of political non-profits following the Citizens United decision because he was relatively new to the public integrity section. He said that Lerner explained it would be difficult if not impossible to bring a case on the abuse of tax-exempt status.\n\nSmith repeated at several points in the interview that the Justice Department did not pursue any investigations due to politics.\n\n“I want to be clear – it would be more about looking at the issue, looking at whether it made sense to open investigations,” he said. “If we did, you know, how would you go about doing this? Is there predication, a basis to open an investigation? Things like that. I can’t say as I sit here now specifically, you know, the back-and-forth of that discussion. I can just tell you that – because I know one of your concerns is that organizations were targeted. And I can tell you that we, Public Integrity, did not open any investigations as a result of those discussions and that we certainly, as you know, have not brought any cases as a result of that.”\n\nSmith also testified that he was not aware of anyone at the Justice Department placing pressure on the IRS – and that he was never pressured to investigate any political groups.\n\n“No. And maybe I can stop you guys. I know there’s a series of these questions. I’ve never been asked these things, and anybody who knows me would never even consider asking me to do such a thing,” Smith said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Kara Scannell Jeremy Herb Katelyn Polantz Chandelis Duster", "Zachary Cohen", "Kara Scannell", "Jeremy Herb", "Katelyn Polantz", "Chandelis Duster"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/16/impeachment-gop-blasts-limited-access-depositions-transcripts/3997318002/", "title": "House Republicans complain about limited access to closed-door ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – A half-dozen Republican lawmakers sought access Wednesday to a closed-door deposition with a former State Department official that is part of the House impeachment inquiry, but they were blocked in an escalation of the partisan dispute over the investigation of President Donald Trump.\n\nThree House committees – Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight and Reform – have been meeting privately for weeks with current and former administration officials to gather information about how Trump urged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a political rival. The latest session Wednesday was with Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. A previous witness, Kurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, appeared Wednesday to review the transcript from his session Oct. 3.\n\nRepublicans have complained that the meetings should be public and transcripts should be released. Access has been limited to members of the three panels, which prevented one Republican from attending Monday and the half-dozen Wednesday. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said private sessions are needed to prevent witnesses from hearing each other, the same protocol used by prosecutors in criminal investigations.\n\nLeading the confrontation was House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who called Schiff a liar and a partisan leading a witch hunt – language that echoes Trump’s terminology. McCarthy cited Schiff’s opening statement Sept. 26 in a public hearing with the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, which characterized Trump’s phone call to his Ukrainian counterpart July 25 as a mafia shakedown.\n\n“I can’t even go down there and read the transcript,” McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy alleged that Republicans have not been allowed to cross-examine the witnesses, which is not accurate. Staff attorneys led the questioning, and the time was evenly divided between Democratic and Republican aides.\n\n“They designed a process to pick and choose who to come,” McCarthy said. “This is a closed system. This is a system designed to already try to find an outcome.”\n\nThe confrontation Wednesday followed a similar incident Monday, when Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a member of the Judiciary Committee, was blocked from attending the private deposition with Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Asia.\n\nSchiff said Tuesday that transcripts would be released and public hearings held. But he said it was important not to have witnesses hear each other’s testimony “either to hide the truth or color the truth or know just how much they can give and how much they can conceal.”\n\nSchiff noted that the special counsel or independent counsel investigations of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were held behind closed doors before public hearings. The committees conduct their own inquiry, for lack of a Justice Department investigation. Schiff said all members of the three committees have been allowed to attend the depositions.\n\n“They have been very professionally done,” Schiff said. “All those members, too, asked questions. And we go until the questions are exhausted, so they get to ask whatever questions they want in a process in which they have every bit as much opportunity as the majority to ask questions.”\n\nSchiff said the committees keep the sessions closed because some witnesses may lie like Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer, who was convicted of lying to Congress.\n\n“Now, we do anticipate a time when we'll be releasing transcripts, and we do anticipate there will be a time when we will hold back some of these witnesses for open session, and we may call witnesses in open session that we haven't called in closed session. But we will do so giving the GOP members every opportunity to ask questions,” Schiff said. “We want to make sure that we get to the truth, and this is the process, I think, early in an investigation that makes the most sense.”\n\nMembers of the Judiciary Committee, which traditionally handles impeachment inquiries, argued Wednesday that they deserve access to the depositions and transcripts of sessions.\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, said he was told by the impeachment panel’s staff that he could not read the transcripts of interviews or attend McKinley's private session.\n\n“That is garbage,\" Gohmert said. \"This is an insane asylum, and it’s clear the inmates are running it, because the elected people … said we want you to participate.”\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., accused Democrats of selectively leaking testimony that would cast Trump in the worst light.\n\n“This is a political hit job on President Trump,” she said. “We’re talking about the impeachment of the president of the United States.\"\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., compared the sessions to Soviet secret hearings. He proposed a resolution on the House floor Wednesday to condemn and censure Schiff, which McCarthy supported.\n\n“What’s going on here is absolutely intolerable,” Biggs said.\n\nThe top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who is allowed to attend the sessions, said McKinley said nothing “inside those closed doors in that secret room\" that couldn't have been said at a public hearing. Republicans should have subpoena power to call their own witnesses and White House lawyers should be allowed to attend, McCaul said.\n\nAnother lawmaker who could attend, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a member of the Oversight and Reform Committee, derided Schiff for comparing this to a special prosecutor’s investigation.\n\n“Four hundred and thirty-five members will have to make a decision” if Democrats move forward with articles of impeachment, Meadows said. “Yet you have less than three dozen members who are getting to hear the actual witnesses.”\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., defended the impeachment inquiry Tuesday in stark terms, listing allegations that Trump undermined national security by withholding military aid for Ukraine and by asking for the investigation of former Vice President Biden, a Democratic front-runner in the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\n\"We are here to find the truth and uphold the Constitution of the United States,\" Pelosi said. \"This is not a game for us. This is deadly serious.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/04/politics/2022-governors-elections-midterms", "title": "These are the key governor's races to watch this fall | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFrom the early days of Donald Trump’s presidency, through the Covid-19 pandemic and following the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the power of governors has been increasingly clear for Americans to see.\n\nIn November, 36 states will hold gubernatorial elections that, while often less expensive than Senate races, are likely to yield more immediate impacts on the political landscape and could provide a launching pad for candidates with even higher aspirations – like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nHeading into the general election season, Republicans control 20 of the contested governor’s seats to Democrats’ 16. But many of the key battleground contests feature Democratic incumbents, elected during the 2018 “blue wave,” trying to win a second term. In Michigan and Wisconsin, Govs. Gretchen Whitmer and Tony Evers are likely Republicans’ only obstacle to governing trifectas. The same goes in Pennsylvania – another state President Joe Biden flipped in 2020 – where Democratic state Attorney General Josh Shapiro would likely face a GOP-controlled legislature if he defeats Republican nominee Doug Mastriano, a Trump-allied election denier.\n\nRepublicans have stronger grips on the governors’ mansions in the red states of Florida, Texas and Georgia. But those campaigns underscore the unique nature of these races – DeSantis in Florida and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott are closely aligned with Trump and his movement, while Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, because he didn’t go along with the former President’s 2020 election lies, has come under frequent criticism from his party’s ascendant right. That, however, didn’t stop him from subduing a Trump-backed primary challenger, strengthening his brand with Peach State Republicans.\n\nThe added attention and, to some extent, increasing attractiveness of governors’ races to big donors and outside spenders, could benefit Democrats if only because the party has in the past tended to look past state elections and zero in on federal and presidential ones.\n\n“The rising profiles of some of our governors really make a big difference in getting people to focus on those races,” said David Turner, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association. “But it’s still much harder to get a major donor to have a conversation with a gubernatorial candidate in a top-tier race than it is for them to have that conversation with a Senate candidate.”\n\nThe balance of interest – among donors and the grassroots – is improving, Turner added, especially as some Republican gubernatorial nominees either openly stake out hard-line positions on issues such as abortion rights or are confronted with past positions they’ve since tried to soften.\n\n“This is an issue about Republicans talking about taking away rights and freedoms and what that means for other rights and freedoms,” Turner said, noting Wisconsin Republican gubernatorial nominee Tim Michels’ opposition to same-sex marriage\n\nWhile Democrats try to fashion a broad argument that ties economic concerns to growing extremism in the Trump-dominated Republican ranks, the GOP has been keen to narrow the conversation to dissatisfaction with the economy – especially in states, such as Nevada, which was hit especially hard by Covid-19 and has been slow to recover.\n\nRepublican Governors Association spokesman Jesse Hunt hangs the blame there on Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, who will face off against GOP nominee Joe Lombardo, the Clark County sheriff, in the fall.\n\n“These incumbent Democrats took a pretty heavy-handed approach (to Covid-19),” Hunt said. “Everyone knew who their governor was and many of them have not been satisfied with how their states have recovered post-pandemic.”\n\nHunt also downplayed the impact of the voter backlash to the Supreme Court decision stripping federal abortion rights, saying, “Kitchen table issues that are affecting their everyday lives” will ultimately outweigh “an issue that certainly invigorates the base Democratic voters.”\n\nThough top operatives might stress different broad-based messaging, there is an implicit agreement – as seen in advertising expenditures – on which states are likely to be closely contested and where the respective parties see prime opportunities to pick up seats.\n\nKansas, a heavily Republican state where Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly was elected in 2018, is widely viewed as a toss-up, while Massachusetts and Maryland, a pair of deep-blue states with twice-elected popular, moderate GOP governors, offer Democrats a built-in advantage with those executives on the way out.\n\nHere’s a look at this fall’s gubernatorial election landscape with Election Day about two months away:\n\nThe Biden Belt states\n\nBiden flipped five states from red to blue in 2020, including three that had long been in the Democratic column before Trump won them in 2016.\n\nIn Michigan, Whitmer since her election in 2018 has emerged as a favorite of national Democrats. She was also among the first Democratic governors to face intense conservative backlash over Covid-19 policies, including business and school shutdowns. Still, she enters the fall favored to keep her seat.\n\nThat’s due in no small part to the mess of a Republican primary that eventually nominated conservative commentator Tudor Dixon, who emerged – with Trump’s seal of approval – after other leading GOP candidates were kicked off the ballot for submitting fraudulent signatures to get on it.\n\nPerhaps more important than Trump’s support, though, is that of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and her family, who poured cash into Dixon’s primary bid and see her as an ally in their long effort to shift public money toward private education.\n\nWhitmer, whose pledge to “fix the damn roads” was the hallmark of her 2018 campaign, will again have a strong appeal to many drivers, this time in the form of a new automobile insurance law that helped deliver $400 rebate checks to many Michigan motorists.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, here with his running mate, Sara Rodriguez, in Madison on August 10, 2022, is seeking a second term in November. Scott Bauer/AP\n\nNext door in Wisconsin, Evers is locked into what could be the tightest race of the season. Polling earlier this year suggested his path to reelection was narrow and contracting. Since then, Wisconsin Democrats have become somewhat more bullish about his chances. And, once again, that shift in perception was aided by Republicans.\n\nThe establishment favorite, former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, lost the GOP nomination to Michels, a wealthy construction company owner who won Trump’s support by embracing lies about the 2020 election and suggesting he might go along with a scheme to seek to decertify the results.\n\nMichels also pledged to further restrict absentee voting and replace the state’s bipartisan elections commission with one run by representatives from its congressional districts – which, in practice, would hand control of the body to Republicans.\n\nThe Wisconsin race will also, like so many others across the country, offer voters a stark choice on the question of abortion rights. Evers, even before the Supreme Court’s ruling – which brought back into effect a 173-year-old state ban, which is being challenged in court – had been the last line of defense against a GOP-controlled legislature seeking to restrict the procedure. His calls to pass a law protecting abortion rights were ignored by Republicans.\n\nMichels is a staunch opponent of abortion rights.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, with term-limited Gov. Tom Wolf on his way out, Democrats are desperate to hold on to yet another seat in a state that has a GOP-led legislature.\n\nEnter Shapiro, the state attorney general and Democratic nominee to succeed Wolf. He will square off with Mastriano, a state senator who not only had Trump’s backing but attended the former President’s rally in Washington on January 6, 2021. (Mastriano says he never entered the US Capitol and has not been charged with any crimes.)\n\nMastriano is either Democrats’ dream opponent or worst nightmare. He is an unabashed exponent of Trump’s false election fraud claims, has expressed support for an abortion ban with no exceptions and, in the most recent controversy to erupt around his campaign, can be seen posing in Confederate military uniform for a faculty photo back in 2014 when he worked at the Army War College.\n\nIn the estimation of some Democrats, he is unelectable in a general election. Among them: Shapiro, who ran an ad during the GOP primary appearing to offer Mastriano a backhanded boost.\n\nRed states that turned on Trump\n\nBiden’s performances in Pennsylvania and the Upper Midwest were always considered crucial to his campaign’s fate.\n\nBut his victories in Arizona – which also voted for Democrat Mark Kelly in a special Senate election – and Georgia – where Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won their Senate runoffs – provided Democrats with proof that, under the right circumstances, they could win big races in states that had eluded them for so long.\n\nThose particular circumstances might be in place in Arizona, where former local news anchor Kari Lake, another Trump-backed election denier, won the GOP nomination over a candidate supported by term-limited Gov. Doug Ducey, who co-chairs the Republican Governors Association, and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nIn addition to leaning hard into bogus election fraud claims, Lake also opposes abortion and has repeatedly singled out “the transgender movement” for attack. (This after previously expressing support for transgender youth.)\n\nThe Democratic nominee is Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, whose national profile rose in the aftermath of the 2020 election amid Republican efforts to sow doubt over the presidential result in Arizona. (None of it – most memorably a ramshackle “audit” – yielded anything.)\n\nHobbs, meanwhile, has doubled down on her support for abortion rights, in yet another state where the legislature is controlled by Republicans, and Lake’s inflammatory rhetoric.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, here speaking in McDonough on July 29, 2022, faces a rematch with Democrat Stacey Abrams this fall. Megan Varner/AP\n\nRepublicans appear to be in better shape in Georgia, where Kemp blew out Trump-backed primary challenger David Perdue, a former US senator.\n\nWith the state GOP unified behind him, Kemp is the favorite in a rematch with Democrat Stacey Abrams, whom he defeated by roughly 55,000 votes in 2018.\n\nIn Abrams’ favor is her highly developed grassroots voter turnout operation and, as her national political star rose after 2018, the ability to raise lots of money. She will need both to fire during the stretch run to Election Day.\n\nThe Democratic dream states\n\nDemocrats have been dreaming about reclaiming a foothold in Texas politics for ages. Beto O’Rourke, then an El Paso congressman, nearly pulled it off in 2018, when he challenged GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nBut rather than a sign of things to come, it now feels like a high-water mark. Biden underperformed O’Rourke by about 3 points in losing the state to Trump in 2020.\n\nO’Rourke is back on the ticket this year, taking on Abbott, who is seeking a third term.\n\nLike in Georgia, the Republican establishment in Texas saw off a handful of Trump-inspired challengers, and the party’s base appears to be solidly behind its statewide ticket. (Trump endorsed Abbott, but mostly stayed away from the primary.) Still, Abbott’s efforts to shore up his right flank – including the signing of controversial abortion bans and a further loosening of gun laws – could be used against him during the final weeks of the race.\n\nO’Rourke, too, has some baggage – for better or worse. His 2020 presidential campaign, in which he pushed for a mandatory assault weapon buyback program, is still fresh on the minds of conservatives. And though he has, at times, offered a softer version of that message during the current campaign, there is no mistaking his position.\n\nBut, as it did for so many other Democratic candidates, the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling put a charge into his campaign. His first television ad warns that “women will die” as a result of the state’s Abbott-backed abortion law.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, here speaking to supporters in Hialeah on August 23, 2022, will face Democrat Charlie Crist in November. Gaston De Cardenas/AP\n\nIf Democrats have been yearning for generations to overcome Texas Republicans, the party is only now coming to grips with the GOP’s strength in Florida. Once a perennial swing state, Trump won there twice – by a greater margin the second time around – and it hasn’t elected a Democratic governor since 1994.\n\nIt is also now home to the Republican Party’s second most popular national figure in DeSantis. (And Trump, of course, calls the state home for much of the year.) DeSantis, a onetime US House backbencher before winning a 2018 gubernatorial primary that centered on his support for Trump, saw his profile explode after becoming a leading voice in opposition to pandemic restrictions – and then parlaying those headlines into national notoriety on a variety of culture war flashpoints.\n\nThe Democratic nominee, now-former Rep. Charlie Crist (he resigned from the House to focus on the governor’s race), would likely note that, while Florida hasn’t elected a Democratic governor in nearly three decades, it did elect him to the job more recently. He served one term, from 2007 to 2011, most of it as a Republican before becoming an independent, and then a Democrat in 2012. Crist came within a point of defeating Republican Rick Scott (now the state’s junior senator) in 2014, in his first statewide campaign as a Democrat. Two years later, he won the first of three terms in Congress.\n\nCrist is hoping his history and familiarity with voters, mixed with an untapped desire among the electorate to take down the state’s political temperature, could propel him to a remarkable return to his old job. But DeSantis, whose political operation has amassed a record fundraising haul, is the clear favorite in an increasingly red state.\n\nBiden states that could flip\n\nIf other states saw more electable Republican challengers lose their primaries, Nevada provides a clear contrast.\n\nLombardo, the sheriff of Clark County, home to Las Vegas, has deep ties in the state’s most populous area, and cuts a milder figure than flame-throwing GOP candidates in Arizona and Pennsylvania. He has suggested he was open to accusations of 2020 election fraud (all of them have proved baseless), but acknowledged Biden as the winner while seeking to pivot to criticism of Sisolak and state election laws he says are too lax.\n\nAbortion law in Nevada is mostly set in stone – it’s legal up to 24 weeks (with exceptions therafter for health concerns) and could only be reversed by a direct vote. Lombardo, though maintaining he is anti-abortion, has not spelled out any plan to seek to change the law.\n\nStill, Sisolak has been hammering his rival on the issue and warning that, should Lombardo win, additional efforts taken by the Democrat’s office to expand abortion access and protect providers would come under threat.\n\nSisolak’s fate, though, could likely turn on issues mostly outside his control. Gas prices in Nevada are among the highest in the country, and the state, with its reliance on tourism, has been relatively slow to recover on the economic front. The good news for Sisolak: Both fuel prices and the unemployment rate are trending down.\n\nMinnesota and Maine are also home to Democratic governors in states that broke for Biden in 2020. But neither is considered safely blue territory – Maine delivered three of its four electoral votes to Biden, with one going to Trump under state rules that award votes to the winners of its two congressional districts – and a GOP wave could endanger the incumbents.\n\nMaine Gov. Janet Mills, left, here chatting with a barber shop owner in Hallowell on May 25, 2022, is being challenged by her predecessor, Republican Paul LePage. Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n\nMaine Gov. Janet Mills is running against her predecessor, Republican Paul LePage, who has described himself as “Trump before there was Trump.”\n\nLePage has not only made false claims about voter fraud in 2020, but has a history of alleging stolen elections. His campaign has also attacked Mills over Covid-19 restrictions and the struggles of the state’s seafood industry, which Mills has sought to backstop by, among other measures, sending federal relief cash to reimburse licensing fees paid up and down the supply chain.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who is also seeking a second term, will face Republican Scott Jensen, a doctor and former state senator. Jensen emerged as a potential challenger after becoming a critic of the Covid-19 lockdowns during the early days of the pandemic and a vaccine skeptic later on.\n\nWalz and his allies, though, are keen to focus voters on abortion rights and the prospect that, should a narrowly divided legislature break for Republicans, who already control the state Senate, Jensen could lead a push to ban the procedure. Jensen has said that he would not seek to overturn a state Supreme Court ruling protecting abortion rights but that any potential legal prohibition should have exceptions for rape, incest and any threat to a woman’s health.\n\nOregon and New Mexico could pose greater challenges to Democrats.\n\nThere is a three-way race to replace term-limited Democratic Gov. Kate Brown in Oregon. The presence of an independent candidate, timber heiress and former Democratic state Sen. Betsy Johnson, could cut into the vote of the Democratic nominee, former state House Speaker Tina Kotek, and potentially benefit Republican former state House Minority Leader Christine Drazan in what’s believed to be a tight race. Republicans have not won a governor’s race in Oregon since 1982 – their longest gubernatorial losing streak in the country.\n\nAnd in New Mexico, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham faces a tough GOP challenger in Mark Ronchetti, a longtime TV weatherman who lost a surprisingly close 2020 Senate election to Democrat Ben Ray Luján.\n\nThe mismatched states\n\nAs this year ends, Massachusetts and Maryland will say goodbye to their Republican governors. Term limits will conclude Gov. Larry Hogan’s tenure in Maryland, while Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, perhaps sensing how a difficult primary challenge from a more conservative candidate might hurt his bid for a third term, decided to retire.\n\nKansas Gov. Laura Kelly, here talking to reporters in Topeka on June 3, 2022, is running for a second term this fall. Evert Nelson/The Capital-Journal/USA Today Network\n\nBut in Kansas, another political outlier, Kelly is hoping to stick around. The Democrat is seeking a second term against GOP nominee Derek Schmidt, the state attorney general.\n\nRepublicans have long sought to paint Kelly as too liberal for a conservative state, while Kelly’s universe of much-needed crossover voters was likely boosted by the heavy turnout on August 2, when Kansans overwhelmingly voted down a ballot measure that would have allowed the state legislature to pursue an abortion ban.\n\nKelly could also benefit from former Republican state Sen.

Cipollone said the administration would not cooperate with what it sees as an unprecedented overreach by politically motivated lawmakers seeking to replicate an already exhaustive and concluded special counsel investigation into Russia and the president's conduct.\n\nNadler's committee \"has no legitimate role\" in collecting materials to investigate Trump, Cipollone said. He suggested that lawmakers are using their investigative power to \"harass political opponents or to pursue an unauthorized 'do-over' of exhaustive law enforcement investigations conducted by the Department of Justice.\"\n\nThe 12-page letter, a response to Nadler's request for documents, is another escalation of a battle between the White House and congressional Democrats who are conducting wide-ranging investigations of Trump's presidency, his finances and his private business. The administration has largely defied lawmakers' efforts to gather records and has signaled a willingness to fight them in court.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's investigation concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Trump win, but it did not find enough evidence that the president's campaign conspired with Russia. Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice, but detailed nearly a dozen episodes in which the president sought to intercede in the probe and suggested some could well have been criminal.\n\nAttorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein separately determined that the evidence did not amount to a crime.\n\nIn March, Nadler sent letters to 81 individuals and agencies, including the White House, requesting documents pertaining to the House Judiciary Committee's investigation into possible obstruction of justice by Trump.\n\nCipollone said in his response to that request that Nadler is seeking to \"replow the same ground\" Mueller and his large team of investigators have already covered.\n\n\"I ask you to consider that approach,\" Cipollone said. \"With the Special Counsel's investigation behind us, the President and his team stand ready to work with the Committee cooperatively to advance the legislative agenda for the benefit of the American people.\"\n\nIn a statement, Nadler said his committee will not end its investigation.\n\n\"The White House position appears to be that the Justice Department cannot hold the President accountable, since it purportedly cannot indict him,\" Nadler said. \"Now it adds the extreme claim that Congress cannot act either ... This flies in the face of the American idea that no one is above the law, and I reject it.\"\n\nCipollone cited in his letter what he says were legal flaws in Nadler's request for documents. He said Nadler is seeking records, including confidential communications and deliberations between Trump, his advisers and foreign leaders, all of which are subject to executive privilege. He said Nadler's request is \"beyond the reach of congressional oversight,\" does not advance a \"legitimate legislative purpose,\" and violates separation of powers.\n\nCipollone said the White House will cooperate with congressional investigations that have a legislative purpose. But even then, he said, Congress' authority \"to explore in detail any particular case of alleged wrongdoing is limited.\"\n\nTrump's personal lawyers made similar arguments in federal court on Tuesday, asking a federal judge to block a House subpoena seeking financial records from his longtime accountant. Trump's private lawyer told a judge that Congress has no authority to investigate his private conduct, and suggested that even the Watergate investigation that ultimately led to President Richard Nixon's resignation was improper.\n\nTrump took the rare move last week of asserting executive privilege to keep secret the millions of pages of evidence that Mueller gathered in his investigation. At the same time, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt for refusing to turn over an unredacted version of the Mueller report.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/15"}]}

Brian Harrison, a former first-term Trump administration official, told USA TODAY, adding: “The stakes could not be higher.”\n\nLaunching a rare mid-decade redistricting, Texas Republicans have drawn a new map of U.S. House districts that could give the GOP five more seats and help the party maintain control of the narrowly-divided chamber.\n\nIf they succeed, a pliant GOP-led House would allow Trump to continue one of the most aggressive and disruptive agendas in modern presidential history, while a Democratic majority in January 2027 opens the door to Congressional investigations, legislative paralysis − even a third impeachment.\n\nDemocratic control of the House would be the \"de facto\" end of Trump's presidency, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a recent press conference.\n\nRepublicans argue it would bring chaos, pointing to the impeachments that consumed Washington D.C. during the second half of Trump's first term.\n\nThe GOP's Texas power play has shaken the political landscape 15 months ahead of the midterm election, setting off a redistricting arms race as blue state leaders move to create more Democratic-leaning House seats to counter Texas, and lawmakers in other red states, including Indiana and Missouri, consider joining the fray.\n\nThe tit-for-tat redistricting battle has exploded into one of the most consequential elements of the 2026 midterms, with the potential to decide control of the House well before votes are counted.\n\nDemocrats seek check on Trump\n\nRepublicans currently hold a 219-212 majority in the House, with four vacancies. The party in power typically loses seats in the midterms. If the four vacant seats are filled by a member of the same party that vacated them, Democrats need to pick up just three seats to win control.\n\nTrump’s agenda has energized the Democratic base.\n\nA Democrat-controlled House could kill any legislation coming out of the White House, launch investigations of the Trump administration on everything from the Epstein files to Trump's deportation tactics, wield subpoena power to compel testimony from administration officials and even impeach the president for a third time.\n\n\"Donald Trump has always been a wannabe dictator,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat, told USA TODAY. \"If Democrats take control of the House we’re a stumbling block for him.\"\n\nTrump has seen it before.\n\nDemocrats rode a wave of anti-Trump enthusiasm to win the House in 2018 during his first term and aggressively probed everything from Trump’s tax returns and personal finances to his administration’s family separation policy for detained immigrants and his purported threats to the rule of law.\n\nTrump twice was impeached by the House during his first term after Democrats won a majority, the first time over allegations he pressured Ukraine's president to dig up dirt on political rival Joe Biden and the second for allegedly inciting an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021 when a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe Senate acquitted Trump in both cases. Democrats face a less favorable political map for the upper chamber and are less likely to win control next year.\n\n'Impeach, impeach, impeach'\n\nRepublicans are highlighting the impeachment threat to argue the last two years of Trump’s presidency could be a distraction from issues Americans care about, such as boosting the economy. They hope to give Trump maximum flexibility to continue a controversial agenda that includes mass deportations, overhauling the federal government and new tariffs on foreign goods.\n\n\"We all know that should we lose the House, which I don’t think we would... that the Democrats would do nothing but impeach, impeach, impeach for two straight years,\" Texas GOP Rep. Troy Nehls, a Trump ally, told USA TODAY.\n\nDemocrats say Trump is abusing his power and must be reined in. They point to polls showing aspects of his agenda are unpopular. The Texas redistricting plan is a way for Trump to game the system to circumvent a reckoning at the 2026 ballot box, Democrats say.\n\n\"Let’s be clear why this is happening, this is happening because Donald Trump is trying to avoid accountability,\" Texas Democratic Party Chair Kendall Scudder told USA TODAY.\n\nWhether a few new GOP-leaning seats in Texas would be enough to swing the election is unclear. Many other factors could come into play, especially the economy, University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato told USA TODAY.\n\n\"We’re so far away\" from the election, Sabato said. \"Suppose we have a recession or even a significant slowdown in the economy? Then it probably will be... a sizeable Democratic margin, at least in the House.\"\n\nBut in a close race for the House, any redistricting changes could be decisive.\n\nHigh stakes\n\nBoth parties are acting aggressively, portraying the redistricting fight as a battle for the future of the country.\n\nAs Texas Republicans worked to jam through a new House map, Democrats fled the state to prevent a quorum and stall legislative business. The state’s GOP governor and attorney general responded with legal threats.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Newsom is pushing a plan to redraw his state’s House districts to counter Texas.\n\n\"Whatever they are doing will be neutered here in the state of California,\" Newsom said Aug. 4.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nWisconsin, North Carolina and Ohio are once some of the most closely contested battleground states. But for more than a decade, extreme gerrymandering in these three states tipped the scales in favor of the Republican Party.\n\nDave Daley courtesy Paul Specht\n\nAs a result, district maps sent a disproportionate number of Republicans to Washington and often protected lawmakers against significant blue waves.\n\nOur democracy is in dire straits. Earlier this year, a GOP filibuster stalled crucial voting rights laws in Congress while in 2019 a US Supreme Court decision shuttered federal courts to partisan gerrymandering claims, giving state legislatures the green light to take redistricting to extremes.\n\nBut state supreme courts have stepped in to curb gerrymandering, becoming a crucial stopgap in championing free and fair elections. And while this redistricting cycle has been a partisan bloodbath, some congressional maps better reflect the nation’s politics, thanks to the work of state courts.\n\nWe’ve seen this in battleground states including Wisconsin, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Virginia, where state courts – often, though not always, in bipartisan fashion – have struck down aggressive partisan gerrymanders, making the case that they violate the rights of voters under the state constitution.\n\nThis is some of the best news to emerge from an otherwise bleak redistricting cycle. The number of competitive districts nationwide has been driven to alarming lows. Many rapidly growing Black and Latino communities have been cracked, packed and diluted in the first redistricting since the US Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Shelby County v Holder gutted preclearance, a provision under the Voting Rights Act that required states to obtain federal approval before making any changes that affect voting.\n\nLast week, the US Supreme Court struck down Republican requests to block congressional maps in North Carolina and Pennsylvania. While the decisions are a win for democracy in the run-up to the 2022 midterm elections, the Supreme Court could later uphold the legal argument presented in these cases, known as the Independent State Legislature doctrine, which argues that state courts do not have authority over state legislatures when it comes to federal election matters.\n\nWithout state courts to step in, many legislatures could continue to warp congressional maps – or pursue election subversion methods – for years to come.\n\nWe’ve seen the results of this partisanship for much of the last decade. In 2012, for example, President Barack Obama carried Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia and Wisconsin to win reelection. But Republicans, in the first election after the GOP’s successful redistricting strategy provided them monopoly power over new district lines, won 47 of 67 US House seats up for grabs, and retained control of the lower chamber even though Democratic candidates won 1.4 million more votes nationwide.\n\nIn 2018, Ohio voters overwhelmingly endorsed a state constitutional amendment that established new guardrails on elected officials tasked with drawing maps. But five Republicans on the state redistricting commission ignored those provisions and backed a map in 2022 that ensured the GOP would win at least 12, and potentially 13, of the state’s 15 US House seats.\n\nGov. Mike DeWine, a Republican commission member who voted for the map, even admitted that the state legislative process could have been “more clearly constitutional.” The state supreme court – with the Republican chief justice joining three Democrats in a 4-3 decision – overturned it as unconstitutional, demanding that lawmakers try again. And when the same commission failed to follow a court order to produce a new state legislative map, the chief justice threatened to hold the governor and the entire panel in contempt.\n\nIn North Carolina, where redistricting has become a blood sport as intense as the Duke vs. UNC basketball rivalry, Republicans enacted a congressional map that guaranteed them at least 10, and as many as 11, of the 14 seats in a state where a few races were determined by less than one percentage point in 2020.\n\nThe state court, in a 4-3 decision, overturned that map, citing state constitutional protections of free and fair elections, freedom of speech and equal protection. “Achieving partisan advantage incommensurate with a political party’s level of statewide voter support is neither a compelling nor a legitimate governmental interest,” the ruling signed by Associate Justice Robin Hudson read.\n\nUnder court order, the legislature produced a more balanced map, with six safe GOP seats, five safe Democratic districts and two battlefields.\n\nIn Virginia, the state supreme court protected fair maps after the new redistricting commission broke down over partisan bitterness.\n\nIn Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, meanwhile, state courts proved effective (if imperfect) adjudicators in creating compromise maps in states with Democratic governors and Republican controlled legislatures. And with only five seats separating the two parties in the US House, maps that better reflect the partisan balance of the people will go a long way toward preventing minority rule in the House.\n\nState courts are not a panacea to cure the effects of gerrymandering. Only 30 state constitutions protect free and fair elections; New York, for example, lacks that extra safeguard, which will make it difficult to undo an intense Democratic gerrymander. And while one Republican justice in Wisconsin and Ohio did join with Democratic colleagues in defense of a fair process, conservative judges have generally taken a narrower view of those free and fair election clauses, and in North Carolina, even found the Rucho decision should make gerrymandering claims nonjusticiable – a case the court cannot hear – period.\n\nThat leaves little hope for voters to challenge egregious gerrymanders in Texas, Oklahoma, Utah, Indiana, Tennessee and Arkansas. The lack of federal standards, the abeyance by federal courts, and the growing partisanship of state courts creates a dramatically uneven playing field.\n\nNaturally, the crucial role state courts have played has also not gone unnoticed by partisans eager to retain control over the process. Since former President Donald Trump and his allies tried to overturn the 2020 election, there’s been greater attention paid to state secretary of state races.\n\nWhat hasn’t gotten enough attention is the battle over state supreme courts. According to a Brennan Center report, big donors and interest groups poured more than $100 million into state supreme court races during the 2019-2020 cycle as these down-ballot and often sleepy races became more central to partisan control.\n\nThat’s likely to be only the beginning of the fight. The ugly truth is that the state of democracy could depend less on the will of the people and more on the results of judicial contests that are often held in off-years.\n\nIn Ohio, where Republicans tend to win statewide elections, the legislature decided to add partisan affiliation to judicial elections this year. In Pennsylvania, where the state supreme court also overturned a gerrymandered congressional map in 2018 and batted aside baseless claims of voter fraud in 2020, Republicans have pushed a constitutional amendment to elect judges by districts, not statewide, which would favor the GOP.\n\nPennsylvania state lawmakers also tried, but failed, to impeach the justices who struck down a gerrymandered congressional map that favored Republicans. North Carolina’s fight over redistricting also sets up an intense showdown this fall, when two seats on the state supreme court – and partisan control – will be on the ballot.\n\nThe US Supreme Court, meanwhile, could upend this entire dynamic between state courts and legislatures. Four of the Supreme Court justices have signaled an openness to the controversial Independent State Legislative doctrine.\n\nBecause state courts and governors are not the legislature, at its most extreme interpretation, this doctrine hands unilateral control to state lawmakers with no ability for a court to undo their work. This would mark a seismic shift of power that could remake the very nature of judicial checks and balances, let alone the nature of a state constitution. It also goes against decades of precedent and is dangerously anti-democratic.\n\nWhile the Court this week rebuffed an invitation from North Carolina and Pennsylvania Republicans to intervene with the state court-ordered maps, three justices did sign onto an opinion that called this notion “an exceptionally important and recurring question of constitutional law.”\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nA fourth justice, Brett Kavanaugh, who previously questioned the state courts’ jurisdiction, suggested that the Supreme Court take on these questions in a future term.\n\nState courts have made a critical contribution to ensuring that the 2022 elections will be conducted on fair maps.

The facts aren't even in dispute: Lawmakers in the relatively \"purple\" state, where the statewide congressional vote swings back and forth between Democrats and Republicans, declared their intentions on camera.\n\n\"We want to make clear that to the extent we are going to use political data in drawing this map, it is to gain partisan advantage,” state Rep. David Lewis said at the time. He proposed a 10-3 edge for Republicans \"because I do not believe it’s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.”\n\nMore: Stumped in two cases on partisan election maps, Supreme Court could turn to North Carolina next term\n\nTo achieve that goal, the map packed Democrats into three districts and spread them among the other 10. In one glaring example, it split North Carolina A&T State University, the nation's largest historically black college, between the 6th and 13th Congressional Districts, ensuring that most students would be voting for losing candidates.\n\n“The North Carolina case is about as extreme as you’re ever going to get,” says Paul Smith, one of the lawyers representing the League of Women Voters in the case.\n\nAs Western North Carolina's largest city, Asheville had historically anchored that politically volatile region's congressional district.\n\nBut that changed in 2010, when GOP mapmakers carved a large hunk of Asheville out of its traditional 11th District, lumping it in with the conservative 10th District which stretches southeast all the to the suburbs of Charlotte.\n\nWith the Democratic votes of the city and its outskirts split into two solid Republican districts, Asheville voters said they were effectively disenfranchised.\n\nElections Board chairman Quinn said that leads to suppressed voter turnout. \"Some of my friends and some of my community members, they are going to stay home.\"\n\nIt's important to have individuals such as Asheville residents as plaintiffs to show the court how people are affected, said Dustin Chicurel-Bayard with the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, a Durham nonprofit whose attorney Allison Riggs representing the plaintiffs.\n\nThat was a factor lacking in a Wisconsin gerrymandering case, Chicurel-Bayard said.\n\n\"While it's important to demonstrate statewide harms, in the Whitford case out of Wisconsin, the Supreme Court noted that they needed to see individual voters who have been harmed, not just a statewide claim.\"\n\nThe Maryland map that's returning to the high court was drawn by the legislature's Democratic majority to give them seven of the state's eight congressional seats. The battle there is over one district that was redesigned in 2012 to oust a GOP incumbent.\n\nThat rural 6th District is home to 40 miles of the Appalachian Trail, but it was stretched to include wealthy suburbs of Washington, D.C. Heading into the 2010 elections, it had nearly 50,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats. Two years later, the reverse was true.\n\nRoberts, who lives in nearby Chevy Chase, drew attention to the lengthy stretch during oral arguments last year.\n\n\"Part of the issue here is you have people from, you know, Potomac joined with people from the far west panhandle,\" he said. \"I mean, they both have farms but the former, hobby farms.... The others are real farms.\"\n\nYet when the time came to render a verdict in the Wisconsin case, the chief justice said it wasn't the court's job to police partisanship.\n\nMore: Political maps under fire as Supreme Court case on tailor-made districts looms\n\n\"This court is not responsible for vindicating generalized partisan preferences,\" Roberts wrote. \"The court's constitutionally prescribed role is to vindicate the individual rights of the people appearing before it.\"\n\nMore broadly, what's at stake is the way state and congressional election districts are redrawn once every decade in most states – a system dominated by political self-interest that grows more intense every time the Supreme Court declines to tame it. If the justices fail to act, election districts drawn after the 2020 census could be even more extreme, leading to more lopsided elections and more ideological gridlock in Congress.\n\nThe court has declined to intervene five times before, most recently last year, when the justices refused to decide challenges in Wisconsin and Maryland. Opponents of partisan gerrymandering hope the sixth time will be the charm, but the court's conservative majority stands in the way.\n\nOr does it?\n\nSince the high court took on a more contentious political air during last fall's confirmation of Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Roberts has sided with liberal justices in several cases that would have drawn attention to the court's 5-4 divide between conservatives and liberals. Those included abortion-related cases from Louisiana and Kansas, religious liberty cases from California and New Jersey, and death penalty cases from Texas and Alabama.\n\nNone of those is as consequential as the gerrymandering cases to be heard Tuesday.\n\nStory continues below\n\nIf the Supreme Court decides the congressional maps in either Wisconsin or Maryland violate the Constitution by relegating some voters into irrelevance, it could signal a sea change in the way legislatures controlled by one party have tried to rig the map-making process.\n\n“Our hope is that there is a concern about basic fairness,\" says Dan Vicuña, national redistricting manager at Common Cause, which is challenging the North Carolina map. \"Either side of the political aisle can be the victim of this.”\n\nLike a 'Globetrotters game'\n\nFor the past decade, Democrats have been victimized by gerrymandering the most. Republicans seized power in many states in the 2010 midterm elections, giving them control over the redistricting process. Now Democrats are at a disadvantage entering the 2020 elections, which will determine who draws the next decade's state and congressional lines in most states.\n\n\"Where extreme partisan gerrymandering exists, district lines are drawn in a manner that ensures that all seats remain safe,\" former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, both Republicans, argue in court papers. \"In such districts, elections are as predictable as a Harlem Globetrotters game.\"\n\nThat's not always the case. When state legislative power is shared – or in eight states, including California, where the process is governed by a commission – the maps often are drawn fairly.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled on multiple occasions that race cannot be a major factor in the way district lines are drawn, but it has yet to set a standard for how much politics is too much. The court's more conservative justices have been reluctant to choose political winners and losers.\n\nLast year, the court sidestepped the issue, sending cases from Wisconsin and Maryland back to lower courts for further review. The justices said challengers to the design of 99 state Assembly districts in Wisconsin could not tackle the entire map at once but must target specific districts. They said challengers to Maryland's congressional map did not merit an immediate fix because they had waited six years to bring their claim.\n\nBut while concurring in that ruling, Associate Justice Elena Kagan warned that something must be done to curb Democrats' and Republicans' political instincts when drawing districts.\n\n\"The 2010 redistricting cycle produced some of the worst partisan gerrymanders on record,\" she said. \"The technology will only get better, so the 2020 cycle will only get worse.\"\n\n'Looking for a way out'\n\nU.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, here speaking to his daughter's high school graduating class, represents the key vote in the partisan gerrymandering cases coming to the Supreme Court this month. (Photo: Caitlin Myler Taylor)\n\nDuring last year's cases, Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy was seen as the swing vote. But he has since retired, and all eyes now are on Roberts.\n\nIn a 2014 case upholding the rights of major campaign donors, the chief justice wrote, \"There is no right more basic in our democracy than the right to participate in electing our political leaders.\"\n\nMore: Supreme Court's conservatives appear poised to expand Second Amendment gun rights\n\nChallengers to the North Carolina and Maryland congressional lines say that right effectively is taken away when voters are placed in districts where the weight of their vote is diluted. They are hoping Roberts wants to avoid a 5-4 ruling in which all the majority votes come from Republican presidents' nominees, which has happened only once so far this term.\n\n“I think the chief justice is keenly aware of these political overtones and will want to say ... this is an equal opportunity offense,\" says Michael Kimberly, who represents the Maryland challengers. \"This is not about picking one party over the other.”\n\nRoberts may be inclined to render a minimalist decision that leaves most of the heavy lifting to Congress and the states. The U.S. House of Representatives this month passed legislation that includes giving the power to draw congressional maps to independent commissions – something Colorado, Michigan and Missouri voters approved in November.\n\nMore: President Trump bets big on Supreme Court to uphold controversial policies after lower court losses\n\n\"The democratic process is actively engaged in this,\" says Misha Tseytlin, a former Wisconsin solicitor general who filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of members of Congress from North Carolina. \"The value of democracy is allowing the people to solve their own problems.”\n\nFormer U.S. solicitor general Paul Clement, who will argue the case for North Carolina lawmakers, says in court papers that \"courts simply do not have any business making value-laden judgments about how much politics is too much in a process that will never be free of politics.\"\n\nWhatever the court decides could affect several other states with lawsuits pending, including Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. The justices last year let stand the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision striking down that state's congressional map and replacing it with one that helped Democrats win more seats in November.\n\nIf the justices strike down the North Carolina or Maryland maps, \"every single map in the country is going to be subject to this kind of attack,\" warns Jason Torchinsky, who argued against that result in court papers on behalf of the Republican National Committee.\n\n“I believe Roberts is looking for a way to get the court out of these questions,” he says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/14/politics/desantis-florida-redistricting-what-matters", "title": "Florida redistricting: Ron DeSantis is drawing Democrats out of the ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter.

Politicians have been using gerrymandering for hundreds of years to manipulate election map boundaries in favor of one party over another.\n\nRegardless of the approach, gerrymandering is all about elected officials trying to keep their power by manipulating the makeup of the population that they represent, thereby making it easier for their party to win.\n\nThe consequences for the country are severe. Lawmakers in both parties speaking candidly admit that gerrymandering House districts is one of the big reasons that the chamber has become more partisan over the last several decades.\n\nFlorida is unique, but everyone should pay attention. DeSantis took the unusual step of proposing his own congressional map, which was far more partisan than the ones moving through the state House and Senate – which are controlled by his party – at the time.\n\nThough the state Constitution puts lawmakers in charge of redistricting, GOP legislative leaders announced this week that they would cede those duties to DeSantis, ending a power struggle between the two branches of government that has lasted for months.\n\nThis is highly unusual, but it does raise the possibility that other governors will be emboldened to do the same under the right circumstances in the future.\n\nThis isn’t the win Florida Republicans think it is. Gerrymandering is bad for everyone. Full stop.\n\nThe practice “really harms all of us. It harms Americans from both parties, and I think it’s really, really destructive for a democracy,” Christopher Warshaw, a political science professor at The George Washington University, told What Matters.\n\n“I think that regardless of whether you normally support Democrats or Republicans, gerrymandering is bad. And it’s bad when Republicans do it in Florida, it’s bad when Democrats do it in other states. I think that in a world where it’s hard to come to agreement about things that we should all sort of say are out of bounds, I think that egregious gerrymandering is just one of the things that is so destructive for democracy,” Warshaw said.\n\n“I hope Americans can come together and say: ‘We need to figure out a way to not do this.’ “\n\nThe big picture. For more on this, we went to Sam Wang, a professor at Princeton University and director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, to explain what’s happening right now and what it will mean for US politics in the coming years. Our conversation, conducted over the phone and edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nWHAT MATTERS: How unusual is it for a sitting governor to draw his state’s congressional map himself?\n\nWANG: Highly unusual. The job of legislation belongs to the legislature, and for the legislature to break its impasse with the governor by throwing it in his lap goes against almost every tradition of redistricting in any state.\n\nI’ve followed redistricting pretty closely for two decades, and I cannot think of any state where this happened in this way.\n\nWHAT MATTERS: If DeSantis gets his way, how extreme will the gerrymandering in Florida be compared with other states?\n\nWANG: It will be one of the most extreme gerrymanders in the country. It will be on par with another Republican gerrymander in Texas, or with Democratic gerrymanders in Illinois or New York.\n\nIt’ll be every bit as bad as the slew of Republican gerrymanders that took place in 2012, which I think of as “the great gerrymander of 2012.” It was a high-water mark for partisan gerrymandering that decade.\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Are you concerned at all that this sets a new precedent wherein governors everywhere will brazenly draw their congressional map as they see fit?\n\nWANG: As bizarre as the circumstance was, it might be hard to repeat. One important point is that Florida has so many congressional seats. It was an unusual circumstance.\n\nIt’s an unusually high-profile situation, and one in which both parties are aware of the stakes. And so I think it’s an extreme set of circumstances, and DeSantis has been engaged in a protracted dispute with the legislature. It would be more common in such a situation for such a dispute to be thrown into state or federal court.\n\nWHAT MATTERS: How do you convince both parties that the short-term gains that come with gerrymandering are eclipsed by the long-term damage to democracy?\n\nWANG: I would say that one should probably appeal to legislators through their self-interest.\n\nWhat I mean by that is that at this point, redistricting across the United States at a congressional level has reached a stalemate in which both political parties are gerrymandering to the max. And so in terms of gaining power, I think there’s less and less to be gained from pushing partisan gerrymandering.\n\nIn terms of other motivations, other incentives one could give legislators, gerrymandering creates fewer and fewer competitive seats. And the few seats that are competitive will end up being expensive races in which more and more resources are put into a very small number of states. And it may be that legislators will perhaps have enough of that.\n\nI think a more real realistic route is to look at the fact that several dozen states have an initiative process where they can form independent commissions – as has been done in the last decade in Michigan, in Colorado and in Virginia. That’s a route where the people have taken the power from the legislators, as opposed to the legislators doing it voluntarily.\n\nAnother route might be to do what happened in Virginia, where the majority actually shifted because of demographic changes in Virginia. In that case, the Republican majority became concerned that they would lose the majority – putting Democrats in control and possibly putting them at risk of being gerrymandered the way that they committed to gerrymandering in the past decade.\n\nAnd in that case, I think that fear of being gerrymandered led them to a good government reform. And so I think in that case, just self-preservation led to reform. So I would say that legislators are, in many ways, not any different from anyone else.\n\nThey of course have a duty to serve the people, but they also have incentives to take care of themselves, and all these ways that I’ve described take that into account.\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Have any states found success in regulating gerrymandering to the satisfaction of both parties? It sounds like the independent commissions could be key.\n\nWANG: Yeah, I think that the two major routes are basically an independent commission or, rather, a commission that’s (as) independent as possible. And the other route is action in state court.\n\nBoth of those can lead to better outcomes that are more fair from a partisan standpoint, giving both parties equitable opportunities, and also leading to more competition than you see when legislators are left in charge.\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Anything you’d like to add?\n\nWANG: Well, honestly I think there’s been a lot of coverage in the last month about how there’s less competition. And that’s a big story, but I think that in fact, in some ways, things are not as bad as they’ve been made out to be.\n\nIt is true that there are partisan gerrymanders, but it’s also true that there’s an awful lot of press coverage. The analytics that we’ve done and the Princeton Gerrymandering Project show that, overall, competition has actually increased slightly from 2012. I’d say there’s a moderate increase in competition compared with 10 years ago.\n\nI think the big story is that competition is still low, but that’s because of both redistricting and because of partisan polarization.\n\nSo I think the next challenge really is to find ways to increase competition in congressional seats, and also in state legislative seats. And the same reformers who have been working so hard on redistricting reform may be turning their sights onto the next wave of reforms: things like ranked choice voting, which can take a noncompetitive district and make it more competitive by giving voters more options.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/04/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/28/election-2024-the-key-races-to-watch-in-all-50-states/75674463007/", "title": "Election 2024: The key races to watch in all 50 states", "text": "USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nElection Day will be about more than just Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nThough the presidential election is commanding the most attention, a host of down-ballot races across the country will determine control of Congress, the direction of state legislatures and major policy battles on issues such as abortion rights and marijuana.\n\nHouse races in states like Arizona, Alaska and California will determine control of the control of the 435-seat House, where Democrats seek to upend the current 220-212 GOP majority. Likewise, Democrats currently control the Senate but only by a razor-thin margin. Which party will gain control of the upper chamber?\n\nBut there are other, less high profile but still important races on the Nov. 5 ballot. Voters will get to decide on ranked choice voting in multiple states and in Maine voters will decide whether to change their state flag for the first time in a century.\n\nHere is our guide to some of the most consequential — and interesting — races in all 50 states.\n\n— Melissa Brown and Duane W. Gang, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nLearn more about the races\n\nAlabama | Alaska | Arizona | Arkansas | California | Colorado | Connecticut | Delaware | Florida | Georgia | Hawaii | Idaho | Illinois | Indiana | Iowa | Kansas | Kentucky | Louisiana | Maine | Maryland | Massachusetts | Michigan | Minnesota | Mississippi | Missouri | Montana | Nebraska | Nevada | New Hampshire | New Jersey | New Mexico | New York | North Carolina | North Dakota | Ohio | Oklahoma | Oregon | Pennsylvania | Rhode Island | South Carolina | South Dakota | Tennessee | Texas | Utah | Vermont | Virginia | Washington | West Virginia | Wisconsin | Wyoming |\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican Caroleene Dobson, Democrat Shomari Figures\n\nWhat's at stake: Alabama’s congressional map was redrawn in 2023 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the proposed Alabama congressional district map was gerrymandered, discriminating against Black voters in the case of Allen v. Milligan. While the state initially refused to redraw the map, defying a federal court order, a new map was eventually drawn. This allowed for another nearly majority Black district in Alabama and set the stage for the competitive primaries as a minority opportunity district. The winner of this race will be the first person to represent the new district. If Figures wins, Alabama will have two Democrats in the House for the first time since 2008 when it had three Democratic representatives.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Terri Sewell, Incumbent, Republican Robin Litaker\n\nWhat's at stake: Sewell is currently the only Democratic member of Congress from Alabama. If unseated, all nine of Alabama’s Congress members could be Republicans, depending on the outcome of the closely watched race in the 2nd Congressional District. It would also be the first time District 7 has ever been represented by a Republican.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Democrat Eric Hafner, Republican Nicholas Begich and independent John Howe.\n\nWhat's at stake: Holding onto Alaska’s sole House seat is key to Democrats regaining control of the House. Peltola narrowly won in 2022, defeating former Gov. Sarah Palin, becoming the first Democrat from the state elected to the House since 1972. The state’s rank choice voting system advances the top four primary candidates and places them in the general election, regardless of party. Hafner, who’s a New Jersey resident, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for making false bomb threats over the phone and threatening judges, police officers and lawyers, pleading guilty to the crimes in 2022. He’s previously ran for office outside of his home state, running in Hawaii in 2016 as a Republican and in Oregon in 2018 as a Democrat.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Increase the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour and require employers to provide earned paid sick leave for employees.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, Alaska will become the 8th state (not including Washington D.C.) to install a $15 or higher minimum wage.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 2\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting system that was adopted in 2020\n\nWhat's at stake: If repealed, the state will resume traditional voting. There are currently four other states, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, and Oregon, with rank choice related measures their ballots this election.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Republican Kari Lake, U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona\n\nWhat's at stake: It’s one of the marquee races across the country that could help determine which party will control the chamber. Lake appears to have gained ground on Gallego, but he has held an advantage in the polls since the outset of the race. The seat is now held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who announced in March she would not seek a second term.\n\nThe race: Proposition 139 – Arizona Abortion Access Act\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A measure to protect abortion rights\n\nWhat's at stake: This measure would create a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution. If passed by voters, the state will not be able to interfere before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible. Polling shows strong support for the measure.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican David Schweikert, Democrat Amish Shah\n\nWhat's at stake: David Schweikert, a seven-term member of Congress, is locked in a tight race with emergency room physician Amish Shah, a former state lawmaker, in Arizona’s most affluent congressional district. Schweikert is a free-market Republican; Shah is a “practical” Democrat who won a crowded six-way primary. The race is rated a toss-up.\n\nThe race: 6thCongressional District\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Republican Juan Ciscomani, Democrat Kirsten Engel\n\nWhat's at stake: In a rematch from 2022, Ciscomani faces Engel, an environmental lawyer and former state lawmaker whom he defeated by less than 2% of the vote. He is a free-market Republican and served as an aide to former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The race is rated a toss-up. Arizona’s congressional delegation is now 6-3 Republican, so flipping both seats could flip the delegation to the Democrats.\n\n— Arizona Republic, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice\n\nWho is running: Arkansas Supreme Court Justices Karen R. Baker and Rhonda Wood are competing for the position of chief justice in a runoff election.\n\nWhat's at stake: While the outcome of this race won’t likely affect the ideological breakdown on the seven-member court, it could serve as a symbolic referendum on the two justices who have diametrically opposed views on a number of issues, notably around direct democracy. Both justices recently took strong stances on Secretary of State John Thurston’s disqualification of a ballot measure that if approved would have guaranteed a limited right to abortion in the state Constitution. Wood wrote the majority opinion in the controversial decision to uphold Thurston’s rejection of the measure, while Baker wrote a scathing dissent.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 62\n\nWho is running: In House District 62, Dexter Miller, a tech worker at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is challenging Republican Mark McElroy, a moderate Republican who’s served on and off in the legislature since 2012, also having run as a Democrat and an independent.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Miller ran against McElroy in 2022, losing by less than 200 votes. If 2024’s rematch is nearly as close this time around, the race could be an opportunity for the Democrats to pick up a district in eastern Arkansas, contiguous with the blue counties around West Memphis. Arkansas Democrats are mounting a big push to challenge Republican incumbents in the state legislature and in Congress, many of whom have run unopposed for years.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 56\n\nWho is running: Conway eye doctor Steve Magie, an incumbent Democrat, is defending his state House seat against conservative Republican Kim Slaughter, the owner and operator of a miniature golf course.\n\nWhat’s at stake: If the results of the 2022 elections are any indication, Magie might be one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the Arkansas General Assembly. He won by only 10 votes while running for his seventh term representing District 56, outside of Little Rock, in the last election. Republicans in the Arkansas House command an 82-seat supermajority in the 100-person chamber. Picking up a handful of seats could allow the state’s Democrats to gain some leverage, since spending bills require a three-quarters vote. But this will be challenging without holding onto seats like Magie’s.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 24\n\nWho is running: Moderate Democrat Ryan Intchauspe, an employee for a training contractor that works with the Dept. of Transportation, is running against conservative Republican Brad Hall, a rancher.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This matchup is part of a trend of Arkansas Democrats running for seats which have been solidly Republican for years and where a blue win might be a long shot. Outgoing incumbent Republican Charlene Fite ran unopposed in 2022. In 2020, before redistricting, she won in the equivalent district by close to 40 percentage points in a three-way race, and in 2018 by almost 45%. Intchauspe, a relatively conservative Democrat with some talking points that could appeal to Libertarian-leaning voters, as well as a military service record, might be a good indicator of whether districts like this are necessarily as safe for Republicans as they appear.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent and freshman Rep. John Duarte is hoping to keep hold of his seat in this rural swing district, facing his 2022 challenger, Democrat Adam Gray, a second time.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The rematch is one of five highly competitive House races in California, all of which forecasters say will help decide which party is in the majority next year. They’re also all held by Republicans, despite the state’s overwhelming Democratic majority, making them rare purple races in a state not known for dramatic election face-offs. The 13th district is among the tightest of those five, and with Gray and Duarte facing off again, it’s expected results will be razor-thin. Just two years ago, Duarte won by fewer than 600 votes, the second-slimmest margin in the nation.\n\nThe race: 27th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Garcia is defending his seat from Democrat George Whitesides, a deep-pocketed political newcomer and who once headed space-tourism company Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In this Northern Los Angeles County district, Garcia picked up the seat in 2020 in a special election and has held on to through the general election and 2022 midterm. But all those prior victories were against Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman. With a new Democrat in the mix in Whitesides, the race could see an upset. It’s one of the five most competitive races in California this year, all of which have Republican incumbents representing areas that went to Biden in 2020. Garcia’s record could present challenges in deep-blue California. A staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, he is one of a few California Republicans who voted against certifying election results Jan. 6, 2021, and signed a 2021 amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nThe race: 41st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Rep. Ken Calvert, who has been in Congress for nearly three decades, is up against Democratic upstart Will Rollins. It’s a rematch, as former federal prosecutor Rollins attempts to grab the seat again after his 2022 defeat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whereas most of California's toss-up House races feature relative newcomers who assumed office within the last few years, Calvert is one of the state’s longest-serving representatives. Calvert won against Rollins in 2022 by less than 5 percentage points, and the Democratic challenger boasts a much larger war chest this time around. The race has attracted much attention and cash, making it the most expensive House race in the state as of early October. Polling roughly a month out from Nov. 5 has the pair at a dead heat. While Calvert has defended his seat many times over, this second match-up against Rollins is increasingly competitive, especially as 2021 redistricting looped in more liberal areas like Palm Springs.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, Democrat Trisha Calvarese and three third-party candidates: Paul Noel Fiorino, Unity; Frank Atwood, Approval Voting; and Hannah Goodman, Libertarian\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert has been a U.S. House member since 2021, but in a different district: the 3rd Congressional District that covers western Colorado. She decided to run in the 4th Congressional District last year after longtime Republican Rep. Ken Buck announced he wouldn’t be seeking a sixth term, saying many within his Republican Party have strayed from its ideals and are no longer addressing solutions. If Boebert is not elected, it will shift the representation of a portion of Colorado that has long been represented by a Republican and will represent a significant shift in the political makeup of Colorado's representation.\n\nThe race: Proposition 127\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure regarding the hunting of mountain lions, bobcats and lynx\n\nWhat's at stake: Citizen-initiated Proposition 127 seeks to make it illegal to hunt bobcats, lynx and mountain lions in Colorado, though it’s important to note that it’s already illegal to hunt lynx under state and federal law. With appropriate licenses, the hunting of mountain lions has been allowed in Colorado since 1965. Hunting of bobcats in the state has been allowed even longer. Trophy hunting mountain lions is illegal in the state. By law, mountain lion meat must be prepared for human consumption. Bobcats are considered furbearers, so you do not have to eat their meat under state hunting laws. This initiative would allow bobcats, lynx and mountain lions to be killed if they are deemed a threat to human life, livestock or property.\n\nThe race: Poudre School District R-1 Ballot Issue 4A\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A local measure on levy for schools\n\nWhy it matters: This local ballot issue represents a critical crossroads school districts face as they grapple with school funding woes and aging facilities: Do they cut services, ask for help or do both? And if they do ask for help, will they get it? Poudre School District is asking voters to approve a debt-free mill levy to support a wide range of wants and needs, including repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to school facilities.\n\n— Kelly Lyell, Miles Blumhardt, Rebecca Powell and Sarah Kyle, The Coloradoan\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent Rep. Jahana Hayes is seeking a fourth term against Republican challenger George Logan in a highly anticipated rematch. Logan, a former state senator, narrowly lost to Hayes in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 5th District is a key swing seat and the outcome could help decide which party controls the U.S. House. Both candidates are focused on economic issues, but their approaches differ. Hayes backs more federal funding for affordable housing and wage increases, while Logan advocates for reducing government spending. Other major topics include immigration reform and abortion rights, with Hayes supporting federal protections for abortion access and Logan opposing them.\n\nThe race: No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Connecticut voters will decide on the No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment. A \"yes\" vote would allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason. A \"no\" vote keeps the current rules, which require voters to give an excuse, like being out of town or having a disability.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, this amendment would make voting more accessible by expanding the use of mail-in ballots. Supporters say it’s the next step in ensuring all voters have the flexibility to cast their ballot. Opponents worry about the potential for misuse and prefer keeping in-person voting as the primary method. With many states already allowing no-excuse absentee voting, this decision could reshape how elections are conducted in Connecticut.\n\nThe race: Key state legislative races\n\nWho is running: Connecticut's state legislature expects to see several highly competitive races. In the 8th Senate District, incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Seminara faces Democrat Paul Honig, who seeks to flip the seat held by Republicans since 1967. The 28th Senate District features Republican Sen. Tony Hwang challenged by newcomer Rob Blanchard, a Democrat, testing the suburbs' political leanings. In the 36th Senate District, Republican Sen. Ryan Fazio contends with Democrat Nick Simmons, a former deputy chief of staff for Gov. Ned Lamont. The 22nd House District showcases Republican Rep. Francis Cooley battling Democrat Rebecca Martinez, who aims to reclaim her seat after a narrow loss. The 65th House District sees Democrat Rep. Michelle Cook go against Republican Joe Canino. In the 81st House District, Democrat Rep. Chris Poulos is up against Republican James Morelli. Lastly, in the 138th House District, Republican Rep. Rachel Chaleski battles Democrat Ken Gucker, who seeks to reclaim his former seat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These races could reshape Connecticut's political landscape as demographics shift and voter turnout spikes during the presidential election. With several traditionally GOP districts in play, the outcomes will determine whether Connecticut leans further left or sees a Republican resurgence.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Current U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester faces Republican Eric Hansen and independent Dr. Mike Katz. Hansen is a Wilmington resident and businessman, while Katz is an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Both of Delaware’s seats in the U.S. Senate have been held by Democrats since 2001, so a win by Hansen or Katz, while unlikely, would be a major upset. Katz specifically would be the state’s first independent U.S. Senator. If Blunt Rochester is elected, she would be the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the third Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Sarah McBride faces Republican political newcomer John Whalen III, a retired state police officer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Delaware’s sole House seat is up for grabs without an incumbent in the race for the first time since Lisa Blunt Rochester, now running for Senate, was elected in 2016. A Republican hasn’t held the seat since 2011, and the odds appear to be against Whalen. If McBride wins the race, she will be the first transgender person elected to federal office, as well as the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer won the Democratic nomination after a tight primary race with the current lieutenant governor. He faces Delaware House Minority Leader Mike Ramone.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats have held the governor’s office in Delaware since 1993, with current Gov. John Carney – now running uncontested for mayor of Wilmington – winning his last election with nearly 60% of votes. Ramone, who has held a seat in the statehouse since 2008, is running on a platform of bipartisan leadership to challenge the state’s “single-party rule.”\n\n— The News Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second six-year term against former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who served just one term in Congress before being defeated by U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Miami.\n\nWhat's at stake: At stake is a seat that could decide which party controls the upper chamber, with the power to approve or block appointments to the judicial branch in the next administration. Each has harshly criticized the other on perceived vulnerabilities heading to the Nov. 5 election. Scott slammed Mucarsel-Powell as an “open-border socialist” while Mucarsel-Powell called Scott an “extremist” who would put social safety net programs at risk and push for a federal abortion ban.\n\nThe race: Amendment 3\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Recreational marijuana\n\nWhat's at stake: In Florida, voters statewide will decide on Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. As with all proposed constitutional amendments in the state, the measure requires no less than a 60% majority to pass. It would allow people to purchase, possess and use marijuana, but would not allow home growing. Its passage could align Florida with the 24 other states that have already legalized recreational marijuana, potentially affecting the state's economy and criminal justice system. Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top conservatives in the state oppose the measure, with the governor saying it could lead to prolific pot smells, among other criticisms.\n\nThe race: Amendment 4\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Abortion access\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot initiative aims to guarantee abortion access in Florida. It’s generated the most attention, especially since the Florida Supreme Court gave its OK to a six-week abortion ban in the state. Florida Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, have come out in force against the amendment. If approved, abortion access would be assured up to fetal viability, or how soon a fetus can survive outside of its mother's womb, generally considered 24 weeks. It would also allow abortions when necessary to protect a patient’s health, as determined by a health care provider. Opponents say that’s too vague and will lead to an unregulated abortion industry, but proponents dismiss those claims as “scare tactics.”\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 42\n\nWho is running: Gabriel Sanchez, a 27-year-old Democratic Socialist, and Republican Diane Jackson are both vying for their first term in the Georgia legislature.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Sanchez is the first Democratic Socialist to win a state primary in Georgia, according to the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the May primary, he defeated incumbent Rep. Teri Anulewicz, who has served in the House since 2017. District 42 has not been represented by a Republican since 2012 and overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, meaning Sanchez will likely be the first Democratic Socialist state lawmaker in Georgia’s history.\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 53\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Deborah Silcox, a Republican, is vying for her second term representing District 53 against Democrat Susie Greenberg.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is one of the most competitive in the state, and one of the most expensive legislative battles. Silcox flipped the district Republican in the last election, winning by fewer than 1,500 votes. Greenberg has raised nearly $432,000, according to her most recent campaign filing, more than four times Silcox’s $103,000 from this year’s campaign. Silcox previously represented House District 52 but lost to Rep. Shea Roberts, a Democrat, in 2020. Silcox notably refused to concede for over six months following the election, after a lawsuit was filed by a Sandy Springs resident alleging that voter fraud had occurred in the district. The case was eventually dismissed by the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nThe race: Georgia Senate District 48\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Shawn Still, a Republican, is defending his seat from Democratic challenger Ashwin Ramaswami\n\nWhat’s at stake: Still was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia as part of former President Trump’s fake elector scheme, having served as a secretary who signed and filed false documents in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. His opponent, Ramaswami, has been campaigning on his experience in election cybersecurity and other progressive issues, and has raised more than five times as much as Still, according to recent campaign filings. If elected, Ramaswami would be the first Indian American and first Gen Z lawmaker in the Georgia Senate.\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Hawaii Island mayor\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Mayor Mitch Roth is seeking a second term against challenger Kimo Alameda. Roth, a former Hawaii County prosecutor, has over 40 years of public service experience, while Alameda, a psychologist and former VP at Hawai‘i Island Community Health Center, has deep ties to the island and has been compared to the late Mayor Billy Kenoi.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Key issues include affordable housing, homelessness, permit backlogs, and infrastructure upgrades. The race is closely watched due to the split endorsements from labor unions, with Roth supported by private-sector unions and Alameda backed by public-sector unions. In the August primary, Roth led with 38% of the vote, but Alameda’s 28% and the 34% secured by four other candidates make this a competitive race, as those voters could swing the outcome in November.\n\nThe race: Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees\n\nWho is running: Six candidates are running for three seats on the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) Board. For the at-large trustee seat, incumbent Keli‘i Akina is being challenged by Lei Ahu Isa. In the Kauai-Niihau seat race, incumbent Dan Ahuna faces Laura Lindsey. For the Molokai-Lanai seat, incumbent Luana Alapa is running against Kunani Nihipali. Additionally, Kaiali‘i Kai” Kahele has already secured the at-large trustee seat for Hawaii County in the primary election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The OHA Board directs significant resources to Native Hawaiian communities through scholarships, loans, and grants. These trustees play a vital role in shaping programs that promote education, business development, and community support for Native Hawaiians across the state.\n\nMore: Hawaii House speaker loses reelection bid, deceased lawmaker wins seat: 5 takeaways from Saturday's primaries\n\nThe race: Hawaii legislative races\n\nWhat’s at stake: Hawaii's Legislature is set for a major shakeup, with at least 11 new members joining the upcoming session. With all 51 House seats and 13 of 25 Senate seats up for election, a wave of retirements, primary defeats, and shifting political dynamics are driving significant turnover.\n\nKey races: One of the most notable upsets occurred in House District 25, where progressive Kim Coco Iwamoto ousted House Speaker Scott Saiki, leaving a leadership vacancy that will be addressed after the election. In other key House races, Ikaika Hussey unseated longtime Rep. May Mizuno in District 29, while Shirley Ann Templo defeated Rep. Sonny Ganaden in District 30, signaling growing ideological diversity within Hawaii’s Democratic Party. The race in District 50, where Mike Lee will face Republican Timothy Connelly, could also see a competitive challenge from the GOP. In the Senate, Democrat Cedric Gates is battling Republican Samantha Decorte in Senate District 22, a district that has been trending more conservative, offering the GOP a rare opportunity in a predominantly Democratic state.\n\nWhat's at stake: These contests reflect broader trends of political shifts in Hawaii, with an incoming class that could tilt the legislature in new directions on housing, education, and economic policy. Whether the state moves further left or sees a surge in conservative momentum will depend on the outcomes of these races, marking a pivotal moment for the future of Hawaii’s politics.\n\nThe race: Constitutional amendments\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Voters in Hawaii will consider two significant state constitutional amendments. The first proposal aims to remove the legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, contingent upon a reversal of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2014 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The second proposal seeks to streamline the judicial appointment process by aligning the selection of district court judges with that of Supreme Court justices and higher court judges, enhancing consistency and efficiency in the judiciary.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These amendments mark a notable shift from Hawaii's recent trend of maintaining legislative control over such matters. They represent the first constitutional amendments on the ballot since 2018, following a long period of inaction where the legislature rejected hundreds of proposals, including 68 in the current biennium. Given Hawaii's stringent requirements for passing amendments — requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers or consecutive majority votes — the outcome could have lasting implications for the state’s legal framework and judicial system.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore: Hawaii voters to decide on marriage law authority and judicial appointment process\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Idaho voters will weigh in on an initiative to institute a top-four primary system and ranked-choice voting. Under a top-four primary system, all the primary candidates appear together on the same primary ballot, regardless of their party, and the top four vote-getters from that pool move on to the general election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Idaho’s Republican, Libertarian and Constitution Party primaries are currently closed, meaning that only registered members can vote in them. The Democratic Primary is open, meaning anyone can vote regardless of their affiliation. According to Boise State Public Radio, almost a third of all registered voters in Idaho today are unregistered, which means they can’t vote in most primaries.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 15\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Rick Just, a Democrat, is defending his seat against Republican former state Rep. Codi Galloway in a rematch of a race from 2022. District 15 is a swing district in the western part of Boise.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Spending on this race has been the highest among any state legislature race this year, Idaho Education News reported. Close to a quarter million in spending between the two candidates works out to almost $6 per resident in the district. Just won the seat in 2022 by less than 2 percentage points, a little more than 300 votes which, if that’s any indication of how this race will go, makes him perhaps one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the legislature this cycle.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 6\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Dan Foreman is fending off a challenge from Democrat Julia Parker. In 2022, Foreman ousted incumbent Democrat David Nelson in a tight race decided by little over 400 votes.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This might be one of the best opportunities in Idaho for Democrats to flip a seat in the state Senate, which is dominated by Republican lawmakers by a four-to-one margin. Foreman had run against Nelson twice, in 2018 and 2020, before finally winning in 2022, showing how competitive the district is.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Eric Sorenson faces off with challenger Joe McGraw, a retired Rockford judge running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race, which covers majority of northern/northwestern and parts of central Illinois has been hotly contested the last few races, with the Democrats winning in tight races. The race is seen as a potential seat where Republicans can make a gain. Of the 17 seats in the congressional delegation, 14 are held by Democrats.\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Nikki Budzinski faces off with Joshua Loyd, a political outsider running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is another one which was seen as a potential seat that could flip from blue to red in the Springfield area. In August, Democrats across the state poured “seven figure investments” into two races, this being one of them. Loyd is a West Point graduate and fervent backer of the Second Amendment.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: This is an open seat, since outgoing Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb is term-limited. Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun is giving up his Senate seat to run against Democrat Jennifer McCormick, a former state Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Libertarian Donald Rainwater, who previously garnered 11% of the vote in the 2020 gubernatorial race, a record for Indiana Libertarians.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Braun's to lose, in a solidly red state where Democrats haven't won a statewide office since 2012 or the governor's office since 2000. But since recent polling has shown Braun underperforming compared to other Republicans in Indiana, the race has suddenly seemed more competitive in the eyes of national observers and each party's governor associations, which have chipped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to each candidate in the last few weeks. A Democratic win is still unlikely, but there are signs that a solid performance by McCormick could mark the beginning of a pendulum shift for the balance of power in Indiana in elections to come.\n\nThe race: Indiana Attorney General\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita is seeking a second four-year term against Democratic challenger Destiny Wells, an Indiana Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who has quickly risen to prominence in the state Democratic Party. Rokita has been a mainstay in Indiana Republican politics for the last two decades, serving in both the U.S. House and as Indiana Secretary of State. Wells has not held elected office but ran for Indiana Secretary of State back in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: There’s been a lot of attention on the race in the context of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban. Rokita is an ardent anti-abortion candidate who faced a national firestorm over his comments on Fox News about an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, who gave an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim back in 2022. Wells has campaigned with Bernard and has pitched the race as a way for Hoosiers to weigh in on abortion rights since the state lacks a ballot referendum process.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan is seeking a third term in the U.S. House. He is being challenged by Republican Lake County Council member Randy Niemeyer, who has been endorsed by high-profile national Republicans and tapped as a “Young Gun” race to watch by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Libertarian Dakotah Miskus, a 25-year-old from LaPorte County, is also running in this election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The district is one of only two Democratic congressional districts in all of Indiana and the 2024 race is the second election cycle that Republicans have eyed the seat as a potential flip to grow their party’s majority in the House. In the 2022 midterms, Mrvan won reelection by 6 points over his Republican challenger in a race closely watched by national political analysts. Democrats have held the 1st District for nearly 100 years, but the area is made up of working-class Rust Belt communities where former President Donald Trump typically performs well.\n\n— The Indianapolis Star, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks is in a rematch with Democrat Christina Bohannan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 1st Congressional District could be the sleeper swing district in a state that has turned decidedly red in recent elections. Active voter registrations favor Republicans, and Miller-Meeks defeated Bohannan in 2022 by about 7 percentage points. But in this rematch, national Democrats have funneled money into the race to capitalize on what they see as Miller-Meeks’ weakness with independents and even some Republicans. The limited publicly available polling of the race suggests Bohannan might have the edge.\n\nThe race: 3rd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Zach Nunn is being challenged by Democrat Lanon Baccam, both of whom are veterans.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 3rd District was anticipated to be its most contested after Nunn squeaked into office with a victory of less than 1 percentage point in 2022. In a state where Republicans hold all four congressional posts, it’s perhaps Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat. It’s got a narrower Republican voter registration advantage than other districts in the state, and it’s home to some of Iowa’s largest urban metro areas, which tend to favor Democrats. But Nunn has avoided major missteps, and Republicans remain confident in their chances.\n\n— The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: House District 52\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jesse Borjon, R-Topeka, faces challenger Jacquie Whitney Lightcap, D-Topeka.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the legislature. National Democrats early on identified Borjon’s seat as a key pickup opportunity, but Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s PAC did not endorse in the race.\n\nThe race: House District 102\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, faces challenger Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature. Republicans believe they can grow their supermajorities and identified Probst’s seat as a key pickup opportunity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 10\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, faces challenger Andrew Mall, D-Shawnee.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, is widely viewed as the most important electoral battleground, and this race could be a barometer for others in the Kansas City suburbs. Thompson is an affable former television weatherman, but has established himself as one of the most conservative lawmakers with high-profile questioning of climate science and election integrity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 11\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Kellie Warren, R-Leawood, faces challenger Karen Thurlow, D-Stilwell.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is another high-profile race in Johnson County. Warren was a significant figure behind Value Them Both, an anti-abortion constitutional amendment that voters decisively rejected in 2022. The race could show whether reproductive rights continue to be a winning issue for Democrats.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 2\n\nWho is running: Kentucky voters will weigh in on a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would let state lawmakers direct spending toward non-public education, including through charter school and voucher programs.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While proponents of the change say this would allow Kentucky students to have wider access to a variety of schools that may better suit their educational needs, critics allege that the amendment would leave a devastating financial impact on the state's public school system.\n\n— The Courier-Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t face a serious challenge in what is considered a safe GOP seat, but his race and reaction after will be closely watched because of his close ties to former President Trump.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson’ previous defense of Trump both during his impeachment and following the 2020 election that Trump lost has raised questions as to whether the leader of the House will certify the 2024 presidential election if Trump loses again.\n\nThe race: 6th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress in the 1990s, and former Republican state Sen. Elbert Guillory are familiar faces on the ballot, but they are joined by newcomer Quentin Anthony Anderson, a Democrat and executive chairman of a social justice nonprofit, who is also running a district-wide campaign.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana’s new 6th District boundaries created a court-ordered second majority-Black district that favors Democrats and caused incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves to bow out of race. A victory here by Democrats would cut into the Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\nThe race: Amendment No. 1 to the Louisiana Constitution\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The proposed amendment would expand the dedication to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund to add federal money the state receives from offshore wind, solar and other alternative or renewable energy sources generated in federal Gulf waters off the state’s coast.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land since the 1930s, about the size of Delaware. The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund provides money for projects to restore and preserve the Louisiana coast.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is being challenged by Republican Austin Theriault\n\nWhat’s at stake: Golden is running for his third term in Congress, but as a Democrat in a Trump-won district, he is particularly vulnerable to a Republican challenge. Not only are the party demographics stacked against him, but he also recently changed his position on assault weapons after Maine’s deadliest ever shooting in Lewiston last October. A district with a high proportion of gun owners, this may come back to hurt him in the election. While Golden is a blue dog, conservative Democrat, Theriault, a Republican state representative and former NASCAR driver, has tried to tie him to national Democrats as well as criticized him on the gun issue. The race will be an important one for determining which party will take control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe race: Maine state legislature\n\nWho is running: Every representative and senator in the Maine state legislature\n\nWhat’s at stake: Maine currently has a Democratic trifecta in state politics, with Democrats controlling the governorship, the state House, and the state Senate. The governor has two more years left of her term, but every seat in the legislature is up for reelection. Maine also has term limits on its legislators — they are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms — making the races more volatile and open than other states. While Democrats are the favorites to retain control, these factors along a national election with Trump on the ballot is causing Republicans to feel hopeful of capturing one of those chambers this year, more likely the House.\n\nThe race: Flag question\n\nWho is running: Measure to change Maine’s state flag\n\nWhat’s at stake: This measure would replace the current official Maine state flag, which is blue with the state’s coat of arms, with the former state flag, which features a green pine tree and the North Star on a light tan background. The former state flag, commonly known as the Pine Tree Flag, was originally adopted in 1901 before being replaced by the current flag in 1909. It’s become a slightly controversial ballot measure, with some conservatives see changing the flag as a sign of “wokeness,” as the current flag features two white men next to the coat of arms. However, the Pine Tree Flag is already an iconic image, appearing on souvenirs, clothing and many flag poles.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Ben Cardin, who is not seeking reelection after serving three terms.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The eyes of the nation are on Maryland as the Senate race may help might decide the balance of power in the chamber. Though Larry Hogan has said he won't vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, the shadow of presidential race holds major sway over this contest. Alsobrooks leads by double digits in many polls, but this one should still come down to the wire.\n\nThe race: Legislatively referred abortion amendment\n\nWhat's on the ballot: In 2023, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to refer an amendment to the state’s Constitution on abortion to voters. The state’s voters approved a related measure in 1992 with a majority voting to make the procedure legal. If the measure is passed, any future changes would require a future General Assembly to put the issue again before voters. If the measure fails, the procedure would still be allowed under current state law.\n\nWhat's at stake: Though this ballot measure in bright blue Maryland is almost certain to pass, by how wide a margin could have a big impact on Maryland's U.S. Senate race. Ads supporting Democrat Angela Alsobrooks have continuously singled out Republican Larry Hogan's personal opposition to abortion, though Hogan's campaign has stressed that he has publicly opposed to a federal abortion ban and as far back as when he first ran for governor, Hogan promised not to change Maryland’s laws protecting abortion access.\n\n— Keith Demko, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is being challenged by Republican John Deaton\n\nWhat's at stake: Warren has gained a national profile in her two terms as senator, compiling one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. She's been willing to break with party leadership on key issues such as immigration — voting earlier this year against a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and criticizing President Joe Biden's executive order on tightening the border. Deaton moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island only months before the primaries. The cryptocurrency lawyer has highlighted his rough childhood in the Detroit area while presenting a moderate stance on issues such as abortion — at times infuriating conservative Republicans in the process.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 2, Eliminating the MCAS Graduation Requirement\n\nWhat's on the ballot: For more than 20 years, students have been required to pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests in math, science and technology, and English in order to graduate from a public high school in Massachusetts. If it is passed, Ballot Question 2 would eliminate the requirement.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The question has divided some of the most prominent Democrats in the state. Supporters include Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Ayanna Pressley, James McGovern, Lori Trahan and William Keating. Opponents include Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kimberly Driscoll and Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. Supporters of the ballot question, including the state's teachers unions, say the test is a one-size-fits-all exam that does not properly evaluate student performance and achievement. Opponents, who include business-aligned groups as well as the state superintendents association, say removing the requirement would lead to a lowering of standards across the board.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 5, Minimum Wage for Tipped Workers\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Current law allows employers of service workers such as servers, bartenders and nail technicians to pay them as little as $6.25 an hour, as long as tips raise the workers’ pay to at least the regular minimum wage of $15. If they do not, employers must make up the difference. Question 5 would gradually eliminate the difference between tipped workers' minimum wage and the standard minimum wage.\n\nWhat's at stake: If the question passes, by Jan. 1, 2029, the statewide minimum wage would apply to all workers. The measure would also allow employers to pool tips to distribute to all their workers, as long as everyone on the payroll is paid the state minimum wage. Supporters of the ballot question say that tips should be a reward for good service, and not a subsidy for employers who pay less than minimum wage. The ballot question has been fiercely opposed by the restaurant industry, which warns passage will lead to higher menu prices for consumers, and will force restaurants to cut staff or even close.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who served as a CIA officer in Iraq and as a Pentagon official, faces Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who served seven two-year terms before leaving in 2015 and rose the rank of House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is one of a handful of open seats in the U.S. Senate, the result of Democratic U.S. Debbie Stabenow’s decision last year not to run for a fifth six-year term, so it could play into which party ends up with majority control of the chamber. Democrats (and the independents they caucus with) currently have a one-seat majority. No Republican has won a U.S. Senate election in Michigan since Spencer Abraham in the Republican wave of 1994. But with Michigan clearly in play as a presidential battleground, Republicans are hoping Rogers can ride what they are hoping is former President Donald Trump’s strength in a state he won in 2016 to a victory.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican former state Sen. Tom Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, faces former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., a member of a well-known Michigan political family who was a key aide to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Two years ago, Barrett lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in one of the most expensive House races in the nation in a redrawn district centered in and around Lansing, the state capitol. Slotkin is running for U.S. Senate this year and Barrett is back figuring that Hertel may be an easier opponent than his former rival who was known for raising scads of money and doing well in tossup districts like this one. Hertel, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on Barrett’s previous stance as an all-out abortion opponent, even though he says he will vote for anything that crosses protections put into the state constitution in 2022. With control of the U.S. House possibly in play, millions in outside spending have already poured into this race again.\n\nThe race: 8th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet faces Paul Junge, a former assistant prosecutor, TV anchor and official with the Homeland Security Department during the Trump administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Like the race in the 7th District, this is one which, if U.S. House races are close nationally, could determine which party holds majority control of the chamber. Right now, Republicans hold an eight-seat majority in the U.S. House. Even though this district, anchored by Flint, Bay City and Saginaw in mid-Michigan, has been trending more Republican in recent years, it was considered a likely Democratic hold until U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee last year announced he would leave at the end of this term, his sixth. KIldee’s late uncle, Rep. Dale Kildee, sat in the seat before him for 18 two-year terms.\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. John James, in his first term in Congress, faces a rematch with Carl Marlinga, a Democratic former Macomb County judge and prosecutor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This district, which includes much of southern Macomb County and parts of neighboring Oakland County, was widely seen as trending Republican when it was redrawn ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. As such, Democratic groups largely stayed away, figuring James, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot who had run two strong but ultimately unsuccessful U.S. Senate races, would easily win. It was anything but easy in the end: Marlinga, who has been in and around Macomb County politics for decades and presents himself as a pragmatist and a moderate Democrat, came within about one-half of 1% of beating James, despite being outspent by a 6-to-1 margin. James is running on his record, saying he has worked to bring projects back to the district; Marlinga, now with some Democratic support behind him, is trying to portray James’ conservativism as out of step with the district.\n\n— Detroit Free Press, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Minnesota House of Representatives District 14B\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, is looking to keep his seat in the Minnesota legislature, which he first won in 2018. He is being challenged by Republican Sue Ek, who previously ran for office in 2005.\n\nWhy it matters: The Minnesota statehouse is completely controlled by the DFL, which is Minnesota's Democratic party. Republicans are looking to flip the House to end the DFL trifecta, and St. Cloud is historically a political battleground, with some candidates in District 14A winning by fewer than 200 votes. Wolgamott came under fire last fall after he got a DWI. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent is labeled as extreme with her vocal opposition against same-sex marriage, contraceptives and abortion access. LGBTQ+ issues remain a hot topic in the state. The DFL trifecta passed a law banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth last legislative session. In addition, the state passed gender-affirming care legislation for minors.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seeking reelection. She is challenged by Republican Royce White, Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey and Libertarian Rebecca Whiting.\n\nWhat's at stake: Minnesota's U.S. Senate race is sparking a conversation about morals. White, a former NBA player, has been criticized for allegedly using past campaign funds at strip clubs. At a St. Cloud appearance, he told voters he is transphobic, alleged the \"woke left\" are trying to villainize Christians and said he's further right than former President Donald Trump. This in part caused former Republican, current Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey to run, saying conservatives needed another option. Despite the conversations, incumbent Klobuchar is polling significantly behind her 24-point margin of victory in 2018. Current 2024 polls show the Democratic senator having an 8- to 11-point lead.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic candidate Ty Pinkins, a Delta native, is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Pontotoc native who has been in office since 2008. If Pinkins' wins, he would be the first Democrat to occupy the office since John C. Stennis, who retired in 1989. While Pinkins' name became more common due to the 2023 Mississippi Secretary of State race in which Pinkins lost, he is polling at a mere 1% against Wicker.\n\nWhat's at stake: Pinkins' challenge to Wicker, if successful, would contribute to the Democratic defense of their majority in the U.S. Senate. A Pinkins victory would also take Mississippi's congressional ratio from five Republicans and one Democrat to four Republicans and two Democrats. While a Democratic win in this race is a long shot, how far Pinkins closes the 99-point gap with Wicker by Nov. 5 will be used as a starting line for future Democrats running for Mississippi's congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is running against Republican challenger Ron Eller, who has never won a political race. Thompson, who is favored to win, has been in office in Washington, D.C., since 1993 and has become something of an institution among national and state Democrats. Notably, Thompson has served as the chair of the Jan. 6 Investigative Committee, trying to unfold the chain of events surrounding a Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhat's at stake: Thompson is the only Democrat from Mississippi in the U.S. Congress right now and has been so since 2011. If he were to lose to Eller, the state's largest Black and Democratic district would go red and Mississippi would not be represented by any Democrat in Washington, D.C., if Republican U.S. Reps. Trent Kelly and Mike Ezell, and Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker don't lose to their respective races.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court Central District, Place 1\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Jim Kitchens faces a challenge from four opponents for one of the state's supreme court judge seats. Kitchens was appointed to his seat in 2009, and it is uncommon for a judge to win a seat as a challenger to incumbents in Mississippi, according to state election records.\n\nWhat's at stake: Of Kitchen's opponents, one, state Sen. Jenifer Branning, R-Philadelphia, has been endorsed by the Mississippi Republican Party. The race, as well as the Mississippi Supreme Court, is supposed to be nonpartisan. With an endorsement from the state GOP, a Branning victory could mean a more conservative lean on the court. Kitchens is listed as a nonpartisan candidate, as well as Ceola James and Byron Carter, who are also running in that race.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court District 2, Place 2\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Dawn Beam has served on the court since she was appointed by former Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016. She faces just one challenger, David Sullivan, a South Mississippi attorney.\n\nWhat's at stake: Like in other races this year, the Mississippi GOP has endorsed Beam to beat Sullivan, who himself has so far been outraising Beam for the court seat. Judge positions in Mississippi and judicial races are known for being nonpartisan. Considering the endorsement for Beam, a Sullivan victory could signify a political shift. It would also represent a break from how judges usually win a Supreme Court seat, which is to be appointed and then reelected as an incumbent.\n\n— The Clarion-Ledger, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 3, abortion rights\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A ballot initiative amending the state Constitution to establish a “right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” without government interference. While establishing a constitutional right to abortion, the amendment would still allow government regulation of the practice as well as restrictions on abortions that take place after fetal viability.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri was the first state to outlaw abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, enacting a trigger law passed in 2019. The heavily-funded effort to get the abortion rights initiative on the ballot has been opposed by Republican legislators and elected officials at every step, with the state Supreme Court weighing in at the 11th hour to keep it on the ballot.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is seeking a second term after flipping Missouri’s second Senate seat in 2018, when he defeated Democrat Claire McCaskill. Though polls still show Hawley favored to win, Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce, a former Marine, has closed the gap while significantly outperforming Hawley in fundraising. In addition, independent candidate Jared Young, who formed his own Better Party when establishing his candidacy, is running with the endorsement of former Republican Sen. Jack Danforth.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have established a significant advantage in Missouri over the past two decades and now control every statewide elected office, as well as both seats in the U.S. Senate. How competitive the race turns out to be is likely to highlight Hawley’s vulnerability as well as the effectiveness of Democrats’ strategy — Kunce is the second Missouri Democrat with a military background to run competitively for Senate. Young’s performance, meanwhile, could point to desire among moderates and conservatives for a return to a more balanced approach.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe faces Democrat Crystal Quade, who is termed out in the state House of Representatives, where she has served as minority floor leader.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri last elected a Democratic governor in 2012, when moderate Jay Nixon won a second term. In the years since, Republicans have taken every statewide office and hold supermajorities in the legislature. Kehoe, endorsed by outgoing Gov. Mike Parson, is heavily favored to win, but the race against Quade — a well-liked leader who has helped flip several seats for Democrats in conservative southwest Missouri — will show how much ground progressives need to make up to be competitive again. With abortion rights on the ballot and Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, conditions are as favorable as they’re likely to get for Quade to close the gap.\n\n— Amos Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate:\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is fighting for his fourth term against Republican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Sheehy currently leads by 7 points, according to RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Tester is one of the last remaining Democrats in a heavily Republican state. His loss could almost guarantee a GOP Senate majority. Despite trailing in the polls, Democrats are heavily investing in Tester’s campaign, with outside groups spending tens of millions of dollars. Native American voter turnout, which played a crucial role in Tester’s previous victories, could be a deciding factor. Sheehy's comments about Native Americans and questions about his past have provided Democrats with attack lines. The outcome will likely come down to turnout and the effectiveness of both candidates’ ground games.\n\nMore: These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House\n\nThe race: Montana's Second Congressional District\n\nWho's running: Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking reelection, facing Democrat Monica Tranel in a rematch from 2022. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and interior secretary under Donald Trump, won that race by 4 points. Tranel, a former Olympic rower and energy lawyer, is giving it another shot after her narrow loss.\n\nWhat's at stake: This race could play a key role in deciding control of the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Zinke has moved further to the right, aligning closely with Trump on issues like the border and \"cancel culture.\" Tranel, once a Republican herself, has positioned her campaign as a fight for accountability and transparency in government. The district includes both Democratic hubs like Missoula and Republican strongholds, making it a competitive battleground.\n\nThe race: Montana Supreme Court justices\n\nWho is running: Voters in Montana will elect two new justices to the state Supreme Court in 2024. The race for chief justice features Jerry Lynch, a former federal magistrate, and Cory Swanson, an attorney with military experience. For the associate justice position, Katherine M. Bidegaray, a district court judge and ranch owner, is running against Dan Wilson, a former justice of the peace.\n\nWhat's at stake: The upcoming election is crucial as it could shift the ideological balance of the Montana Supreme Court. Currently, the court has three liberal-leaning justices, two conservative-leaning justices, and two swing voters. If both conservative candidates win, the court may lean conservative for the first time in years. However, if at least one liberal candidate secures a seat, the court will maintain its existing balance. Partisan groups are already making endorsements: Democratic-aligned organizations support Lynch and Bidegaray, while Swanson and Wilson receive backing from prominent conservatives, including Gov. Greg Gianforte.\n\nThe race: Montana abortion access\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Montana voters will decide whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution. This measure seeks to protect a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling, which asserts that the right to privacy includes the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice.\n\nWhat's at stake: This initiative comes as Republican lawmakers have tried to overturn the Supreme Court ruling since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Montana Legislature passed a law in 2023 stating that the right to privacy does not safeguard abortion rights. Supporters collected over 81,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents attempted to block it. With abortion access becoming a hot button issue nationwide, the outcome in Montana could set a precedent for similar measures in other states.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Bacon is seeking a fifth term in a race against Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race between Bacon and Vargas is seen as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year and is being eyed by national Democrats as an opportunity to flip a Republican seat in its attempt to regain a majority in the House. Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District is deeply moderate and has gone for Bacon since 2016, despite flipping for President Joe Biden in 2020. Vargas ran against Bacon in 2022 and lost by nearly three points. Vargas has been polling just points ahead of Bacon in recent weeks and the Cook Political Report identified the race as a toss up in late September.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third six-year term against former union leader, steamfitter and independent candidate Dan Osborn.\n\nWhat’s at stake: A few months ago, the race appeared to clearly favor Fischer, who has broad financial and political backing in the deeply Republican state. That was the case until this summer, when polls conducted by Osborn’s campaign showed him and Fischer in a dead heat. Outside groups are pouring advertising money into both campaigns and the Cook Political Report recently changed the race’s leaning from solid-R to likely-R.\n\nThe race: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives: one aiming to expand abortion access in the state and the other looking to limit it.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While multiple states will see abortion on the ballot this election, Nebraska is the first since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to put competing measures before voters. One measure backed by Protect Our Rights, a coalition of reproductive rights groups in the state, aims to enshrine the right to abortion when it is “needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient,” as well extend abortion access up to fetal viability. However, it does not list a specific number of weeks. The other sponsored by Protect Women and Children would enshrine Nebraska’s current 12-week ban in the state Constitution with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman. It would allow the state legislature to pass narrower or complete bans in the future.\n\nThe race: Ballot measure on the legalization of medical cannabis\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Two measures aimed at legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Nebraska is one of the last states where the use of medical cannabis is still illegal. To combat Nebraska’s single-issue law, the group is sponsoring two separate measures. One would decriminalize the use of medical marijuana and create protections for patients and caregivers. The other would legalize possessing, manufacturing, distributing, delivering and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes and create a state commission to regulate the drug.\n\n— Maya Hoff, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Sam Brown\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats’ majority in the U.S. Senate is hanging by a thread, and Nevada’s seat up for election this year is considered competitive. Rosen, who prides herself on being one of Congress’ most bipartisan members, has an edge in the polls against Brown, an Army veteran who’s fully in former President Donald Trump’s camp. If Trump wins Nevada — the presidential race is within a single percentage point in the polls — his coattails could help Brown. In 2022, Catherine Cortez Masto — a well-liked incumbent Democrat with support from numerous prominent Republicans — won her U.S. Senate race by only about 8,000 votes. The Senate race may be a squeaker again.\n\nThe race: Ranked-choice voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A “yes” vote on the initiative would create primaries where the top five candidates regardless of party would move on to the general election.\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot race could upend Nevada politics for years to come by allowing nonpartisans — who outnumber Republicans and Democrats in the state — to participate in partisan primaries for state and federal races. Currently only Republicans and Democrats can vote in their own party’s primary races. Supporters think the initiative will create less extreme candidates because candidates will need to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, and they say voters will have more choice because often only the two candidates with the most money get on the November ballot. Opponents say it’ll create confusion and could diminish the chances of independent candidates who would now have to compete with major party candidates in primaries. Only three states currently have ranked-choice voting: Alaska, Maine and Hawaii.\n\nThe race: Washoe County Question 1 — library funding\n\nWhat’s the ballot: Continue a dedicated funding stream for the Washoe County Library System or give the county commission more oversight of library programs.\n\nWhat's at stake: As part of the culture wars in a swing county of a swing state, Reno-area libraries have been the scene of heated protests and increased security. Of the 22 book challenges last year in Nevada libraries — most of those over LGBTQ+ content — all were in Washoe County. This summer, the library system ended Drag Queen Story Hours at its libraries, citing “violence against staffers … perpetrated by a small group of very vocal, very aggressive protesters.” A Drag Queen Story Hour protester — Bruce Parks, chair of the Washoe County Republican Party — co-authored the official ballot argument against continuing the library’s dedicated funding stream. The dedicated funding stream represents about a quarter of the library system's budget. If the initiative fails, the library would have to appeal to elected officials to make up that shortfall.\n\n— Reno Gazette Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces Democrat former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in an open seat race to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been the state’s popular Republican governor for eight years.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats are hoping to take back the governor's office in New Hampshire for the first time since 2016. The most competitive governor’s race in the country, Ayotte benefits from name recognition, while Craig is bolstered by Vice President Kamala Harris’ popularity in the state. Ayotte’s poor relationship with Trump as well as his lack of popularity in the state means she will likely have to run far ahead of the former president to win the seat. She has also faced attacks on her past votes on abortion policies, while Craig has faced attacks over homelessness in Manchester. While the state has trended more Democratic in federal elections in recent years, the state government has been controlled by Republicans. Ayotte currently holds a narrow lead over Craig in the polls.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is seeking a fourth two-year term to represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District against Republican former New Hampshire Executive Councilor Russell Prescott.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District has historically been a swing district, the moderate Pappas has dominated in recent years, proving his ability to win over voters from both parties. It is currently rated likely Democratic by the Cook Political Report. But Prescott is a less pro-Trump Republican opponent than Pappas has faced in the past, and his supporters hope this will help him unseat the popular incumbent and allow Republicans to take one of the two congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Maggie Goodlander faces Republican Lily Tang Williams in this open race seat to replace retiring Rep. Annie Kuster.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This seat leans likely Democratic, but features two unique candidates. A political newcomer, Goodlander is a former senior White House aide in President Joe Biden’s administration as well as the wife of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. She won a hard-fought primary against Kuster’s endorsed successor, Colin Van Ostern, proving herself to be a savvy campaigner and fundraiser. She is favored over Lily Tang Williams, whose American dream-esque story of escaping communist China allowed her to emerge victorious from a field of 13 Republican candidates.\n\nThe race: New Hampshire Executive Council District 3\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent Executive Councilor is seeking a third term to represent the Seacoast of New Hampshire in the five-body Executive Council. She is being challenged by Democrat former state Sen. Jon Morgan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Hampshire’s little known Executive Council has been dominated by a Republican majority of 4-1 thanks to heavy gerrymandering and has faced controversy for the Republican’s repeated rejection of funding for Planned Parenthood and other reproductive clinics in the state that provide basic, low-cost reproductive health care. Stevens is favored to hold onto her seat in the Republican-leaning district, but Morgan’s record of winning in similar partisan districts means he could be a legitimate threat.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat, faces Republican Curtis Bashaw.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The contest will determine the future of the seat long held by former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was convicted on federal bribery charges earlier this year and resigned from the Senate. Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to fill the seat until a successor is elected. Bashaw, a Cape May hotelier and businessman who is gay, has framed his campaign around moderate Republican positions familiar to New Jersey voters. Bashaw is pro-choice and has made his focus on government accountability and lowering spending. Kim, who has served in Congress since 2018 and was a diplomat in the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, prevailed in a competitive primary in which he held off a challenge from New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy. Kim is focused on ensuring America’s global economic competitivesness and stabilizing affordability.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Faces Democrat Sue Altman\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Jersey’s sprawling 7th Congressional District is a microcosm of the Garden State itself and stretches across 95 municipalities in six diverse counties. The district includes urban, suburban and rural communities. Kean, first elected in 2022 after a career in the New Jersey Senate, is a moderate Republican who is focused on affordability and lowering government spending. Kean has endorsed former President Donald Trump. Altman, the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party, is running on a platform that espouses women's and reproductive rights, safeguarding democratic institutions and asserting America’s leadership on the world stage. The race is tight, but registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by more than 14,000.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New Jersey\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Gabe Vasquez faces Republican Yvette Herrell\n\nWhat’s at stake: As a result of redistricting in 2020, New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District stretches from its traditional boundaries encompassing the conservative southeastern part of the state to include portions of blue-leaning central and northern New Mexico. The seat has bounced back and forth between the parties since Republican Steve Pearce left it to seek election to the U.S. Senate, with Yvette Herrell gaining the seat in 2020 from Democrat Xotchitl Torres Small, who she challenged in 2018. Herrell then lost it in 2020 to Gabe Vasquez. Herrells’ loyalty to Trump is reflected in her stand on abortion and enthusiasm for domestic drilling of crude oil and natural gas resources, positions in direct opposition to the governor and majority Democratic state legislature.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Martin Heinrich faces Republican Nella Domenici\n\nWhat’s at stake: Martin Heinrich has been at the forefront of developing New Mexico’s green energy transition, committing federal funds to establish wind and solar farms. Nella Domenici, daughter of Pete Domenici, a Republican who held New Mexico’s Senate seat for six terms, is following in her father’s conservative footsteps. Domenici says New Mexico should trade on its position in the Permian Basin, one of the largest oil producing regions in the U.S.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in office since 2009, is seeking another six-year term against Mike Sapraicone, a Long Island resident who owns a private security company.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Gillibrand is widely favored to win, New York state has seen some shifts in places from blue to red. Her margin of victory and where her numbers might slip from the 2018 election will be telling about New York’s political trends.\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: New York has one statewide ballot question for voters to decide this fall: whether to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state Constitution. New York's would ban discrimination based on \"reproductive healthcare\" and a host of other reasons unrelated to abortion, such as sexual orientation, national origin and age.\n\nWhat’s at stake: At a time when such rights are under attack in much of the country, this ballot measure’s fate will be instructive.\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional district\n\nWho’s running: First-term Republican Rep. Mike Lawler faces former Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 17th Congressional District, one of the nation's most hotly contested swing districts — a seat Democrats lost in 2022 and need to recover to regain a House majority. Lawler eked out a narrow upset win in the suburbs north of New York City two years ago. If he retains his seat, that would reflect a reddening of these areas where residents have been concerned about immigration and crime. Jones is a former House member who saw his previous seat disappear in redistricting earlier this decade.\n\nThe race: 19th Congressional District\n\nWho’s running: Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro is seeking a second term in a rematch against Democratic challenger Josh Riley, former Dutchess County executive and a former state Assembly member.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In early autumn, this was the most expensive House race in the country, reflecting the importance of the seat in terms of which party will control Congress in 2025 and 2026.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New York\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Mark Robinson, the current Republican lieutenant governor, has caused shock waves in North Carolina and national politics for his incendiary comments, most recently after a CNN article alleged he made racist and sexual posts on a pornography message board, which he denies. Robinson, 56, is running against Josh Stein, the 58-year-old lawyer and current attorney general.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Abortion and education have become key aspects of this race. Although he’s flipped on his abortion stance, Robinson in the recent past has supported tighter restrictions. Stein is an outspoken reproductive rights supporter and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic. These candidates are also on opposite ends when it comes to funding education. Stein is fighting for fully funding public schools, and Robinson is supporting taxpayer funded private school vouchers. Robinson also used his time in office to investigate possible indoctrination of schools.\n\nThe race: Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nWho is running: Republican Michele Morrow is a former missionary and homeschool curriculum developer and nurse who is running against Democrat Maurice (Mo) Green, a previous superintendent of Guilford County Schools and general counsel and deputy superintendent for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Morrow, 53, has become a controversial candidate for her presence at the Jan. 6 riot and incendiary remarks posted on social media, recently posting on X that the “+” in LGBTQ+ stands for “Pedophilia.” Morrow supports private school vouchers and has said she wants an audit of federal money in North Carolina schools, claiming their money often comes with strings attached, WRAL reports. Green’s campaign has called Morrow a “dangerous” choice for students, and he supports fully funding public schools and rejects using taxpayer money for private school vouchers. Green, 56, also hopes to partner more with outside community organizations to support children's education.\n\nThe race: North Carolina Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs is looking to keep her seat on the state’s high court after Gov. Roy Cooper appointed Riggs, a Democrat, to fill former Justice Mike Morgan’s slot on the bench in 2023, following his retirement. She is running against Jefferson Griffin, a Republican on the state court of appeals.\n\nWhat's at stake: Republicans already hold a 5-2 majority on the state’s highest court, which in recent years has upheld gerrymandered maps that could give Republicans even greater control in the U.S. House. But if Riggs, a Democrat wins, her party will have the opportunity to regain that majority in 2028. Griffin is close with N.C. Supreme Court Justice Paul Newby. (Newby won his seat in 2020 by just 401 votes against Cheri Beasley.) So far this election, Griffin has raised $1.3 million, to Riggs’ $1.1 million.\n\nThe race: Buncombe County Board of Commissioners chair\n\nWho is running: Former Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan is running for chair of the county board of commissioners as an unaffiliated candidate. His opponent, Commissioner Amanda Edwards, a Democrat, faces a steep fundraising gap.\n\nWhat's at stake: Duncan, a former Democrat, is trying to toe the line between parties. But he’s received sizable campaign contributions from notable area Republicans like former Congressman Charles Taylor. Buncombe County is home to Asheville and was hard hit be Tropical Storm Helene. Whoever wins will likely play a major role in the county's Helene recovery efforts.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The measure creates a new chapter of the North Dakota Century Code related to the legalization of cannabis and related regulation, according to North Dakota’s Secretary of State website.\n\nWhat's at stake: If approved, it would allow for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis and the possession and use of various forms of cannabis by individuals who are 21 years of age and older. It would also allow the state to regulate the industry and preserve employer rights regarding the use of cannabis products by employees, among its provisions. The measure includes revenues of $10,227,600, expenses of $8,324,275, and “an undetermined amount of additional costs associated with behavioral health and social impacts for the 2025-2027 biennium,” the website states.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Michael (Coach) Coachman, an independent; Kelly Armstrong; a Republican; Merrill Piepkorn; a Democrat.\n\nWhat's at stake: North Dakota caught a bit of attention this election season, when current Gov. Doug Burgum ended up on the short-list as a vice-presidential candidate for former President Donald Trump. Last year, Burgum briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination and in January, he announced he would not seek a third term as governor, leaving the race wide open.\n\n— Shelly Conlon, Argus Leader, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican businessman Bernie Moreno\n\nWhat’s at stake: Brown is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this year − second only to Montana Sen. Jon Tester − and the outcome in Ohio could determine which party controls a closely divided U.S. Senate come January. Former President Donald Trump also won Ohio by 8 points in 2016 and 2020. Polls show Trump easily winning Ohio again. This is the first time Brown has been on the ballot the same day as Trump, who has endorsed Moreno.\n\nThe race: State Issue 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A group called Citizens Not Politicians crafted a new way to draw districts and put the constitutional amendment on the ballot as Issue 1.\n\nWhat's at stake: The proposal would replace the current politician-run commission with a 15-member citizen commission of five independents and five members each from the top two political parties, currently the Republicans and Democrats. Members couldn't be elected officials, lobbyists or political consultants. During the last redistricting cycle, lawmakers and elected officials repeatedly drew legislative maps deemed unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. Currently, Ohio Republicans dominate the redistricting process and hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate.\n\nThe race: 3 seats on the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: Cleveland Democrat Melody Stewart and Cincinnati Republican Joe Deters, both incumbent justices, are facing off. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Deters to an unexpired term but Deters decided to challenge Stewart for a full term. Cleveland Democrat Michael Donnelly, an incumbent, is being challenged by Cincinnati Republican Megan Shanahan, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge making her first statewide run. Cleveland Democrat Lisa Forbes, an 8th District Appellate Court judge, and Columbus Republican Dan Hawkins, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge, are both running for the seat left open by Deters' decision to challenge Stewart.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have held majority on the court for nearly 40 years. The Democrats are trying to reelect two incumbent justices and win an open seat. The GOP wants to expand its majority by sweeping all three races, which would give Republicans six of seven seats. Who controls the court has a major impact on issues including abortion and redistricting.\n\n— The Columbus Dispatch, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Oklahoma Corporation Commission\n\nWho is running: Republican Brian Bingman faces Democrat Harold Spradling and Libertarian Chad Williams in a race to replace outgoing Commissioner Bob Anthony. Bingman was the secretary of state until he stepped down last year to campaign for corporation commission.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The influential Corporation Commission regulates public utilities, oil, gas and other energy sources, commercial transportation and petroleum storage tanks. The three-person commission has been the subject of recent turmoil after witnesses reported seeing Commissioner Todd Hiett grope a man while Hiett was extremely intoxicated at a conference in June. Hiett has refused to step down, and Anthony launched an investigation into his colleague’s behavior. Anthony’s replacement will now help determine how the commission moves forward.\n\nThe race: State Question 834\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure put on the ballot by Republican lawmakers asks voters to tweak part of the state Constitution that defines who can vote as a “qualified elector.”\n\nWhat’s at stake: While only a few words would change, supporters say the move is needed to make clear only people who are legal citizens of the U.S. can vote in Oklahoma elections. Critics say the proposed change is targeting issues that don’t exist — routine audits of election results and voter rolls show the state’s election system is accurate and secure.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District, representing Oklahoma City and parts of central Oklahoma\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice faces a challenge from Democrat Madison Horn, a cybersecurity expert.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Oklahoma is a solidly red state, the metro area district Bice and Horn are vying to represent is turning purple. If voters send Horn to Washington, D.C., she would be the state’s lone Democratic representative in Congress. Her odds remain long, however. While Democrats are gaining ground in and around Oklahoma City, they’re still outnumbered by Republican voters. Republican incumbents are on track to retain Oklahoma’s four other seats in the U.S. House.\n\n— The Oklahoman, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Measure 118\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Measure 118, known as the Oregon Rebate, would raise the minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Oregonians will decide whether to raise the minimum tax rate by 3% for corporations with Oregon sales above $25 million a year and distribute the proceeds to every Oregonian, beginning in 2025. Passage would make Oregon the first state with a universal basic income program. State analysts estimate the measure would increase corporate tax revenue by $1.3 billion during Oregon’s two-year budget cycle. Proponents say the measure would decrease the state poverty rate by “rebating” some $1,600 a year to every resident. Opponents say the measure would result in increased costs and loss of businesses.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Janelle Bynum is challenging incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez DeRemer, R-Oregon.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In 2022, Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in the U.S. House. Bynum twice beat Chavez-DeRemer for the Oregon legislature and seeks to flip the seat. Polls have designated the race as a “toss-up.”\n\nThe race: Oregon attorney general\n\nWho is running: Republican Will Lathrop and Democrat Dan Rayfield\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Oregon’s first attorney general election since the state’s 2020 drug decriminalization measure was passed and later dismantled. Lathrop previously served as a deputy district attorney in Yamhill and Marion counties, while Rayfield has been a member of Oregon’s House of Representatives since 2015 and served as speaker of the House from February 2022 until the end of the 2024 legislative session. Democrat Ellen Rosenblum, who has been attorney general since 2012, announced her retirement in 2023. With more than $2 million in combined spending, the race is the most expensive of Oregon’s three statewide elections. Oregon’s last Republican attorney general left office in 1993.\n\nThe races: Mayor of Portland and Portland city councilors\n\nWho is running: There are 19 people running for mayor, including three city commissioners, a trucking company leader, a stripper/author, and a nonprofit director. Ninety-eight candidates are running for 12 Portland City Council seats.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 2024 election will be the first using ranked-choice voting for the mayoral, auditor and city council races in Portland, Oregon's largest city. The new Portland mayor also will have a new job description. A voter-approved change in 2022 means the mayor will not have a vote on the Portland City Council unless there is a tie and will mostly serve in an administrative role.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey is vying for his fourth term against Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO and high-ranking Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The Pennsylvania Senate seat is a must-win for Democrats seeking to retain control of the upper chamber, which they hold by a razor-thin margin. Casey, a fixture in Pennsylvania politics, has breezed through his past reelection battles. But McCormick does have the advantage of voter discontent with President Joe Biden and has worked hard to implicate Casey in the Democratic administration's perceived shortcomings on immigration and the economy. While the incumbent is favored, the race has narrowed, and a handful of polls show the two candidates locked in a dead heat.\n\n— Bethany Rodgers, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Six-term incumbent Republican Scott Perry is facing perhaps his strongest opponent so far, Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson, a popular former TV news anchor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Control of the U.S. House could be on the ballot in this race. Perry, a former chair of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has not faced strong opposition during his tenure in Congress in a conservative district. But Stelson, a Republican turned Democrat, has hammered Perry for his positions on reproductive rights and has cast the election as a choice between anti-democratic views and her commitment to democracy. Perry was on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s fight to overturn the 2020 election, an effort that led the U.S. Justice Department to launch an investigation and seize Perry’s cell phone via a search warrant. That investigation has not resulted in any charges, and Perry has denied any wrongdoing. Political observers predict a close race in a district that became more competitive after the most recent redistricting. Polls show the race in a dead heat.\n\n— Mike Argento, York Daily Record, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is seeking a fifth term against Army veteran and Apache helicopter pilot Ashley Ehasz, who lost against Fitzpatrick in 2022 but now has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a “top-tier candidate” to flip a longtime red district in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nWhat's at stake: The 1st District is one of 33 congressional races the DCCC has highlighted in its Red to Blue campaign to maintain or bolster control of the House. The southeastern Pennsylvania district has been under Republican leadership since 2011, with Fitzpatrick cementing a reputation as the most bipartisan member of congress. Ehasz’s campaign has pushed back on that neutral image, saying the incumbent’s bipartisanship won’t extend to reproductive rights and threats to democracy.\n\n— Chris Ullery, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: Pennsylvania Senate, 49th District\n\nWho is running: Two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Dan Laughlin faces a challenge from the former chair of the Erie County Democratic Party Jim Wertz, a first-time candidate.\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats see district, which covers nearly all of Erie County, as being among the seats they can flip to take over the state Senate. Laughlin and Wertz, who used to trade emails about politics, also are engaged in a civil lawsuit. Laughlin claims the weekly Erie Reader and Wertz defamed him by publishing an opinion piece by Wertz — who was a contributing editor and writer for the publication before his state Senate bid — that accused Laughlin and U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of seeking a pardon over the 2020 election. Laughlin had signed an amicus brief that specifically stated it was not taking the side of either the plaintiff or the defendant in the case Texas v. Pennsylvania, which was a hail-Mary attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election.\n\n— Matthew Rink, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is seeking a fourth term against Republican state legislator Patricia Morgan, who lists her occupation as \"financial advisor.\"\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whitehouse, 68, a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island attorney general, has been in the Senate since 2007, after he ousted Republican Lincoln Chafee. He is known for warning about the perils of climate change and \"dark money\" in campaign finances. Whitehouse was named Senate Budget Committee chair last year and turned much of its focus toward climate issues. More recently, he’s been one of the louder voices in Washington on term limits for the U.S. Supreme Court. Morgan is a former state Republican chair, House minority leader – and unsuccessful 2018 primary candidate for governor – who has served in the legislature off and on for 12 years. She has attacked Whitehouse for supporting President Joe Biden on immigration and federal spending, among other issues. In announcing her candidacy, she took aim at inflation, the economy and \"massive and wasteful federal spending.\"\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Question 1 will determine whether there will be a constitutional convention\n\nWhat’s at stake: If voters approve Question 1 on Nov. 5 there will be an election to choose 75 delegates who will meet at a time and place to be determined to recommend amendments to the state Constitution that would be put up for approval at another statewide election. The last time voters called for a convention was 1984, and past conventions have taken on many shapes and sizes, from the 1973 convening that lasted a month to the 1964 affair that lasted four years. The last one cost taxpayers $891,000, or about $2.5 million in today's money.\n\n— Providence Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposed constitutional amendment on voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: South Carolina voters will see a proposed amendment to section 4 of Article II of the state Constitution reading “Must Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of this State, relating to voter qualifications, be amended so as to provide that only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law?”\n\nWhat’s at stake: The proposed change would alter one word of the state Constitution to have it read “only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law.” Although an investigation found no noncitizens were voting in the state’s elections, lawmaker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/10/politics/nuclear-option-senate-filibuster", "title": "What's the nuclear option in the Senate? | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nAs Democrats push to pass voting rights legislation through Congress, there’s been talk of using a process known as the “nuclear option.”\n\nIt’s an overheated phrase that boils down to changing Senate rules to pass legislation with a simple majority.\n\nSenators need 60 votes to do just about anything in the Senate but change the rules. That takes only 51 votes.\n\nNuclear? That sounds harsh for something as simple as a rule change.\n\nSenators view themselves as being part of the “world’s greatest deliberative body.” It’s a debatable point, but in order to protect the minority party and make sure nobody does anything without a full debate, Senate rules require that 60 of 100 senators agree to votes to move toward passing legislation. In the fancy language they speak on Capitol Hill, limiting debate and moving toward a vote is called “invoking cloture.”\n\nActually passing the legislation takes only 51 votes, but because of the procedural rules, it takes 60 to invoke cloture and get to the actual vote. By requiring only 51 votes to limit debate, the entire character of the chamber would change. Instead of being forced to get buy-in from the minority party – Republicans right now – the majority party would be able to pass anything for which it could get a simple majority.\n\nThe idea is that it would figuratively “blow up” the Senate. For now, a simple majority Senate excites many Democrats who want to pass more legislation. It frightens Republicans whose strategy is to grind things on Capitol Hill to a halt.\n\nThe symbolism of “going nuclear” portends a sort of mutually assured destruction in the future, to borrow another Cold War term. Democrats won’t always control the Senate. And when Republicans are in charge, you can bet they’ll return the favor.\n\nHas this kind of rule change ever happened before?\n\nYes. We’re already living in a post-nuclear option world when it comes to presidential nominees.\n\nMost judicial and executive branch nominees used to require 60 votes to invoke cloture. Democrats changed the rules to require only a simple majority to get votes on most nominees during the Obama administration. Republicans changed the rules for Supreme Court nominees during the Trump administration.\n\nIs all of this constitutional?\n\nSure is. The Constitution doesn’t say anything about Senate rules. It puts that power in the hands of senators.\n\n“Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings,” according to Article 1, Section 5.\n\nSenators are tasked with signing off on nominees in Article 2, Section 2. But it doesn’t say how, exactly, which has led to a centuries-long debate on the matter.\n\nHere’s what the Constitution says about the president’s power to appoint: “He shall have Power … with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.”\n\nWhere does the 60-vote threshold come from?\n\nIt’s in the Senate rules. Read the chapter on cloture.\n\nBut the rules have changed over time. Until 1949, for instance, according to the Congressional Research Service, senators couldn’t even move to limit debate (invoke cloture) on nominations.\n\nAccording to the Senate website, Henry Clay was the first senator to threaten going nuclear on legislation, back in 1841. Up until 1975, it actually took 67 votes to overcome a filibuster.\n\nThe most famous examples came during the civil rights era, when Southerners from both parties blocked equal rights legislation. It took 60 days of filibustering to find the votes for the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nWhat role does actual filibustering play in all this?\n\nEverybody seems to have a different definition of what a filibuster is. In pop culture, filibustering brings to mind Jimmy Stewart in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” speaking for hours to block legislation with which he disagrees.\n\nThese days, the filibuster is an implied thing. When everybody realizes that there aren’t 60 votes to limit debate, senators don’t generally spend much time debating at all. They just move on. When a senator mounts an all-night speech, the outcome is usually preordained.\n\nIf rules are changed and it requires only a simple majority to limit debate, Republicans will still have delaying tactics to use. They simply would not be able to block most votes altogether.\n\nWhy is all this coming to a head now?\n\nMore and more Democrats support doing away with the filibuster, at least in some circumstances. Already, most major legislation – tax cuts during the Trump administration and health care during the Obama administration – required finding a way around filibuster rules. In those two cases, party leaders exploited budget rules.\n\nBut that’s an imperfect solution and would not work for voting rights, the issue over which most Democrats argue it’s worth changing rules.\n\nRELATED: Why Democrats want to change the Senate’s filibuster rules\n\nDemocrats want to impose new national rules to protect the rights of voters as Republicans in key states scramble to limit access to mail-in voting and otherwise make it more difficult to cast a ballot.\n\nBut the consequences of going nuclear would extend beyond voting rights. You can’t go back from the nuclear option. That’s why more moderate Democrats, like Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, aren’t yet on board with pushing the nuclear button.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe most urgent policy change needed to help dismantle racism in 2022 and going forward is ending the largely unchecked voter suppression that has targeted Black and low-income voters since the 2013 Shelby v. Holder Supreme Court decision gutted section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which expressly prevented states from enacting punitive voting laws that disproportionately disenfranchise historically marginalized groups.\n\nPeniel Joseph. Kelvin Ma/Tufts University\n\nThat’s the message of the latest “State of Black America” report from the National Urban League, an annual assessment of the progress and challenges of securing Black citizenship and dignity. The title of this year’s edition, “Under Siege: The Plot to Destroy Democracy,” reflects its sobering – and accurate – portrait of the health of American democracy.\n\nThe report found that Black Americans, according to an “Equality Index” that reveals disparities for Black Americans relative to Whites in economic opportunity, education, health, social justice and civic engagement, received a score of 73.9% – up 0.2 % from a year ago but well short of the 100% goal of a nation where racial equality is the norm. “The Equality Index is an aggregate analysis of centuries of structural racism that can be a starting point to crafting policy to dismantle anti-Black racism in America,” the report’s authors observed.\n\n“Under Siege” outlines the four tools being weaponized against Black voters: gerrymandering, voter suppression, election sabotage and intimidation.\n\nGerrymandering is the practice of drawing congressional district lines for partisan advantage. In states like Texas and North Carolina this has meant that Republicans have been able to decrease Black congressional representation through gerrymandering despite an increase in the overall population of people of color. The GOP-controlled Florida legislature this week adopted Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’s proposed congressional map that would add four seats likely to go to Republicans, do away with districts now represented by two of the state’s Black US House members and potentially prompt a federal court challenge to the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAccording to the report, last year 19 states passed 34 voter suppression bills making it harder to vote, policies that hamper Black representation already dwindling because of gerrymandering. In 2022, 18 states have pursued 152 voter restriction bills. The bulk of these bills enforce strict voter ID laws, purge voter rolls, reduce access to mail-in ballots, eliminate providing water and snacks to voters waiting in long lines, limit early voting and make the entire process more difficult.\n\nElection sabotage – efforts to discredit legitimate votes or empower partisan officials to reject or overturn votes – has since 2020 been fueled at the national level by former President Donald Trump and his allies promulgating the “Stop the Steal” falsehood, and those attempts have seeped into state and local election bureaucracy. Multiple states have introduced legislation that would allow elected officials to disregard the will of voters and authorize undemocratic results based on their party affiliation.\n\nSuccessful campaigns to sow doubt about election security have placed local elected officials, often volunteers performing their civic duty, under undue pressure and – as the report details, many have experienced threats of violence and worse.\n\nFully understanding the report’s findings requires historical context, because we have been here before. Much of the contemporary GOP voter suppression efforts echo the actions of the Reconstruction-era Democratic Party, which used voter intimidation, fraud, conspiracy theories and naked violence to marginalize increasing majorities of Black voters in the decades immediately after the end of racial slavery in 1865.\n\nBy the early 20th century, virtually no Black elected officials represented the South at the federal level, and local politics shut them out completely. For almost a century, Black people lived under one-party rule in the South, a pattern that threatens to be repeated in perpetuity if the current situation continues.\n\nThe National Urban League’s “State of Black America” is, at its core, a warning of the perils of failing to address the steady erosion of democratic norms in America. Even after the departure of Donald Trump, this trend imperils the future of liberalism, democracy and capitalism – at home and around the world.\n\nThe open commitment among some in the GOP to anti-democratic authoritarianism (and the sympathy or silence on the matter by other Republicans), which many hoped might end after Trump was voted out of office, continues to flourish. Just witness the unwillingness by conservative media outlets to criticize Putin in the weeks leading up to the Russian invasion.\n\nThe longtime flirting with autocratic strongmen leaders in Hungary, Brazil and Russia by conservatives is more than just a troubling sign of the times. It betrays the fundamental precepts of a liberal democracy. The Putin Wing of the Republican Party is a crisis in the making, with devastating possible consequences around the world.\n\nThe political drift that has found some conservatives expressing sympathy for authoritarians such as Putin and Hungary’s Viktor Orban has added to the growing crisis of relevancy facing liberal democracy on the world stage.\n\nBut it does not have to be this way.\n\nAmerica can still be a beacon for liberal democracy at home and abroad by seeking to fundamentally protect the right to vote of all Americans. Black folks have always been the canary in the coal mine in this nation. During times of war and economic depression, the hardships and miseries confront those most vulnerable first. Black America remains, as the Urban League report demonstrates, more likely to suffer lack of access to health care, high quality schools and good jobs.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. characterized the nation’s belief in freedom as “great wells of democracy” first dug by founders and successively deepened and expanded upon generationally. We face a similar fight to the one King successfully waged with the help of President Lyndon Johnson and millions of ordinary citizens at home and around the world. How are we to claim to be the world’s more important and enduring democracy around the world and yet fail to safeguard the sacred right to vote for our citizens at home?\n\nWe can start by choosing country over party and passing the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The chance of this legislation passing in the near term depends less on the outcome of this year’s midterms (where Democrats are expected to lose their majority in the House of Representatives) and more likely on the 2024 election. Democrats should remind voters at every opportunity of what is at stake on the ballot during the upcoming midterms.\n\nRepublicans who are good faith political actors (in contrast to bad faith political actors who celebrate the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday while refusing to support voting rights) should join together with Democrats to pursue a halt to voter suppression.\n\nThat toxic political weapon, although used most against the Black community as shown by the Urban League’s report, in reality threatens to upend the entire fabric of the freedoms long enjoyed by so many and earned by the generations of sacrifice Americans celebrate to this day.

It could also be the clearest test of whether national Democrats’ decision to pump money into ads in GOP primaries elevating candidates the party views as unelectable – including John Gibbs, an official in Donald Trump’s administration who has backed the former President’s lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election, in this district – will backfire. Democrats, whose narrow House majority is on the line, are already facing historic headwinds and economic factors that could tilt competitive races in the GOP’s favor.\n\nFreshman Rep. Peter Meijer, one of the 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach Trump in the wake of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, was seeking a second term in the Grand Rapids-based district.\n\nBut Trump, who has spent much of 2022 seeking political retribution against those Republicans, endorsed Gibbs. And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee – expecting that Gibbs would be easier to defeat in what, after last year’s redistricting process, now looks like a battleground district – spent $450,000 on television advertising labeling him “too conservative.”\n\nIt might have been the difference: Gibbs defeated Meijer by 3.6 percentage points, less than 4,000 votes. He is now taking on Democrat Hillary Scholten, an attorney, in the general election.\n\n“I understand the strategy,” Davis said. “I think Gibbs is a much weaker candidate, and … Pete Meijer is someone that’s in the community, he’s someone that you see around – like, his family has done like a lot for this community. So, like, the strategy is not something I would have spent money on. But like, tactically, I guess I get it.”\n\nThere is no evidence in the district of backlash against Scholten over her national party’s tactics in the race. But some Democratic-leaning voters’ discomfort with the DCCC’s approach underscores why Meijer was broadly seen as poised to win re-election if he survived the GOP primary.\n\n“It bothered me, and I know it bothered others,” said Ruth Kelly, a retired teacher and former Grand Rapids city commissioner. “I just think, you know, Peter Meijer had a lot to offer here. However, I’m still really excited about Hillary.”\n\n“They had to make some choices, some very difficult choices, and I disagree with that,” Janice Lanting, a retired teacher from Grand Rapids, said of national Democrats’ involvement in the race. “But I guess I’m not the one to make decisions, and we just want Hillary to do well in the polls.”\n\n‘Risky and unethical’\n\nMichigan’s 3rd District offered a window into a strategy Democratic political groups employed across the map. Democrats also pumped money into similar ads temporarily boosting what would become winning candidates in gubernatorial primaries in Illinois, Maryland and Pennsylvania, as well as House and Senate primaries in New Hampshire.\n\nThe practice helped elevate a series of election deniers in key races in November’s midterm elections. Democratic officials have defended the practice, arguing that it is the most effective way of defeating GOP candidates. But some in the party have warned that helping Republicans who have attempted to erode Americans’ faith in its election system – particularly at the cost of helping the GOP purge figures such as Meijer, who sided with Democrats on Trump’s impeachment – could have serious consequences.\n\n“These destructive primary tactics aim to elevate Republican candidates who Democrats hope they can more easily beat in November,” former Indiana Rep. Tim Roemer wrote in an August letter signed by 35 former Democratic lawmakers criticizing the party’s strategy. “But it is risky and unethical to promote any candidate whose campaign is based on eroding trust in our elections. We must stop this practice, and stop today.”\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, one of two Republicans on the largely Democratic House panel investigating the insurrection, said the DCCC’s actions in Michigan were “terrible.”\n\n“All of us, again, across party lines, have got to make sure that we are supporting people who believe fundamentally in our democratic system,” she said. “And so I think that it’s inexplicable and wrong for the Democrats to be funding election deniers, particularly against one of the 10 Republicans who so bravely stood up and did the right thing.”\n\nMeijer said on CNN in the days after the election that that Democrats’ tactic in the Michigan 3rd District primary showed that “there is no incentive to try to be a productive member” of Congress while working in Washington, and that “it all will come down to partisan benefit no matter what the consequence.”\n\n“Any party that pretends to have a set of principles, any party that pretends to have a set of values and that comes in and boosts exactly the same type of candidate that they claim is … a threat to democracy, don’t expect to be able to hold on to that sense of self-righteousness and sanctimony,” Meijer said.\n\n‘A much better opponent’\n\nIn Michigan, Scholten said she does not see Gibbs as necessarily being easier to defeat than Meijer would have been.\n\n“At the end of the day, Republicans decided who their standard bearer was going to be in this race, and they chose Mr. Gibbs. The voters came out, and they elected Mr. Gibbs, and national Republicans wanted him too,” she said in an interview with CNN. “You know, they didn’t spend a dime to try to support Peter Meijer or to keep Mr. Gibbs out of this race.”\n\nGibbs, meanwhile, has tapped into a Republican base that remains energized by Trump and the former President’s lies about election fraud. He campaigned in recent days alongside GOP gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon, the former President’s son Donald Trump Jr. and former top Trump White House aide Kellyanne Conway.\n\n“My opponent’s name happens to be Hillary. And no matter what, not another Hillary,” Gibbs said recently at an event held by the Muskegon County GOP, to cheers from the crowd.\n\n“I’m losing the country I grew up in. It’s crazy to see what’s happening, but we got to take it back,” he said.\n\nHe called the race a “civilizational fight.”\n\n“This is a big deal, we got to let them know that they’re not going to take us down a path of China, North Korea, Iran, whatever it might be, whatever it might be. We are a free country, we have to remain that way,” Gibbs said.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Scholten believes the stakes are similar.\n\n“This election is a referendum on our democratic ideals as a state and as a nation,” she told CNN. “There is nothing easy about this race, let me tell you, this is going to be a fight to the finish.”\n\nGibbs, who worked in Trump’s administration, has wrongly called the results of the 2020 election “mathematically impossible.” He is also under fire after CNN reported that he wrote as a college student in the early 2000s that the United States has “suffered as a result of women’s suffrage.” He’s insisted the writings were satirical.\n\nWhile Democratic voters fretted about the consequences of helping elevate Gibbs in the primary, some Republican voters said they saw him as the better candidate for November’s general election.\n\nVicki Ware, a Republican from Norton Shores, said she believes Gibbs is a stronger candidate than Meijer was. She said Meijer had betrayed the GOP by voting to impeach Trump, and that she wants to see Trump run for president again.\n\n“Everyone knew, obviously, that Peter Meijer was a RINO,” Ware said, using an acronym that refers to the phrase “Republican in name only.” “He got into office promising one thing and then completely flipped and so everybody wanted him out, and John Gibbs is the person that beat him and can win.”\n\nDiana Blais, a retiree from Muskegon, said Meijer “was not a good fit for Michigan” and that Gibbs is, in her view, “going to be a much better opponent” against Scholten.\n\n“I think just because his values line up with what we’re looking to gain back again – that we’ve, you know, been under attack by this administration in a lot of different ways; our freedoms are being taken away, kind of slowly but surely, they have been,” Blais said. “And he’s going to help get us lined back up again.”", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Omar Jimenez Donald Judd", "Eric Bradner", "Omar Jimenez", "Donald Judd"], "publish_date": "2022/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/25/partisan-gerrymandering-redistricting-supreme-court-congress-election-maryland-north-carolina/3132895002/", "title": "Gerrymandering: Voting rights and redistricting for elections collide ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – The extreme partisanship gripping American politics could be reduced by two landmark cases coming to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, and Chief Justice John Roberts looms as the deciding vote.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, the high court is considering something it has never done before: declaring as unconstitutional election maps drawn blatantly by state legislators to gain partisan advantage.\n\nOn the chopping block will be congressional districts set by North Carolina Republicans and Maryland Democrats to give their candidates an overwhelming advantage during the past decade.\n\nMore broadly, what's at stake is the way state and congressional election districts are redrawn once every decade in most states – a system dominated by political self-interest that grows more intense every time the Supreme Court declines to tame it. If the justices fail to act, election districts drawn after the 2020 census could be even more extreme, leading to more lopsided elections and more ideological gridlock in Congress.\n\nThe court has declined to intervene five times, most recently last year, when the justices refused to decide challenges in Wisconsin and Maryland. Opponents of partisan gerrymandering hope the sixth time will be the charm, but the court's conservative majority stands in the way.\n\nOr does it?\n\nSince the high court took on a more contentious political air during last fall's confirmation of Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Roberts has sided with liberal justices in several cases that would have drawn attention to the court's 5-4 divide between conservatives and liberals. Those included abortion-related cases from Louisiana and Kansas, religious liberty cases from California and New Jersey, and death penalty cases from Texas and Alabama.\n\nNone of those is as consequential as the gerrymandering cases to be heard Tuesday.\n\nIf the Supreme Court decides the congressional maps in either North Carolina or Maryland violate the Constitution by relegating some voters into irrelevance, it could signal a sea change in the way legislatures controlled by one party have tried to rig the map-making process.\n\n“Our hope is that there is a concern about basic fairness,\" says Dan Vicuña, national redistricting manager at Common Cause, which is challenging the North Carolina map. \"Either side of the political aisle can be the victim of this.”\n\nLike a 'Globetrotters game'\n\nFor the past decade, Democrats have been hurt by gerrymandering the most. Republicans seized power in many states in the 2010 midterm elections, giving them control over the redistricting process. Democrats are at a disadvantage entering the 2020 elections, which will determine who draws the next decade's state and congressional lines in most states.\n\n\"Where extreme partisan gerrymandering exists, district lines are drawn in a manner that ensures that all seats remain safe,\" former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, both Republicans, argue in court papers. \"In such districts, elections are as predictable as a Harlem Globetrotters game.\"\n\nThat's not always the case. When state legislative power is shared – or in eight states, including California, where the process is governed by a commission – the maps often are drawn fairly.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled on multiple occasions that race cannot be a major factor in the way district lines are drawn, but it has yet to set a standard for how much politics is too much. The court's more conservative justices have been reluctant to choose political winners and losers.\n\nLast year, the court sidestepped the issue, sending cases from Wisconsin and Maryland back to lower courts for further review. The justices said challengers to the design of 99 state Assembly districts in Wisconsin could not tackle the entire map at once but must target specific districts. They said challengers to Maryland's congressional map did not merit an immediate fix because they had waited six years to bring their claim.\n\nThough she concurred in that ruling, Associate Justice Elena Kagan warned that something must be done to curb Democrats' and Republicans' political instincts when drawing districts.\n\n\"The 2010 redistricting cycle produced some of the worst partisan gerrymanders on record,\" she said. \"The technology will only get better, so the 2020 cycle will only get worse.\"\n\nRepublicans 10-3, Democrats 7-1\n\nNorth Carolina's congressional map looms as the freshest test. The facts aren't even in dispute: Lawmakers in the relatively \"purple\" state, where the statewide congressional vote swings back and forth between Democrats and Republicans, declared their intentions on camera.\n\n\"We want to make clear that to the extent we are going to use political data in drawing this map, it is to gain partisan advantage,” state Republican Rep. David Lewis said. He proposed a 10-3 edge for Republicans \"because I do not believe it’s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.”\n\nTo achieve that goal, the map packed Democrats into three districts and spread them among the other 10. In one glaring example, it split North Carolina A&T State University, the nation's largest historically black college, between the 6th and 13th Congressional Districts, ensuring that most students would vote for losing candidates.\n\n“The North Carolina case is about as extreme as you’re ever going to get,” says Paul Smith, one of the lawyers representing the League of Women Voters in the case.\n\nThe Maryland map returning to the high court was drawn by the Legislature's Democratic majority to give it seven of the state's eight congressional seats. The battle is over one district that was redesigned in 2012 to oust a GOP incumbent.\n\nThat rural 6th District is home to 40 miles of the Appalachian Trail, but it was stretched to include wealthy suburbs of Washington. Heading into the 2010 elections, it had nearly 50,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats. Two years later, the reverse was true.\n\nRoberts, who lives in nearby Chevy Chase, drew attention to the lengthy stretch during oral argument last year. \"Part of the issue here is you have people from, you know, Potomac joined with people from the far west panhandle,\" he said. \"I mean, they both have farms but the former, hobby farms. ... The others are real farms.\"\n\nYet when the time came to render a verdict in the Wisconsin case, the chief justice said it wasn't the court's job to police partisanship.\n\n\"This court is not responsible for vindicating generalized partisan preferences,\" Roberts wrote. \"The court's constitutionally prescribed role is to vindicate the individual rights of the people appearing before it.\"\n\n'Looking for a way out'\n\nDuring last year's cases, Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy was the swing vote. He has since retired, and all eyes now are on Roberts.\n\nIn a case upholding the rights of major campaign donors in 2014, the chief justice wrote, \"There is no right more basic in our democracy than the right to participate in electing our political leaders.\"\n\nChallengers to the North Carolina and Maryland congressional lines say that right effectively is taken away when voters are placed in districts where the weight of their vote is diluted. They hope Roberts wants to avoid a 5-4 ruling in which all the majority votes come from Republican presidents' nominees, which has happened only once this term.\n\n“I think the chief justice is keenly aware of these political overtones and will want to say ... this is an equal opportunity offense,\" says Michael Kimberly, who represents the Maryland challengers. \"This is not about picking one party over the other.”\n\nRoberts may be inclined to render a minimalist decision that leaves most of the heavy lifting to Congress and the states. The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation this month that would give the power to draw congressional maps to independent commissions – something Colorado, Michigan and Missouri voters approved in November.\n\n\"The democratic process is actively engaged in this,\" says Misha Tseytlin, a former Wisconsin solicitor general who filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of members of Congress from North Carolina. \"The value of democracy is allowing the people to solve their own problems.”\n\nFormer U.S. solicitor general Paul Clement, who will argue the case for North Carolina lawmakers, says in court papers that \"courts simply do not have any business making value-laden judgments about how much politics is too much in a process that will never be free of politics.\"\n\nWhatever the court decides could affect several other states with lawsuits pending, including Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. Last year, the justices let stand the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision striking down that state's congressional map and replacing it with one that helped Democrats win more seats in November.\n\nIf the justices strike down the North Carolina or Maryland maps, \"every single map in the country is going to be subject to this kind of attack,\" warns Jason Torchinsky, who argued against that result in court papers on behalf of the Republican National Committee.\n\n“I believe Roberts is looking for a way to get the court out of these questions,” he says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/politics/mike-lee-chip-roy-text-messages-jan-6-mark-meadows-overturn-election", "title": "CNN Exclusive: 'We need ammo.

Mike Lee of Utah and GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. The text exchanges show that both members of Congress initially supported legal challenges to the election but ultimately came to sour on the effort and the tactics deployed by Trump and his team.\n\n“We’re driving a stake in the heart of the federal republic,” Roy texted Meadows on January 1. That text was first released in December by the House select committee and described as being written by a House Freedom Caucus member. Roy’s authorship has not been previously reported.\n\nWhen situated in the overall timeline of events between the election and January 6, the series of texts from Lee and Roy provide new details about how two Trump allies went from fierce advocates of the former President’s push to overturn Joe Biden’s win to disheartened bystanders. By January 3, Lee was texting Meadows that the effort “could all backfire badly.”\n\nBut shortly after the election, both men were encouraging Trump to keep fighting.\n\nSen. Mike Lee speaks about a bill to end the US support for the war in Yemen on December 13, 2018. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nIn a series of texts to Meadows on November 7, Lee offered his “unequivocal support for you to exhaust every legal and constitutional remedy at your disposal to restore Americans faith in our elections.”\n\nLee went on: “This fight is about the fundamental fairness and integrity of our election system. The nation is depending upon your continued resolve. Stay strong and keep fighting Mr. President.”\n\nAlso on November 7, Roy wrote to Meadows, “We need ammo. We need fraud examples. We need it this weekend.”\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Lee’s communications director, Lee Lonsberry, said, “I’d like to highlight that Senator Lee has been fully transparent,” pointing to how Lee had called for an investigation into claims of fraud in the 2020 election but ultimately recognized Biden as president-elect and voted to certify the electoral results on January 6.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Liz Cheney responds to NYT report on possible criminal referral for Trump 02:46 - Source: CNN Liz Cheney responds to NYT report on possible criminal referral for Trump 02:46\n\nRoy Communications Director Nate Madden told CNN the text messages “speak for themselves.”\n\nIn a tweet on Friday, Roy wrote: “Been off social media this Good Friday, but apparently there’s quite a stir. I’ll say this once. No apologies for my private texts or public positions – to those on the left or right. I stand behind seeking truth, fighting nonsense, & then acting in defense of the Constitution.”\n\nAn attorney for Meadows did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for the select committee declined to comment.\n\nA source familiar with the committee’s work tells CNN that Lee’s texts “reflect he was a cheerleader before he was against it. He uses legal language to push blatant conspiracy theorists into the Trump orbit.”\n\n‘Can you help her get in?’\n\nOver a few days in November, Lee lobbied Meadows to get attorney Sidney Powell access to Trump.\n\n“Sydney Powell is saying that she needs to get in to see the president, but she’s being kept away from him,” Lee wrote to Meadows on November 7. “Apparently she has a strategy to keep things alive and put several states back in play. Can you help get her in?”\n\nLee then sent Meadows Powell’s cell number and her email.\n\nSidney Powell pushed baseless claims of voter fraud as one of Trump's lead lawyers in the former President's efforts to challenge the 2020 election. Pool\n\nOn November 9, Lee again pressed Meadows about Powell, calling her a “straight shooter.”\n\nThat same day, Roy warned Meadows about Trump’s approach, texting him, “We must urge the President to tone down the rhetoric, and approach the legal challenge firmly, intelligently and effectively without resorting to throwing wild desperate haymakers or whipping his base into a conspiracy frenzy.”\n\nThen came the now-infamous news conference on November 19, where members of Trump’s legal team – including Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis – laid out a series of false claims and conspiracy theories about alleged voter fraud.\n\nThe messages started to take on a more critical tone.\n\nMark Meadows Patrick Semansky/AP/FILE\n\n“Hey brother - we need substance or people are going to break,” Roy texted on November 19, a few hours after the news conference wrapped.\n\nTwo hours later, Lee texted Meadows with serious concerns, saying he was “worried about the Powell press conference.”\n\nLee told Meadows, “The potential defamation liability for the president is significant here.\n\n“For the campaign and for the president personally.\n\n“Unless Powell can back up everything she said, which I kind of doubt she can.”\n\nMeadows responded, “I agree. Very concerned.”\n\nThe news conference came as Trump’s legal losses piled up in his effort to challenge the results in key swing states.\n\nFrom Powell to Eastman\n\nBy late November, Lee had shifted away from Powell and started promoting right-wing lawyer John Eastman, who a federal judge in California said last month may have been planning a crime with Trump as they sought to disrupt the January 6 congressional certification of the presidential election, calling it “a coup in search of a legal theory.”\n\nPrivately Roy was also texting Meadows with support for Eastman, and criticizing Giuliani.\n\n“Have you talked to John Eastman?” Roy texted on November 22. “Get Eastman to file in front of pa board of elections…\n\n“Get data in front of public domain.\n\n“Frigging rudy needs to hush.”\n\nBy December, both Republican lawmakers express grave concerns to Meadows about the plan to challenge the certification of the election on January 6.\n\nOn December 16, Lee asked Meadows for guidance: “If you want senators to object, we need to hear from you on that ideally getting some guidance on what arguments to raise.\n\n“I think we’re now passed the point where we can expect anyone will do it without some direction and a strong evidentiary argument.”\n\nOn December 31 Roy expressed even more concern in a text to Meadows.\n\n“The president should call everyone off. It’s the only path. If we substitute the will of states through electors with a vote by congress every 4 years… we have destroyed the electoral college… Respectfully,” Roy wrote.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See ex-Trump official's reaction to Trump Jr.'s 'revealing' texts 04:16 - Source: CNN See ex-Trump official's reaction to Trump Jr.'s 'revealing' texts 04:16\n\nBy this time, Trump and his allies were working behind the scenes to enlist portions of the federal government in the effort to overturn the election. That included urging Justice Department officials, including then-Attorney General William Barr, to investigate fraud even after the agency had declared there was none. Trump was also putting heavy pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence not to certify the election on January 6.\n\nIn a January 3 text to Meadows, Lee argued that Trump’s effort to have states send alternate slates of electors to Congress was not legitimate.\n\n“I only know that this will end badly for the President unless we have the Constitution on our side,” Lee texted in a note to Meadows. “And unless these states submit new slates of Trump electors pursuant to state law, we do not,” Lee wrote to Meadows.\n\nAs CNN has previously reported, the plan to replace authentic electors with fake ones in a handful of swing states was orchestrated by allies of the former President and overseen by his then-attorney Giuliani.\n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, speaks as the House reconvenes to debate the objection to confirming the Electoral College vote from Arizona, after protesters stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021. AP\n\nNone of those alternate slates of pro-Trump electors received sign-off from state officials or were put before Congress.\n\nWhile Lee and Roy both voted to certify the electoral results in favor of Biden, more than 100 of their GOP colleagues in both the House and Senate did not. Chief among them were Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, both of whom Lee called out in his texts to Meadows.\n\n“I have grave concerns with the way my friend Ted is going about this effort,” Lee wrote to Meadows. “This will not inure to the benefit of the president.”\n\nLee added that unless new, competing slates of electors were put forward in accordance with state law, the net effect “could help people like Ted and Josh to the detriment of DJT.”\n\nWhen January 6 finally came, neither Lee nor Roy joined their colleagues in objecting to the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nAfter the violence unfolded and Congress returned to session, Roy said on the House floor, “The President should never have spun up certain Americans to believe something that simply cannot be.”\n\nHe also texted Meadows, “This is a sh*tshow.\n\n“Fix this now.”\n\nThis story has been updated with Rep. Chip Roy’s tweet on Friday.", "authors": ["Ryan Nobles Annie Grayer Zachary Cohen Jamie Gangel", "Ryan Nobles", "Annie Grayer", "Zachary Cohen", "Jamie Gangel"], "publish_date": "2022/04/15"}]}

Mark Amodei’s office on Kietzke Lane.\n\nOrganizers from Indivisible Northern Nevada say they have seen a huge increase in interest and were expecting its largest crowd to date — possibly more than 2,000.\n\nThe event is a “direct response to President Trump’s self-aggrandizing multi-million dollar birthday celebration — estimated to cost between $25 and $45 million,” the organizers said in a news release. “The miliary-style parade, which will be funded entirely by taxpayers, will happen at the same time the administration continues to assert that there is both not enough money for and ‘too much waste’ in vital programs like Social Security, SNAP, Medicaid, and the Veteran’s Administration.”\n\nIndivisible Northern Nevada said more than 1,200 have registered to attend and that it expected twice that many to show up.\n\nThe anti-Trump group 50501 planned its own protest from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. June 14 at the Legislative Complex in Carson City. About 7,000 were estimated to have attended its April protest there against Trump administration actions.\n\nWhat to do if a protest turns violent\n\nNance said people should leave if a protest turns violent or aggressive.\n\n“Please leave the area and get yourself to a place of safety,” she said, “because we don't want people that are there to peacefully protest and have their voices heard to get wrapped up in the law enforcement response that is inevitably going to happen if violence or illegal actions take place.”\n\nSpecific acts will definitely trigger a law enforcement response, she said.\n\n“I would say violent acts, vandalism to businesses,” Nance said when asked about what makes a protest no longer peaceful. “Any sort of violent acts towards our law enforcement officers or other people in the crowds. Anything that is going to not be a safe environment.\n\n“If people are on the sidewalk with signs demonstrating, that's the type of peaceful protest we want to see. When it moves into acts of vandalism or acts of violence, those are behaviors that we cannot tolerate.”\n\nMark Robison is the state politics reporter for the Reno Gazette Journal, with occasional forays into other topics.

The arrival of President Donald Trump on Sunday, making him the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl, will only induce a heightened security environment around Caesars Superdome.\n\nTo begin with, the Super Bowl is categorized as a Special Event Assessment Rating (SEAR) Level 1 event by the Department of Homeland Security, which requires close coordination between state, local and federal law enforcement. Lanier had declined to reveal the number of police officers assisting in keeping the city safe this week, but that it would be in “the thousands.” Lanier told the Washington Post recently she made “probably 10” visits to New Orleans to coordinate security.\n\nEven before Super Bowl week began, the NFL and authorities promised a “visible law enforcement” presence throughout the city. That has certainly been the case.\n\nAccessing Bourbon Street, the security apparatus is immediately apparent. Anyone walking with a purse or bag has it searched at a checkpoint. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry created the security zone around and including Bourbon Street via an emergency order.\n\nAll types of barriers prevent vehicles from coming close to accessing the famous road of revelry, which was the site of tragedy in the early hours of Jan. 1.\n\nIn addition to the 14 killed, dozens were wounded in a truck attack on Bourbon Street that police say was perpetrated by Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who was fatally shot by police at the scene.\n\nJabbar rammed his truck onto the street that is pedestrian-only; varying types of barriers for blocks in all directions from Bourbon Street are now in place after bollards were not up prior to the attack. Two improvised explosive devices Jabbar had planted in coolers in the French Quarter did not detonate.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs’ hotel is about 0.2 miles from the base of Bourbon Street on Canal Street. The amount of mobile command and law-enforcement satellite vehicles surrounding the Marriott is astounding.\n\nEven Frenchmen Street, the live music and jazz epicenter of New Orleans, had an increased police presence and was closed to vehicles. Barriers also prevented access from any intersecting roads.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles’ police escort Monday from practice in nearby Metaire, Louisiana, created a traffic standstill at the Warehouse District exit off Interstate-10. That same day, a pair of military jets conducted training maneuvers over downtown a handful of times. A low-flying helicopter hummed over the city for most of the week.\n\nAirspace has become an increasingly worrisome battleground for the NFL in recent years. Last week, a man was arrested for flying a drone over M&T Bank Stadium during a Baltimore Ravens’ home playoff game that paused the proceedings. Organizers won’t have to worry about that since Caesars Superdome is an enclosed venue, but the week operated under the second-highest rating in terms of airspace clearance. Drones throughout the downtown area were prohibited starting Monday. On game day, the restriction space is 30 nautical air miles, Lanier said.\n\nOn Sunday, Secret Service agents checked bags and had a heavy uniformed presence outside of the stadium. The day prior, a popup concert on Bourbon Street with electronic-music DJs John Summit and Dom Dolla was promptly shut down by police for security reasons, according to a social-media post by Summit.\n\nOn the ground – on Bourbon Street, the French Quarter and the rest of downtown – the good times have rolled all week. But throwing a party in the shadows of rifles and snipers on rooftops became reality for New Orleans, the NFL and Super Bowl 59 after Jan. 1.\n\nContributing: Tom Schad", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/washington/2025/06/11/no-kings-day-protests-near-me-safety-washington/84151865007/", "title": "No Kings protests in Washington, nationwide June 14.

No weapons should be brought to a protest, they stressed.\n\nPublic protests are protected in the United States by the First Amendment. They are legal in public areas, provided you are not blocking car or pedestrian traffic or blocking access to government buildings.\n\nThat said, law enforcement may interpret your intentions differently, and some have acted with force.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign advises protesters to scout out the area of the protest ahead of time and identify multiple ways out of the area. An offline-accessible map can help. During the protest, remain aware of your surroundings and what's happening around you.\n\nWhat should I bring to a protest?\n\nProtest signs and sunscreen are just the beginning.

Bass announced the curfew while many people in the city were out marching through the streets and protesting against the ICE raids.\n\nThe curfew was announced to \"stop bad actors who are taking advantage of the President's chaotic escalation,\" Bass asserted in a social media post. \"Law enforcement will arrest individuals who break the curfew, and you will be prosecuted.\"Nights of volatile protests have prompted a legal and social media standoff between California leaders and the Trump administration. The conflict centers on Trump's move to deploy Marines and the National Guard in California in response to protests that have sprung up against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit against Trump for deploying federal troops in the city. Newsom has also accused Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth of trying to use the assets to help ICE conduct raids. A judge set a hearing for the matter for Thursday.\n\nNewsom’s efforts to block federal incursion in California come after Trump doubled the National Guard presence in Los Angeles to 4,000 and deployed 700 Marines, an escalation estimated to cost about $134 million, according to a Pentagon official. Trump remained all-in on his decisions, posting on Truth Social that \"if we didn't send out the National Guard—Los Angeles would be burning right now!\"\n\nSince Friday, officers have had confrontations with protesters, leading to the use of pepper spray and flash bangs as officials announced more than 150 arrests amid flare-ups of vandalism and violence. Bass on Tuesday said damage was limited to a small area downtown, but noted that the graffiti was \"extensive\" and required a large response as the city prepares to host the 2026 World Cup.\n\nWhat to know about the curfew?\n\nThe curfew issued by Bass covers a one-square-mile area of downtown Los Angeles and will last from 8 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday local time. The mayor said she expected the curfew to last for several days.\n\nBass announced the curfew while people were marching through the streets, where protests had turned into vandalism and looting earlier in the week. Police have made over 150 arrests in response to the protests, including over 100 the night before the curfew was announced.\n\nIn a statement about the protests Monday night, Los Angeles police said that \"as demonstrators were being disbursed, agitators and miscreants within the crowd looted businesses and vandalized property.\"\n\nCalifornia officials have said that Trump’s move to send federal troops to the city has only exacerbated tensions and prompted more unrest.\n\nNewsom on Trump: 'Rule of law has increasingly given way to rule of Don'\n\nNewsom delivered a fiery speech Tuesday night, sharing details about what sparked the protests in California's biggest city and what the president’s reaction says about the state of the nation.\n\n\"This situation was winding down and concentrated in just a few square blocks downtown, but that's not what Donald Trump wanted,\" Newsom said. \"He chose escalation, he chose more force, he chose theatrics over public safety.\"\n\nNewsom said Trump did not consult with California law enforcement leaders and commandeered National Guard troops to Los Angeles streets \"illegally and for no reason.\"\n\n\"This brazen abuse of power by a sitting president inflamed a combustible situation,\" Newsom explained.\n\nNewsom said the protests were sparked by unprecedented immigration enforcement raids that saw federal agents \"jumping out of unmarked vans\" outside Home Depot to detain people. The governor added that a \"U.S. citizen nine months pregnant was arrested, a four-year-old girl taken, families separated, friends quite literally disappearing.\"\n\nTrump has said his immigration policy is meant to root out criminals and people illegally in the country, adding that deploying federal troops to Los Angeles was necessary to protect federal buildings from vandalism and keep the peace.\n\n\"California may be first, but it clearly will not end here, other states are next, democracy is next,\" Newsom said. \"This moment we have feared has arrived. The rule of law has increasingly given way to the rule of Don.\"\n\nProtesters take to the streets of Chicago, other US cities\n\nCHICAGO — Hundreds of people gathered in the city’s iconic Loop neighborhood on Tuesday to protest ICE and the immigration enforcement raids that sparked widespread demonstrations in Los Angeles.\n\nMarchers gathered at Daley Plaza near the federal courthouse, marched under the tracks of the El train and down Michigan Avenue.\n\nDemonstrators carried Mexican flags, signs reading “none of us are free unless all of us are free” and chanted a slogan in Spanish insulting immigration authorities.\n\nProtesters marched through Chicago at the same time that people took to the streets in Los Angeles.\n\nWatch the protests here.\n\n--Contributing: Reuters\n\nJudge balks at Newsom request to limit Trump use of National Guard\n\nJudge Charles Breyer balked at Newsom's request to block the Trump administration's use of the National Guard and Marines on Tuesday. Instead, Breyer ordered a briefing on Wednesday and a hearing on Thursday.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Trump administration called Newsom's motion for an emergency temporary restraining order \"legally meritless,\" in pursuit of \"an extraordinary, unprecedented, and dangerous court order,\" and claimed the court has no authority to weigh in.\n\n- Sarah Wire\n\nTrump says troops sent to LA are 'defending the republic'\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in remarks from Fort Bragg in North Carolina that service members deployed to California are \"defending the republic itself\" and helping the administration \"liberate\" the city of Los Angeles.\n\n\"They're stopping an invasion,\" Trump said, in late afternoon remarks.\n\nThe Republican president said California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats, are \"incompetent\" and suggested without evidence that \"troublemakers, agitators and insurrectionists\" were being paid to undermine federal immigration law.\n\nAsked by a reporter if he was accusing Newsom and Bass of paying demonstrators, Trump said \"somebody\" was but not necessarily the Democratic politicians. \"He was just asked by reporters about this remark and he said \"somebody\" is paying for it, without specifiying who.\n\n\"And if they're not, they're just troublemakers,\" he said. \"I believe someboyd is paying them.\"\n\nTrump said: \"As the entire world can now see, uncontrolled migration leads to chaos, dysfunction and disorder.\"\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nHas Trump overblown the threat of protests? Residents, officials say yes.\n\nTrump's deployment of thousands of troops to the nation's second-largest city has unleashed indignation and anger among residents and local officials who say the threat of immigration protests has been dramatically overblown by the White House.\n\n\"The implication is that Donald Trump is waging a war on us personally,\" said protester Charlie Knowlton, 30.\n\nImmigration agents carrying out Trump's goal of deporting 1 million undocumented immigrants annually sparked a series of sometimes-violent protests in the greater Los Angeles area.\n\nTrump has dispatched 4,000 members of the National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, arguing that local law enforcement is overwhelmed. Few of those troops are actually on the streets, however.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department alone has about 9,000 officers to serve the city of nearly 4 million people sprawling across a land area that's one-third the size of Rhode Island. The larger Los Angeles metro area has more than 18 million residents and covers an area nearly the size of Maine.\n\nLocal authorities say they have detained about 150 people in connection to the unrest that left small areas of the 5.8-square-mile downtown marred with pervasive graffiti and a few broken windows. No serious injuries have been reported.\n\n\"We all know this is a power grab,\" Knowlton said before taking a selfie in front of a line of LAPD officers in riot gear. \"What I want right now is for the city police to grow a spine and stand up to the feds.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nState asks judge to stop troops in LA from helping ICE\n\nThe motion says the state on June 9 became aware that the National Guard units in California \"would be providing support for counter-immigration operations and not only at federal buildings.\"\n\n\"Specifically, these activities—scheduled to begin today, June 10, 2025—will include 'holding a secure perimeter in communities around areas where immigration enforcement activities would take place, and securing routes over public streets where immigration enforcement officers would travel,'” the motion said.\n\nThe filing did not say how the state received word about the alleged change in operations.\n\nThe 4,000 California National Guard members called in by the president were originally tasked with protecting federal buildings and other property of the federal government. The Trump administration has not responded to the motion or Newsom's allegation's that the troops were going to used for immigration enforcement.\n\nLA Mayor: ‘We’re an experiment’\n\nMayor Karen Bass, asked why Los Angeles would be targeted, said she believes her city is “an experiment.”\n\n“If you can do this to the nation’s second largest city, maybe the administration is hoping this will be a signal to everybody everywhere to fear them—that you federal government that historically has protected you can come in and take over,” she told reporters in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nBass said she would be reaching out to President Trump. Asked what she would tell him, she said, “I want to tell him to stop the raids. I want to tell him that this is a city of immigrants. I want to tell him that if you want to devastate the economy of the City of Los Angeles, attack immigrants.”\n\n− Phaedra Trethan\n\nOver 100 arrests, 2 officers injured: LAPD\n\nThe number of arrests in connection with the demonstrations in downtown Los Angeles shot up Monday evening, according to the city’s police department.\n\nPolice reported on Tuesday that officers made at least 113 arrests. 96 were for failure to follow orders to leave the area. 14 people were arrested for looting. One person each was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon, resisting arrest and vandalism.\n\nTwo officers were brought to a hospital for their injuries and released. Several businesses were looted, police said.\n\nThe crowds of people left around 3 a.m., officials said.\n\nLAPD acknowledged the hectic night in a statement: “Unfortunately, as demonstrators were being disbursed, agitators and miscreants within the crowd looted businesses and vandalized property,” police said. “We are asking that all residents and businesses continue to report any crimes… Please document with photographs or video before clean up.”\n\nThe number of arrests was more than double what LAPD reported for Saturday and Sunday when 50 people were arrested. Most were also for failure to follow dispersal orders although among the charges was attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail and assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, according to police.\n\nLA mayor considers curfew to curb nightly violence\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she is considering a curfew to restore calm to the city.\n\n“We’re looking at things like a curfew,” she said June 10, and she planned to meet with Police Chief Jim McDonnell later in the day to discuss it.\n\nShe said a curfew wouldn’t need to be citywide, but likely focused on the downtown area.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nTeams cleaning up protesters' graffiti\n\nAuthorities have dispatched painters, cleaners, and other workers to scrub away, cover up or fade out widespread spraypaint graffiti around downtown. While the vast majority of protesters have been peaceful, a small number have defaced buildings, sidewalks and streets with anti-Trump slogans, criticism of ICE and police, and exhortations to resist fascism.\n\nFederal buildings are among the hardest hit, and there was no sign of the National Guard or Marines protecting those facilities Tuesday. On North Los Angeles Street, contractors were paying particular attention to the asphalt where five Waymo self-driving electric vehicles were burned by protesters, releasing rare Earth materials that can be hazardous.\n\nAround the corner, painter’s apprentice Tim Brevard, 53, covered up graffiti on a wall with grey paint shot from a sprayer. Under normal circumstances, Brevard’s team removes gang graffiti from the same area daily. Now it is political graffiti. City policy calls for removing it within 72 hours of being reported, and the city spends about $14 million annually on graffiti removal, according to its annual budget.\n\n“Down here it’s tough because there’s fresh graffiti every day,” Brevard said as he paused to wipe sweat from his face with a gloved hand. “There’s always gang graffiti. Every day we do this.”\n\nHow did the LA protests begin? Immigration raids spark outrage\n\nThe protests in Los Angeles County began as a reaction to a handful of immigration raids, including one outside a Home Depot and another at a clothing manufacturer in the city's garment district.\n\nThe raids and subsequent outrage came as the Trump administration stepped up its detention and deportation of immigrants including at workplaces, traffic stops and routine legal check-ins.\n\nProtests against these moves have increased, too. While most have remained peaceful, the Department of Homeland Security reported a more than 400% surge in assaults on agents.\n\nAfter small protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles on June 6, Trump took several swift actions, calling in the 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines, drawing ire – and at least one lawsuit – from California officials who accuse the president of stoking tension and escalating unrest.\n\nTrump has stood by his actions, saying the deployments were necessary to contain what he described as \"violent, instigated riots.\" About 150 people have been arrested at the protests, which have included flare-ups of unruly clashes, vandalism and looting, but have remained limited to a few blocks in the city's downtown area.\n\nAs authorities brace for another day of protests and Los Angelenos ready themselves for the increased military presence, read more about how the protests began.\n\nTrump says he’d invoke Insurrection Act 'if there’s an insurrection'\n\nTrump said he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act, which would give him more leeway to use the military for domestic purposes as he deploys troops to Los Angeles in response to violent protests.\n\n\"If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it,” Trump said Tuesday during an event in the White House. “We'll see. But I can tell you, last night was terrible. The night before that was terrible.\"\n\nTrump deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles over the objections of Newsom, sparking the lawsuit from the state. Marines also were sent to help the guard after protests erupted over federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nThe troops currently are limited to protecting federal property and law enforcement officers. The Insurrection Act would give Trump authority to use them more broadly. Trump said some areas of Los Angeles, during the protests, where \"you could have called it an insurrection. It was terrible.\"\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nHouse Speaker says Newsom should be 'tarred and feathered'\n\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, asked Tuesday whether Newsom should be arrested, said the governor should be “tarred and feathered.”\n\n“That's not my lane. I'm not gonna give you legal analysis on whether Gavin Newsom should be arrested. But he ought to be tarred and feathered,” Johnson, R-LA., said in a weekly press conference.\n\nJohnson said Newsom is keeping the administration from implementing federal law.\n\nNewsom quickly responded on social media. “Good to know we’re skipping the arrest and going straight for the 1700s style forms of punishment. A fitting threat given the (Republicans) want to bring our country back to the 18th Century.”\n\n− Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhere are LA protests happening?\n\nMost of the unrest is taking place across a few square miles in a mostly commercial area downtown. The city is sprawled across hundreds of square miles and the county covers thousands of square miles. The vast majority of the metropolitan area has been quiet, with people able to continue their daily routines.\n\nTrump has insisted that he had no choice but to increase the level of force in response to growing unrest over his immigration crackdown.\n\n700 Marines heading to LA for riot assistance; Newsom calls move 'deranged fantasy' of Trump\n\nHegseth says National Guard is 'huge component' going forward\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth told a House committee Tuesday the United States was entering a new phase in which the National Guard would \"become a critical component of how we secure that homeland.\"\n\n\"The National Guard is a huge component of how we see the future,\" he told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.\n\nBryn MacDonnell, a special assistant to the secretary of defense, said the Pentagon is spending $134 million of deploying 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines. Funding is coming from operations and maintenance accounts, he said.\n\n− Mayes-Osterman, Cybele\n\nNewsom, Trump aide spar on social media\n\nNewsom criticized Trump on X Tuesday after Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, blasted the governor on the same social media site hours earlier. Miller wrote that \"when the rioters swarmed, you handed over your streets, willingly. You still refuse to arrest and prosecute the arsonists, seditionists and insurrectionists.\"\n\nNewsom made reference to Trump's decision to pardon or commute the sentences of hundreds of people in connection with the assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"The only people defending insurrectionists are you and @realDonaldTrump,\" Newsom wrote. \"Or, are we pretending like you didn’t pardon 1500 of them?\"\n\nCivil rights groups rip Trump's show of force\n\nSeveral national civil rights groups described the Trump administration's National Guard deployment as an overreach of power that was “deeply disturbing\" and “reckless.\"\n\n\"It is not lost on us that no such show of force was deployed in advance of the January 6 insurrection at our nation’s capital despite the clear threat to democracy. The contrast is alarming,\" leaders wrote in a statement released Monday night. “Peaceful protesters in Los Angeles are met with military presence, while violent actors in Washington, D.C. were allowed to breach the heart of our government with little resistance. This inconsistency amplifies questions about how power is used and against whom.\"\n\nThe right to protest the Trump administration’s \"unjust policies targeting Black and Brown communities must be protected,\" they wrote.\n\nThe groups include the NAACP, the National Urban League, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, the National Action Network, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Leadership Conference, the National Council of Negro Women and the Legal Defense Fund.\n\nSeparately, Judith LeBlanc, executive director of Native Organizers Alliance Action Fund, called the administration’s decision to call in the National Guard and the Marines “an act of violence meant to silence organizers who are taking a righteous stand against the illegal and brutal ICE raids happening everyday.”\n\n− Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nMultiple journalists injured by nonlethal rounds\n\nMultiple members of the media have reported being caught in the crossfire or targeted by authorities using tear gas or rubber bullets.\n\nThe incidents included Australian journalist Lauren Tomasi, who was hit in the leg by a rubber bullet on camera in a video that shows an officer appearing to aim at her. A New York Post photographer, Toby Canham, also said he was shot in the forehead with a nonlethal round. British freelance photographer Nick Stern told the BBC he underwent emergency surgery after he was hit in the leg by a plastic bullet.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists has sounded the alarm over the incidents, warning against the intimidation of journalists.\n\n“Any attempt to discourage or silence media coverage by intimidating or injuring journalists should not be tolerated,” Katherine Jacobsen, program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, said in a statement. “It is incumbent upon authorities to respect the media’s role of documenting issues of public interest.”\n\nNational Press Club President Mike Balsamo warned that law enforcement \"cannot pick and choose when the First Amendment applies. Journalists in Los Angeles were not caught in the crossfire — they were targeted. \"\n\n-Jeanine Santucci\n\nMultiple journalists injured by police nonlethal rounds while covering LA protests\n\nCNN correspondent briefly detained, warned by LAPD\n\nPolice briefly detained CNN correspondent Jason Carroll while on air Monday night during the network's coverage of the protests. CNN was covering the protests live when in-studio anchors briefly lost contact with Carroll, who could be seen being led away from the protests by LAPD officers with his hands behind his back. Carroll returned to the mic, informing the anchors: \"I am being detained.\"\n\nAn officer then can be heard telling Carroll: \"We're letting you go. You can't come back. If you come back, you will be arrested.\"\n\nCNN issued a statement saying \"we are pleased the situation resolved quickly once the reporting team presented law enforcement with their CNN credentials. CNN will continue to report out the news unfolding in Los Angeles.\" Read more here.\n\n− Taijuan Moorman\n\nNational Guard lawsuit a 'test case'\n\nOn Monday, California sued the Trump administration, alleging that the president's deployment of Guard troops was unnecessary and unlawful. Newsom later indicated that he will take similar action to prevent the Marines from being deployed, describing the order as a \"blatant abuse of power.\"\n\n\"It makes me feel like our city is actually a test case,\" Bass said at a news conference. \"A test case for what happens when the federal government moves in and takes the authority away from the state or away from local government.\"\n\n'I hate it': LA residents who surveyed vandalism fear more violence in future protests\n\nDay laborers 'looking for work to survive'\n\nSome day laborers and other community members in Los Angeles County are warily watching federal troops, bracing for more raids and trying to look to the future while looking out for each other.

Checks and balances are crumbling,\" Newsom added.\n\n-Jeanine Santucci\n\nFederal forces present 'challenge' for police\n\nOfficials at the Los Angeles Police Department said Monday that despite violent demonstrations, local police can handle whatever protesters throw at them and that federal help is unnecessary and could become a hindrance.\n\n“The possible arrival of federal military forces in Los Angeles - absent clear coordination - presents a significant logistical and operational challenge for those of us charged with safeguarding this city,” Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement. “The Los Angeles Police Department, alongside our mutual aid partners, have decades of experience managing large-scale public demonstrations, and we remain confident in our ability to do so professionally and effectively.”\n\nLAPD said officers have fired over 600 non-lethal bullets and used tear gas on the \"hostile crowd.\" Among those hit was an Australian journalist covering the protests.\n\nAt least five officers received minor injuries, according to police. Five police horses also “were targeted and sustained minor injuries,\" police said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nDays of protests sparked by ICE raids in LA\n\nThe protests began Friday after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps near Los Angeles resulted in more than 40 arrests. The protests had largely been peaceful but flared up when heavily armed, masked agents raided Los Angeles businesses.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, defended the raids and said those arrested by ICE included a Vietnamese man convicted of second-degree murder, an Ecuadoran man convicted of possession of five kilograms of cocaine, and a Filipino man convicted of sexual offenses.\n\nOn Monday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said local immigrant rights groups had confirmed at least five ICE raids in the Los Angeles region. The mayor said officials were still working to compile more information on the raids but noted that in some cases, ICE targeted day laborers and detained people who appeared for scheduled immigration appointments.\n\n\"As you know, ICE does not tell anybody where they're going to go or when they're going to be there,\" Bass said at the Monday news conference.\n\nProtests also sprang up in at least nine other cities across the U.S. on Monday, including New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, according to Reuters.\n\nWhen does a protest become a riot?\n\nProtests in Los Angeles were relatively peaceful when they began on Friday, but escalated into scenes of chaos, with electric vehicles lit aflame, large clouds of tear gas and clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators. Trump has backed his move to send in troops, calling the protests “violent, insurrectionist mobs” and “lawless riots.” But Newsom said it was Trump who “instigated violence.”\n\nExperts say while there are legal definitions for a riot, the term has become increasingly politicized and encapsulates a wide variety of incidents. In most states including California, the key determinator lies in whether multiple people are involved and whether they are committing acts of violence, Brian Higgins, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said.\n\n\"One person is not a riot and neither is a group that is nonviolent,\" he said. \"They can even be breaking the law, like refusing to disperse. It's when you add in the factor of violence that it becomes a riot.\"\n\nThere are some gray areas, he said. Experts also said that while violence is a defining factor in a riot, such violence could be incited by law enforcement.

The agency said it collaborated with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee, a division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security which acts as the primary investigative arm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.\n\nRumors swirled across social media about numerous ICE raids at homes and businesses in Tallahassee and elsewhere as federal immigration enforcers rushed to comply with President Donald Trump's tough nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\n“I will declare a national emergency at our southern border,” Trump said during his inaugural speech. “All illegal entry will be immediately halted and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of illegal aliens back to the places from which they came.”\n\nTwo hours after the first post, the FHP stepped into the GOP civil war brewing in the state over who will control immigration enforcement when it posted video from the action and condemned a new bill from the Florida Legislature that makes Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson the new state Chief Immigration Officer with a staff of more than 140 people and funding of over $500 million to get started. The bill passed Tuesday, despite Gov. Ron DeSantis' strenuous objections.\n\n\"FHP is already operating under the governor's leadership to work with federal partners and enforce immigration law in Florida,\" the FHP said on its official X, formerly Twitter, page. \"The new bill proposed by the legislature would undercut our ability to deliver on this mission and remove critical authority and resources from our purview.\"\n\nICE raids for illegal immigrants have spiked dramatically around the country in the last few days. Multiple raids were carried out in Texas, Colorado, New Jersey and New York.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nWhat does ICE stand for in immigration?\n\nThe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was created in 2003 under the Department of Homeland Security to protect the U.S. from cross-border crime and illegal immigration.\n\nICE enforces the nation's complex Title 8 immigration laws inside the country and U.S. Customs and Border Protection handle it at the nation's borders. ICE has more than 20,000 law enforcement officers and an annual budget of about $8 billion.\n\nHowever, last week the Trump administration deputized thousands more federal law enforcement officers to help with Trump's goal of mass deportations, and many local law enforcement agencies have announced their intentions to coordinate and cooperate with the efforts.\n\nWho is ICE deporting?\n\nThat depends on who you ask.\n\n\"ICE detains individuals as necessary, including to secure their presence for immigration proceedings and removal from the United States,\" the agency says on its website. \"ICE also detains those who are subject to mandatory detention under U.S. immigration law and those a supervisor has determined are public safety or flight risks.\"\n\nThe president, who declared a national border emergency on his first day in office and ordered the U.S. armed forces to repel \"forms of invasion,\" has said his administration will prioritize deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal histories.\n\nHowever, on Tuesday White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked at her first press conference how many people were arrested by ICE since Trump regained power had criminal records.\n\n“All of them, because they illegally broke our nation’s laws and therefore they are criminals as far as this administration goes,’’ Leavitt said, suggesting that any and all people in the country without permission are fair game.\n\nWithin a few days of Trump taking office, ICE began posting totals of arrests and number of detainees lodged per day. On Jan. 23, 538 people were arrested. On Monday, it was 1,179. The ICE office in Miami reported Sunday it had arrested a Nicaraguan resident and a Jamaican resident on multiple charges.\n\nCNN reported that ICE teams around the country have been given quotas for high-profile arrests, although the Trump administration’s new “border czar” Tom Homan said there were no quotas.\n\nICE teams were also told to be camera-ready in case they are filmed, according to CNN. TV show host Dr. Phil McGraw was embedded with an ICE operation in Chicago on Sunday.\n\nWhat happens to people after ICE arrests them?\n\nAfter ICE arrests and process people, or takes them into custody after other law enforcement agencies turn them over, they may detain them while their immigration cases are pending or release them under supervision.\n\n\"Officials make custody determinations on an individual basis, taking into account all facets of a person’s situation, including their immigration history and criminal records. Authorities also consider family ties, humanitarian issues and whether a person may be a flight risk,\" ICE said.\n\nHowever, Trump issued executive orders last week to authorize the expansion of “expedited removal,” which allows the U.S. to deport someone without a hearing and revoked a ban on ICE arrests in sensitive areas such as hospitals, schools and churches.\n\nIs ICE offering a $750 reward for turning in suspected immigrants?\n\nNo. The agency posted a denial of this rumor to its X page. Some suspects wanted for crimes by local, state or federal law enforcement who are also illegal immigrants may have rewards attached to information leading to their arrest but there are currently no financial incentives for turning-in suspected immigrants to ICE.\n\nWhat can I do if I fear an ICE raid?\n\nThe National Immigration Resource Center recommends:\n\nGather important documents for all family members showing how long each one has been in the United States. This can include birth certificates, U.S. income tax returns, utility bills, leases, school records, medical records or bank records. Put copies into a secure online folder or location you can access by phone.\n\nIdentify your emergency contacts, memorize their phone numbers and make sure your contact can access all of your documents.\n\nProvide your child’s school or daycare with an emergency contact to pick up your child in case you are detained.\n\nTell your loved ones that if you are detained by ICE, they can try to use ICE’s online detainee locator to find you with the date of birth and country of origin at https://locator.ice.gov/odls/#/search.\n\nYou, your family or emergency contacts can contact the local ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) office to initiate an ICE Case Review process. You can find your local ERO office here. Have supporting documents ready.\n\nEveryone living in the United States has certain rights and protections provided by the U.S. Constitution, whatever their residency status is, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nYou have the right to remain silent. You don’t have to discuss your immigration or citizenship status with police or immigration agents. Anything said to an officer can later be used against you in court.\n\nYou don’t have to discuss your immigration or citizenship status with police or immigration agents.

However, we believe that every Rochesterian deserves their shot at the American Dream,\" Alaimo said. \"And that is why RPD does not inquire into immigration status during routine stops solely for the purpose of enforcing federal immigration laws, and RPD does not engage in such inquiries outside of the requirements of federal, state, and local law unless necessary to investigate criminal activity.\"\n\nLast February, the Rochester City Council unanimously passed a resolution reaffirming Rochester as a sanctuary city. The move came as the Department of Homeland Security issued sweeping orders to implement President Donald Trump's plan for increased immigration enforcement.\n\nThe council resolution, which re-stated one passed in 1986, directed the city administration to adopt policies that protect \"all who come within its borders” and says the city is not required to collect information or \"engage in immigration enforcement.\"\n\nIt also directed city employees not to inquire or request proof of immigration status or citizenship when providing services or benefits, unless specifically required to do so by law.\n\nWhen the resolution was passed, Police Chief Michael Ciminelli said he did not think the policy would limit his department in any way from its responsibility to deal with crime or violence. Nor did he think it would put his officers in conflict with immigration authorities.\n\n\"The resolution is clear that everything we do will comply with federal law,\" Ciminelli said.\n\nShortly after President Trump took office last January, he issued an executive order to cut funding from cities that limit cooperation with U.S. immigration authorities. In November, a federal judge permanently blocked that order.\n\nTuesday's comments by the DHS secretary came in response to questions from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat from California, about the federal response to that state's new sanctuary law.\n\nUnder that law, which went to into effect on January 1, local law enforcement agencies are prohibited from automatically transferring people to federal immigration authorities, with some exceptions, and barred from holding someone in custody, beyond their release date, for immigration agents.\n\nEarlier this month, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Thomas Homan, said his agency would significantly increase its enforcement presence in California.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Homan said that local officials in sanctuary cities should be charged with violating federal law.\n\n\"For these sanctuary cities that knowingly shield and harbor an illegal alien in their jail and don't allow us access, that is, in my opinion, a violation of 8-USC-1324. That's an alien smuggling statute,\" Homan told Fox News host Neil Cavuto. \"I think we charge some of these sanctuary cities with violating federal law.\"\n\nSLAHMAN@Gannett.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/06/14/no-kings-protests-against-trump-actions-planned-in-nevada/84192995007/", "title": "'No Kings' protests held in Northern Nevada against Trump actions", "text": "Reno rally draws 9,000 protesters, organizers say\n\nOrganizers of Reno’s protest estimate 9,000 attended the rally outside Rep. Mark Amodei’s office on Kietzke Lane.\n\nThey said the estimate was based on drone footage and on-site counters.\n\nThe rally was organized by Indivisible Northern Nevada and sponsored by the Nevada Labor Union, Third Act, and Blue Band Alliance.\n\nThe rally featured Flag Day tributes with 500 flags stationed throughout the area, organizers said in a statement.\n\nState legislators Selena LaRue Hatch, Erica Roth and Natha Anderson attended the event, with LaRue Hatch offering a speech addressing the assassination of a Democratic state legislator and the attempted assassination of another Saturday in Minnesota.\n\n“While this is a huge day — and should be a wake-up call for some of our elected officials as well as some of the people on the margins trying to figure out how to behave, we know this is a marathon,” said Kimberly Carden of Indivisible Northern Nevada in a statement.\n\nShe said her group will continue to hold rallies most Tuesdays at 10 a.m. in front of the federal building in Reno.\n\nFor these protesters, Trump's actions are those of a monarch, dictator\n\nMarz Ambriz-Rodriguez of Carson City said she came out Saturday’s “No Kings” protest because of Trump administration actions in Los Angeles.\n\n“Watching people be treated like animals and families being separated is disgusting,” she said.\n\n“Not only that, but everything is being destroyed: our access to science, factual information. Everything's being defunded from our natural resources to our schools. Everything's falling apart, and this guy is acting like a dictator. I'm afraid, and I think all of America should be afraid.\"\n\nStephanie Parker of Carson City wore a handwritten sign on her back saying “No kings” and held another one saying “Silence is violence” at Saturday’s protest.\n\n“We've got to stick with each other,\" she said. \"I hope everybody soon realizes that we live in a democracy, not a monarchy.”\n\nProtests in Northern Nevada remain peaceful with a sense of camaraderie\n\nTrouble was at a minimum at Saturday’s protests in Reno and Carson City.\n\nAn occasional vehicle with Trump signs would drive down Carson Street between the lines of protesters, the occupants sometimes yelling things like, “Get a job!“\n\nThe vast majority of vehicles honked in support and carried their own anti-Trump signs and flags.\n\nOne pickup carried water bottles on the tailgate and handed them out to protesters.\n\nSheriff's deputies stood around one man who got overheated and needed to lie in the shade until he felt better.\n\nIn Reno, there was minimal police presence among the hundreds of protesters that lined Kietzke Lane outside Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei's office.\n\nHannah Zimmerman and Katie Monahan told the RGJ they didn't see any counter-protesters, and that most of the drivers on Kietzke were supportive.\n\n\"This is a pretty big turnout (compared to) the one we were at a month ago,\" Monahan said. \"There's a real sense of camaraderie from everyone around here.\"\n\nProtest brings out Vietnam veteran to support democracy\n\nA Vietnam War veteran, Barry Combs of Minden said he came to Saturday’s protest in Carson City to show support for the republic and democracy.\n\nAsked about President Donald Trump‘s statement this week that protesters hate America, Combs said he loves America.\n\n“I fought to keep America safe and free,” he said. “I came out today to make sure those values stay alive.“\n\n50501 organizer: 'We need to exercise our right to peaceful protest in order to counteract the rapid shift toward authoritarianism'\n\nBy 90 minutes into Saturday’s “No Kings” protest in Carson City, the scene became cacophonous roar with steady cheers, shouting and honks of support from passing cars.\n\nAbout 5,000 people were already in attendance, based on past crowd estimates in the same location, with more people streaming in every minute.\n\n“I'm pleasantly surprised by the size of this crowd,” said Shane Scott, spokesperson for 50501 Northern Nevada, a protest group opposed to Donald Trump’s presidency that organized the rally.\n\n“It's a little bigger than I imagined, and I'm glad because I think the situation in this country is only gotten worse and we need to exercise our right to peaceful protest in order to counteract the rapid shift toward authoritarianism in this country.”\n\nThe group set up a shaded table in front of the Nevada Legislature building where it had Food Bank of Northern Nevada barrels to accept donations for those in need, as well as free American flags and stickers reading “Trump” with a circle and line striking through his name.\n\nAnother protest — organized by Indivisible Northern Nevada — is taking place at the same time on Kietzke Lane in Reno outside Rep. Mark Amodei’s office.\n\nBetween the two events, Scott estimated that the crowds will far surpass the April 5 protest in Carson City that his group pegged at about 7,000 attendees.\n\n\"We have the president federalizing the California National Guard without the governor’s consent and putting Marines on the streets of LA where they're detaining veterans trying to find the VA,” Scott said as one of the reasons why 50501 was protesting the Trump administration.\n\nHe also mentioned the latest federal budget bill that seeks to limit the ability of federal courts to hold government officials in contempt for violating court orders, a move that would undermine the judiciary's power to enforce its rulings.\n\n“The Republicans in Congress are trying to kneecap the courts with their budget bill,” he said. “I think that's scary.”\n\nCarson City protest draws families, seniors, small police presence\n\nBy 10:25 a.m. Saturday, hundreds of people with mostly homemade signs opposing the Trump administration lined the four blocks in front of the Nevada Legislature in Carson City.\n\nA half dozen sheriff’s deputies on motorcycles parked on side streets and made regular loops around the rally route. One sheriff deputy was on a dirt bike to more nimbly give chase if needed.\n\nA protester was immediately chastised over a loudspeaker by a motorcycle deputy when he stepped into the roadway outside of the crosswalk. “Get out of the street,” the deputy said firmly.\n\nOverall, the early protest vibe is peaceful. The crowd is mellow with lots of children and seniors.\n\nProtesters begin gathering in Carson City ahead of 10 a.m. start time\n\nA few hundred people are lined up in front of the Nevada Legislature in Carson City before the official start time of 10 a.m. for today’s protest.Numerous cars are honking up and down the street in support of the protesters.\n\nMetal barricades are lined up along Carson Street to keep people out of the roadway.The courtyard in front of the Nevada Legislature, which has been the location of numerous speeches and a central location for protesters during past rallies, is barricaded off with fencing for construction work.\n\nWhy is it called a 'No Kings' protest?\n\nA major protest theme Saturday is \"No Kings.\"\n\nOrganizers describe President Donald Trump as acting like a king through his executive orders, bypassing Congress on actions normally under their control such as tariffs and taking actions that go against judges' orders.\n\nTrump has ordered the National Guard and Marines into Los Angeles, saying they are needed to keep the peace, although state and local officials have said they don't want the help.\n\nThe Nevada National Guard says it has not been contacted by the Trump administration to deploy or be on standby.\n\nToday's protests coincide with President Donald Trump's 79th birthday and a military parade in Washington, D.C., celebrating the U.S. Army's 250th birthday.\n\nWhen and where are Nevada's 'No Kings' rallies?\n\n\"No Kings\" rallies are planned across Nevada in Reno, Carson City and Las Vegas, as well as Elko, Pahrump, Mesquite, Hawthorne, Mina and Duckwater, according to an event map by the 50501 protest group.\n\n• Reno rally: A protest will take place from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. outside Rep. Mark Amodei's office at 5310 Kietzke Lane.\n\n• Carson City rally: A separate \"No Kings\" event from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. is planned at the Legislative Complex at 401 S. Carson St.\n\nWhat can I expect at a 'No Kings' protest?\n\nBecause local organizers are involved in setting up \"No Kings\" events, each demonstration can look a bit different. The one in Carson City includes a food drive for local food banks and community groups that help those in need.\n\nOrganizers said that a “core principle” behind No Kings events is “a commitment to nonviolent action.”\n\n“We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events,” according to a news release.\n\nKnow your rights at protests: Tips from the ACLU\n\nPublic protests are protected in the United States by the First Amendment and are legal in public areas providing you are not blocking car or pedestrian traffic or blocking access to government buildings.\n\nThat said, law enforcement may interpret your intentions differently and some have acted with force.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign advises protesters to scope out the area of the protest ahead of time and identify multiple routes out of the area. An offline-accessible map can help. During the protest, remain aware of your surroundings and what's happening around you.\n\nWhile the First Amendment protects your right to say your opinions, keep in mind that making “true threats” or saying things that incite imminent violence or law-breaking can get you into trouble.\n\nAlso, counter-protestors are allowed to show up and voice their contrasting opinions, although they shouldn’t be allowed to physically disrupt the event.\n\nWhile demonstrators are urged to act lawfully at No Kings protests, tensions can escalate or bad actors can be present, heightening the possibility of arrests. People are urged to remember that if they are arrested, they have the right to remain silent, although they should not refuse to tell the police their name and address, according to both the ACLU.\n\nWhat should I bring to a protest?\n\nExperts at Physicians for Human Rights suggest bringing the following:\n\nBackpack or string bag: You won't want anything bulky and you'll want your hands free. Fanny packs can also help.\n\nYou won't want anything bulky and you'll want your hands free. Fanny packs can also help.

Carson St. It will include remarks from Brig. Gen. D. Rodger Waters.\n\nA spokesperson says it's coincidence the event starts at the same time as the anti-Trump rally across a large courtyard from the protesters, and that the Guard has not been contacted by the White House to deploy against protests in Nevada.\n\nWhat day is Trump’s military parade?

Likewise, those who are exercising their rights peacefully must be protected.\"\n\nIn a nod to President Donald Trump ordering the military to protests in Los Angeles, Ford added, \"We do not need a federalized National Guard — and we certainly don't need the United States Marine Corps — in Nevada.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Ford joined 17 other Democratic attorneys general calling it illegal for the Trump administration to deploy the California National Guard against LA protesters without coordination with state leaders.\n\nParis Barraza, C.

The conversations culminated with Hegseth, hours before the airstrikes, sharing secret plans ‒ including targets and attack sequencing ‒ in the chat.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have said the Signal leak - by federal officials using the publicly available encrypted messaging app - raises alarming questions about the potential mishandling of national security information, which federal law dictates should only be shared through the government's own approved secure platforms.\n\nThe White House's National Security Council is investigating the incident, Gabbard told senators on Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also confirmed to reporters that he expected the committee that oversees the Pentagon would look into the Trump administration's use of Signal.\n\nTop House Democrat calls for Trump to fire Hegseth\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., sent a letter to President Donald Trump Tuesday urging him to “immediately” fire Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.“The so-called Secretary of Defense recklessly and casually disclosed highly sensitive war plans—including the timing of a pending attack, possible strike targets and the weapons to be used—during an unclassified national security group chat that inexplicably included a reporter,” Jeffries wrote in the letter. “His behavior shocks the conscience, risked American lives and likely violated the law.”- Riley Beggin\n\nJust something that can happen’: Trump downplays Signal chat fiasco\n\nTrump insisted Tuesday afternoon no classified information was shared in the Signal chat and defended his national security adviser, who mistakenly invited The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief into a chat group with top Trump officials.\n\nSpeaking to reporters from the White House' Cabinet room, Trump downplayed the gravity of the security breach during meeting with several of his ambassador picks and said Waltz has no reason to apologize.\n\n“It’s just something that can happen. You can even prepare for it, and it can happen.” Trump said. “We always want to use the best technology. This was the best technology for the moment.”\n\nTrump said the White House will consider potential changes to security practices and how officials communicate with each other including the use of Signal, which he said he will likely not be used as often.\n\n\"We'll look into it,\" Trump said. \"But everybody else seems to be using it, it seems to be the number one used device or app, whatever you want to call it.\"\n\n\"It's used by a lot of the military, and I think, successfully,” he said. “But sometimes somebody can get onto those things. That's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones on, which is always the best, frankly.\"\n\nEven though the White House has acknowledged the contents in The Atlantic’s story, Trump lashed out at the reporter, calling him a “sleazebag” who works for a “failed magazine.”\n\nWaltz says he’s investigating ‘how the heck’ reporter got into chat\n\nWaltz also lashed out on Tuesday at Goldberg, telling reporters he’s never met The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief and will investigate how he mistakenly invited him into a Signal chat group with other Trump officials.\n\nTrump asked Waltz to address reporters about the Signal chat during a meeting in the White House Cabinet Room.\n\n“Mr. President, you asked about lessons,” Waltz said. “There's a lot of journalists in this city who have made big names for themselves making up lies about this president.”\n\n“And this one in particular,” Waltz said of Goldberg, “I've never met, don't know, never communicated with, and we are looking into him and reviewing how the heck he got into this room.”\n\nWaltz told Trump the reporter “wants the world talk about more hoaxes and this kind of nonsense rather than the freedom that you're enabling.”\n\nTrump said the main thing is the attack on Houthi sites in Yemen was a success. “The Houthis are absolutely on the run. The worst of them have been killed,” Trump said.\n\nTrump stands by his national security adviser\n\nTrump, in a phone interview Tuesday morning with NBC News, stood by Walz in his first substantive remarks on the security breach. \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man,\" the president said.\n\nTrump told NBC that Goldberg's presence in the chat had \"no impact at all\" on the military operation.\n\n“It was one of Michael’s people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there,\" Trump said when asked what he was told about how Goldberg was added to the Signal chat.\n\nTrump defended his national security team despite the details revealed in The Atlantic's story, calling the situation \"the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one.\"\n\nFBI director briefed about Signal scandal\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel said he was briefed about the Signal incident Monday night and again on Tuesday morning.\n\n“I don’t have an update,” Patel said in response to Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner’s question of whether the FBI had launched an investigation into the potential leak of classified information.\n\nWarner had asked Gabbard, seated to Patel’s left in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday, to confirm she was one of several senior officials a part of the group chat.\n\n“I’m not going to get into the specifics,” Gabbard said repeatedly, adding, “because this is currently under review by the National Security Council.”\n\nRatcliffe, the CIA director and another reported member of the Signal chat, confirmed to Warner he was a member of the virtual group.\n\nTrump officials deny classified information was shared\n\nBoth Gabbard and Ratcliff claimed there was nothing classified or at risk of endangering national security included in the messaging thread.\n\n“I’m a little staggered that that is your view,” Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said at one point to Ratcliffe.\n\nSen. Angus King, I-Maine, also pushed Gabbard on the issue, asking, “So the attack sequencing and timing and weapons and targets you don’t consider should have been classified?”\n\nGabbard deferred the question to the Department of Defense.\n\nRepublican leaders promise investigation\n\nRepublican Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his panel plans to investigate the Signal group chat to \"see what the facts are.\"\n\n\"It's definitely a concern,\" Wicker, R-Miss., said in an interview with CNN. \"You can be sure the committee, House and Senate, will be looking into this. And it appears that mistakes were made. No question.\"\n\nThune, the Senate's top Republican, later told reporters in the U.S. Capitol that he expected Wicker's panel would investigate the matter.\n\nHegseth revealed details about planned airstrikes\n\nOn the morning of the Saturday attack in Yemen, Goldberg said Hegesth sent an update to the group that contained \"operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen,\", including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying and attack sequencing.\n\nGoldberg said he did not publicize the full transcript of Hegseth's message because of the sensitive nature of the attack details.\n\n\"I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts,\" Goldberg wrote in his article. \"The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility.\n\nTrump officials used emojis to celebrate military operation’s execution\n\nAs the airstrikes were carried out in Yemen, several Trump officials responded with emojis, according to The Atlantic report.\n\n“I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote in the chat, with two other users subsequently adding prayer emojis.\n\nWaltz provided an update to the group, describing the operation as an “amazing job.” He later sent the group three emojis: a fist, an American flag and fire.\n\nRubio and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles congratulated Hegseth and the United States Central Command for executing the operation. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, responded with five emojis: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep and two American flags.\n\nMembers of the chat then discussed the damage that resulted from the airstrikes as well as the likely death count, according to Goldberg.\n\nVance discussed reservations about Houthi strikes\n\nThe airstrikes came in response to more than two years of Houthi attacks on vessels in the Rea Sea that has disrupted shipping.\n\nBut ahead of the airstrikes, Vance shared concerns about carrying out plans, telling the group he worried the operation could undercut Trump's foreign policy position on matters that impact Europe more than the U.S.\n\nAt one point he said, \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.”\n\nIn another message, Vance told the group: “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”\n\nWhy was a reporter included in the chat?\n\nIt is unclear why Goldberg, a longtime Washington-based reporter and editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was added to the chat of Trump officials.\n\nGoldberg said he received a connection request from a Signal user with name Mike Waltz on March 13. Two days later, he was added to a chat called “Houthi PC small group.”\n\nNo one realized that Goldberg, whose username appeared as \"JG,\" had been added, Goldberg wrote.\n\nGoldberg said he was initially suspicious about the chat, wary that it could be a hoax designed to entrap a reporter and skeptical top national security officials would be using a phone app to discuss such sensitive material. He said he realized it was authentic when the Yemen airstrike plans revealed by Hegseth came to fruition.\n\n\"I didn’t think it could be real,\" The Atlantic article's headline said. \"Then the bombs started falling.\"\n\nTop Senate Intelligence Democrat blasts witnesses for Signal scandal\n\nAt Tuesday's hearing, Warner wasted no time bringing up The Atlantic’s scathing story in his opening remarks during the Senate Intelligence Committee's annual hearing Tuesday morning on global threats to the United States.\n\nWarner, vice chairman of the committee, condemned the reported group chat of senior officials – which included Gabbard and Ratcliffe, who sat facing Warner and the committee as witnesses for the hearing.\n\n“Putting aside that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system,” Warner said, “it’s also just mind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line, and nobody bothered to even check – security hygiene 101 – who are all the names? Who are they?”\n\nThe Virginia senator called the error reckless and sloppy, and said it was emblematic of issues across the Trump administration.\n\n“If this was the case of a military officer or an intelligence officer, and they had this kind of behavior, they would be fired,” Warner said. “I think this is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information, that this is not a one-off or a first-time error.”\n\nTrump was charged with mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House when his first term concluded. A federal judge dismissed the indictment last summer and special counsel Jack Smith dropped his appeal to continue pursuing the federal criminal charges after Trump's presidential election victory last November.\n\nWhat is Signal?\n\nSignal, which is downloadable on Apple and other phone devices, is an open-source encrypted messaging often used by reporters who seek more privacy than traditional texting platforms.\n\nBut Signal is not approved by the government for classified communications. Its use by leading Trump national security officials leaves an opening for U.S. adversaries like China, Iran and Russia, national security experts say.\n\nSignal president calls app ‘gold standard’ in private communications\n\nMeredith Whittaker, the president of Signal, defended the app on social media as the “gold standard” in private communications even if top U.S. national security officials disclosed a pending attack on Houthis in Yemen to a journalist through an encrypted chat.\n\nWhittaker didn’t address the potential security breach of Waltz and others inviting Atlantic magazine’s editor-in-chief into a chat where the attack was discussed.\n\nBut she said Signal collects little data about its users, so there is little to see when the company receives subpoenas for information that it cannot resist.\n\n“Signal is the gold standard in private comms,” Whittaker said.\n\nWhite House acknowledges authenticity, downplays breach\n\nThe White House acknowledged the authenticity of the Signal chat but downplayed the significance of the breach, arguing the airstrike operation was executed as planned.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Goldberg of \"sensationalist spin,\" insisting that no \"war plans\" were discussed. She said no classified material was sent in the thread, adding that the White House Counsel’s Office has provided guidance on a “number of different platforms” for Trump’s top officials to communicate.\n\nShe said the White House is “looking into” how Goldberg’s number was inadvertently added to the chat.\n\nHegseth also denied war plans were shared, telling reporters on Monday, “Nobody was texting war plans, and that’s all I have to say about that.”\n\nJournalist says group chat had military details\n\nRatcliffe and Gabbard told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that their multi-day chat two weeks ago did not discuss the kind of specific operational details that could be considered classified related to the bombing of Houthi militants in Yemen.\n\nBut in a series of interviews before Tuesday's hearing, Atlantic's Goldberg said the conversations by Ratcliffe, Gabbard, Hegseth and others in the days before the March 15 U.S. airstrike did contain those kinds of details.\n\nGoldberg told MSNBC’s Jen Psaki on Monday night that he wanted to be “responsible here and not disclose the things that I read and saw.”\n\nBut the journalist added, “I will describe them to you: The specific time of a future attack. Specific targets, including human targets meant to be killed in that attack. Weapons systems.”\n\n“Even weather reports that the government is ... I don't know why Hegseth was sharing it with everybody,” Goldberg said. “I mean, the precise detail. And then a long section on sequencing. This is gonna happen, then that is gonna happen. After that happens, this happens, then that happens, and then we go and find out if it worked.”\n\n“I mean, you know, he can say that it wasn't a war plan,” Goldberg said of Hegseth. “But it was a minute-by-minute accounting of what was about to happen.”\n\nTop Democrat on Intel Committee slams officials in Signal chat\n\nWarner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters the arguments that Gabbard and Ratcliffe made before his panel Tuesday were absurd “that somehow this might be defense intelligence but it’s not actual intelligence. Having senior military officials fighting over policy before you launch a military strike by its nature is classified information.”\n\n“You know the old adage, if you’re in a hole, stop digging,” Warner said. “Well, DNI Director Gabbard and CIA Director Ratcliffe today dug that hole a lot deeper in their dodging and weaving.”\n\nHe added that encrypted text messaging platforms like Signal are not intended to be used for classified information and expressed shock that the administration hasn’t said whether they’ve collected the phones or if they were personal phones the officials used for communicating.\n\n“I think you’re going to see a continued level of incompetence that’s going to stun even Trump’s supporters,” Warner said.\n\nJosh Meyer, Riley Beggin and Bart Jansen contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/maryland/2025/04/08/maryland-budget-with-tax-hikes-spending-cuts-passes-on-final-day/82993801007/", "title": "Maryland budget with tax hikes, spending cuts passes on final day", "text": "Sofia Appolonio and Marissa Yelenik\n\nCapital News Service\n\nAI-assisted summary Maryland lawmakers passed a $67 billion budget that includes spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nThe budget addresses a deficit by cutting spending and raising taxes on higher earners and certain services.\n\nThe legislature also passed an energy package focused on in-state energy generation and reforms.\n\nDebate over the Blueprint for Maryland's Future education plan resulted in funding freezes, cuts, and delays.\n\nMaryland lawmakers passed a budget this week, concluding their spring session after months of grappling with a tough fiscal reality and new federal policies coming down from President Donald Trump.\n\nThe end-of-session agreement hikes taxes and cuts programs to balance the spending plan for the 2026 fiscal year, assuming the federal funding picture does not change radically in the months to come.\n\nLawmakers made the budget work partly by trimming back the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the ambitious 2021 education reform plan meant to improve public schools. Architects of the deal said the changes will preserve the Blueprint’s priorities.\n\n“We present a budget that puts Maryland in a strong fiscal position and faces the challenges ahead while protecting our shared values and priorities,” said Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone, a Democrat from Howard County.\n\nBut House Minority Whip Del. Jesse Pippy, a Republican who represents Frederick and Carroll Counties, argued that the plan unnecessarily burdens taxpayers.\n\n“A majority of my colleagues feel very strongly that we could have balanced the budget without raising taxes,” Pippy said. “I don't think the direction of the state is the direction that most Marylanders want to go in.”\n\nSpecter of federal layoffs looms as challenge in Maryland\n\nRepublicans made their mark on legislative work in the opening months of the new Trump administration, which helped give rise to the newly formed Maryland Freedom Caucus.\n\nStill, the Democrat-controlled legislature generally opposed new Trump-era policies. And now the state – home to the most federal workers in the country outside of Washington, D.C. – likely faces continuing challenges with the Trump administration’s mass government layoffs. At present, one Democratic leader said, the number of fired workers in Maryland stands at about 11,000.\n\n“We expect that number to climb to 30,000, and there are many more contractors, probably at least double that amount,” said Sen. Katie Fry Hester, a Democrat representing Howard and Montgomery Counties.\n\nThe legislature might have to reconvene at some point this year to cope with unemployment and changes in federal policy affecting Maryland. As of Monday night, though, the General Assembly has settled a range of issues affecting Maryland’s six million residents.\n\nHere's a look at what passed, and what didn't, in this legislative session.\n\nBalanced budget mixes spending cuts, tax increases\n\nThe $67 billion spending plan addresses a significant deficit through approximately $2 billion in spending cuts and $1.6 billion in tax changes.\n\nThe budget raises income taxes on the state’s higher earners, extends the sales tax to certain technology services and introduces a $5 tire fee. It includes two new tax brackets, increases the standard deduction, phases out itemized deductions for those in higher tax brackets and includes tax hikes on individual goods and services.\n\nMany lawmakers celebrated its passage, but some said increasing the standard deduction would lead to service cuts in lower-income counties that rely on the income tax of low- and middle-income residents. The finalized plan will now go to Moore for consideration.\n\nEnergy package calls for new in-state generation\n\nEnergy was a hot topic this session, with multiple bills going through the legislature as lawmakers worked to address high energy prices. They passed a three-bill package on Monday.\n\nThe package focuses on new in-state energy generation, ratepayer protections and reforms, solar siting and permitting and the creation of a state energy planning office. It outlines procurement processes for nuclear, battery storage and dispatchable energy, and removes trash incineration from the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard.\n\n“I think, on balance, it’s a good package,” said Sen. Brian Feldman, a Democrat from Montgomery County and chair of the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment committee.\n\nThe package initially drew criticism from environmental advocates, who were concerned that one of the bills would lead to new natural gas development in the state. But the Chesapeake Climate Action Network Action Fund praised the bill as passed, saying in a statement that it “will likely reduce the chance of new gas plant construction in the state and … will advance a host of clean energy priorities,” including battery storage.\n\nRepublican critics worry that the package doesn’t do enough to help ratepayers.\n\nEducation Blueprint sees freezes, cuts and delays\n\nBlueprint funding was the subject of debate during the legislative session. In January, Moore proposed short-term cuts to mitigate the cost of the massive education plan, pushing back and pausing funding for different programs.\n\nThe education budget came under even more scrutiny late in the session, after an expected $418 million in government funds was suddenly in jeopardy. U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon announced the end of a pandemic-era fund for state educational spending.\n\nAs it stands, state lawmakers agreed to postpone the Blueprint requirement that teachers receive a set amount of planning every school week, delaying it for three years. Additional Blueprint funding was also decreased through freezes and cuts.\n\nJustice reforms focus on geriatric parole, more\n\nLawmakers passed a bill to let prisoners access medical or geriatric parole more easily by allowing them to prove they are no longer a threat to others. It would not apply to those serving life sentences without parole or those on the sex offender registry. Geriatric parole would only be available to those over 65 who have served at least 20 years of their sentence.\n\nLawmakers also approved the Maryland Second Look Act, which aimed to reduce the sentences of some inmates with good behavior credits.\n\nA proposal to scale back the state’s practice of automatically sentencing teen offenders as adults in violent crimes stalled in committee. The bill faced pushback from law enforcement over concerns that the Department of Juvenile Services couldn’t accommodate juveniles with “complex problems.”\n\nBill on sharing sensitive data with immigration officers fails\n\nConcerns over the Trump administration’s immigration policy encouraged some lawmakers to propose the Maryland Data Privacy Act to prevent law enforcement and other local officials from sharing sensitive data with immigration officers. However, the bill failed to receive enough support.\n\nDespite concerns about unregulated police drones, lawmakers decided not to advance a proposal to set guidelines for law enforcement uses of aerial surveillance.\n\nDisabilities\n\nLawmakers passed Eric's ID Law – a measure allowing individuals with invisible disabilities to include a sticker on the bottom of their license, identification or moped operator’s permit. The notation is meant to improve interactions and communication with law enforcement.\n\nReparations\n\nMaryland lawmakers approved the creation of a commission to study the impact of slavery after years of debate and consideration. The Maryland Reparations Commission would make recommendations to the state legislature, providing guidance on what, if any, benefits should be given to those impacted by “historical inequality” by November 2027.\n\nSex abuse\n\nAfter emotional deliberation, lawmakers voted to downsize the monetary compensation the state can provide for sexual abuse lawsuits, amending the amount survivors can file for under the 2023 Child Victims Act.\n\nGender-affirming care\n\nThe legislature chose not to roll back rights for trans people. Republicans introduced a bill that would have made it a felony for a healthcare provider to give hormone replacement therapy to any minor, but the measure did not pass.\n\nIf passed, the Fairness in Girls’ Sports Act would have required both public schools and the nonpublic schools that compete against them to separate sports teams based on the team members’ sex assigned at birth. Similar legislation has been introduced since 2022.\n\nBut the General Assembly also rejected an attempt to expand rights for trans people, turning away a bill to allow “X” as a sex designation on birth certificates for transgender and nonbinary individuals.\n\nHealth\n\nThe legislature considered restricting the distribution of veterinary tranquilizers after neighboring Delaware and Pennsylvania moved to restrict access to the drugs, but the idea failed to garner support.\n\nCNS reporters Emma Tufo, Sasha Allen, Rachel McCrea, Paul Kiefer, Adriana Navarro and Jack Bowman also contributed to this piece.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/08"}]}

The fire rapidly spread to over 35,000 acres overnight as it burned through grasslands in a section of the Los Padres National Park.\n\nBy around 9:30 p.m. PT on July 3, the fire expanded to nearly 52,600 acres and was 10% contained, according to Cal Fire data. Evacuation orders and warnings were issued for small communities near Highway 166 as the fire moved toward the Carrizo Plain National Monument, about 69 miles southeast of San Luis Obispo, California.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Los Angeles said satellite images showed the blaze impacting interior San Luis Obispo County, with a plume of smoke spreading southeast of the fire over Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.

Officials have not released any more information on them.\n\nThe McKinney Fire burns near Yreka, California, Saturday. Fred Greaves/Reuters\n\nAs the weekend ended, the blaze was 0% contained, and firefighters face a long battle ahead as lightning and thunderstorms complicated efforts while the flames raced through dry vegetation.

They evacuated from the campground knowing one of them may return on deployment if the fire grows.\n\n“In 22+ yrs of fire I’ve never experienced anything like this fire behavior at night. It felt absolutely surreal and not just a little apocalyptic,” Grayber tweeted.\n\nThe fire is just one symptom of the American West’s historic drought and the human-caused climate change crisis, which has caused more frequent and more severe wildfires. California’s persistent drought conditions have set the scene for rapid fire spread in the forest, with the fires burning extremely dry, receptive fuels, according to the forest service.\n\nSprinting through dry brush, grass and timber, the fire activity has been extreme, with the flames running uphill, and spotting further out, according to fire officials.\n\n“Klamath National Forest is a big and beautiful forest, but it also has some steep and rugged terrain.

There were 10 different wildfires burning in the Klamath National Forest Sunday afternoon, forest officials said.\n\nThe fires generated their own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds, which are created from the intense heat of the fire forcing air to rise.\n\nTor Mason was one of the hundreds evacuated due to the McKinney Fire. He and his friends fled their homes and arrived at the Klamath River Community Center, only to find the fire closing in, he told CNN affiliate KDRV.\n\n“When I got to the community center it was almost on fire.

Around 6:30 p.m., the Eaton Fire broke out in Altadena near Pasadena and swelled to more than 10,000 acres. By 10:30 p.m. a smaller blaze named the Hurst Fire had ignited in Sylmar, in the San Fernando Valley northwest of downtown Los Angeles and consumed about 500 acres.\n\nThe cause of all three blazes are still under investigation, according to Cal Fire. But the powerful Santa Ana winds are likely driving their rapid growth.\n\n\"The combination of low humidity, dry fuels and shifting winds has heightened the potential for spot fires and rapid expansion,\" Cal Fire said in an update.\n\nHow do wildfires start? The natural and artificial causes of wildfires explained.\n\nEven before the fires started, the National Weather Service had issued its highest alert for extreme fire conditions for much of Los Angeles County. The weather service office in Los Angeles warned Monday that wind gusts could reach 100 mph in some areas this week, prompting \"extreme fire behavior\" wherever blazes ignited.\n\n\"This is a particularly dangerous situation − in other words, this is about as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather,\" the weather service office in Los Angeles warned Monday. \"Stay aware of your surroundings. Be ready to evacuate, especially if in a high fire risk area. Be careful with fire sources.\"\n\nWhat causes wildfires?\n\nA wildfire, an uncontrolled blaze that occurs on open land with vegetation, can be ignited by natural or artificial causes.\n\nLightning is the most common natural cause of wildfires. In higher elevations lightning sometimes strikes dry vegetation, which sparks a fire that can easily become uncontrollable, particularly when fueled by dry winds.\n\nGet weather and fire alerts via text: Sign up to get current wildfire updates by location\n\nIn cities with roads near wildlife, such as in Southern California, it is very common for vehicles to unknowingly ignite a fire, Luca Carmignani, a Fire Advisor from the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, previously told USA TODAY.\n\n'We can expect to see larger wildfires': Climate change helping drive an increase in large wildfires in the US\n\n“For example, you have a truck with a train that drags on the road and generates sparks,” Carmignani said. “Or you have like a catalytic converter, there are different ways that cars and trucks can start a fire from the road.”\n\nStrong winds can cause power lines to move, which may generate sparks that eventually land on dry fuel such as grass or vegetation, Carmignani said. He added that unextinguished campfires are also a prevalent human cause of wildfires.\n\nIs it wildfire season?\n\nHistorically, wildfire season typically begins in July and ends around late November to early December, Carmignani said. This time of year has the driest conditions which are perfect for igniting and burning vegetation.\n\nLast month, the Franklin Fire in scenic Malibu was quickly contained while November’s Mountain Fire burned tens of thousands of acres, destroyed and damaged hundreds of homes in western Ventura County and was the third most destructive wildfire in Southern California since at least 2013, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nLive updates: Fatalities and injuries reported as Southern California wildfires rage\n\nThe National Weather Service's Los Angeles office issued a red flag alert Tuesday, the first in January since 2021, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\"November, December, now January − there’s no fire season, it’s fire year. It’s year-round,\" California Gov.

Warmer temperatures create conditions that make fire behaviors more dangerous, the assessment found.\n\nJon Keeley, a senior research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, previously told USA TODAY climate change isn’t the only reason for the increase in large fires.\n\nIn California, population growth, increasing fire ignitions and the Santa Ana winds are bigger factors in wildfires, Keeley said. These factors don’t appear to be affected by climate change right now, and climate change is likely to be a bigger driver in the northern part of the state rather than the south, he said.\n\nContributing: John Bacon and Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/26/california-park-fire-wildfire-photo-video/74562853007/", "title": "Park Fire damage: Photos, videos capture impact of California wildfire", "text": "The largest wildfire in the West so far this summer continues to grow as firefighters in Northern California battle the blaze.\n\nThe so-called Park Fire has engulfed over 164,000 acres, an area larger than the city of Chicago, near Chico, California since it began on Wednesday, fueled by hot weather, low humidity and strong wind gusts.\n\nOn Thursday, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey announced the arrest of Ronnie Stout, a 42-year-old Chico resident, in connection with the fire.

It’s now the seventh-largest fire in California history and is even producing its own clouds and fire whirls.\n\nThe blaze has more than doubled in size since Friday morning, when it engulfed an area the size of Chicago.\n\nProsecutors allege the fire started when Ronnie Stout sent his mother’s car ablaze 60 feet down an embankment near Alligator Hole in Chico’s Upper Bidwell Park. That gave the fire its match to spread northward across the Sierra Nevada foothills.\n\nTriple-digit temperatures, low humidity and gusty winds contributed to the Park Fire’s rapid growth, officials say. The Park Fire on Saturday has burned an area larger than the size of the city of Los Angeles. So far, the Park Fire has damaged 134 structures, according to Cal Fire on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe area's terrain is steep and rocky, with few roads for firefighters to enter to try to put out fires, Kirsten Larson, a spokesperson for Cal Fire's response, told USA TODAY on Saturday.\n\nSaturday had cooler temperatures, with highs in the upper 80s, and more humidity, according to the National Weather Service’s Sacramento office. Cooler conditions are expected to continue in the coming days before hot weather returns next week.\n\nOfficials hoped these conditions would give some 2,500 firefighters the needed respite to reduce the fire's spread from Butte County into Tehama County, where the majority of the fire is now occurring, as it burns grass, brush, timber and dead vegetation.\n\nEvacuation orders have been issued across eastern Tehama County up to the Shasta County line, nearly 50 miles from the fire’s start. This includes smaller communities approaching Lassen Volcanic National Park.\n\nIn Butte County, evacuation orders and warnings continued through Friday night, the county Sheriff’s Office announced. This included warnings for Magalia in the foothills east of Chico, located just next to Paradise, the California town burned by the 2018 Camp Fire that destroyed 14,000 homes and killed 85 people. The Camp Fire, caused by faulty Pacific Gas & Electric power lines, maxed out at 153,336 acres.\n\nIn total, officials have told nearly 8,700 people to evacuate their homes with the Park Fire, Larson said. The Butte County Fairgrounds, churches and rodeo grounds have been converted to evacuation centers and animal shelters.\n\nFire's extreme behavior, climate change\n\nThe Park Fire has scorched a relatively remote area that hasn’t had a recent fire history, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. The fire has spread across from grasslands in the west, toward the Central Valley, to dense forest, including logging, east into the Sierras.\n\nAt the same time, this month has been the region's hottest on record, Swain said. It hasn't been a particularly dry year, nor has severe drought affected the area. But the heat quickly dried foliage to help fuel the fire in under three days, he said.\n\n“The fire has, continuously since it started, moved incredibly quickly and exhibited continuously extreme behavior,” he said. He pointed to the Park Fire producing its own thunderstorm-like clouds, as well as one or two fire vortices captured on video.\n\nWarmer temperatures and dry conditions caused by climate change are helping fuel massive wildfires. More than that, Swain said, fires are burning more readily through the night, along with fires creating their own weather patterns with winds that can reinforce flames. This allows events like the Park Fire to move much more quickly.\n\nThere are over 100 large wildfires that have burned over 2 million acres across 10 western states and Alaska, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nContributing: Christopher Cann and Dinah Pulver of USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/30/california-wildfire-park-fire-arson-charges-updates/74598770007/", "title": "California wildfire arson suspect says massive blaze was accident", "text": "REDDING, Calif. − A Northern California man charged with arson in one of the largest fires in state history denied claims he pushed a burning car down an embankment and ignited the blaze that has forced evacuation of more than 25,000 people in four counties.\n\nRonnie Dean Stout II, charged Monday with reckless arson and related charges, was being held pending completion of his arraignment Thursday. The Park Fire continued to expand, and Tuesday had burned 600 square miles in Tehama and Butte counties, making it the fifth-largest fire in California history. It was only 14% contained as of the last update Tuesday at 4:17 p.m. Pacific Time by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection − Cal Fire.\n\nThe fire ignited last Wednesday in Upper Bidwell Park, a 3,600-acre municipal park in Chico in Butte County, although the blaze has mostly burned in Tehama County. Additional evacuations in nearby Shasta County were ordered Tuesday.\n\n\"This didn't have to happen,\" Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said at a briefing. He said Stout pulled over to the side of the road but went over a berm and into grass. Ramsey said the fire started when Stout revved his car's engine trying to drive out.\n\nWitnesses said they saw Stout watch his car burn, then push it backward. Ramsey said Stout claims he didn't push the car down the embankment but panicked and left the scene.\n\n\"The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire,\" Ramsey said in statement. The suspect, he said, was \"seen calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.\"\n\nRamsey's office has said Stout has two previous serious felonies on his record, which would make him subject to at least a 25-year prison sentence if convicted of felony arson under California's \"three strikes'' law.\n\nVideo shows a vortex of smoke: Was it a fire tornado?\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ More than 5,000 firefighters were battling the fire, which has burned over 330,000 acres in Tehama County and more than 53,000 acres in Butte County.\n\n∎ The blaze has destroyed at least 165 homes, businesses and other structures, and damaged over a dozen more.\n\n∎ Some evacuations also were ordered in Shasta and Plumas counties.

It was at 900 acres Monday night.\n\nThe Stone Canyon Fire near the town of Lyons prompted Boulder County officials to expand an evacuation area that now includes parts of Larimer County. By 5 p.m. Mountain Time, evacuation orders also applied to parts of Lyons because of \"changing wind conditions,'' according to an alert by Boulder's Office of Disaster Management. Air tankers and 10 firetrucks and other vehicles were contending with the blaze, which was estimated at 85 acres and growing in an earlier alert.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service has taken control of the efforts to contain the Alexander Mountain Fire from Larimer County, but the blaze remained uncontrolled, according to InciWeb. Hundreds fled their homes after mandatory evacuation orders were issued for parts of Larimer County near the Wyoming border.\n\n\"We are still trying to work out our best plan of attack to get around this thing,\" incident commander Mike Smith said in a video update Tuesday. \"There are some challenges directly north.\"\n\nHigh temperatures and low humidity would likely strengthen the blaze, InciWeb warned. \"Significant\" smoke is expected over the next few days. Larimer County Sheriff’s Office Emergency Services Coordinator Justin Whitesell said drawing on firefighting resources from other states was made difficult because of wildfires burning elsewhere.\n\n\"We are doing the best we can with the resources we have,\" he said, adding firefighters were focused on evacuating people and protecting homes.\n\n− Erin Udell and Holly Engelman, Fort Collins Coloradoan\n\nOregon's extreme weather has 'tested our limits'\n\nAlmost 10,000 firefighters were battling 43 large fires across Oregon, the state Forestry Department reported. That does not include \"many of the local and agency government employees, landowners, forestland operators and members of the community who are contributing every day,\" the agency said in an update on the struggle.\n\nOregon's state climatologist, Larry O’Neill, said the state's heat waves will keep getting hotter, contributing to the fires. Deputy Director of Fire Operations Kyle Williams said the extreme weather has \"tested our limits.\" Gov. Tina Kotek has declared a state of emergency, and National Guard teams have been called in to help with the blazes.\n\n“The wildfire situation on the ground is dynamic and challenging, and we need all hands on deck,” Kotek said.\n\nFive years later, couple loses second home to flames\n\nIn California, Butte County resident Rick Pero told KHSL-TV the Park Fire was the second wildfire to destroy his home. Pero and his wife moved to Forest Ranch after losing their previous home to the Camp Fire, which killed 85 people in the Butte County town of Paradise in 2018. After that event, Pero became a fire safety advocate and educated neighbors on maintaining a defensible space around their homes.\n\n“Twenty-eight houses benefited from defensible space and are still standing,\" Pero said. But for his home and a few others, \"it was just too much mother nature,” he said.\n\nFire advisories issued in 6 states\n\nEighty-nine large wildfires are burning nationwide and have scorched more than 3,300 square miles, according to the National Interagency Fire Center report released Tuesday. Fire behavior advisories are in place for parts of California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah and Nevada. Temperatures topping 100 degrees over much of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, combined with breezy southerly winds and low humidity, will promote a \"continued drying trend\" that could bring wildfires to the region, the fire center said.\n\nThere was some good news: \"There are no fire environment concerns in the eastern half of the country, where high humidity and areas of rainfall will continue,\" the fire center said.\n\nFlames 'right by our front door': Wildfires rage across western US\n\nPark Fire fueled by dry vegetation from record heat\n\nThe Park Fire has spread rapidly, fueled by dry vegetation resulting from weeks of record heat. Climate scientist Daniel Swain said that although data is insufficient to confirm claims the weather has been the hottest in thousand of years, \"we can also refute the myriad claims I've been seeing lately that 'it was hot like this all the time when I was a kid!'\" he wrote on social media. \"It most certainly was not.\"\n\nTehama County Sheriff Dave Kain asked evacuees to be patient, saying many areas had appeared ready for residents to return, only to erupt in flames again. \"This fire is extremely unstable and unpredictable,\" Kain said.\n\nPark Fire's massive size: Blaze one of the biggest wildfires in California history\n\nCollapse of 'carbon sink' hastening climate change\n\nForests and other land ecosystems failed to curb climate change in 2023 as intense drought in the Amazon rainforest and record wildfires in Canada hampered absorption of carbon dioxide, according to a study released Monday. A record amount of carbon dioxide entered Earth's atmosphere last year, further feeding global warming, the researchers said.\n\nForests and other land ecosystems on average absorb nearly a third of annual emissions from fossil fuels, industry and other human causes. But in 2023, that \"carbon sink\" collapsed, according to a study from the Laboratory for Climate and Environmental Sciences, a French research organization.\n\n\"The sink is a pump, and we are pumping less carbon from the atmosphere into the land,\" co-author Philippe Ciais said. \"Suddenly the pump is choking, and it's pumping less.\"\n\nWildfire smoke map: Track fires and red flag warnings across the US\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/26/park-fire-wildfire-california-chico-updates/74554661007/", "title": "Park Fire continues to burn thousands more acres in California", "text": "The largest wildfire to break out in the West this summer continued its explosive growth Friday morning as emergency responders in northern California struggled to gain control of the blaze, which has put thousands of residents under evacuation orders and has destroyed homes.\n\nThe so-called Park Fire broke out Wednesday afternoon near the city of Chico and quickly swelled in size as it was fueled by hot weather, low humidity and strong wind gusts. As of Friday morning, the inferno had engulfed over 164,000 acres, an area larger than the city of Chicago.\n\nButte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey on Thursday announced the arrest of a local man accused of pushing his mother's flaming vehicle into a gully, sparking the largest fire that California has seen this year. Ronnie Stout, 42, of Chico, faces at least one charge of arson, though more charges could follow in the days ahead, Ramsey said.\n\nMore than 130 structures have been destroyed by the fire, according to a Cal Fire update posted Friday morning. Some 4,000 residents in unincorporated Butte County were under evacuation orders, said Sheriff Kory Honea at a news conference Thursday night. Other nearby areas, including portions of the city of Chico, were also under evacuation warnings. Honea urged residents to prepare to flee their homes as more evacuation orders could be issued.\n\n\"If the order is given, get the most important things that you have and get out,\" he said, later adding, \"If the fire blows over, I can't make any promise or guarantee that we can get up there to save your life.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom secured a fire management assistance grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to \"ensure the necessary resources are available to suppress the fire,\" according to Cal Fire.\n\nMore than 1,600 personnel were assisting in the effort to quell the flames. Authorities have secured 140 fire engines, dozens of bull dozers and at least six helicopters, Cal Fire said.

Shortly before she left her home in northern Butte County, the fire had crossed the nearby highway, forcing Basil and other residents to take a narrow, winding backroad instead.\n\nBasil slept at her friend's home in Chico, where she plans on staying until the evacuation order is lifted.\n\n\"Fire season is the hardest time of the year,\" she said.\n\nButte County has a history of historic wildfires\n\nThe residents in Butte County and surrounding areas are all too familiar with rapidly spreading wildfires.\n\nIn 2018, the Camp Fire devastated the area, particularly the town of Paradise, killing 85 people and destroying 14,000 homes. It remains the deadliest wildfire in California history, the deadliest wildfire in 100 years in the U.S. and it was the costliest natural disaster in the world in 2018.\n\nThe fire was eventually tied to power lines maintained by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which pleaded guilty to one count of gross negligence and 84 individual counts of involuntary manslaughter – one for each person who was killed in the wildfire.\n\nIn 2021, the Dixie Fire stretched across Butte and several other counties, burning nearly 1 million acres and more than 700 homes, the largest single wildfire in state history. The historic wildfire was eventually tied to Pacific Gas & Electric Co. power lines.\n\nProsecutor: Man pushed flaming vehicle off embankment\n\nStout was arrested around 2 a.m. Thursday after police had surrounded his trailer in Chico, Ramsey, the Butte County district attorney, said at a news conference.\n\nRamsey said Butte was being held in Butte County jail with no possibility of bail until he's arraigned on Monday afternoon, \"undoubtedly under a count of arson.\"\n\nRamsey said it was a witness account that had tied Stout to the fire. The witness saw Stout standing by his mother's vehicle, watching it as a fire appeared under the car's front-left side, Ramsey said. Stout then, according to the witness, got in the vehicle for a short period of time before he got out and pushed it off the embankment.\n\n\"We are here today because of that,\" said Ramsey, whose family has been evacuated because of the blaze.\n\nOver a million acres burning in active wildfire\n\nFirefighters are monitoring 89 large active wildfires across 10 western states and Alaska, encompassing 1.2 million acres. The size and severity of the fires are driven largely in part by climate change as warmer temperatures, high winds and dry conditions help fuel fires.\n\n\"Climate change is leading to larger and more severe wildfires in the western United States,\" the National Climate Assessment reported.\n\nAt least 26,825 wildfires have been reported in the U.S. this year, 6,000 fewer fires than the 10-year average year to date, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.

That's about a third the size of Delaware.\n\nThe blaze burning near the coast of Northern California unseated the 2018 Mendocino Complex Fire, which had reigned as the state's largest fire for two years at 459,000 acres. The Mendocino Complex Fire burned in another part of the same forest where the August Complex Fire currently rages on.\n\nThe August Complex Fire started Aug. 17 during a series of lightning strikes that ignited 37 different fires. It was 24% contained Thursday.\n\nAbout 40 fires are burning in California weeks before the autumn months, which typically bring the year'ss most devastating blazes. Overall, across the West, 16 people have died and an area the size of Connecticut has burned in fires this month.\n\n“We are hitting the record books in ways that we never would have imagined, and definitely not records that we like breaking,” said Daniel Berlant, an assistant deputy director at Cal Fire. Check out satellite images of the fires here.\n\nFire behavior getting more extreme\n\nCalifornia wildfires are growing bigger and moving faster than ever before, the Associated Press reported. One of the major concerns with this trend is it leaves less time for warnings and evacuations.\n\nRecently “we have seen multiple fires expand by tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours, and 30 years or more ago that just wasn’t fire behavior that we saw,” said Jacob Bendix, a professor of geography and the environment at Syracuse University who studies wildfires.\n\nWarmer temperatures and years of drought, conditions related to climate change, are some of the prime factors in this fire behavior trend. And fast-moving fires are difficult to predict.\n\n“When you have a fire run 15 miles in one day, in one afternoon, there’s no model that can predict that,” U.S. Forest Service forester Steve Lohr said. “The fires are behaving in such a way that we’ve not seen.”\n\nAnother reason to stay home?\n\nState air quality officials said it's rare that so many Californians are breathing in air polluted by lung-damaging particles. It's a more widespread effect of the brutal fire season, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.\n\n“What’s notable is that it’s everywhere,” said Anthony Wexler, director of the Air Quality Research Center at UC Davis. “So no matter which way the wind blows you’re getting hit by smoke and ash. It’s pretty brutal.”\n\nMany people have remained indoors as they practice physical distancing amid the coronavirus health crisis, which impacts the respiratory system. The health effects of the air due to wildfire smoke include irritation to the eyes, nose and throat. It can cause asthma attacks and increase the risk of heart attacks and stroke.\n\nChildren, pregnant women, the elderly, outdoor workers and people with asthma or other chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are most at risk.\n\nWildfire smoke sends more smog-forming pollutants in the air, according to the Los Angeles Times. Over Labor Day weekend, the smog in downtown L.A. was the worst it has been in nearly 30 years.\n\nThe levels were so far above normal it prompted a quality control check to prevent the release of any wrong data.\n\nThe Redding Record Searchlight in Northern California reports the unhealthy conditions are likely to continue through the weekend.

There were no new evacuation orders issued as of Thursday, McLean said.\n\nIs the Mosquito Fire contained?\n\nApproximately 3,600 firefighters were working the Mosquito Fire by Thursday, according to McLean. The fire's containment dropped to 20% Wednesday as its size increased by more than 12 square miles in the Foresthill area.\n\n\"The fire made some significant runs, so it increased in size and they ended up stretching the line out a little bit farther, so the containment went down accordingly,\" McLean said. \"It's something that definitely can happen, especially the last few years with such volatility of the vegetation,\" he said.\n\nHURRICANE SEASON CONTINUES: Tropical Storm Fiona forms in Atlantic, headed toward Puerto Rico\n\nCrews were running burning operations to remove fuel from the front of the fire, but the fire is expected to burn into the Eldorado and Tahoe National Forests, according to McLean.\n\n\"There are a lot of efforts, a lot of heavy equipment, a lot of personnel out ahead of it on the east side,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nHow is weather impacting the Mosquito Fire?\n\nCooler weather, a lack of extreme winds and high daytime humidity levels of 30% has helped firefighters battle the blaze, according to McLean. Winds Thursday and Friday weren't forecast to be \"all that strong,\" AccuWeather senior meteorologist John Feerick said.\n\n\"Hopefully, (firefighters) can make a little bit of inroads over the next couple of days because it does look like over the weekend, there's going to be a storm moving in to the West Coast,\" Feerick told USA TODAY.\n\nConditions could turn windy ahead of the storm, causing problems for firefighters, he said. Any rain arriving with the storm would \"certainly help matters,\" he added.\n\nSmoke from the Mosquito Fire lowered air quality in the Sacramento region, including Placer and El Dorado counties, to unhealthy levels Thursday, according to the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District.\n\n\"The last couple of days, it's been really smoky in the Reno area and western Nevada, and if anything, that's probably going to get worse the next couple of days,\" Feerick said.\n\nScientists say climate change has made the West warmer and drier over the past three decades and will continue to increase extreme weather events and more frequent, destructive wildfires.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}]}

The full vaccine series is 97% effective against measles, but even one shot provides 93% effectiveness, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nMeasles had been declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, the CDC said. But as MMR vaccination rates have decreased, measles has surged back.\n\nIn 2024, 33 states reported 285 measles cases, and 89% of cases were among people who weren’t vaccinated or had no known vaccination status, the CDC said. About 40% of cases resulted in hospitalization.\n\nAs of Feb. 7, the CDC reported 14 cases of measles in 2025. The agency said updates are posted monthly.\n\nIn 2024, CDC reported coverage for all vaccines in children enrolled in kindergarten fell below 93%, with uptake of the vaccine at 92.7%, below the 95% threshold health experts say is needed to prevent outbreaks.\n\nWhat are measles symptoms?\n\nSymptoms can begin seven to 14 days after exposure to the measles virus, according to the CDC. The disease can cause severe complications and death in rare cases.\n\nSymptoms can include:\n\nHigh fever;\n\nCough;\n\nRunny nose;\n\nRed, watery eyes.\n\nSmall white bumps can begin to appear in a person's mouth two to three days after symptom onset. A rash may begin to spread three to five days after symptom onset.\n\nHow does measles spread?\n\nMeasles virus spreads when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks and another person inhales droplets, Mayo Clinic said. People can also get infected by touching a surface with virus and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nMeasles stays in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after a sick person leaves a room. It can spread before someone knows they are sick. People can spread it for about eight days − four days before a rash appears and four days while they have a rash, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nHow serious is measles?\n\nAbout 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles end up hospitalized, the CDC said. One in 20 children who get it end up with pneumonia, the most common cause of death in infected children.\n\nEncephalitis, or brain swelling, occurs in 1 in 1,000 children who contracts measles, the CDC said. This can lead to deafness, convulsions or intellectual disabilities.\n\nBetween 1 and 3 of every 1,000 children who get measles die from respiratory or neurologic complications. Unvaccinated women who are pregnant can have babies born prematurely or low birthweight, which can cause long-term issues for a child's development.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/08/06/legionnaires-disease-harlem-nyc-cluster-outbreak/85540128007/", "title": "Legionnaires' disease cluster in NYC grows: 3 dead, 67 sickened", "text": "Three people have died and more than 60 others are sickened in a growing Legionnaires' disease cluster in New York City, according to officials.\n\nThe cluster, which began July 25, has led to 67 Legionnaires' disease diagnoses in Central Harlem as of Aug. 5, according to the NYC Department of Health's latest update.\n\nThe source of the cluster is believed to be a cooling tower in the area, according to the agency.\n\nLegionnaires' disease is a severe pneumonia caused by a type of bacteria called Legionella, which grows in warm water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhere is the NYC Legionnaires' cluster?\n\nNYC Health said the Legionnaires' disease cluster is affecting the following Central Harlem zip codes:\n\n10027\n\n10030\n\n10035\n\n10037\n\n10039\n\nThe agency previously said the likely source of the bacteria causing the Legionnaires' cluster is a cooling tower in the area.\n\nAfter testing, 11 cooling towers in the area of the cluster had positive results for the Legionella bacteria.

In previous years, 6 to 13 cases were typically confirmed annually in Genesee County.\n\nDr. Eden Wells, chief medical executive for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, explained why three more cases, including two deaths and an illness, were added, during an interview with the Free Press.\n\nState epidemiologists went back through all cases of the disease in Michigan from 2014 and 2015 and checked for any ties to Genesee County, she said. They found one person lived in another county, but had been hospitalized in Flint, which made it a linked case to the outbreak.\n\nThere was also a glitch with the system used to report cases electronically, so two of the cases sent by a hospital didn’t make it to the health department, she said.\n\n“It wasn’t anything intentional,” Wells said. “We were actually pretty worried when we heard about two cases that hadn’t been reported because that is a public health code violation, but it turned out that it was a glitch.”\n\nThe announcement about the increase in confirmed cases came a day after the Free Press ran a report that identified eight people who were diagnosed with Legionnaires’ and later died.\n\nWhy were officials silent on Legionnaires' in Flint?\n\nHealth officials now say five of the deaths occurred from June 2014 through March 2015 and seven deaths during a second spike of the outbreak from May 2015 to October 2015.\n\n“I think we need to keep in mind that it’s still part of the same outbreak,” Wells said. “It grew in numbers up, but it’s not changed the outbreak timing.”\n\nThe source of the outbreak has not been definitively determined or directly connected to the municipal water system, but the illnesses began after Flint changed its water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River in April 2014.\n\nInvestigators looked at a several potential exposures including hospitals, water and community venues, health officials said.\n\n“The investigation was able to identify a common source of exposure for 50 individuals (55%) of the 91 total confirmed cases, which is a hospital in Flint,\" a release issued by the state health department said.\n\nFaces of Legionnaires’ cases in the Flint area\n\nHealth officials did not identify which hospital, but said it is served by Flint's municipal water system and the situation has been remediated there.\n\nThe Free Press found that seven of the eight people identified in an article Sunday were treated at McLaren Flint for other ailments shortly before their Legionnaires’ diagnoses.\n\nMcLaren Flint tested for the Legionella bacteria — which health experts say is often found in water and can lead to Legionnaires’ disease — in 2014, amid an increase in Legionnaires' cases and concerns about the water supply. Hospital officials say a low level of the bacteria was found and that they responded quickly with preventive measures.\n\nA hospital spokeswoman could not be immediately reached for comment today. In a statement sent last month, McLaren Flint spokeswoman Laurie Prochazka said the hospital has followed “all statutory regulations and notification requirements.”\n\nThe hospital, along with current and former employees of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, is being sued by families who got ill and families whose relatives died.\n\nThose most at risk to get Legionnaires’ disease include current or former smokers, people with chronic lung disease and those with a weak immune system.\n\nWells cautioned that if there is another case in the Flint area, it doesn’t mean there’s a new outbreak. She said if there’s more than one case, health officials will look extensively to see if there are any common sources that can be identified between cases.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Jim Ananich criticized the handling of the outbreak after new numbers were released and called for more help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“I'm not confident the Department of Health and Human Services can handle another outbreak, never mind this one,” he said in a statement.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nick Lyon, director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, is expected to testify before Congress about the Flint water crisis and the Legionnaires' disease outbreak.\n\nOther than the raw numbers, state health officials have released little information about the identities of the people who got sick or died during the Legionnaires' disease outbreak, including names.\n\nJennifer Eisner, a spokeswoman with the state health department, said health officials are aware of all the cases in Free Press articles over the weekend.\n\nContact Elisha Anderson: 313-222-5144 or eanderson@freepress.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/08/13/legionnaires-disease-bacteria-infection-virus-new-hampshire-lincoln-water-tower-symptoms-illness/74778686007/", "title": "Legionnaire's disease identified in NH.

They aim to prevent spread of the disease, which is caused by the Legionella bacteria. Cooling towers in Tompkins County, and across New York state, are subject to the new regulations starting Sept. 16.\n\nLegionella gets its name from an outbreak that killed 29 people attending an American Legion event at a Philadelphia hotel in 1976. Legionnaires’ disease is a severe form of bacterial pneumonia.\n\nOne case of Legionnaires’ disease was reported in Tompkins County this year, Tompkins Public Health Engineer Stephen Maybee said.\n\n“We’re struggling to identify cooling towers in Tompkins County,” Maybee said. “We don’t know where all these towers are.”\n\nCooling towers are heat rejection devices that radiate waste heat into the atmosphere by cooling a water stream.\n\nBuilding owners will need to self-identify that they have a cooling tower and have the device registered, inspected and tested, Maybee added. Cooling tower registration can be completed at ny.gov/services/register-cooling-tower-and-submit-reports.\n\nThe county health department is tasked with enforcing the new regulations, but local officials are still working out how they will take action against unregistered cooling towers, Maybee said.\n\n“We don’t really have any guidance on that,” he added. The county health department will first seek to educate the public on the new regulations before enacting any punishments.\n\nPeople contract the sickness when they breathe in a mist or vapor containing the bacteria, such as the water droplets sprayed from a hot tub that hasn’t been properly cleaned, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bacteria does not spread from person to person, like the flu or a cold.\n\nMost people exposed to Legionella don’t become sick. Smokers, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems are more susceptible than others to Legionnaires’ disease, according to the Mayo Clinic. Symptoms include fever, chills, headaches and muscle pain, which can progress to coughing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting and difficulty breathing.\n\nLegionella also can cause a milder disease, called Pontiac fever, with symptoms similar to the flu.\n\nBetween 5 percent and 30 percent of patients with Legionnaires’ die, according to the CDC.\n\n“Legionella is a very serious bacteria, and I think we all have to take it (seriously),” Maybee said.\n\nUSA TODAY staff writer Liz Szabo contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Andrew Casler on Twitter @AndrewCasler.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/08/10/facts-legionnaires-disease/31409455/", "title": "Could the hot tub at the gym give you Legionnaires' disease?", "text": "Linda Lombroso\n\nllombros@lohud.com\n\nThe Legionnaires’ disease outbreak that killed 12 people in the Bronx – and sickened a Rockland resident who works at Chromalloy in Orangeburg – has renewed concerns about the pneumonia-like illness, first discovered in 1976 in Philadelphia.\n\nLate last week, New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that the health department will provide free Legionella testing for buildings statewide that have cooling towers or evaporative condenser units. The Legionella bacteria can cause Legionnaires' disease, also known as legionellosis. It is usually treated successfully with antibiotics.\n\nUPDATE:Legionnaires' disease cases in Rockland isolated, official says\n\nIn one of the earliest outbreaks of the illness, in 1978, Westchester neurosurgeon Dr. Ezriel Kornel — working as an intern at a Washington, D.C. hospital — suspected a young patient with symptoms of severe pneumonia actually had Legionnaires' disease. Kornel immediately put the patient on a course of antibiotics. \"He was the first person in Washington to survive Legionnaires',\" he said.\n\nFAQs about Legionnaires' disease\n\nCan you catch Legionnaires’ disease if somebody with the illness sneezes on you?\n\nNo. The Legionella bacteria cannot be spread from one person to another.\n\nIf the bacteria have been found in cooling towers, can’t you also be exposed to Legionella when walking under a dripping air conditioning unit?\n\nNo. The bacteria do not seem to grow in window air conditioners. They can flourish, however, in warm water in decorative fountains, large plumbing systems, hot water tanks and hot tubs.\n\nSo using a hot tub at the gym or a hotel — or even a friend’s house — can put you at risk for Legionnaire’s disease?\n\nYes. Hot tubs that are not disinfected properly can become contaminated with Legionella. You can get infected with the bacteria by breathing in contaminated steam or mist.\n\nHow do you check on the safety of a hot tub?\n\nAsk a hot-tub operator to show you the most recent health inspection score. A hot tub needs to have its disinfectant and pH levels checked at least twice a day, and more often when used by many people. You can also use pool test strips to check for adequate free chlorine, bromine and/or pH levels (guidelines are available from the CDC). Hot tubs need regular maintenance, including scrubbing to remove slime and replacement of the water filter and the water.\n\nWho is most at risk for getting sick from Legionnaires’ disease?\n\nPeople with compromised immune systems, chronic illness or end-stage renal disease. Smokers, those with diabetes or HIV, and the elderly are also at increased risk. The disease is rare among children.\n\nDoes everyone who inhales Legionella bacteria get Legionnaire’s disease?\n\nNo. Most people have resistance to the disease.\n\nSources: CDC, New York State Department of Health, Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/07/11/arizona-pneumonic-plague-death-what-to-know/84597349007/", "title": "Arizona patient died of plague infection, say health officials", "text": "Corrections & clarifications: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated when plague was first introduced to the U.S. Plague first occurred in the U.S. in 1900.\n\nA Northern Arizona patient died this week after becoming infected with a severe form of plague, according to public health officials.\n\n“(We) recently cared for a patient in the Flagstaff Medical Center Emergency Department and despite appropriate initial management and attempts to provide life-saving resuscitation, the patient did not recover,” Northern Arizona Healthcare (NAH) said in a statement to USA TODAY on July 11, adding that the patient died that same day.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Health Services has conducted rapid diagnostic testing and issued a \"presumptive diagnosis of Yersinia pestis, the bacteria that causes the plague,\" NAH said in a statement.\n\nPlague is the same illness that killed millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages.

In the previous case, the patient contracted the disease after interacting with an infected dead animal.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Health Services did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's requests for comment.\n\nWhat is Yersinia pestis and what does it have to do with plague?\n\nYersinia pestis is a bacterium that causes a potentially life-threatening disease called plague. Plague is spread among wild rodents and other animals. Doctors can cure human patients of the disease with antibiotics, but it must be treated promptly, according to the CDC.\n\nHumans usually contract plague from being bitten by an infected flea or by touching an infected animal, the CDC said.\n\nWhen was plague first reported in the U.S.?\n\nPlague was first reported in the U.S. in 1900 from rat–infested steamships sailing in from affected areas, according to the CDC. This led to epidemics in port cities, and the last urban plague epidemic in the country was in Los Angeles from 1924 through 1925. After that, plague spread from urban rats to rural rodent species, becoming common in parts of the western United States. Plague has since occurred in many rural areas.\n\nIn 1996, there were five human cases reported in the U.S. Two out of five infected patients died, with neither being formally diagnosed until after succumbing to the illness, according to the CDC.\n\nPlague was first reported in the U.S. in 1996. At the time, two out of five infected patients died, with neither being formally diagnosed until after succumbing to the illness, according to the CDC.\n\nInvestigators said one of the patients in 1996, an 18-year-old, likely became infected about six days before his first doctor’s visit when he was bitten by fleas while walking through a prairie dog colony in Navajo County, about 103 miles east of Flagstaff, Arizona. Investigators found traces of the bacterium in multiple pet dogs living near the prairie dog colony, the report said.\n\nPrairie dogs are \"highly susceptible to plague but are not considered a long-term reservoir of the disease,\" according to officials in Coconino County, where the most recent patient died. The county's statement also said the death is not related to recent reports of prairie dog deaths nearby.\n\nSymptoms and what to do if you suspect you have the disease\n\nCoconino County health officials said symptoms in humans typically appear within one to eight days after exposure.\n\nAccording to the CDC, there are three primary forms of plague:\n\nBubonic plague – Bubonic plague is most commonly spread via a flea bite. After a two to eight day incubation period, patients may develop fever, headache, chills, weakness and one or more swollen, painful lymph nodes.\n\n– Bubonic plague is most commonly spread via a flea bite. After a two to eight day incubation period, patients may develop fever, headache, chills, weakness and one or more swollen, painful lymph nodes. Septicemic plague – Septicemic plague is most commonly spread through flea bites or exposure to infected animals. Patients develop fever, chills, weakness, abdominal pain, shock, and possibly bleeding into the skin and other organs. Skin and some tissues can turn black and die, primarily on fingers, toes, and the nose. Septicemic plague can develop on its own or from untreated bubonic plague.\n\n– Septicemic plague is most commonly spread through flea bites or exposure to infected animals. Patients develop fever, chills, weakness, abdominal pain, shock, and possibly bleeding into the skin and other organs. Skin and some tissues can turn black and die, primarily on fingers, toes, and the nose. Septicemic plague can develop on its own or from untreated bubonic plague. Pneumonic plague – Pneumonic plague is the most serious form of the disease. It occurs when someone has untreated bubonic or septicemic plague in their lungs, or when a person inhales infectious droplets coughed out by another person or animal with pneumonic plague. The incubation period of pneumonic plague following inhalation can be as short as 1 day. Pneumonic plague is the only form of plague that can be spread from person to person. Patients develop fever, headache, weakness and pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough and sometimes bloody or watery mucus.\n\nTo avoid contracting the disease, county officials suggest staying away from wild animals; using veterinarian-approved flea treatments on pets; removing brush, rock piles, trash, and lumber from around homes and outbuildings; and avoiding campsites next to rodent burrows.\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

McDermott\n\nDemocrat and Chronicle\n\nThe Michigan city of Flint became ground zero of the nation's latest public-health outrage when it was learned in recent months that its tap water contained unsafe levels of toxic lead.\n\nThough the aqueous cause of its lead problem is unusual, Flint is otherwise far from unique. Many American cities, including Rochester, continue to struggle with lead poisoning, particularly of children.\n\nIn fact, despite years of successful anti-lead work locally, the proportion of children in Rochester found to have elevated levels of lead in their blood still was roughly double that of their counterparts in Flint in 2014, the most recent year for which comparable data are available.\n\n\"We have had a huge amount of progress here. We’ve had a nearly 90 percent reduction in the number of kids with elevated blood lead levels in the past 15 years,\" said Katrina Smith Korfmacher, an associate professor of environmental medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center who has long been involved in local anti-lead efforts. \"But I would say it’s still a serious, or an ongoing, problem. The point is, it won’t ever go away entirely, because there is lead in the environment.\"\n\nThe lion's share of lead poisoning in the Rochester area is ascribed to inhalation and ingestion of the lead-paint dust and chips that can be found in older homes. The contribution made by lead that can be found in the tap water of some city homes has never been documented, though experts presume it is relatively minor.\n\nLead was used in pipes, solder, paint, gasoline and many other products in decades gone by. Today, it is known to be highly toxic, especially to children. Lead, which accumulates in the body and remains there, has been proven to cause learning disabilities, behavior problems, slowed growth, hearing difficulties and many other problems. Medical experts say no amount of lead is considered safe.\n\nFlint, which is half the size of Rochester, has been rocked in recent months by the revelation that a switch to a new source of drinking water in 2014 triggered the release of lead from water pipes. That lead found its way into the tap water of some homes in Flint, contributing to a sudden increase in the number of children there with unacceptably high levels of lead in their bodies.\n\nLocal and state government officials have been widely excoriated for failing to prevent the problem and for trying to minimize it in the face of widespread complaints. Federal officials are investigating, and many citizens are supportive of lawsuits that have been filed against the city and state of Michigan\n\nThe woes of residents of Flint, a relatively poor city where General Motors was once the dominant employer, have given fresh focus to the issue of urban lead poisoning in Rochester and many other cities.\n\n\"I’m appalled and heartbroken that it took the tragedy in Flint to reignite this conversation,\" said Elizabeth McDade, program director for the Coalition to Prevent Lead Poisoning in Rochester. \"Those kids are going to need decades of assistance.\"\n\nRochester: Progress on lead\n\nIn Rochester, scientists, public-health advocates, government officials and others began to push about 15 years ago for a concerted effort to reduce lead exposure in Rochester, which was rampant. The coalition was formed then, and Mayor William A. Johnson Jr. and County Executive Maggie Brooks jointly committed to the undertaking.\n\nA decade ago, Rochester’s City Council enacted a lead-based paint poisoning prevention ordinance targeting rental housing in high-risk neighborhoods.\n\nThe problem here is old housing stock, both rental and owner-occupied.\n\nPaint containing lead was legal for sale until 1978, and paint with very high levels of the toxic metal was common before 1950. The older the home, the more layers of lead paint are likely to remain on woodwork, floors, doors, windows and walls.\n\nNinety-five percent of all the housing units in Rochester were built before 1980 and thus could contain lead paint. Two-thirds of those units date to the years before 1950. Most suburban villages and inner-ring suburbs in Monroe County also have older homes with potential lead contamination.\n\n\"We live in old wooden homes. That’s just the nature of our housing,\" McDade said.\n\nDust and chips containing lead come loose over time, particularly from painted surfaces like windows and doors that are subject to repetitive wear. As well, dangerous amounts of dust can be generated by improper home renovations, McDade said.\n\n\"All it takes is a sugar packet's worth of dust to consider a home contaminated,\" McDade said.\n\nUnder the city ordinance, all pre-1978 single and double rental housing units are inspected for loose lead paint. Deteriorated paint, both inside and outside the properties, must have a protective covering and must be repaired using lead-safe work practices. The law provides for follow-up inspections.\n\nMore than 129,000 inspections have been conducted by city officials since the law went into effect.\n\nThe city and county also have doled out $28 million in federal grants to low-income homeowners and some landlords to pay for lead-paint abatement work.\n\nRochester’s efforts have been held out as a national model, and the ordinance was praised last year in a series of stories by the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n\n\"Our community has a lot to be grateful for and thankful for. Local government and organizations have done a lot,\" McDade said. ''The results of all those efforts are clear in the data.\"\n\nAt the time the city ordinance was passed, as many as 90 percent of children living in high-risk neighborhoods reported elevated blood-lead levels. Since that time, the number of poisoned children has plummeted to a tenth of what it was.\n\nFlint water crisis a reminder of lead danger\n\nStill, problems remain. In 2014, the most recent year for which data are available, nearly 500 children in the city and adjoining portions of some suburbs were found with blood-lead levels above five micrograms per deciliter, the point now considered \"poisoned.\" Another 23 children living elsewhere in suburban Monroe County were found with lead above that level.\n\nThat worked out to about 7.4 percent of children tested in the city who were lead-poisoned. The parallel figure for children under the age of six in the city of Flint was 3.9 percent poisoned.\n\n\"People start thinking that somehow, because they don’t live in Flint, they’re perfectly safe,\" McDade said. \"That’s not true.\"\n\nBad pipes, good water\n\nIn Flint, like Rochester, lead paint was the prime suspect in lead poisoning in children. Its problems weren't as acute as Rochester's, perhaps because its housing stock is not as old, and the percentage of children who tested with elevated levels had been declining, according to published statistics.\n\nThat decline ended in mid-2014, after the city switched to a different water supply.\n\nThe new supply, from the Flint River, did not contain lead. But it contained minerals or other material that made the water corrosive. When that water sat in pipes that were made of lead or were joined with lead-based solder, it caused the metal to leach into the water.\n\nThe blood-lead level spiked in people who lived in homes served by pipes containing lead. The corrosive water causes other problems as well, including bacteria contamination and discoloration. The water is suspected in an outbreak of deadly Legionnaire's disease and for odd rashes about which some residents complain.\n\nBecause it was inexpensive and easily workable, lead was a popular choice for plumbing pipes up until the 1930s. Even after that, lead was commonly used in the solder that held copper pipes together. Lead-based solder was banned in the late 1980s, but until 2014 fixtures such as spigots and faucets could contain as much as 8 percent lead and still be certified \"lead-free.\"\n\nSo Rochester, just like Flint, owns plenty of pure lead service lines leading from the water main under the street to the curb — about 23,000 of them, or 40 percent of all city services. An unknown number of privately owned lead services feed water into homes, and even more houses likely have lead solder.\n\nThe Monroe County Water Authority, which serves the surburbs, said it has no lead services.\n\nBut the big difference between here and Flint is that our water is not considered corrosive. This is true for the city supply, which comes from Hemlock and Canadice lakes, about 30 miles south of Rochester, and for the water authority's primary supply, Lake Ontario.\n\n\"Do we have lead pipes? Yes, we have lead pipes. But that’s not what poisoned the kids in Flint. It was the corrosive water,\" McDade said. \"To my knowledge, whatever levels might be found in our municipal water are not a major cause for concern. Flint is really an anomaly, a horrific anomaly.\"\n\nDave Rowley, chief of water quality operations for the City Water Bureau, said our water supply is remarkably stable.\n\n\"We're lucky to have the same source of water for 140 years now,\" he said. \"What that means for us is that the water hasn't changed for us in terms of chemistry in a long time.\"\n\nNonetheless, parameters that measure the water's corrosiveness are monitored continually at the city plant near Hemlock Lake to ensure the water remains neutral. The water authority does the same at its two Lake Ontario plants.\n\nAnd because local water is so non-corrosive, nobody has paid the issue much attention.\n\n\"It’s not an issue that’s on our radar very much,\" said John Ricci, a spokesman for the Monroe County Public Health Department.\n\nRicci termed it unlikely that county health officials would test tap water when they make a home visit after a child has been diagnosed with lead poisoning.\n\n\"Normally when we talk about lead poisoning and the exposure pathway, we don’t usually think of water,\" he said. \"It's like that old expression — when you hear hoof beats, think of horses, not zebras. Normally when you think about lead, you think about paint and about dust.\"\n\nStill, there's lead in water\n\nLead does, however, contaminate tap water in some Rochester homes. \"We’re not representing that our water is not going to pick up any lead from plumbing,\" Rowley said. \"That would not be accurate.\"\n\nThe number of homes affected and the concentration of lead are not known. Likewise, it is not clear what contribution lead in tap water makes to the elevated blood-lead levels in some Rochester children. Local experts said they weren't aware that any such assessment had been made.\n\nNationwide, 10 percent to 20 percent of the lead that poisons children comes from tap water, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nEven though local water is not unusually corrosive, lead can and does leach into water as it stands in pipes. This happens in both city and suburbs, though the problem is more pronounced in the city, where there are more pure-lead pipes.\n\n\"We would love to have zero lead exposure from water. It is not from the source. It comes from the service piping and plumbing in folks’ homes,\" Rowley said.\n\nThe regulation of lead in drinking water is atypical in that no hard-and-fast standards have been set for lead in drinking water as has been done for contaminants such as bacteria and arsenic. There is no systemic way for government to monitor for its presence, in fact, because the lead originates in homes' plumbing — and each home's plumbing is different.\n\nInstead, the EPA simply requires water suppliers like the city and the authority to sample for lead in the tap water of a small number of homes every three years. This is done solely to double-check that the water hasn't become more corrosive, though results are shared with the homes' occupants.\n\nThis limited testing opens a small window on the extent of lead contamination of our tap water.\n\nEach agency does roughly 50 homes per round. To capture worst-case data, the sampling is done at properties with lead services or, in the water authority's case, in older homes where lead solder might be present.\n\nAnd each time these samples are analyzed, elevated lead levels are found in at least a few of them in both city and suburbs.\n\nIn Rochester, in fact, it's commonplace to find tap water that exceeds both the World Health Organization lead guideline of 10 parts per billion and the EPA action level of 15 ppb.\n\nOne city home measured 55 ppb in 2003. In 2009, the highest was 42 ppb and six of 55 city samples equaled or surpassed the EPA action level. That placed Rochester within a statistical whisker of violating the agency's rules.\n\nAlarmed that something might have gone awry with the city's water chemistry, officials did immediate follow-up testing. Lower levels satisfied them there was no systemic problem, Rowley said.\n\nIn samples taken this summer, 90 percent of homes tested in the city had lead levels of 9.7 ppb or lower, and the average was 3.8 ppb, well under the EPA action level.\n\nIn water authority territory, the highest value measured since 1997 is 26 ppb, one of only two occasions on which tap water from an authority customer has exceeded the EPA action level. The authority has never come close to violating the EPA lead rule, executive engineer Richard Metzger said.\n\nWhen the city or the authority stumble on a home with elevated lead in its water, officials notify the resident and offer advice on how to address the problem. In the city's 2015 sampling, three such homes were identified, with the highest lead level coming in at 19 ppb. Advice given to residents is simple and straightforward: Run cold water for a minute or two before using it in order to flush out the pipes inside the home, and never use hot water for cooking or drinking.\n\nHot water is not only more corrosive, but it has typically sat stagnant for a longer period of time, and can hold more dissolved solids such as lead.\n\nGovernment involvement doesn't go beyond advice-giving.\n\n\"We’d love to replace all of it and get rid of lead-bearing piping,\" Rowley said. \"But that is not feasible or practical.\"\n\nSORR@Gannett.com\n\nMCDERMOT@Gannett.com\n\nPreventing lead exposure\n\nALWAYS run tap water for a minute or more before using it, until it becomes noticeably colder. That simple practice gets rid of any water in pipes that may have picked up lead.\n\nNEVER use hot tap water for drinking or cooking.\n\nAlways keep painted surfaces in good condition to minimize deterioration.\n\nTalk to your landlord about fixing peeling or chipping paint.\n\nDon’t try to remove lead-based paint yourself.\n\nWhen renovating, hire only EPA- or state-approved Lead-Safe certified firms.\n\nBefore buying, renting or renovating, have your home checked for lead-based paint. If you live in Rochester, the city will conduct a free inspection to determine if there is lead paint in the home. If there is, they can recommend ways to address it. In the suburbs, private contractors will provide those services for under $200.\n\nRegularly clean floors, window sills and other surfaces.\n\nWash children’s hands, bottles, pacifiers and toys often.\n\nRemove shoes or wipe soil off of your shoes before entering your house.\n\nTo see if you have a lead service bringing water into your home, check the pipe that enters your water meter. If it is silvery, scratch it with a metal object. If that leaves a shiny line, it likely is lead.

Some remote-work arrangements began much earlier.\n\nLess than half – 46% – of the 2.3 million federal employees were eligible for remote work and about 10% were fully remote, meaning they worked from home all the time or part time, according to a report by the Office of Management and Budget in August.\n\nTelework and hybrid schedules boosted productivity and made it much easier for them to manage their daily lives and family schedules, according to federal employees who spoke with USA TODAY.\n\nMad scramble for parking and cubicles\n\nThe transition from remote work has been bumpy. Federal agencies shed so much office space to reduce costs after the pandemic work-from-home order that there are now too many people for the available space.\n\nFederal employees say they get in early to jockey for parking spots, desks, chairs and basic supplies, rely on spotty internet connections and retreat to their cars to discuss sensitive or classified matters out of earshot of co-workers. Some people have set up makeshift offices inside supply closets.\n\nOf the six passenger elevators that reach the higher floors of a 30-story building in downtown Atlanta that houses the Internal Revenue Service and other federal agencies that serve the public, only one is in service, forcing long waits for federal employees and the visiting public.

People showed up before 6:30 or 7 a.m. to find a parking space, and leaving campus at the end of the workday could take as long as 30 minutes because of the backup.\n\nScouting for spots to have secure or sensitive conversations, some people worked out of closets, according to Turner. Networks were overloaded. Basics are in such short supply – not to mention the rash of broken monitors and even a broken desk – that she brought in her own keyboard and mouse.\n\n“We are doing what we can, but this is NOT a situation that was implemented (or even designed) for efficiency,” she wrote. “We continue to show up and fight because the public health mission, the dedication of federal employees and the work of the federal government is stronger than the whims of a few egomaniacs.”\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\n'They just want to stick it to us because they can'\n\nSome offices that have stood semi-vacant for years have sanitation problems, from infestations of cockroaches and rats to clogged toilets and busted sinks to overflowing trash cans, and too few janitorial staffers to stay on top of it all.\n\nFederal workers say they suspect the Trump administration deliberately made the return to office stressful to get people to quit in frustration.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Inauguration Day directing the heads of federal departments and agencies to \"as soon as practical, take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements and require employees to return to work in-person at their respective stations on a full-time basis, provided that the department and agency heads shall make exemptions they deem necessary.\"\n\nTop Trump adviser Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency have warned that federal workers must show up in the office. He has said he welcomes the wave of “voluntary terminations” of those federal employees who don’t.\n\n“They say we are unproductive and lazy, and that is just a big bald-faced lie,” an employee of the Department of Health and Human Services said. “There’s no rhyme or reason for doing this other than being vindictive and being bullies. These are punitive steps. They just want to stick it to us because they can.”\n\nLong commutes and limbo for some federal employees\n\nFederal workers say the biggest blow has been to their work-life balance with so much time wasted behind the wheel or on public transit in rush-hour traffic.\n\nOne Homeland Security employee estimates he spends 2 ½ hours a day in his car instead of playing with his newborn son. “It’s a huge morale killer,” he said.\n\nA Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation employee with one child and a second on the way lives with his parents and said the in-person mandate has forced him into an impossible situation.\n\nHe pays $1,200 a month in rent, well below market, and his mother cares for his child during the workday. If he moved closer to the office, the rent would be nearly triple, not to mention the additional child care costs.\n\nSo for now he’s gritting his teeth for the four-hour round-trip commute. “I’m just blessed to have a job still,” he said.\n\nFor many of these workers, the return to office is not all smaller sacrifices, like missing out on an early morning run or having dinner with the family.\n\nSome commutes are so lengthy that federal employees are crashing in shared sublets or youth hostels on weeknights, with family, friends or neighbors picking up the slack on the home front.\n\nExtra expenses plus gas and car maintenance add up quickly to a substantial pay cut, they say. Also off the table are dinners out or putting away for retirement or a house.\n\nThose federal employees who were hired as remote workers and sometimes live hundreds of miles – or states – away face a tough choice: Uproot their lives or walk away from the job they love.\n\nStill others are stuck in limbo with no idea where or when they will be asked to report. The Office of Personnel Management is “phasing in” the return of remote workers who are more than 50 miles from an agency office.\n\nOne Health and Human Services employee hired as a remote worker lives hundreds of miles from the main office. “My duty station is my home,” she said.\n\nShe still doesn’t know if she will be assigned to an office near where she lives or if she will be called into the headquarters.\n\n“If it’s near, that would be fine. I have no problem with that, and I have no problem with doing my job in person,” she said.\n\nIf not, her husband would have to give up his job and she would have to pull her kids out of school, with no guarantee she would keep her job with mass layoffs looming.\n\n“If I am told I have to go somewhere hundreds of miles away, it’s going to be a nonstarter for me.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/08/23/water-flint-rashes-chemistry/89195574/", "title": "Water chemistry problems may have caused Flint rashes", "text": "Kristen Jordan Shamus\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency tested water samples from 170 homes in Flint.\n\nHealth officials interviewed 390 people with exposure to Flint municipal water about their rashes.\n\nFour volunteer dermatologists from Flint conducted 122 examinations on people with rashes.\n\nA months-long investigation that brought federal, state and local leaders to Flint to hunt for a cause of mysterious rashes and hair loss has not led to any definitive answers.\n\nInterviewers talked to 390 people with rashes and hair loss who had exposure to Flint municipal water after the switch back to Lake Huron. They conducted examinations on 122 and extensive water testing in 170 homes and did not prove a correlation. With the exception of lead, all metals and minerals the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found in the water are common in most public water systems. None of the metals are likely to cause a rash or hair loss.\n\nBut authorities said at a news conference Tuesday that the biggest clues might lie in historical data of water samples from the Flint Water Treatment Plant, which show large swings in the levels of chlorine, pH and water hardness from April 2014, when the city switched to the Flint River as its water source, to Oct. 16, 2015, when the city began to draw again from Lake Huron.\n\n\"While the study wasn't designed to look historically, we did note that over half the people had rashes ... that started before the switch back to the Lake Huron water. So we wanted to explore as much as we could what might be associated with that, and that's when we went back to look at the water treatment-plant data. And we think there's a strong suggestion that the water quality at that time ... represents a smoking gun, if you will, that suggests that this is rash-related,\" said Patrick Breysse, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Environmental Health and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.\n\n►Related: E-mails show feds knew of Flint rashes in mid-2014\n\n►Related: Free Press photo helps define Flint tragedy for nation\n\nWide fluctuations in the levels of chlorine, pH and water hardness are known to cause skin dryness and irritation that can lead to dermatitis, eczema-type rashes, which happen to most commonly flare up in fall, winter and spring in Michigan. That, said Flint dermatologist Dr. Walter Barkey, combined with stress that many people in Flint felt as they lived through the water crisis and changes in bathing habits, might have initiated the widespread rashes. And if untreated, those rashes could have continued even after the change in water source.\n\n\"Stress is actually one of the most impressive things that the dermatologists found, aside from the rashes themselves. .... A lot of what happened, I think it was a perfect storm of things,\" said Barkey, adding that the time of year the crisis unfolded — autumn and winter — is typically when people turn on their furnaces and the air is dry and cold, and when there is a peak in the number of cases of dermatitis.\n\nBut the investigation was launched by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services on Feb. 3 — after the city had switched back to Lake Huron as its municipal water source.\n\nOf the 122 examinations that were done by four volunteer dermatologists in Flint, none of the cases were found to be caused by bacteria or viruses. Many of patients were classified as having dermatitis, and 80% were classified as having skin conditions that could be related to water exposure. Nearly 44% were diagnosed with dermatitis; 22% were diagnosed with non-dermatitis skin conditions possibly related to the water. And 14% had inactive rashes that were possibly related to water exposure.\n\n\"These findings might not immediately alleviate the fear and anxiety that many residents of Flint are feeling right now,\" said Dr. Nicole Lurie, assistant secretary for preparedness and response for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \"I know that there is nothing more important to you than your health, and the health of your children. … I want you to know that your concerns are justified that the rashes are real, that’s why we put so much careful effort into this study.\n\n\"We are committed to improving the health in this community, and restoring the safety of this water system,\" she said, adding that representatives from the CDC would remain in Flint for the next two weeks and that officials from the Health and Human Services, along with the EPA, would continue to work in Flint at least through the end of the year to work on issues related to the water crisis.\n\n►Related: Boy on Time cover moves from Flint, happy at new home\n\nMinerva Witt, whose 7-year-old granddaughter, Layla, started losing her hair about a year and a half ago, was disappointed at hearing the news Tuesday. She attended the news conference with her sister hoping for answers.\n\n\"They can't tell me that it is or it isn't because of the water. ... This little girl is losing her hair,\" said Witt, who lives in Flint. She said her granddaughter was diagnosed with alopecia, which she knows is an autoimmune disorder, but Witt said she wonders whether it was sparked by something related to the water.\n\n\"If you're a young lady, how would you feel if you started to lose your hair, with patches of bald here and there?

But, Lurie noted, if anyone is still experiencing hair loss or rashes, he or she ought to be treated by a physician.\n\nThe City of Flint stopped using water drawn from Lake Huron in April 2014. It instead began using the Flint River as its municipal source and treating that water at its own treatment plant. At the time, the state Department of Environmental Quality did not require that the city use corrosion-control chemicals in the water. Even if it had, the city's water-treatment plant didn't have the capability to add those chemicals when the change was made.\n\nSoon after, lead and copper from pipes, solder and fixtures began to leach into the tap water. There also was E. coli contamination and unsafe levels of a chlorine by-product used to kill the E. coli. Officials are also investigating whether the switch to Flint River water caused two outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease, a form of pneumonia, which killed 10 people and sickened 88 in Genesee County in summer 2014 and again in summer 2015.\n\nIn October, Flint once again began to draw water from Lake Huron, but damage to pipes in the city continues to make unfiltered tap water unsafe for drinking or cooking.\n\nContact Kristen Jordan Shamus: 313-222-5997, kshamus@freepress.com or on Twitter @kristenshamus\n\nHave a rash or hair loss?\n\nThe doctors evaluating rashes in Flint urge anyone still suffering from rash or hair loss to see a primary care physician for a diagnosis and treatment.

Pop juggernauts Taylor Swift and Beyoncé were both nominated for artist of the year, despite not releasing any music videos during the eligibility period from June 20, 2024, to June 18, 2025. And Bruno Mars received 11 nominations, the second most behind Lady Gaga, and they're all for collaborations he did for other artists.\n\nBut a few standouts in music videos couldn't seem to get on the award show's radar. \"All The Way,\" a cross-genre track from rap breakout BigXthaPlug and rising country singer Bailey Zimmerman, got no love despite standing at over 32 million views. The same goes for R&B songstress Mariah the Scientist, whose breakout hit \"Burning Blue\" stands at 21 million views notched in the three months since its release.\n\nHere are the most notable snubs for the 2025 MTV VMAs, which will air live at 8 p.m. Sept. 7 from New York's UBS Arena.\n\nLisa featuring Rosalía 'New Woman' and Lisa featuring Tyla 'When I'm with You'\n\nLisa boasts a nomination at this year's award show for her Doja Cat and Raye collaboration \"Born Again.\" But the Blackpink star only managed to receive one nomination in the best K-pop category despite several hit videos, including two that could have at least gotten a mention in the best collaboration conversation: \"New Woman\" with Spanish sensation Rosalía and \"When I'm with You\" with South African star Tyla.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"New Woman\" brought together two major women in music for a high-concept video debuting with more than 40 million views in its first week. \"When I'm with You,\" with its sensual, dance-heavy treatment, also did extraordinarily well on views, at upwards of 21 million. Given the praise for Rosé and Bruno Mars megahit \"Apt.,\" it appears the category only had room for one Blackpink breakout.\n\nThe Weeknd 'Dancing in the Flames'\n\nThe Weeknd is not hurting for nominations, but hear us out. Yes, his Playboi Carti-assisted hit \"Timeless\" received three nominations, including video and song of the year, and \"Hurry Up Tomorrow\" got a nomination for best long-form video. But that leaves another hit from this album, \"Dancing in the Flames,\" without any love, despite a dramatic video treatment that sees the crooner get hit by a semitruck and miraculously recover. The video was heavily noted as being shot on the iPhone 16 Pro and has 70 million views on YouTube.\n\nKesha 'Boy Crazy' and 'Joyride'\n\nKesha is in her comeback era, but MTV has yet to welcome her back with open arms. Though the \"Die Young\" hitmaker just released the provocative self-directed treatment for \"Boy Crazy\" in June to modest viewership, the video has been widely shared on social media for its feminist message. The video follows the buzz around \"Joyride,\" released in November 2024, another campy, action-packed video featuring gunfire and a car-track-helicopter chase through the desert, which also flew under the radar.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2024/09/11/taylor-swift-could-break-all-time-mtv-video-music-awards-record-beyonce-2024-vmas/75178337007/", "title": "Taylor Swift could break all-time MTV Video Music Awards record", "text": "This week could see Taylor Swift finish with a record-breaking showing at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nThe pop superstar has a cool dozen nominations this year.

Kendrick Lamar),\" \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever (ft. Zayn),\" \"You Need to Calm Down,\" \"ME! (ft. Brendon Urie),\" \"All Too Well: The Short Film\" and \"Anti-Hero.\"\n\nWhat did Kanye West say to Taylor Swift onstage at the MTV VWAs?\n\nSwift's first win came with a maelstrom of controversy in 2009, when Kanye West interrupted her speech telling the crowd, \"Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!\" After the West interruption, Swift performed \"You Belong With Me\" in front of Radio City Music Hall.\n\nTaylor Swift dominated the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards\n\nSwift was the biggest winner at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards.

Malone joined Swift on stage, and she honored him as \"everyone in music's favorite person\" to work with.\n\nAt the end of the evening, Swift received the top prize of video of the year for \"Fortnight.\" She holds the record for most wins in that category with five, including three consecutive victories since 2022, for \"Bad Blood,\" \"You Need to Calm Down,\" \"All Too Well,\" \"Anti-Hero\" and \"Fortnight.\"\n\nHow many VMAs did Taylor Swift win?

The singer won seven awards Wednesday, including the night's top prize of video of the year.\n\nThat makes her the solo artist with the most career VMA wins, and the artist with the most video of the year wins.\n\nIn her acceptance speech for video of the year, she thanked her boyfriend Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. \"When I'd finish a take, and I'd say cut, and we'd be done with that take, I'd always just hear someone like cheering and like 'whoo' from across the studio,\" she said. \"And that one person was my boyfriend Travis.

Also, coincidence that the dress was made by the same designer that Michelle Obama wore while speaking at the Democratic National Convention?\n\n(If you loved the UFO dress, a similar dress that has a tapestry print rather than sequined, is on the Monse site for $990.) It is described as an \"alien UFO print, inspired by the iconic sci-fi films of the 1950s.\" But you'll need to be patient. The dress doesn't ship until January, 2025.\n\nSwift also thanked those who worked on the video, including Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles who appeared in cameos: \"Directing this video and putting it together and writing it was the most wonderful experience, and that is because of all the people that I got to make it with — and that includes my amazing cinematographer [and] Rodrigo Prieto, who goes out of his way to work with female directors. He's a genius and I can't believe I got to work with him as well as Ethan Tobman, my amazing production designer, who I worked with on the Eras Tour.\"\n\nThe tortured poet's first single off her 11th studio album, \"Fortnight (ft.

See the singer's full, record-breaking haul\n\nWhen the collaboration win was announced, the audience got on their feet and shrieked with excitement. Swift came to the stage with Post Malone. Presenter Flava Flav jumped up and down hugging her.\n\n“Waking up this morning in New York on Sept. 11,\" she said. \"Everyone we lost, and that is the most important thing about today.”\n\nShe then complimented Post Malone. \"There is a very clear reason why Post Malone is everyone in music’s favorite person,\" she said. \"You are so ridiculously talented, you are so versatile and you are the most down to earth person. Honestly so unfailingly politice, it has taken me forever to get him to stop calling me ma'am.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" he responded. \"Taylor is absolutely one of the most kind and talented people I've ever had the honor of knowing.\"\n\nHe described how she directed the \"Fortnight\" music video while tied to an operating board during one scene.\n\n\"It was pretty bad***,\" he said.\n\nWednesday's wins mean she's up to a record 30 VMAs over her career, surpassing Beyoncé's 25 wins as a solo artist.\n\nSwift was up for 12 total awards Wednesday evening at the UBS Arena:\n\nWON: Song of the summer for \"Fortnight\"\n\nSong of the summer for \"Fortnight\" VMAs Most Iconic Performance: \"You Belong With Me\"\n\nWON: Video of the year for \"Fortnight\"\n\nVideo of the year for \"Fortnight\" WON: Artist of the year\n\nArtist of the year Song of the year: \"Fortnight\"\n\nWON: Best collaboration for \"Fortnight\"\n\nBest collaboration for \"Fortnight\" WON: Best pop\n\nBest pop WON: Best direction for \"Fortnight\"\n\nBest direction for \"Fortnight\" Best cinematography: \"Fortnight\"\n\nBest visual effects: \"Fortnight\"\n\nBest art direction for \"Fortnight\"\n\nWON: Best editing for \"Fortnight\"\n\nSwift's VMA history: awards and music performances\n\nSwift has a lengthy history with the VMAs extending back to 2008 when she was nominated for \"Our Song.\" The country singer won her first moon man for the \"You Belong With Me\" music video in 2009. She's collected hardware for her music videos for \"I Knew You Were Trouble,\" \"Blank Space,\" \"Bad Blood (ft. Kendrick Lamar),\" \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever (ft. Zayn),\" \"You Need to Calm Down,\" \"ME! (ft.

Two years later in a red and white top, she sang, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\" In 2014, she shimmied to \"Shake It Off,\" joking when her dancers encouraged her to jump off a second-story \"1989\" platform, \"I don’t care if it’s the VMAs, I’m not jumping off there. People are getting bit by snakes; it’s dangerous.\" The next year, Swift joined Nikki Minaj on stage for a mashup of \"The Night Is Still Young\" with \"Bad Blood.\" Her performance served as a harbinger to the dissolution of bad blood between her and West as she presented the rapper with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.\n\nThe next year Swift was canceled by West and his then-wife Kim Kardashian. He released his song \"Famous,\" which included the line, \"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex. Why? I made that b**** famous.\" Swift denied approving the lyrics, and Kardashian released a series of videos on Snapchat that made it seem like Swift was lying. Years later it came out that the videos were edited and Swift was telling the truth.\n\nIn 2017, Swift premiered her music video riddled with Easter eggs for \"Look What You Made Me Do\" at the show. Two years later, she returned to the stage singing \"You Need to Calm Down\" and \"Lover.\"\n\nIn 2022, to celebrate 13 years since her first win, Swift announced the release of \"Midnights.\" The singer stunned in a bejeweled gown designed by Oscar de la Renta.\n\nLast year, she lit up the red carpet in a black Versace gown with gold buttons and a thigh-high slit.

Though he didn't attend the New York award show, she thanked boyfriend Travis Kelce for his support.\n\n\"When I'd finish a take, I'd always hear someone cheering from across the studio,\" she said during her acceptance speech when \"Fortnight\" was crowned video of the year. \"Everything this man touches turns to happiness and fun and magic.\"\n\nNeed a break?

She later swapped outfits, stepping into a custom bejeweled Monse minidress featuring a spaceship on the front in a possible nod to her song \"Down Bad,\" which compares love bombing to being abducted by aliens.\n\nWhen are the VMAs?\n\nThe VMAs will be broadcast live from New York's UBS Arena at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT Sept. 7 on CBS and Paramount+. Fans can vote in 19 categories by visiting vote.mtv.com.\n\nRepeating history\n\nSwift’s relationship with the VMAs is as glittering as it is dramatic, spanning more than 15 years of wins, performances and pop culture flashpoints.\n\nHer first nomination came in 2008 for \"Our Song.\" A year later, she earned her first Moon Person for \"You Belong With Me\" — a moment famously interrupted by Kanye West. Swift had just begun her acceptance speech when West stormed the stage, declaring, \"Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’ma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time.\" The moment became an instant cultural inflection point. That same night, Swift delivered a poised performance of \"You Belong With Me\" outside Radio City Music Hall.\n\nIn 2010, she returned to the VMA stage with \"Innocent,\" a poignant ballad she later confirmed in New York Magazine was written about West.\n\nShe performed \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" in 2012. Two years later, she debuted her \"1989\" era with a high-energy rendition of \"Shake It Off.\" When her dancers encouraged her to jump from a platform mid-performance, she quipped, \"I don't care if it's the VMAs, I’m not jumping off there. People are getting bit by snakes — it’s dangerous.\"\n\nIn 2015, Swift performed \"Bad Blood\" in a mashup with Nicki Minaj after a brief public feud, hinting at reconciliation. That same night, she presented West with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, a gesture that appeared to close the loop on their rocky history.\n\nBut just a year later, their relationship fractured again after West released \"Famous,\" including the line, \"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex. Why? I made that b**** famous.\" Swift denied approving the song. Kim Kardashian, then West’s wife, released edited videos on Snapchat that painted Swift as dishonest, a narrative that years later was disproven when the full footage revealed Swift was telling the truth all along.\n\nIn 2017, Swift premiered the snake-laced, Easter egg-heavy music video for \"Look What You Made Me Do.\" She returned to the stage in 2019 with a technicolor performance of \"You Need to Calm Down\" and \"Lover.\"\n\nAt the 2022 VMAs, Swift celebrated the 13th anniversary of her first win by announcing her next album, \"Midnights.\" She stunned in a sparkling Oscar de la Renta gown and later took home the award for video of the year, her third in that category.\n\nIn 2023, she ruled the red carpet in a black Versace gown with gold accents and a thigh-high slit. Throughout the night, the cameras cut to the singer-songwriter dancing in the crowd with \"Karma\" collaborator Ice Spice.
