Follow along here for updates throughout the day.\n\nSenator Thom Tillis statement on Trump visit to WNC\n\n“President Trump’s visit is a welcome display of leadership as Western North Carolina recovers from damage and devastation left behind by Helene. Although I was unable to attend due to the Senate being in session, I want to thank him for traveling to North Carolina to witness the damage firsthand. Throughout the transition, both President Trump and Vice President Vance repeatedly reached out to me to check in on how Western North Carolina was doing. That is a testament to how high of a priority the recovery and rebuilding process is for them.\n\nUnder President Biden, FEMA’s failure to act and communicate swiftly put vulnerable families at risk with freezing temperatures outside. Despite our continued pressure, FEMA made little progress in providing direct housing solutions for those most affected by Helene. Things will be changing under President Trump, and his visit shows his Administration is committed to the people of Western North Carolina as he promised during the campaign. I look forward to working with the Trump-Vance Administration to ensure that every available federal resource is deployed and that red tape preventing families from accessing housing is eliminated.”\n\n‘Houses, trailers, bodies’ float past during Asheville flood: victim\n\nThomas Bright described for President Donald Trump his harrowing escape from a home that had been in his family for 80 years and four generations before Hurricane Helene destroyed it.\n\nBright woke up at 5 a.m. to the sound of trees falling on the house in the Azalea Road area of East Asheville. He began moving five vehicles from around the house as the floodwaters began to rise because it’s one-third of a mile of the road.\n\nWhen the water was ankle-deep inside the house, he retreated a loft. When the water reached their hips, he made a makeshift ladder to climb onto the roof.\n\nHe spent four hours on the roof writing farewell notes on his cellphone to his two children and his two grandchildren as debris from the storm floated past. His garage floated away before the water crested at about 4 feet high on the roof.\n\n“We didn’t think we were going to make it at all,” Bright said. “We were watching houses, trailers, bodies coming by us.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\n‘Horrific’: Fairview resident tells Trump of flood and bodies\n\nMona Nix-Roper, who lives in the Fairview area of North Carolina, told President Donald Trump her home became like an island in September as floodwaters from Hurricane Helene rose around it.\n\nShe was home alone because her husband was staying with a 98-year-old neighbor to make sure she was all right. When Nix went out to check the road and bridge that provide access to her home, she found they were gone.\n\nFire Department officials urged her the next day to evacuate because of the risk of landslides. Her 21-year-old son Nathan hiked in 5 miles after roads became impassable to help her leave.\n\n“He said, ‘Mom, grab a bag, we’ve got to go,’” Nix said. “I said, ‘Son, there’s no way I can hike out of here.’ He said, ‘No, we’ve got to go.’”\n\nAs they walked out, they saw a neighbor’s body that had turned blue in the water.\n\n“Horrific is just all I can say,” Nix said. “There were people out everywhere looking for their loved ones. And there were dead bodies. My son’s like, ‘Mom, you’re going to see things you don’t want to see.’”\n\nNix’s home was without power for two months, so she lived in her church’s sound room. Others had lost everything, so she said she is embarrassed to ask for help.\n\n“We need help,” Nix said. “It’s just heartbreaking.”\n\nTrump appeared moved.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of bad things, but I’ve never seen anything like it,” Trump said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump motorcade leaves Swannanoa\n\nTrump’s motorcade departed Swannanoa around 1:18 p.m., passing some remaining spectators and supporters. Kate Feathers called out “thank you” as the vehicles passed, telling the Citizen Times she’s “so grateful that he showed up.”\n\n“He just became president Monday. Now it’s Friday and he’s here,” said Feathers, who has lived in Beacon Village the last 4 years and watched with her neighbors as homes flooded during Tropical Storm Helene Sept. 27.\n\nPastor describes generosity of volunteers helping recovery\n\nPastor Ramona Nix told President Donald Trump she had dedicated her Eagle Rock Church a week before the storm arrived with Hurricane Helene in September.\n\nNix stayed in the church building for three months, sleeping on the floor for three weeks, because the community’s needs were so great. Her son ferried supplies in, Nix said.\n\n“Before the week was over, the church was so packed, we couldn’t even walk,” Nix said. “Even our sanctuary, it was up to the platform.”\n\nVolunteers arrived from Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana and Oklahoma to help with the recovery. “They were coming in day and night,” Nix said.\n\nAt one point, Nix asked a woman who arrived if she could do anything special for her.\n\n“She said, ‘I don’t want to be selfish, but could I have a cup of coffee,’” Nix said. “I handed her that coffee and she stood there. Tears just poured. She said, ‘You don’t realize how important the little things.’ It’s not the big things in life that we have, but it’s the little things.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\n‘I didn’t think I was going to make it’: NC victim to Trump\n\nKim West described her harrowing escape from her home as it flooded from Hurricane Helene in September, as President Donald Trump visited the storm-ravaged Swannanoa, North Carolina.\n\nAs the river waters rose near their house, Kim and her husband Chris West started moving vehicles to higher ground along the road. By then, water was ankle deep inside the house. Kim West grabbed her purse and pug dog and Chris West put dog food in a trash bag.\n\n“By the time we got into the driveway it was already waist deep,” West said. “I didn’t think I was going to make it.”\n\nThey were stuck on local roads for hours because of flooding. The waters finally receded about midnight, after they began evacuating at 5 a.m.\n\n“We just lost everything that we had,” West said. “Didn’t even have a brush for like three days.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nGovernor Josh Stein releases statement on Trump visit to WNC\n\n“It’s a positive signal that President Trump made his first visit outside the capital as President to our mountains. I thanked the President for coming and asked for his support of $20 billion in additional disaster relief and for 100% reimbursement of eligible FEMA expenses for another six months.\n\n“Families, businesses, and communities are struggling and need these urgent resources to help them rebuild. I look forward to working with the Trump Administration in the coming weeks and months to get people what they need to rebuild and recover.”\n\nTrump suggests abolishing FEMA\n\nPresident Donald Trump ratcheted up his criticism with the suggestion he might abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency because of its response in North Carolina to lingering damage from Hurricane Helene in September.\n\n“I’ll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA or maybe even getting rid of FEMA,” Trump said after a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina. “Frankly, FEMA’s not good.”\n\nTrump accused FEMA crews of being unfamiliar with areas when responding to disasters. FEMA also imposes rules and requirements on crews that aren’t as good as what local officials provide, Trump said. The federal government should instead send funding to governor’s to manage their own response to disasters, he said.\n\n“FEMA has turned out to be a disaster,” Trump said. “I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly – we pay a percentage to the state.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWNC residents want blanket extension on FEMA hotel vouchers\n\nAutumn Mullins and Rene Rickman, both Western North Carolina residents, said they’re here as a “final hail mary” to get a blanket extension on FEMA hotel vouchers, not just for those the agency deems eligible.“we don’t know that President Trump understands, or that the new FEMA Director, we don't know what they know. But we’re desperate for someone to listen today because it's too late today for some people. It's not too late for others,” Rickman said.The full time volunteers helping displaced residents said it’s not about politics — They’re working together for a common goal despite being from both sides of the political aisle.\n\nTrump will sign executive order to change or get rid of FEMA\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday said he would sign an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally overhauling or eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to Reuters.\n\n\"FEMA has turned out to be a disaster ... I think we recommend that FEMA go away,\" he said during a tour of North Carolina to see damage done by Hurricane Helene last year.\n\nTrump detractors await his motorcade in Swannanoa\n\nAbout 40 people line US 70 as lights blink from numerous police cars ahead of the arrival of Trump’s motorcade. As a helicopter hovers overhead, Lucy Bickers, 69, holds a sign that reads, “FEMA helped me.”\n\nThe 21-year Swannanoa resident said she’s “trying to balance the narrative,” though she knows some people are still in need of help. She feels Trump’s comments on FEMA “empowers the people who are anti everything.”\n\n“He's going there just to put on a show that he cares,” Bickers, a retired social worker, said.\n\nNC Reps. Edwards, Foxx and Moore to help lead recovery\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, announced he would help guide recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene with three House Republicans from the region with the most damage.\n\nThe lawmakers are GOP Reps. Chuck Edwards, Virginia Foxx and Tim Moore.\n\nTrump announced that Whatley would lead the recovery effort with Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. \"North Carolina is going to come back bigger, better than ever before,\" Trump said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump offers ‘a lot of money’ to NC, overhaul of FEMA\n\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters in Asheville, North Carolina, the federal government would supply “a lot of the money” to repair damage from floods and landslides after Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump also proposed to overhaul the Federal Emergency Management Agency so that states respond to their own disasters rather than the federal government.\n\n“We’re going to fix it as fast as we can,” Trump said. “It’s a massive amount of damage.”\n\nTrump said Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, and Democratic Gov. Josh Stein would work on plans for demolition of damaged buildings and cleaning up debris. Trump said the federal government would probably provide 75% of the funding.\n\n“We’re going to supply the money, a lot of the money,” Trump said.\n\nTrump said he would review “the whole concept of FEMA” because states such as Florida with hurricanes and Oklahoma with tornadoes are better at responding to disasters.\n\n“I’d like to see the states take care of disasters,” Trump said. “I think you’re going to find it a lot less expensive – less than half – and you’re going to get a much quicker response.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump visits with families on tarmac\n\nTrump met with the press outside Air Force One, then worked his way down the line of supporters, greeting the people who waved at him. Trump then got in his SUV to leave for his tour of the area.\n\nRep. Chuck Edwards told the Citizen Times he spoke to President Trump about the needs of the region’s residents on the flight on Air Force One down from Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Trump has landed in Asheville\n\nDozens of families and supporters waited for Trump on Asheville Regional Airport’s tarmac in below freezing temperatures Friday morning.Echoing Rep. Balkcom’s earlier comments, 11th Congressional District GOP Chair Michele Woodhouse told the Citizen Times she’s hopeful the president will clear some of the “red tape” around permitting with rebuilding and recovery in the aftermath of Helene and help local governments overcome budget shortfalls.“We know that the people of Western North Carolina have not been forgotten by this administration,” Woodhouse said.\n\nTrump WNC visit schedule\n\nPresident Donald Trump left the White House by helicopter at 9:16 a.m. for his tour of disaster areas in North Carolina and California on Friday.

Adam Schiff on trip\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he didn’t invite Sen. Adam Schiff, a frequent critic, on the trip to areas of Los Angeles damaged by wildfires.\n\n“Is he going? I don't know. I mean, I really don't know,” Trump said. “You know, if he's going to be there it would be cheaper, but I didn't invite him. Somebody did.\"\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., has asked that disaster aid for California not come with strings attached, after Republicans suggested potential restrictions on the funding. Schiff previously led the first House impeachment of Trump over his dealings with Ukraine and has questioned whether his nominees to become Cabinet secretaries will act independently from him.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWNC residents call on Trump to help rebuild after Helene\n\nAfter Helene hit Matthew Coleman of Asheville Dream Center helped coordinate relief efforts through his church, working with 60 organizations to distribute $15 million in aid, he said.Nearly four months later, Coleman was awaiting Trump’s arrival in WNC, hopeful that Trump, who he voted for three times, would see that the region is still in need.“We really need him and his administration to step in and help put this area back together again,” Coleman said.\n\nRepublican state lawmaker looks for Trump to speed Helene aid\n\nAlso awaiting President Trump’s arrival on Friday morning was state Rep. Jennifer Balkcom. The Henderson County Republican said she hopes Trump will be able to cut through some of the “red tape” to get aid to the region quicker, which she said he’s already starting to do, less than a week into his presidency.\n\nAt the state level, Balkcom said she’ll be working with lawmakers to prioritize assistance to the region’s farmers, like Henderson County’s apple growers.They need help now, she said.\n\nTrump supporters gather at Asheville airport ahead of visit\n\nJust before 9 a.m., Erin Wilson of Candler and daughter Grace and husband Darrell were awaiting Trump’s arrival at Asheville Regional Airport.\n\nErin, a supporter of Trump, said she was feeling optimistic about the president’s visit to Western North Carolina. She’s hopeful Trump will deliver more aid to the region still reeling in the wake of Helene.\n\nFor Grace, a freshman at Enka High School, she’s got to miss school today to see the president in person.\n\nTrump in Asheville: What to know about Jan. 24 visit\n\nThis marks the third time Trump has visited WNC in the last six months. He made a campaign stop and rally Aug. 14 at Thomas Wolfe Auditorium, and he was in Swannanoa on Oct. 21 after Helene ravaged the town.\n\nTrump visited Helene-ravaged Swannanoa less than a month after the storm left much of the area in shambles.

Thom Tillis says Trump visit is 'welcome news' for WNC\n\nSenator Thom Tillis, who said both Trump and JD Vance reached out to him to check on how Western North Carolina was doing in the aftermath of Helene, shared a statement ahead of the presidential visit:\n\n\"President Trump’s visit on Friday is welcome news for the thousands of families dealing with a state of uncertainty when it comes to securing housing. Under President Biden, FEMA’s failure to act and communicate swiftly put vulnerable families at risk with freezing temperatures outside. Despite our continued pressure, FEMA made little progress in providing direct housing solutions for those most affected by Helene. Things will be changing under President Trump, and his visit shows his Administration is committed to the people of Western North Carolina as he promised during the campaign. I look forward to working with the Trump-Vance Administration to ensure that every available federal resource is deployed and that red tape preventing families from accessing housing is eliminated.”\n\nCongressman Edwards: Trump keeping promise to WNC\n\nU.S. Congressman Chuck Edwards (NC-11) Thursday issued the following statement regarding President Donald Trump’s upcoming visit to Western North Carolina:\n\n“I welcome President Trump back to our mountains, and am honored to accompany him to see the devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene and our efforts to clean up and rebuild. By making this the first official trip of his presidency, President Trump is keeping his promise to the people of Western North Carolina that we are not forgotten.\n\n“I was pleased to have authored the bill appropriating $110 billion toward our recovery, and will fight for every possible dollar of it to come to Western North Carolina. I intend to show President Trump the progress we are making, the unwavering resilience of the people of WNC, and why there is a dire need to overhaul FEMA.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/01/24/gov-stein-to-meet-president-trump-during-western-north-carolina-visit/77916900007/", "title": "Gov.

Follow along for live coverage here.\n\nHe previously visited Swannanoa in October to survey damage less than a month after the storm hit. During that visit Trump repeated a false claim that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was spending money on unauthorized migrants instead of those impacted by the storm. The claim was debunked by USA TODAY and fact checking agencies like PolitiFact.\n\nDuring a Jan. 22 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump teased an overhaul of FEMA, suggesting states be responsible for their own disaster recovery.\n\nHe also blamed Democrats for the agency's alleged failures in North Carolina following Helene.\n\n\"The Democrats don’t care about North Carolina,\" Trump said. \"What they’ve done with FEMA is so bad. FEMA is a whole ‘nother discussion because all it does is complicate everything. FEMA has not done their job for the last four years.\"\n\nRep. Chuck Edwards, who represents North Carolina’s 11th District, is also planning to meet with Trump during his visit, Edwards’ office confirmed Jan. 23.\n\n“I intend to show President Trump the progress we are making, the unwavering resilience of the people of WNC, and why there is a dire need to overhaul FEMA,” Edwards said in a news release.\n\nIn December, Edwards co-sponsored a bipartisan spending bill that will deliver much-needed federal disaster relief funds to areas across the country hard-hit by natural disasters. Passage of the bill not only provided more than $100 billion for recovery efforts following Helene and other disasters like Hurricane Milton, which hit Florida in October, it also funds the government through March 14, 2025.\n\nTwo previous versions of the bill failed to pass the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nAt the time, Edwards said the additional funds will help North Carolina residents “rebuild communities and put our lives back together.” He later told the Citizen Times that the bill will provide North Carolina an estimated $16 billion for recovery, some of which is already beginning to flow in.\n\nOn Jan. 6, Edwards announced that WNC would be receiving $1.6 billion in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funds as part of the spending package he helped create.\n\nJacob Biba is the Helene Recovery Reporter at the Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA TODAY Network.

DOJ fights judge\n\nWASHINGTON – After President Donald Trump granted clemency to Oath Keepers militia founder Stewart Rhodes for his Jan. 6-related conviction, a federal judge ordered Rhodes on Friday to stay away from the U.S. Capitol now that he is out of prison.\n\nWithin hours, the Justice Department – which under the Biden administration had secured Rhodes' 2022 conviction – argued that Judge Amit Mehta didn't have the authority to issue that restriction. Trump commuted Rhodes' 18-year sentence Monday along with the sentences of 13 other defendants. He also pardoned roughly 1,500 defendants who faced Jan. 6-related charges.\n\nRhodes left a federal prison in Cumberland, Maryland, on Tuesday and by Wednesday, he had visited Capitol Hill. Mehta issued his brief order, which also applied to seven other defendants whose sentences were commuted Monday, following that visit.\n\nThe order states that all eight defendants need Mehta's permission to visit the Capitol in particular as well as Washington, D.C. in general.\n\nHowever, the Justice Department said in its motion that the commutation of Rhodes' sentence means he is no longer subject to the terms of probation or a supervised release from prison.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n−Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Quite a day': Devastated Pacific Palisades neighborhood abuzz ahead of Trump visit\n\nLOS ANGELES – Activity buzzed outside Fire Station No. 69 in the Pacific Palisades late Friday morning in anticipation of President Trump’s arrival to inspect the wildfire damage.\n\nThe throng gathered less than a block from burned-down neighborhoods included members of the Secret Service, Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department and Teddy’s Tacos.\n\n“It’s quite a day,’’ said Teddy Vasquez, 39, surveying the scene near his taco truck that has been serving free food outside the firehouse since less than 72 hours after the fires broke out Jan. 7. “Firefighters left their homes to be out here. The least I could do is come out here and feed them.’’\n\nWith Trump expected to arrive by helicopter at about 2:30 p.m. local time, law enforcement walked along nearby Fiske Street, a demolished block of homes that Trump is expected to survey after an aerial tour of the ruin.\n\nAlso, banquet tables have been set up inside the fire department for an emergency briefing that will include the president. Fire captain Jeff Brown, a key participant in the activities, declined comment. But Vasquez, the taco truck owner, was happy to chat about Trump’s impending arrival as his workers began to heat flour tortillas.\n\n“Hoping President Trump likes tacos,’’ said Vasquez, who lives in Long Beach. “I think he will after he tries Teddy’s.’’\n\n– Josh Peter\n\n“I want more babies,” Vance says in his first speech as vice president\n\nVice President JD Vance on Friday told anti-abortion activists at their annual March for Life rally in Washington that the country had failed its citizens.\n\n“We failed a generation not only by permitting a culture of abortion on demand, but also by neglecting to help young parents achieve the ingredients they need to lead a happy and meaningful life,” he said.\n\nHe said a “culture of radical individualism” had led to people viewing the “responsibilities and joys” of raising a family as obstacles.\n\n“Our society has failed to recognize the obligation that one generation has to another as a core part of living in a society,” he said. “So let me say very simply, I want more babies in the United States of America.”\n\nVance, a former senator from Ohio, has advocated boosting the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $5,000 per child to help with the cost of raising children.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\n‘Houses, trailers, bodies’ float past during Asheville flood: victim\n\nThomas Bright described for President Trump his harrowing escape from a home that had been in his family for 80 years and four generations before Hurricane Helene destroyed it.\n\nBright woke up at 5 a.m. to the sound of trees falling on the house in the Azalea Road area of East Asheville. He began moving five vehicles from around the house to a road about one-third of a mile away, as the floodwaters began to rise.\n\nWhen the water was ankle-deep inside the house, he retreated to a loft. When the water reached their hips, he made a makeshift ladder to climb onto the roof.\n\nHe spent four hours on the roof writing farewell notes on his cellphone to his two children and his two grandchildren as debris from the storm floated past. His garage floated away before the water crested at about 4 feet high on the roof.\n\n“We didn’t think we were going to make it at all,” Bright said. “We were watching houses, trailers, bodies coming by us.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\n‘Horrific’: Fairview resident tells Trump of flood and bodies\n\nMona Nix-Roper, who lives in the Fairview area of North Carolina, told President Trump her home became like an island in September as floodwaters from Hurricane Helene rose around it.\n\nShe was home alone because her husband was staying with a 98-year-old neighbor to make sure she was alright. When Nix went out to check the road and bridge that provide access to her home, she found they were gone.\n\nFire Department officials urged her the next day to evacuate because of the risk of landslides. Her 21-year-old son Nathan hiked in five miles after roads became impassable to help her leave.\n\n“He said, ‘Mom, grab a bag, we’ve got to go,’” Nix said. “I said, ‘Son, there’s no way I can hike out of here.’ He said, ‘No, we’ve got to go.’”\n\nAs they walked out, they saw a neighbor’s body that had turned blue in the water.\n\n“Horrific is just all I can say,” Nix said. “There were people out everywhere looking for their loved ones. And there were dead bodies. My son’s like, ‘Mom, you’re going to see things you don’t want to see.’”\n\nNix’s home was without power for two months, so she lived in her church’s sound room. Others had lost everything, so she said she is embarrassed to ask for help.\n\n“We need help,” Nix said. “It’s just heartbreaking.”\n\nTrump appeared moved.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of bad things, but I’ve never seen anything like it,” Trump said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump thanks March for Life activists via video\n\nWhen Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, President Trump on Friday said a “historic wrong was set right” thanks to the “tireless work and devotion across five decades” of anti-abortion rights activists as he addressed March for Life rallygoers at the National Mall.\n\n“Three years ago, I was so proud to be a participant,” he said. “Six courageous justices of the Supreme Court of the United States returned the issue to the state legislatures and to the people where it belongs.”\n\nIn his second term, Trump said he would “stand proudly for families and for life.”\n\n“Under my leadership, the reformed Department of Justice will finally investigate the radical left attacks on churches and crisis pregnancy centers, and we will bring perpetrator to justice,” he said.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nPastor describes generosity of volunteers helping recovery\n\nPastor Ramona Nix told President Trump she had dedicated her Eagle Rock, North Carolina church a week before the storm arrived with Hurricane Helene in September.\n\nNix stayed in the church building for three months, sleeping on the floor for three weeks, because the community’s needs were so great. Her son ferried supplies in, Nix said.\n\n“Before the week was over, the church was so packed, we couldn’t even walk,” Nix said. “Even our sanctuary, it was up to the platform.”\n\nVolunteers arrived from Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana and Oklahoma to help with the recovery. “They were coming in day and night,” Nix said.\n\nAt one point, Nix asked a woman who arrived if she could do anything special for her.\n\n“She said, ‘I don’t want to be selfish, but could I have a cup of coffee,’” Nix said. “I handed her that coffee and she stood there. Tears just poured. She said, ‘You don’t realize how important the little things.’ It’s not the big things in life that we have, but it’s the little things.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\n‘I didn’t think I was going to make it’: NC victim to Trump\n\nKim West described her harrowing escape from her home as it flooded from Hurricane Helene in September, as President Trump visited the storm-ravaged Swannanoa, North Carolina.\n\nAs the river waters rose near their house, Kim and her husband Chris West started moving vehicles to higher ground along the road. By then, water was ankle deep inside the house. Kim West grabbed her purse and pug dog, and Chris West put dog food in a trash bag.\n\n“By the time we got into the driveway, it was already waist deep,” West said. “I didn’t think I was going to make it.”\n\nThey were stuck on local roads for hours because of flooding. The waters finally receded about midnight, after they began evacuating at 5 a.m.\n\n“We just lost everything that we had,” West said. “Didn’t even have a brush for like three days.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nThune and Johnson address March for Life rallygoers\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday addressed the annual March for Life rally at the National Mall in Washington, saying the anti-abortion rights protesters were “not alone.”\n\n“You are part of a great movement united around the truth. That every life is precious,” he said. “I stand with you in this fight and so do many of my colleagues in Congress.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., talked about being a “product of an unplanned teen pregnancy\" born in 1972, one year before abortion was legalized when Roe v. Wade became the law of the land.\n\n“I am so eternally grateful that my mom and dad ignored all the people who told them to just take care of that problem,” he said. “They chose to embrace life and to have me the first of their four children.”\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump granted pardons to 23 anti-abortion rights activists.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump suggests abolishing FEMA\n\nPresident Trump ratcheted up his criticism with the suggestion he might abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency because of its response in North Carolina to lingering damage from Hurricane Helene in September.\n\n“I’ll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA or maybe even getting rid of FEMA,” Trump said after a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina. “Frankly, FEMA’s not good.”\n\nTrump accused FEMA crews of being unfamiliar with areas when responding to disasters. FEMA also imposes rules and requirements on crews that aren’t as good as what local officials provide, Trump said. The federal government should instead send funding to governors to manage their own response to disasters, he said.\n\n“FEMA has turned out to be a disaster,” Trump said. “I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly – we pay a percentage to the state.”\n\nAfter speaking with flood victims in Swannanoa, North Carolina, Trump later added, “If it was up to me right now, I’d end it right now.\"\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nPolitics shadow Trump's visit to North Carolina\n\nGlimpses of the politics behind disaster aid were visible as President Trump visited North Carolina to review damage from Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump recalled a whistleblower reported that Federal Emergency Management Agency crews refused to help people with Trump's 2024 presidential campaign signs in their yards. “That’s not good,” the president said.\n\nTrump noted that North Carolina and adjoining Tennessee each supported him in the last election – the Volunteer State slightly more.\n\nThe president also called for California to adopt voter ID, to ensure the citizenship of voters, to receive disaster aid for its wildfires around Los Angeles.\n\nThroughout his comments at a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina, Trump cited problems with former President Joe Biden’s response to the disaster that left 104 people in North Carolina dead, 73,000 homes severely damaged or destroyed and Asheville without running water for two months.\n\n“It doesn’t matter at this point: Biden did a bad job,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTennessee governor thanks Trump for helping Appalachia\n\nTennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee, whose state abuts North Carolina and was also damaged by Hurricane Helene, attended President Trump’s briefing on the disaster and thanked him.\n\n“The people in this region – including Tennessee, the people of Appalachia – are grateful that you are here and that you haven’t forgotten them,” Lee said. “There are other disasters. This was enormous for both North Carolina and Tennessee.”\n\nTrump joked about which state gave him more votes. “I hate to tell you, North Carolina, it was Tennessee,\" the president said.\n\nLee said one of the counties hurt in the disaster supported Trump with 88% of the vote.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says Anthony Fauci can hire his own security\n\nPresident Trump said the federal security detail for Dr. Anthony Fauci, a former head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease, had been removed Thursday because it can’t last a lifetime and he could hire his own protection.\n\nFauci led the federal health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to harsh criticism from Republicans about studies of the origin of the disease and the lockdowns to combat it during the first year.\n\n“When you work for government, at some point your security detail comes off,” Trump told reporters while visiting storm-damaged North Carolina. “You can’t have them forever.”\n\nTrump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, also lost their security details during the first week of his administration.\n\n“They all made a lot of money, they can hire their own security, too,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nNC Reps. Edwards, Foxx and Moore to help lead recovery\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, announced he would help guide recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene with three House Republicans from the region with the most damage.\n\nThe lawmakers are GOP Reps. Chuck Edwards, Virginia Foxx and Tim Moore.\n\nTrump announced that Whatley would lead the recovery effort with Democratic Gov. Josh Stein.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump wants voter ID in California for disaster aid\n\nPresident Trump said on Friday he would like to see two changes in California – the adoption of voter ID and the redirection of water from the northern part of the state to the south – in exchange for disaster aid for wildfires.\n\nTrump said he wanted voter identification to ensure the citizenship of voters. He also repeated his complaint that the state should divert funding from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Los Angeles to fight fires.\n\n“I want two things,” Trump told reporters upon his arrival in Asheville, North Carolina. “After that, I will be the greatest president California has ever seen.”\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says OPEC lowering oil prices is key to stopping war in Ukraine\n\nTrump said his proposal for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce the price of oil is key to stopping the war in Ukraine.\n\n“We want to see OPEC cut the price of oil and that will automatically stop the tragedy that’s taking place in Ukraine,” Trump said in Asheville, North Carolina. “It’s a butchering tragedy, for both sides, by the way.”\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Trump said a key to stopping the war is for OPEC to cut its prices because “if you have it high, that war is not going to end so easily.”\n\n“OPEC ought to get on the ball and they ought to drop the price of oil and that war will stop right away,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump offers ‘a lot of money’ to NC, overhaul of FEMA\n\nPresident Trump told reporters in Asheville, North Carolina, that the federal government would supply “a lot of the money” to repair damage from floods and landslides after Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump also proposed to overhaul the FEMA so that states respond to their own disasters rather than the federal government.\n\n“We’re going to fix it as fast as we can,” Trump said. “It’s a massive amount of damage.”\n\nTrump said Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, and Democratic Gov. Josh Stein would work on plans for demolition of damaged buildings and cleaning up debris. Trump said the federal government would probably provide 75% of the funding.\n\n“We’re going to supply the money, a lot of the money,” Trump said.\n\nTrump said he would review “the whole concept of FEMA” because states such as Florida with hurricanes and Oklahoma with tornadoes are better at responding to disasters.\n\n“I’d like to see the states take care of disasters,” Trump said. “I think you’re going to find it a lot less expensive – less than half – and you’re going to get a much quicker response.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff ‘glad’ Trump will see devastation from wildfires\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, a frequent critic of President Trump, said he’s glad Trump is visiting Los Angeles to tour the wildfire damage but that he and Sen. Alex Padilla have votes scheduled and couldn’t attend.\n\n“I’m glad that he’s going to see the devastation because I think, frankly, until you see it and the scope of it – whole neighborhoods gone block after block after block – it’s hard to wrap your head around,” Schiff told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”\n\nBut Schiff said he hoped Trump and congressional Republicans wouldn’t put conditions on funding for disaster aid.\n\n“We've never done that when it comes to our fellow citizens who are hurting,” Schiff said. “And California, frankly, has been the most generous state in terms of supporting our fellow citizens, whether they're in red states or blue when they face disaster.”\n\nSchiff said overhauling the Environmental Protection Agency and the FEMA, as Trump has suggested, are areas that could lead to bipartisan support.\n\n“All of that is ample ground to get together and make things happen,” Schiff said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump said he didn’t invite California Sen. Adam Schiff on trip\n\nPresident Trump said he didn’t invite Sen. Adam Schiff, a frequent Democratic critic, on the trip to areas of Los Angeles damaged by wildfires.\n\n“Is he going? I don't know. I mean, I really don't know,” Trump said. “You know, if he's going to be there it would be cheaper, but I didn't invite him. Somebody did.\"\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., has asked that disaster aid for California not come with strings attached, after Republicans suggested potential restrictions on the funding. Schiff is a former member of the U.S. House who previously led the first impeachment of Trump over his dealings with Ukraine and has questioned whether his nominees to become Cabinet secretaries will act independently from him.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump said he will watch ‘March for Life’\n\nPresident Trump said he would be watching the “March for Life” in Washington as he traveled to North Carolina and California to visit disaster areas. He said Vice President JD Vance would represent the administration “very well.”\n\n“I’m going to be watching it,” Trump said. “He’s going to be representing us very well.”\n\nTrump also noted that he pardoned 23 people who he said were \"unjustly\" charged for protesting outside abortion clinics.\n\n“It was disgraceful what happened,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump calls DOD nominee Pete Hegseth ‘a good man’\n\nPresident Trump praised his nominee to lead the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, as a “good man” but didn’t predict what would happen with his Senate confirmation vote scheduled for late Friday.\n\n“He’s a good man. I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Trump said. “I hope he makes it.”\n\nGOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against limiting debate on the nomination. Trump also questioned whether Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would support Hegseth because Trump and McConnell have had disputes in the past.\n\n“I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump: North Carolina was ‘allowed to fester’\n\nPresident Trump told reporters on Friday morning outside the White House that he’s going to North Carolina because the state has been treated badly since Hurricane Helene and to California where he said the wildfires should have been extinguished already.\n\n“North Carolina is a horrible thing the way that’s been allowed to fester. It should have been done months ago,” Trump said. “North Carolina has been treated very badly.”\n\nTrump will visit Los Angeles later in the day to hear about the wildfires.\n\n“We’re going to take a look at the fire if they let the water flow, but they didn’t let the water flow,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump's travel schedule ‒ minute by minute\n\nPresident Trump left the White House by helicopter at 9:16 a.m. for his tour of disaster areas in North Carolina and California on Friday.

Stein to meet Trump\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is planning to meet Trump on the tarmac of Asheville Regional Airport during Trump’s visit to Western North Carolina, according to The Citizen-Times, a USA TODAY Network partner.\n\nEarlier in the week, Stein, a Democrat, said Trump’s planned visit to western North Carolina, which was ravaged by Tropical Storm Helene nearly four months ago, was “very good news” for the region’s residents. The storm killed more than 100 people across the state and caused an estimated $60 billion in damage, according to the latest estimate from the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management.\n\n‒ Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nWhat is Trump’s schedule today?\n\nTrump's disaster-area tour begins around 10 a.m. EST on his first trip away from Washington.

Trump is expected to reach California around 6:15 p.m. EST.\n\nThe president ends his Friday with a flight to Las Vegas, where he'll spend the night before hosting a downtown rally on Saturday. Trump won Nevada in 2024 after losing it four years earlier, and he recently told reporters he wanted to “thank them for the votes.”\n\nA video message from the president will also play at the annual March for Life rally by anti-abortion advocates on Capitol Hill this morning.

He also accused former President Joe Biden of failing the people of North Carolina after the storm.\n\n“The highest responsibility and deepest obligation of the American government is to protect its people, and that’s never truer than in times of emergency like this,” Trump said. “Unfortunately, our government failed you, but it wasn’t the Trump government. It was the government run by Biden.”\n\nFlanked by storm survivors like Kim West, who shared a story of narrowly escaping her flooded home when Helene swept through the region Sept. 27, Trump promised housing solutions that “go beyond mere temporary hotel stays.” He also teased overhauling or even eliminating the agency providing those stays, which has been a source of confusion and frustration for some participants in FEMA's Transitional Sheltering Assistance program.\n\n\"We'll begin the work of fundamentally changing, terminating or overhauling FEMA,\" Trump said. \"FEMA has been a disaster, no matter where they are.\"\n\nPressure and promises\n\nEarlier in the day, families and supporters greeted Trump with cheers and selfie attempts after Air Force One touched down at Asheville Regional Airport just before 11 a.m. Traveling with Trump were Republican members of North Carolina’s congressional delegation, including Rep. Chuck Edwards who represents the state’s 11th District, which covers much of Western North Carolina.\n\nEdwards told the Citizen Times he spoke to Trump about the needs of the region’s residents on the flight down from Washington D.C. and was optimistic Trump would “apply the pressure at the very highest levels in Washington D.C.” to expedite the federal government’s response to the region.\n\n“He’s here to keep the promises that he made to us,” Edwards said.\n\nJosh Stein, North Carolina’s Democratic governor, met Trump on the tarmac and asked for an additional $20 billion in disaster relief for the state, plus six more months of 100% reimbursement for eligible FEMA expenses, Stein’s office said in a Jan. 24 news release.\n\n“Families, businesses and communities are struggling and need these urgent resources to help them rebuild,” Stein said. “I look forward to working with the Trump Administration in the coming weeks and months to get people what they need to rebuild and recover.”\n\nIn December, Edwards co-sponsored a bipartisan spending bill set to deliver much-needed federal disaster relief funds to the region in the storm’s wake. Passage of the continuing resolution provided more than $100 billion to states across the country for recovery efforts following Helene and other disasters like Hurricane Milton, which hit Florida in October.\n\nTwo previous versions of the bill failed to pass the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nAt the time, Edwards said the additional funds will help North Carolina residents “rebuild communities and put our lives back together.” He later told the Citizen Times that the bill would provide the state $16 billion for recovery, some of which is already flowing in, though that figure is still short of an initial $25.5 billion ask made by Stein and other state and local leaders during a trip to Washington D.C. in November.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the airport, Trump said Stein and Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, would work on plans for demolition of damaged buildings and cleaning up debris. Trump said the federal government would probably provide 75% of the funding.\n\n“We’re going to supply the money, a lot of the money,” Trump said.\n\nEdwards, and two other Republican lawmakers, Virginia Foxx and Tim Moore, will help guide recovery efforts alongside Whatley, Trump said.\n\n‘FEMA helped me’\n\nTrump made a previous trip to the region in October, visiting hard-hit Swannanoa to survey damage less than a month after the storm ripped through the state, killing more than 100 people and causing nearly $60 billion in damage.\n\nBefore Trump's motorcade returned for a second visit, more than 50 people lined U.S. 70 to greet the president, some with handmade signs and banners, including Lucy Bickers, 69, who held a sign with the words, “FEMA helped me.”\n\nA resident of Swannanoa for more than two decades, Bickers told the Citizen Times she was “trying to balance the narrative” and believes Trump’s harsh criticism of FEMA “empowers the people who are anti everything.”\n\n“He's going there just to put on a show that he cares,” Bickers, a retired social worker, said.\n\nDuring Trump’s press conference in Swannanoa, he repeatedly criticized FEMA and the Biden administration for its Helene response, which he called a \"disgrace,\" while suggesting his administration would make changes so the region’s roads could be rebuilt without being hamstrung by “bureaucratic barriers,” like permitting.\n\n“That’s the way they built them many years ago, I guarantee you that,” Trump said. “We will get them back very quickly.”\n\nWhen Trump’s motorcade left Swannanoa to return to the airport, where Trump departed for California to survey wildfire damage there, supporters like Kate Feathers called out “thank you” as it passed.\n\nFeathers told the Citizen Times that she was “so grateful that he showed up.”\n\n“He just became president Monday,” said Feathers, who lives in nearby Beacon Village and watched her neighbors’ homes flood during Helene. “Now, it’s Friday, and he’s here.”\n\nBart Jansen contributed reporting.\n\nJacob Biba is the Helene Recovery Reporter for the Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA TODAY Network.

Billy Long, said Long, R-Missouri, asked President Trump to come to southwest Missouri.\n\n\"I think the president wanted to honor that request. He also enjoys a large base of support in southwest Missouri, so it makes a lot of sense for him to come here to make the announcement,\" Reding told the News-Leader. \"The congressman has long enjoyed a great working relationship with the president. The congressman has been a supporter of the president from early on. He has continued to support the president through the early months of his administration, and the president recognized that support from the congressman.\"\n\nThe political demographics of the region make it a favorable destination. Trump carried the state easily in November, garnering half a million more votes than Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn Greene County, Trump won with 60 percent of the vote — a slightly larger margin than across the rest of the state. His margins were even higher in the rural areas surrounding Springfield.\n\n\"We're a big stronghold down here in the 7th (Congressional) District, got him a lot of votes,\" said Danette Proctor, chairwoman of the Greene County Republican Central Committee. She also noted it was \"pretty cool\" that Trump's visit would come almost exactly a year after Vice President Mike Pence, then a candidate, held a rally in downtown Springfield. Video:\n\nThis aligns with what several professors who study politics told the News-Leader as they pointed to several other reasons why Trump might feel comfortable starting a tax reform push in Springfield.\n\n\"Trump has support in Missouri and especially in the southwest corner,\" said Elizabeth Dudash-Buskirk, a socio-political communication professor at Missouri State University. \"He wants to kick off somewhere to draw attention to the lower economic classes, working classes, farmers, hard workers, but (also) somewhere he is liked, especially for a new tax policy.\"\n\nContinuing on this line, Dudash-Buskirk described the visit as a way for Trump to spend time in America's heartland. \"A good bit of his time in the coal mining areas, the steel workers, the auto workers, may have suggested his farmers (and) heartland workers feel forgotten and he wants to reconnect.\"\n\nAs University of Missouri-Columbia professor Peverill Squire noted, Trump \"is likely to face a friendly audience\" in Springfield.\n\nDudash-Buskirk also said Trump may consider the visit a thank-you of sorts for having MSU's chorale sing at his inauguration in January and might want to show an affinity for fellow Republicans Sen. Roy Blunt and Gov. Eric Greitens, who won their respective races with narrower margins than Trump's victory in Missouri.\n\nDan Ponder, a professor of political science at Drury University, also noted that this corner of Missouri is \"heavily Republican\" and \"it would not do\" for Trump to go to St. Louis or Kansas City — bigger cities, but Democratic hotbeds.\n\nTrump's last campaign-style rally was earlier this week in Phoenix. The president was met with a friendly crowd inside an arena and protesters in the streets outside.\n\nSpringfield's smaller size might have worked to its favor, Dudash-Buskirk said. Picking the third-largest city in Missouri could come as a surprise and draw more attention to his message and \"allow for great security.\"\n\n\"It will be easy to control crowds here,\" she said, because \"it is a smaller city than most, but will draw attention because it is a kick-off and a lot of people will ask, 'Why Springfield, Missouri?'\"\n\nIn addition to the Springfield area being mostly red, Ponder said, \"St. Louis and K.C. might be less hospitable to Trump.\"\n\nHe referenced the possibility of unfavorable Trump-related press regarding the unrest in Ferguson in 2014 and the more recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n\"Plus with race on everyone's mind, my guess is he does not want to go near Ferguson lest it meet with hardcore resistance on a larger scale,\" Ponder continued. \"Many in this area are critical of his response to Charlottesville, but (Springfield) is not quite as large and certainly more conservative.\"\n\nMissouri as a whole has voted more conservatively in recent years, leading to what many see as a difficult time ahead for U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat.\n\nProctor, the local GOP leader, said she thought Trump \"could help out in the McCaskill race and energize the base\" while Republican candidates jockey to replace McCaskill, who is seeking her third term.\n\nRobertson, the UMSL professor, said there was precedent for a presidential visit such as Trump coming to Springfield leading up to a midterm election such as the 2018 race.\n\n\"Other presidents push their agendas and the election of their allies in the months preceding an off-year election,\" Robertson said. \"Presidents Reagan (1986) and George W. Bush (2002) both visited Springfield in support of Republican Senate candidates.\"\n\nBush spoke at what was then Southwest Missouri State University in 2002 to support former U.S. Sen. Jim Talent, R-Missouri. The 43rd president stumped for Talent again in 2006.\n\nThe Springfield speech signals that Trump wants Republicans in Congress to move on after they failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and switch tactics to tackle taxes.\n\n\"I assume the GOP members of the state congressional delegation would be supportive of whatever sort of tax package might eventually emerge, so (Trump) doesn't need to persuade them,\" said Squire, the Mizzou professor. \"He might hope to pressure Sen. McCaskill on taxes, but in the absence of any actual legislation to tout, that probably won't work. Consequently, it is not clear what the administration hopes to accomplish with this visit.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nWhen was Donald Trump last in Springfield?\n\nPence, Greitens rail against Clinton, Koster in front of Trump supporters in Springfield", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/01/23/trump-is-visiting-asheville-jan-24-see-scenes-from-his-last-2-stops/77912780007/", "title": "Trump is visiting Asheville Jan. 24.

He then flew to Los Angeles and toured damage from devastating wildfires in the region, which are ongoing.\n\nTrump met with governors in both states, local officials, emergency responders and property owners in his first official trip as president.\n\nHere are some takeaways.\n\nTrump makes nice with Newsom\n\nThe relationship between the GOP president and California's Democratic governor has often been contentious.\n\nTrump likes to refer to Newsom as \"Newscum.\"\n\nThey set those animosities aside Friday as both men grapple with one of the nation's worst natural disasters in memory.\n\nNewsom waited for Trump at the bottom of the stairs as he departed from Air Force One in Los Angeles. They embraced and spoke to the media together.\n\n“We’re gonna need your support, we’re gonna need your help,” Newsom said. “You were there for us during COVID, I don’t forget that, and I have all the expectations that we’ll be able to work together.”\n\n“We’re gonna get it done,” Trump responded, adding: “We’ll get it worked out, ok?”\n\nTrump noted that California will need a lot of federal help. Newsom agreed.\n\n“We’re gonna take care of things,” Trump responded.\n\nTrump suggest abolishing FEMA\n\nTrump ratcheted up his criticism of the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a suggestion to possibly abolish the agency because of its response to Hurricane Helene in September.\n\n“I’ll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA or maybe even getting rid of FEMA,” Trump said after a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina. “Frankly, FEMA’s not good.”\n\nTrump accused FEMA crews of being unfamiliar with areas when responding to disasters. FEMA also imposes rules and requirements on crews that aren’t as good as what local officials provide, Trump said. The federal government should instead send funding to governors to manage their own response to disasters, he said.\n\n“FEMA has turned out to be a disaster,” Trump said. “I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly – we pay a percentage to the state.”\n\nAfter speaking with flood victims in Swannanoa, North Carolina, Trump later added, “If it was up to me right now, I’d end it right now.\"\n\n'Horrific' tales escaping North Carolina floods from Hurricane Helene\n\nSurvivors of Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina described their harrowing escapes from rising floodwaters to Trump on Friday and pleaded for help four months after the disaster.\n\nThomas Bright spent four hours on the roof of his home in east Asheville that had been in his family for 80 years and four generations. He wrote farewell notes on his cellphone to his two children and his two grandchildren as his garage and other debris floated past.\n\n“We didn’t think we were going to make it at all,” Bright said. “We were watching houses, trailers, bodies coming by us.”\n\nMona Nix-Roper, who lives in the Fairview area, said her home became like an island as floodwaters rose around it. As she hiked out with her son, they saw a neighbor’s body that had turned blue in the water.\n\n“Horrific is just all I can say,” Nix-Roper said. “There were people out everywhere looking for their loved ones. And there were dead bodies. My son’s like, ‘Mom, you’re going to see things you don’t want to see.’”\n\nTrump gave her a hug when she finished speaking.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of bad things, but I’ve never seen anything like it,” Trump said.\n\nPolitics shadowed Trump's visits to disaster areas\n\nPolitics shadowed Trump's visits to disaster zones in North Carolina and California.\n\nTrump recalled a whistleblower reported that Federal Emergency Management Agency crews refused to help people with Trump's 2024 presidential campaign signs in their yards. Trump noted that North Carolina and adjoining Tennessee each supported him in the last election – the Volunteer State slightly more.\n\n“It doesn’t matter at this point: Biden did a bad job,” Trump said.\n\nThe president also called for California to adopt voter ID, to ensure the citizenship of voters, to receive disaster aid for its wildfires around Los Angeles. He also repeated his complaint that the state should divert funding from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to fight fires.\n\n“I want two things,” Trump told reporters upon his arrival in Asheville, North Carolina. “After that, I will be the greatest president California has ever seen.”\n\nTrump didn't invite Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a frequent critic of Trump, to join his trip. Schiff said changes to the Environmental Protection Agency and FEMA could result from bipartisan cooperation. But he urged Trump not to attach strings to disaster aid.\n\n“We've never done that when it comes to our fellow citizens who are hurting,” Schiff told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”\n\nTrump wants fast track permitting to rebuild after fires\n\nTrump met with local officials in California after touring fire damage in Pacific Palisades Friday and asked them to speed up permitting for people who want to rebuild.\n\nThe meeting lasted for more than an hour, with the real estate developer turned president often returning to the permitting issue.\n\nTrump said he plans to waive or drastically speed up federal permitting in the wake of the fires that have devastated areas around Los Angeles, adding “the local, I hope, is going to do the same exact thing.”\n\nMembers of the California congressional delegation, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other local leaders joined Trump at the meeting, sharing their thoughts on fire recovery efforts. Trump listened and sometimes raised concerns.\n\nThe president said he heard from homeowners worried about how long it could take to rebuild.\n\n“We are 100% committed to getting this neighborhood rebuilt again,” Bass said.\n\nTrump said permitting should take days, not months or years.\n\n“A federal permit can take 10 years, we’re not going to do that,” Trump said. “We don’t want to take 10 days.”\n\nOfficials need to be mindful of “hazardous waste,” Bass said, but added that if people are rebuilding “essentially the same… they really shouldn’t have to go through much of a process.”\n\n“What’s hazardous waste? You’re gonna have to define that,” Trump responded, adding: “I just think you have to allow the people to go on their site and start the process tonight.”\n\n“And we will,” Bass responded.\n\nOther people brought up insurance issues that homeowners are facing. Trump also repeatedly raised questions about water management policies in California.\n\nTrump told the group that “the federal government’s standing behind you 100%” but has talked about putting conditions on federal fire recovery aid.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/24"}]}

For the latest news on Hurricane Melissa, please visit USA TODAY's coverage for Friday, Oct. 31.\n\nParts of the Caribbean are conducting search and rescue operations and surveying the extensive destruction Hurricane Melissa brought to the region, leaving dozens of people dead and drawing an outpouring of support from the international community.\n\nMelissa tore through the Caribbean as one of the most powerful storms in recorded history and made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday as a deadly Category 5 hurricane. By Thursday, the storm had further weakened as it moved over the southeastern Bahamas and toward Bermuda, about 500 miles off the U.S. East Coast.\n\nThe hardest-hit areas include Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti, where damaging winds and severe flooding from storm surge and days of rainfall destroyed homes and tore down utility poles.\n\nRescue and recovery operations are hampered by widespread power outages, communications failures, and blocked roads. The death toll is growing — with more than 50 deaths attributed to the storm in Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic — as authorities continued to verify reported deaths.\n\n\"There are entire communities that seem to be marooned and also areas that have been flattened,\" said Jamaican Minister of Education, Skills, Youth, and Information Dana Dixon. \"We are trying to get to the areas that have been marooned. We will get there... we are going to get to every single Jamaican and give them support.”\n\n“The entire Jamaica is really broken because of what has happened, but we remain resilient,\" Dixon said.\n\nCountries, including the United States, have pledged support in the form of cash, food aid, and rescue teams. On Thursday, an Urban Search and Rescue team from Fairfax, Virginia, posted photos on social media as the team flew out to Jamaica as part of the U.S. State Department's post-hurricane response to the country.\n\nSee satellite images: Hurricane Melissa's devastation in Jamaica\n\nOver 50 deaths reported in Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic\n\nAuthorities in Haiti, which was battered with days of rain, said Thursday that at least 30 people were killed in the storm and 20 more were missing. At least 23 people, including 10 children, died due to floods in Petit-Goâve, a coastal town about 40 miles west of the capital, where a river burst its banks.\n\nIn Jamaica, officials said they had dedicated a helicopter to the recovery of bodies. The country's information minister told Reuters on Thursday that at least 19 people were killed in the storm.\n\nDesmond McKenzie, Jamaica's minister of local government and community development, acknowledged during a news briefing earlier in the day that there were casualties and the number was expected to rise. He urged the public to wait for official confirmation from local authorities.\n\nAt least two deaths were reported in the Dominican Republic, including one person who died before the storm made landfall, according to the Pan American Health Organization. Before landfall, authorities also reported the storm caused three deaths in Jamaica and three in Haiti.\n\nNo deaths were reported in Cuba as of Thursday, but authorities said the island had suffered severe damage. According to Francisco Pichon, resident coordinator for Cuba at the United Nations, more than 200 communities are entirely cut off by flooding and landslides, so more information about potential casualties would be forthcoming as responders access them.\n\nPower outages, widespread damage reported in hard-hit Jamaica\n\nOver 70% of electrical customers in Jamaica remained without power as of Thursday morning, said the country's Energy Minister Daryl Vaz. Many schools remained without power or water, officials said.\n\nAerial footage and photos showed downed power lines strewn across the island's roadways. More than 130 roads remained blocked by trees and debris, authorities said.\n\nMembers of the Jamaica Defence Force cleared roadways on foot into isolated areas as ambulances followed close behind. One road in the hard-hit coastal town of Black River was swamped with more than four feet of sand stretching over a mile, according to officials.\n\nIn a neighborhood of the island's Montego Bay, 77-year-old Alfred Hines waded barefoot through thick mud and debris as he described his narrow escape from the rising floodwaters.\n\n\"At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape,\" he told Reuters. \"I just want to forget it and things come back to normal.\"\n\nSearch and rescue teams from the United States were heading to Jamaica on Thursday to assist in recovery efforts, authorities said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was prepared to offer \"immediate humanitarian aid\" to the people of Cuba.\n\nDelivery of relief supplies, access for emergency vehicles\n\nJamaican officials are using helicopters to deliver relief supplies and transfer patients to other hospitals, Dixon and others said during a news conference. In some locations, helicopters have been unable to find clear spots to land, she said.\n\nDixon also described grueling work being done in some locations to clear roads to allow access for emergency vehicles, such as crews using machetes to cut through bamboo plants.\n\nOfficials also described a great anxiety and uncertainty among island residents who have been unable to contact family members in some of the hardest-hit and flooded areas. Some airports were reopened on Thursday for relief flights.\n\nBermuda prepares for Hurricane Melissa's approach\n\nBermuda was preparing on Thursday for Melissa to pass nearby to its west overnight. Hurricane- and tropical storm-force winds extend far out from its center and will still reach Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nConditions are expected to \"rapidly deteriorate\" in Bermuda through the evening on Thursday, with strong winds, hazardous seas, and dangerous rip currents. At 11 p.m. ET, Melissa had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and was centered about 160 miles west-southwest of Bermuda, the hurricane center said.\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect, and forecasters warned that \"preparations should be rushed to completion\" before tropical storm-force winds reach Bermuda.\n\nThe country expected to close its causeway Thursday night and shutter schools and ferries on Friday \"out of an abundance of caution,\" National Security Minister Michael Weeks said in a statement. \"I implore all residents to remain vigilant while we navigate another natural threat to our way of life,\" he said.\n\nA statement from the Bermuda Tourism Authority emphasized the country's track record of hurricane resilience and advised tourists to follow official updates and contact travel providers with questions about any changes in operations. The Bermuda Hotel Association offers a ‘Hurricane Guarantee’ for travelers that offers penalty-free cancellations when itineraries are disrupted by hurricanes, the authority stated.\n\nEven as Bermuda battened down for its own brush with Melissa, Premier David Burt pledged the country’s support for Jamaica, which he termed “a resilient country with a proud history” and a strong connection to Bermuda.\n\n“The path to recovery and rebuilding will be a long process and we will continue to work with the Government and people of Jamaica to help where we can,” Burt stated. “We will play our part as that resilience is tested and join the regional and international effort to aid the recovery.”\n\nMelissa could graze Canada on its way out to sea\n\nAfter zooming by Bermuda, Melissa will continue northeast, passing the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland on Saturday morning as an \"extratropical\" hurricane-strength storm, according to Houston-based meteorologist Matt Lanza on his blog \"The Eyewall.\" That means it won't be classified as a hurricane.\n\n\"On the current track, forecast impacts would be mostly minor to moderate in southeast Newfoundland and the Avalon Peninsula, with the worst of the storm remaining offshore,\" he said. \"If for some reason the storm tracks closer to Atlantic Canada, impacts would worsen in Newfoundland. As of now, this looks like a manageable storm, albeit one with the usual hazards from gusty winds to heavy rain to rough seas and high tides in Newfoundland.\"\n\nUS East Coast could see 'life-threatening' surf from Melissa\n\nDespite being far out to sea, Melissa could still impact beachgoers along the U.S. East Coast.\n\nOcean swells generated by Melissa are \"likely to reach the coast of the northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada Friday and persist into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nMeteorologist: Climate change likely a factor in Melissa's rapid intensification\n\nMelissa rapidly intensified last weekend from a tropical storm to a ferocious major hurricane in less than a day, which many scientists say is a clear signal of human-caused climate change due to the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nWhy is this? Climate change increases the rapid intensification of hurricanes by making ocean waters warmer, which provides more fuel for storms. Hurricanes gain strength as they move over warm seawater.\n\n\"Increasing the amount of heat in the ocean increases the odds of rapid intensification, with the largest increases in peak intensification rates occurring for the most extreme cases,\" noted meteorologist Jeff Masters on the Yale Climate Connections blog in August.\n\nIn addition, air that's warmer holds more moisture and warmer oceans reduce wind shear, allowing storms to strengthen more quickly and become more powerful.\n\nAll of this leads to a higher probability of rapid intensification and a greater number of more intense hurricanes.\n\nOne study from 2024, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said that the world’s most intense hurricanes are growing even more intense, fueled by rising temperatures in the ocean and atmosphere.\n\nAmerican tourist remains stranded in Jamaica\n\nTourists who were unable to leave Jamaica before Melissa hit experienced the storm’s full force and are now stranded on the island due to flight cancellations.\n\nJen Eley, a teacher from Silver Spring, Maryland, was on vacation at the RIU Aquarelle resort in Falmouth, Jamaica, when the storm hit. Falmouth is in northwestern Jamaica.\n\n\"I went to Jamaica with a friend to celebrate her birthday,\" she said via text on Thursday. \"We arrived on Thursday and were set to leave on Monday.\n\n\"Once the storm finally started, there was a lot of wind and rain. We boarded up the balcony door/window in our room with the bed's box spring, the dresser, and couch. During the storm we heard a lot of commotion in the hallways, I'm assuming from the wind and debris.\"\n\nShe said that at one point, everything went silent for about 90 minutes, then the wind picked up again \"and we could feel the building swaying. After the rain stopped, there was a strange howling sound from the wind that was loud, constant, and all night long.\"\n\nEley said she's still not sure when she'll return to the United States – spotty cell service and internet access have made it difficult to book another return flight.\n\nState department issues declaration of humanitarian need for Cuba after Hurricane Melissa\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio released a statement on Thursday regarding Melissa’s devastation of eastern Cuba. The Trump administration “stands with the brave Cuban people who continue to struggle to meet basic needs,” stated Rubio, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba in 1956.\n\nAs in neighboring communities, the state department is issuing a declaration of humanitarian need for Cuba and is prepared “to provide immediate humanitarian assistance directly and via local partners who can most effectively deliver it to those in need.”\n\nAlthough the U.S. has an economic embargo against Cuba, there are exemptions and authorizations for private donations of food, medicine, other humanitarian supplies and disaster reply, according to the department’s statement. Anyone who wants to directly support the Cuban people should contact the state department if there are questions or issues at CubaHumanitarian@state.gov.\n\nThe strained relationship between the U.S. and Cuba for more than 60 years has produced a mixed record on offers and acceptance of aid between the two countries.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration declined Cuba’s offer to send doctors to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nAfter Gustav in 2008, the US provided $100,000 in immediate emergency assistance to non-governmental organizations working in humanitarian relief in Cuba. The U.S. also committed to providing up to $5 million in relief assistance to Cuban hurricane victims. But a day after the assistance was offered, the Cuban government declined the offer. Cuba has maintained relief partnerships with other countries.\n\nAfter Category 5 Hurricane Irma struck the island in 2017, the U.S. sent response teams to other Caribbean islands, but did not send a team to Cuba. That's because the smaller country had not made a required request for assistance, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nAfter Hurricane Ian in 2022, Cuba’s government requested emergency assistance after the entire island lost electricity. The U.S. said it would provide $2 million for emergency relief through the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nHurricane Melissa has wreaked havoc: Here's how you can help.\n\nHow you can help Caribbean nations devastated by Hurricane Melissa\n\nHumanitarian organizations have begun mobilizing to provide immediate relief and prepare for long-term recovery after the storm.\n\nYou can help with donations and other forms of support for organizations, including American Friends of Jamaica, the American Red Cross, Americares, CARE, Global Giving, the Salvation Army, and several others.

Though rescue and recovery operations were underway, efforts continued to be hindered by widespread power outages and blocked roads.\n\nIn Jamaica, local authorities said crews and residents were working to assist with relief support. Desmond McKenzie, the country's minister of local government and community development, previously said over 170 communities across six parishes were moderately or severely affected by the storm.\n\n\"We have never had a Category 5 hurricane in our country. The devastation in the west is unimaginable,\" said Jamaican Minister of Education, Skills, Youth and Information Dana Morris Dixon at a news conference Friday.\n\nIn Cuba and Haiti, heavy rainfall caused extensive damage. According to Francisco Pichon, resident coordinator for Cuba at the United Nations, more than 200 communities remained isolated and without communications due to flooding and landslides. The former hurricane unleashed catastrophic flooding in Haiti, damaging homes and forcing thousands of people into emergency shelters.\n\nOfficials across the region said they expected the death toll to rise as they continued to verify reported deaths and search for missing people. By Thursday night, at least 50 deaths had been attributed to the storm. In Jamaica, 19 deaths have been confirmed but the number is expected to increase, Dixon said Friday.\n\nAt least 50 deaths reported in Haiti, Jamaica, Dominican Republic after ex-Hurricane Melissa\n\nAuthorities in Haiti, which was not directly hit by the former hurricane but was battered with days of rainfall, said Thursday that at least 30 people were killed in the storm and 20 more were missing. At least 23 people, including 10 children, died due to floods in Petit-Goâve, a coastal town about 40 miles west of the capital, where a river burst its banks.\n\nIn Jamaica, at least 19 people were killed in the storm, officials confirmed Friday, but the death toll is expected to rise as authorities confirm additional death reports. Local officials previously said they had dedicated a helicopter to the recovery of bodies and authorities were continuing search and rescue efforts.\n\n\"These are Jamaicans who we are so devastated to know that they have lost their lives. Every single life lost is a huge tragedy,\" Dixon said.\n\nAt least two deaths were reported in the Dominican Republic, including one person who died before the storm made landfall, according to the Pan American Health Organization. Before landfall, authorities also reported the storm caused three deaths in Jamaica and three in Haiti.\n\nMelissa weakens and retreats from Bermuda\n\nFriday morning, Melissa barreled away from Bermuda after making its closest approach at about 2 a.m. ET, reaching about 150 miles north-northwest from land as a Category 1 storm with hurricane-force wind gusts reaching Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nBy 11 a.m., Melissa was downgraded to a \"powerful\" post-tropical cyclone packing 85 mph winds and retreating to the northeast at 48 mph.\n\nMelissa is expected to make a gradual slowdown and turn to the east-northeast over the weekend and weaken further over the next few days.\n\nJamaica works to deliver food, clear roads\n\nJamaican officials said on Friday its works department had made progress on clearing key roads to allow first responders to access communities hit by Melissa.\n\nAdditional resources, including helicopters, have arrived in Jamaica that will be used to deliver food and other aid to impacted communities that are difficult to reach, Dixon said. Dixon previously pledged the Jamaican government would continue working until it reaches every person who needs help.\n\n\"There are many individuals who are not hearing from their families because of the communication break,\" she added.\n\nMelissa to impact Atlantic Canada, Northeast US next\n\nPost-Tropical Cyclone Melissa is expected to pass to the south of the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, Canada, on Friday night, the hurricane center said. It will also reach about 580 miles from Nantucket, Massachusetts, later Friday.\n\nSwells generated by the storm will impact the Northeast U.S. coast and Atlantic Canada and persist into the weekend, bringing life-threatening rip currents and surf conditions, forecasters said.\n\nMelissa will bring \"significant risks to lives, property and business operations\" in Newfoundland, AccuWeather reported.\n\nFormer Hurricane Melissa is influencing North Carolina ocean conditions\n\nLong period waves from ex-Hurricane Melissa are forecast to bring large surf to North Carolina’s Outer Banks on Friday.\n\nA significant wave run up may result in the ocean reaching past the dunes in vulnerable locations, said the National Weather Service in Morehead City.\n\nOnly isolated road closures are expected, the weather service said.\n\nFive houses collapsed in Buxton, North Carolina, this week and officials at Cape Hatteras National Seashore has reported other homes remain at risk.\n\nA high risk of rip currents is forecast along the Outer Banks and North Carolina coast on Friday from North Topsail Beach to Duck.\n\nBecause of Melissa’s angle as it moves away into the North Atlantic, its swell is not expected to affect the New England coast, said Joe Dellicarpini, a meteorologist with the weather service in Boston.\n\nDozens of health centers impacted by Melissa, organization says\n\nClinics and hospitals in Jamaica sustained \"extensive damage\" when Melissa roared through the island nation, and dozens of health centers in Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic were impacted, according to a report from the Pan American Health Organization.\n\nThe hardest-hit hospitals were all in the western half of the island, according to the report. Black River Hospital in St. Elizabeth, Jamaica, is inoperable with its roof collapsed, walls damaged and extensive flooding, the report said. Falmouth Hospital in Trelawny was severely damaged from storm surge flooding, while Noel Holmes in Hanover and Cornwall Regional in St. James were both damaged and had services relocated.\n\nFive hospitals in Jamaica have reopened for full services and several other health centers began delivering services during limited hours on Thursday, government officials said in an update. Other hospitals are in \"emergency mode,\" providing critical and life-saving care only.\n\nHere's how you can help Caribbean nations devastated by Hurricane Melissa\n\nHumanitarian organizations have begun mobilizing to provide immediate relief and prepare for long-term recovery after the storm.\n\nYou can help with donations and other forms of support for organizations, including American Friends of Jamaica, the American Red Cross, Americares, CARE, Global Giving, the Salvation Army, and several others.

The storm was located about 255 miles north of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds near 90 mph with higher gusts.\n\nForecasters said Melissa is moving toward the northeast around 41 mph, with this general motion expected to continue into Saturday, followed by a slowdown and a turn toward the east-northeast later in the weekend. The center of Melissa is expected to pass to the south of the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland as a post-tropical cyclone Friday night, Oct. 31.\n\nAfter Melissa becomes post-tropical, a \"brief period of heavy rain and gusty winds\" is possible over the southern Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland Friday night, the hurricane center said in the advisory.\n\nSwells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions of Hispaniola, Cuba, the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Bermuda during the next couple of days, the NHC said, with the swells expected to reach the northeastern coast of the U.S. and Atlantic coast of Canada Friday and persist into the weekend.\n\nThe swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, forecasters said.\n\nHurricane Melissa tracker\n\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm.

By Thursday, the storm had further weakened as it moved over the southeastern Bahamas and toward Bermuda, about 500 miles off the U.S. East Coast.\n\nThe hardest-hit areas include Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti, where damaging winds and severe flooding from storm surge and days of rainfall destroyed homes and tore down utility poles.\n\nRescue and recovery operations are hampered by widespread power outages, communications failures, and blocked roads. The death toll is growing — with more than 50 deaths attributed to the storm in Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic — as authorities continued to verify reported deaths.\n\n\"There are entire communities that seem to be marooned and also areas that have been flattened,\" said Jamaican Minister of Education, Skills, Youth, and Information Dana Dixon. \"We are trying to get to the areas that have been marooned. We will get there... we are going to get to every single Jamaican and give them support.”\n\n“The entire Jamaica is really broken because of what has happened, but we remain resilient,\" Dixon said.\n\nHow do hurricanes form?\n\nHurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.\n\nA tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reach 39 mph.

For the latest news on Hurricane Melissa, visit USA TODAY's coverage for Wednesday, Oct. 29.\n\nThe center of catastrophic Hurricane Melissa was moving off the Jamaican coast on Tuesday evening, pushing toward Cuba with dangerous winds and storm surge while still pummeling Jamaica in a relentless swath of destruction.\n\nMelissa slammed into the coast near New Hope, about 40 miles south of Montego Bay, with its center marking an official landfall at about 1 p.m. Melissa struck the island as a Category 5 hurricane, with sustained wind speeds of 185 mph and higher gusts, earning a spot in history as one of the most intense storms ever to make landfall in the Atlantic.\n\nIn Jamaica, the entire island \"felt the brunt of Melissa,\" Desmond McKenzie, the island's minister of local government and community development, said during an evening news conference. “Almost every parish is experiencing blocked roads, fallen trees, and utilities poles and excess flooding.\"\n\nThe storm's journey across the island disrupted the hurricane's structure, with a clear eye no longer visible on satellite. The still powerful hurricane had weakened to a Category 4, with maximum sustained wind speeds of 145 mph and higher gusts, according to a 5 p.m. update from the National Hurricane Center.\n\nAfter further weakening to 125 mph as it moved offshore of Jamaica, Melissa had regained sustained winds of 130 mph by 11 p.m. It appeared to be on a re-strengthening trend, and its eye appeared to be growing better defined again, the hurricane center stated.\n\nThe storm, centered about 110 miles southwest of Guantanamo, and about 300 miles south of the Central Bahamas, was expected to strike Cuba within hours. Melissa is expected to sweep across the southeastern and central Bahamas on Oct. 29.\n\nA hurricane warning remains in effect for the Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, Holguin, and Las Tunas, as well as the central and southeastern Bahamas. By early on the morning of Oct. 31, Melissa is forecast to pass over or near Bermuda with 100 mph winds as it travels quickly to the northeast in the Atlantic.\n\nCuban authorities said they had evacuated about 500,000 people from areas vulnerable to winds and flooding, Reuters reported. \"Melissa will arrive with force, and there's great concern about what it could destroy in its wake,\" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a message published in state newspaper Granma. He urged people in vulnerable areas to evacuate.\n\nIn the Bahamas, Prime Minister Philip Davis has ordered evacuations for people in the region that could be impacted by Melissa.\n\n'One of its worst periods'\n\n\"Jamaica is going through what I can call one of its worst periods,\" McKenzie said during the news conference. \"Our infrastructure has been severely compromised.\"\n\n“The parish of Saint Elizabeth is under water,” McKenzie said. The parish, known as the country's breadbasket, had \"taken a beating,\" and damage was extensive, he said.\n\nSections of Clarendon Parish were also experiencing severe conditions, and 50 residents of a Santa Cruz infirmary, where care is provided to the poor and needy, had to be relocated, he said. At least three hospitals across the island had been affected by high winds, storm surge, and high water.\n\nSeveral families had been marooned, he said. \"When the parish of Saint Elizabeth was under severe weather, with water as deep as my waist and roofs flying off,\" McKenzie said, a firefighter went to offer assistance, \"but got caught and could not get out.\" At least one of those families had received assistance, but he indicated officials were awaiting further updates. McKenzie said they were praying for no deaths on the island but conditions were still too severe for assessments to be completed.\n\nHurricane Melissa set records See how it compares with historic storms\n\nShortly before landfall, Jamaican electric utility JPS said power outages had affected more than a third of its customers. In its worst-hit parishes, utility provider JPS said some three-quarters of customers lost power, Reuters reported.\n\nJamaican officials said they had made arrangements to bolster the island's communications framework, while health authorities in southeastern Jamaica warned residents to watch out for crocodiles that could be displaced from swamps and rivers.\n\nAt least seven deaths were attributed to Melissa even before its landfall in Jamaica, including three as residents in the island nation prepared for the storm. Torrential downpours were expected to cause flooding and deadly landslides in the island's mountains, where wind speeds were forecast to be as much as 30% higher than at sea level locations.\n\nAs Melissa approached Jamaica on Tuesday morning, the hurricane center had issued a dire warning: \"LAST CHANCE TO PROTECT YOUR LIFE.\"\n\nImpacts 'near the top of what is possible on this planet'\n\nWith its fierce intensification, Melissa became the strongest tropical cyclone of 2025 globally, \"beating out the Western Pacific’s Typhoon Ragasa,\" meteorologist Jeff Masters wrote for Yale Climate Connections on Oct. 27. At least seven deaths in the Caribbean have been blamed on the dangerous hurricane as of Monday.\n\nMelissa's powerful winds left it tied \"with the heavy hitters\" in hurricane history for second strongest winds on record, Phil Klotzbach, a senior hurricane research scientist at Colorado State University, told USA TODAY.\n\nHurricane Melissa is “truly an unprecedented event for the Atlantic Basin, and particularly Jamaica,” said Jeff Waters, director of hurricane models at Moody’s.\n\n“While too early to comment on any economic or insured loss impacts, this will undoubtedly be a generational and humanitarian event for Jamaica and perhaps other impacted areas in the Caribbean,\" Waters said.\n\nWith winds near 250 mph being measured just above the surface, stronger winds would likely impact higher terrain as the eye moves across the island, said Alan Gerard, a retired NOAA meteorologist, in an update on the afternoon of Oct. 28.\n\nWhen Gilbert made landfall on the island in 1988, it \"left areas of completely denuded landscape,\" said Gerard, who expected Melissa's damage to be similar or worse.\n\n\"It is not hyperbole to say that western Jamaica is currently experiencing tropical cyclone impacts near the top of what is possible on this planet,\" he said.\n\nCongresswoman and Jamaican ambassador say U.S> government to be key in island's recovery\n\nThe \"potential for devastation is unmatched and couldn’t be underestimated,\" Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-New York, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, said in a post on X on Oct. 28. The Brooklyn congresswoman pointed to anxiety and fear Caribbean American families are experiencing with the storm.\n\n“For many of us with roots in the Caribbean, hurricanes are a familiar threat,” she said.\n\nOn Oct. 27, Antony Anderson, the Jamaican ambassador to the United States, and Clarke discussed the importance of nongovernmental organizations responding in hurricane preparedness and recovery efforts, according to Jessica Myers, a spokesperson for Clarke. But the two officials agreed the largest player in the hours and weeks ahead will be the American government.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nPresident Trump, Miami Heat, others pledge support\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke to reporters on Air Force One en route to Gyeongju, South Korea, and said they were watching the situation closely and would be prepared to offer humanitarian assistance to Jamaica. \"We're prepared to move,\" the president said.\n\nHe expressed surprise at Melissa's high winds. \"I've never seen numbers like that. I saw it a little while ago. 195 mile an hour wind,\" he said. \"I guess it can get that high, but I've never seen it.\"\n\n\"And it's literally just, you know, knocking down everything in front of it,\" he said.\n\nHours before its Oct. 28 game against the Charlotte Hornets, the Miami Heat NBA team announced that, in partnership with the Micky and Madeleine Arison Family Foundation and Carnival Cruise Line, it would make a $1 million donation to assist with recovery efforts following Hurricane Melissa.\n\nIn Miami, where many residents trace their roots back to Jamaica and Cuba, officials posted support and concern on social media this week, including City Commissioner Danielle Cohen Higgins. \"As a first-generation American with both parents and all siblings born in Jamaica, my heart aches for what’s to come,\" Cohen Higgins posted on X on Tuesday afternoon. \"I will help in any and every way I can.\"\n\nAn 'insane flight' into Melissa\n\nHurricane Melissa tied the 1935 Labor Day hurricane in the Florida Keys for the lowest pressure at landfall in the Atlantic, said Andy Hazelton, an associate scientist at the University of Miami's Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies.\n\nHazelton posted this on X shortly after landing after a morning reconnaissance flight on a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft. Hazelton called it \"an absolutely insane flight,\" saying he couldn't believe the data coming from one of the pieces of equipment they dropped into the storm, when it reported winds of 219 knots just above the surface. That converts to a 252 mph gust.\n\nA U.S. Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter mission was forced to return to its operating location on the morning of Oct. 28, after experiencing \"forces stronger than normal due to turbulence,\" the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron announced in a post on X.\n\nSafety procedures require an inspection before returning to normal procedures. It was the second day in a row that turbulence inside the hurricane had forced a reconnaissance flight to end its mission early.\n\nHurricane Melissa makes most powerful landfall in Jamaica history\n\nHurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph – maximum speeds measure winds at the surface, but gusts are higher and winds are stronger at higher elevations.\n\nMelissa breaks the old strongest Jamaican hurricane landfall record set by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 (130 mph winds).\n\nIt's the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall since Dorian (2019), according to Colorado State University's Klotzbach. Dorian also made landfall with 185 mph winds when it hit Abaco Island in the Bahamas.\n\nConditions to pick up 'very quickly' as Hurricane Melissa approaches Jamaica\n\nIn an 11:15 a.m. update, Michael Brennan, the hurricane center's director, said Hurricane Melissa was poised to make landfall within \"an hour or two.\"\n\n\"A very dangerous scenario is now starting to play out in the next few hours as the eye of Melissa moves across Jamaica,\" Brennan said.\n\nWind gusts over 200 mph are possible in some of the high mountains across Jamaica, Brennan said.\n\nBecause Melissa's eye is only 10 miles across, Brennan cautioned that winds and dangerous conditions will pick up \"very quickly\" as the backside of the eye moves through.\n\nHe urged people not to go outside during the brief clearing as the eye passes.\n\n\"We are starting to experience quite a few impacts of this system,\" said Evan Thompson, principal director at Meteorological Service, Jamaica, during an update on Oct. 28.\n\n“We have been experiencing rainfall over much of the island, especially in the west and south,\" Thompson said.\n\nHow to protect yourself from catastrophic Hurricane Melissa winds\n\nThe National Hurricane Center urged Jamaica's residents to act now to protect their lives before the eye of Melissa moves over the island.\n\n\"THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION! TAKE COVER NOW!\" the center said at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nTo protect yourself from wind, put as many walls as possible between you and the outside, moving to an interior room without windows and where you can avoid falling trees, the center said. You can also cover yourself with a mattress and wear a helmet.\n\nLife-threatening winds from Hurricane Melissa will be even worse in the mountains\n\nWithin the catastrophic winds of the eyewall, \"total structural failure is likely, especially in higher elevation areas where wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains could be up to 30% stronger\" than the winds at the surface, the hurricane center warned.\n\nIf the estimated sustained winds at the surface remain at 185 mph, that would put wind speeds at Jamaica's higher elevations well over 230 mph.\n\nHaunting video shows what's inside Hurricane Melissa\n\nBreathtaking video from the eye of fearsome Hurricane Melissa emerged from a Hurricane Hunter flight with the U.S. Air Force Reserve, clearly showing the inner workings that turned it into one of the most powerful storms in the history of the Atlantic hurricane basin.\n\nIn the videos taken on Monday, clusters of clouds swirl around the hurricane's \"eye.\" At times, the clouds show bright white, highlighted by the sun. The relatively calm \"eye\" gives a hurricane its structure and intensity. A storm's most intense winds reside in a ring just around that center known as the eyewall. Read more.\n\nHurricane Melissa to become first Category 5 hurricane to strike Jamaica\n\nJamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness and other officials urged Jamaicans to seek safe shelter and to stay off the roads until the worst of the hurricane passes over. The island's residents were also encouraged to be prepared for impacts they have not experienced with previous hurricanes.\n\n\"Hour by hour, it is becoming apparent that the impact of Hurricane Melissa will be greater than the impact of Hurricane Beryl, certainly in terms of rainfall and flooding,\" Holness said.\n\nMelissa was expected to be the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the island. That's the highest category possible on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. It's also forecast to bring up to a 13-foot storm surge, topped by large battering waves, on the south coast of Jamaica, and a surge almost as high where it's forecast to strike the southeastern coast of Cuba, the hurricane center said.\n\nTracking Hurricane Melissa See Melissa's path as it's set to make landfall in Jamaica\n\nTorrential rains had already been falling for days, and tropical storm-force winds and rain in Melissa's outer bands had begun to batter Jamaica earlier Monday. The hurricane was forecast to make landfall near the Black River and begin increasing in speed.\n\nThe storm could cause \"extensive infrastructural damage, long-lasting power and communication outages,\" isolating communities, the center said.\n\nEven if the hurricane's fiercest winds begin to wane as the hurricane approaches land, the hurricane center warned there is little difference in the destructive power of winds that are Category 4 (130-156 mph) as opposed to Category 5, (greater than 157 mph).\n\nMelissa powered up over the warm waters in the Caribbean last week, its winds increasing by 65 mph in one 15-hour period. Its low barometric pressure and high winds moved Melissa into a rarified group of the most dangerous hurricanes in the Atlantic basin, researchers said.\n\nAfter Jamaica, Hurricane Melissa will take aim at Cuba and the Bahamas\n\nAfter battering Jamaica, a slightly weakened Hurricane Melissa is forecast to continue to move to the northeast and take aim at Cuba late Tuesday and on Wednesday.\n\nTropical storm conditions were expected to begin in eastern Cuba in the afternoon.\n\n\"We continue to see strong support for a landfall just to the west of Santiago de Cuba, the second largest city in the country,\" said Houston-based meteorologist Matt Lanza in his blog The Eyewall Tuesday morning. \"I would anticipate that a category 3 or 4 storm is likely to hit Cuba tomorrow (Wednesday) morning. This looks worse than Sandy and potentially the worst on record in eastern Cuba.\"\n\nOnce across Cuba, Melissa will weaken a little more, entering the southeast Bahamas likely as a Category 2 hurricane, he predicted. Hurricane conditions are expected in the southeastern and central Bahamas on Wednesday, the hurricane center said.\n\nThe center of the storm and worst winds will likely pass near Long Island and Crooked Island in the Bahamas, while impacts will be felt over a wider area, including portions of the Turks and Caicos Islands, according to Lanza.\n\nAfter tearing through the Bahamas, Melissa will accelerate into the Atlantic Ocean, potentially impacting Bermuda by Thursday and Friday.\n\nDeaths, injuries reported in the islands as Hurricane Melissa approaches\n\nAt least three people died in Jamaica as they were preparing for Hurricane Melissa, Christopher Tufton, the country’s minister of health and wellness, said on Monday.\n\nThe deaths, which occurred in the parishes of Hanover, Saint Catherine and Saint Elizabeth, happened while trees were being cut down, Tufton said. Two people died after trees fell on them, including one health worker who was airlifted to a hospital and later died of his injuries. The third case involved a person who was also electrocuted, the health minister said.\n\nAnother 13 people were injured, according to Tufton, most after falling from ladders or roofs while trying to prepare for the storm.\n\nAt least four deaths also had been reported in Haiti and the Dominican Republic by late Monday, according to Reuters.\n\nWhat's keeping Hurricane Melissa away from the United States?\n\nA series of weather systems has contributed to heavy rain and dangerous surf across parts of the Southeast, especially in Florida, but the well-timed systems are also part of a weather pattern that's forecast to help spare the mainland U.S. from any direct impacts from powerful Hurricane Melissa.\n\nOn Sunday, \"multiple feet\" of water were reported in the lobby of a Boca Raton resort after heavy rains, according to the National Weather Service in Miami, Florida. In Central Florida, more than 19 inches of rain were reported within 24 hours in Eustis, in Lake County, while more than 16 inches of rain were reported in multiple locations elsewhere in the county, according to the weather service office in Melbourne, Florida.

It's the third Category 5 hurricane of the Atlantic season.\n\nBarometric pressure is a measure of the air pressure in Earth's atmosphere. Low pressure is often associated with bad weather, while high pressure is typically linked to good weather.\n\nThe lower the pressure, the more powerful the hurricane, Klotzbach, the senior hurricane researcher at Colorado State University, said in a post on X.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, its pressure plummeted to 892 millibars in a 10 a.m. update on Tuesday, putting it third on Klotzbach's list of hurricanes with the lowest recorded pressures:\n\nWilma (2005): 882\n\nGilbert (1988): 888\n\nMelissa (2025): 892\n\nMilton (2024): 895\n\nRita (2005): 895\n\nAllen (1980): 899\n\nKatrina (2005): 902\n\nOnly five other hurricanes with winds of 111 mph or higher have made landfall in Jamaica, according to historical records, said Phil Klotzbach, a senior hurricane research scientist at Colorado State University. Hurricane Gilbert, which made landfall with maximum winds of 130 mph in 1988, is the strongest storm on record to make a direct landfall on the island.\n\nTurbulence in the eye of the powerful hurricane forced one reconnaissance flight with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to depart the eye of the storm early on Monday, according to the hurricane center.\n\nHurricane Melissa promises feet of rain in Jamaica. How it measures up\n\nA forecast for several feet of rain is rare, but not unheard of during fall storms in Jamaica.\n\n2010 – Hurricane Nicole matched that, but in less time, dropping 37.42 inches of rain at Belleisle, Jamaica, over five days, the hurricane center reported. Most of the island received 1 to 2 feet of rain during the same period. More than 13 people died, and damage to the country's infrastructure was reported at roughly $235 million.\n\n2001 – During the last few days of October and the first few days of November in 2001, slow-moving Hurricane Michelle helped cause widespread heavy rains over Central America and Jamaica, according to the hurricane center. Rainfall totals over 10 days were as high as 37.44 inches at Comfort Castle, Jamaica. Two deaths were reported in Jamaica, and five deaths were reported in Cuba.\n\n1963 – Hurricane Flora reportedly dropped 60 inches of rain in Silver Hill, Jamaica, and 100.39 inches in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, according to a historical report by David Roth, a NOAA meteorologist.\n\n1909 – Historical records, including a monthly review by the U.S. Weather Bureau, show a record of 135 inches of rain at Silver Hill over eight days from Nov. 4 to Nov. 11.\n\nContributing: Swapna Venugopal, USA TODAY, and Reuters\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver, a national correspondent for USA TODAY, has written about hurricanes, tornadoes and violent weather for more than 30 years.

For the latest on Hurricane Melissa, visit USA TODAY's coverage for Thursday, Oct. 30.\n\nHurricane Melissa weakened on Wednesday as it barreled through the Bahamas after devastating Cuba, Jamaica and Haiti, leaving dozens of people dead and destroying infrastructure across the region.\n\nBy 11 p.m. ET Wednesday, Melissa restrengthened into a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph after weakening into a Category 1 earlier in the day. The center of the hurricane was moving away from the Bahamas as it traveled north-northeast near 21 mph, the National Hurricane Center said in its 11 p.m. ET advisory.\n\nIn what the Bahamas called one of its largest evacuation operations, authorities had completed the air evacuation of nearly 1,500 people ahead of the storm. Forecasters had warned that the storm would bring damaging winds, flooding, and storm surge to the Bahamas.\n\nIn southern Haiti, torrential rain from Melissa caused a river to burst its banks, killing at least 25 people, Haitian authorities said. Most of the deaths were reported in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goâve, where at least 10 children were killed and 12 people remain missing, Haiti's disaster management agency said.\n\nIn Jamaica, authorities reported four hurricane-related deaths. Earlier in the day, authorities had said it was too early to confirm a death toll for the island nation.\n\nThe extent of the devastation from the hurricane remained unclear on Wednesday due to widespread power and communication outages. Numerous communities across the region were also isolated following the storm's passage.\n\nOver 30 deaths reported in Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic\n\nThough Melissa did not directly hit Haiti, the Caribbean's most populous nation, the storm slammed the island country with days of rain. Authorities reported at least 25 deaths, largely due to floods in Petit-Goâve, a coastal town about 40 miles west of the capital, where a river burst its banks.\n\nJean Bertrand Subrème, the mayor of Petit-Goâve, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that dozens of homes collapsed in the deluge. People were still trapped under rubble in the area, overwhelming local authorities.\n\nIn Jamaica, authorities said flood waters had washed up four bodies in the southwestern agricultural hub of St. Elizabeth.\n\n\"I am saddened to announce that four persons - three men and one woman - have been confirmed dead by the police in St. Elizabeth. They were discovered after being washed up by the flood waters generated by the hurricane,\" Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica's Minister for Local Government and Community Development, said in a news release.\n\nBefore landfall, authorities reported that the storm had already caused three deaths in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nFlooded homes, isolated communities\n\nThe deadly hurricane flooded homes, blew off rooftops, and toppled trees and utility poles across the region.\n\nIn Haiti, authorities said more than 1,000 homes were flooded. People living in makeshift camps said the flooding made it impossible to sit or sleep, and said the government and aid groups were slow to bring supplies, according to Reuters.\n\nAbout 77% of Jamaica was without electricity, authorities said Wednesday morning. Prime Minister Andrew Holness visited Black River Hospital, the only public hospital in St. Elizabeth, where aerial footage showed destroyed buildings and fields strewn with rubble.\n\nNo deaths were reported in Cuba on Wednesday, but at least 241 communities remained isolated and without communications after the storm swept across Santiago province. Hundreds of thousands of people were still in emergency centers and President Miguel Diaz-Canel said the island had suffered extensive damage.\n\nHundreds of residents evacuated from southern Bahamas ahead of Melissa\n\nMelissa weakened into a Category 1 hurricane with its maximum sustained winds dropping from 100 to 90 mph, the National Hurricane Center said in its 5 p.m. ET advisory. But life-threatening storm surge and heavy rainfall are expected in parts of the southeastern and central Bahamas through the evening.\n\nThe hurricane center advised people to “remain sheltered until local officials deem it safe to venture out.” On Tuesday night, authorities in the Bahamas urged residents to stay safe amid emergency preparations for the storm.\n\n“This is your final opportunity to ensure your safety. If you have not already found secure shelter, please do so immediately,” Leon Lundy, the Bahamas’ disaster risk management minister, said at a press briefing. “If you have not already found secure shelter, please do so immediately. Now is the time to stay indoors and to stay in place.”\n\nAuthorities noted that while most evacuees were staying with family and friends, the government has activated shelters that will remain on standby for any incoming evacuees. The Bahamas Airport Authority also closed all airports except for those needed for final evacuation flights.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Lundy reported that evacuation operations were completed, and preliminary figures indicated that 1,485 residents were evacuated. “This was one of the largest and most complex pre-landfall evacuation efforts in recent national history,” Lundy said.\n\nBahamas and Bermuda are Melissa's next targets\n\nFor those still awaiting Melissa’s arrival, it’s forecast to:\n\nSweep through the central and southeastern Bahamas with hurricane-force winds overnight.\n\nBring a 4- to 7-foot storm surge and 5 to 10 inches of rain to the southeastern Bahamas.\n\nPass west of Bermuda, but still bring heavy rain, swells and rip currents beginning Thursday.\n\nThe east end of Newfoundland is also in Melissa’s probable path and could feel impacts on Friday night as it transitions from a hurricane to a tropical storm.\n\nJamaican airports to reopen as officials assess damage\n\nA contingent of Jamaican officials was in St. Elizabeth parish on Wednesday afternoon, including Prime Minister Andrew Holness and Floyd Green, the minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Mining.\n\n“Images of destruction are all around,” Holness said in an X post. “The damage is great, but we are going to devote all our energy to mount a strong recovery.”\n\nGreen posted on X that nearly 90% of the homes in southwest St. Elizabeth are affected, “with many communities cut off from roads, light, and data.”\n\nOfficials also announced that three airports are reopening. The Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston was scheduled to open to relief flights at 4 p.m. on Wednesday and to commercial flights at 7 a.m. on Thursday, according to Daryl Vaz, minister for Energy, Science, Telecommunications, and Transport.\n\nSangster International Airport in Montego Bay, just west of where the center of Melissa traversed the island, will open only for relief flights starting at 10 a.m. on Thursday, authorities said. Ian Fleming International Airport in Boscobel, St. Mary Parish, Jamaica, will also be open to commercial flights at 7 a.m. on Thursday.\n\n– Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\n2025 is another above-normal Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThanks to the ferocity of Hurricane Melissa, the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season is now considered to be above-normal, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.\n\nHe shared on X that the season has now generated 127 ACE (Accumulated Cyclone Energy), making it an above-normal season per NOAA's definition. ACE is a measurement that reflects the intensity and duration of all tropical storms and hurricanes in a given season.\n\nNine of the last 10 Atlantic hurricane seasons have been classified as either above-normal or extremely active, according to Klotzbach.\n\nUS sends assistance to storm-ravaged Caribbean\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States has sent rescue and response teams to parts of the Caribbean devastated by Hurricane Melissa.\n\n“The United States is in close contact with the governments of Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic and The Bahamas as they confront the devastating impacts of Hurricane Melissa,” he said in a post on X Oct. 29. “We have rescue and response teams heading to affected areas along with critical lifesaving supplies.”\n\nRubio did not describe the size of the rescue teams or say where they would be stationed.\n\n“Our prayers are with the people of the Caribbean,” he added.\n\nMelissa’s fierce winds sent people running for a place to hide\n\nJack Edma, 37, said Hurricane Melissa was a storm like no other he’s ever experienced.\n\nAt a home in eastern Jamaica, which avoided the worst of Melissa’s impacts, Edma felt the building's concrete walls vibrate as the storm barreled across the island.\n\n“It was scary,” he told USA TODAY on Wednesday. “It was so strong I moved away from any windows and hid.”\n\nThe power went out, and as Edma went around St. Catherine Parish the next day, he saw roads covered in downed trees and overtaken by floodwater. One home had partially collapsed and fell over a cliff, he said.\n\nEdma, of Lynchburg, Virginia, said he was in the country on business when his flight was canceled over the weekend. While he awaits his return to the United States, he said he plans to assist in the clean-up effort, handing out food and clearing roads.\n\nMelissa hit as a Category 5 hurricane\n\nMelissa reached Jamaica as an extremely dangerous Category 5 hurricane, the highest level on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, bringing damaging winds, catastrophic flash flooding and landslides across Jamaica on Tuesday. The storm caused widespread infrastructure damage, including power and communication outages that left hundreds of thousands of residents in the dark.\n\nThe winds, which topped 185 mph on the island, were \"like a roaring lion,\" retiree Colin Henry McDonald told Reuters as the storm approached. \"It's mad. Really mad.\"\n\nParishes across Jamaica reported heavy floodwaters, blocked roads and fallen trees and utility poles, according to Desmond McKenzie, the island's minister of local government and community development. The parish of St. Elizabeth was submerged by flooding, and its only public hospital lost power and reported severe damage to one of its buildings.\n\nThe International Federation of the Red Cross previously said up to 1.5 million people in Jamaica were expected to be directly affected by the storm. About 15,000 people were in temporary shelters by late Tuesday, according to McKenzie. The government had issued mandatory evacuation orders for around 28,000 people.\n\nPope offers prayers to those affected by Hurricane Melissa\n\nPope Leo XIV took to social media on Wednesday and called for prayers for those impacted by Hurricane Melissa throughout the Caribbean.\n\n“Thousands of people have been displaced, and there is severe damage to homes and infrastructure,” he said on X. “Let us #PrayTogether for those who have lost their lives, for those who are fleeing and for those who are experiencing a period of anxiety and concern.”\n\nThe head of the Catholic Church also thanked civil authorities, voluntary organizations, and Christian communities for their relief efforts.\n\n2025 storms: Elon Musk makes Starlink satellite internet free in regions hit by Hurricane Melissa\n\nHurricane Melissa makes landfall in Cuba\n\nMelissa restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane as it approached Cuba and made landfall as a Category 3 storm, the hurricane center said.\n\nA hurricane warning remained in effect Wednesday morning for the Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, Holguin, and Las Tunas, as well as the southeastern and central Bahamas.\n\nMore than 735,000 people were evacuated in Cuba by Tuesday night, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a social media post. In the Bahamas, next in Melissa's path to the northeast, the government ordered evacuations of residents in southern portions of that archipelago.\n\n\"There will be a lot of work to do. We know that this cyclone will cause significant damage,\" Diaz-Canel said in a message published in the state newspaper Granma.\n\nJamaican authorities assess 'devastating' impacts from Hurricane Melissa\n\nOfficials said while they were still working to assess the damage across Jamaica on Oct. 29, it’s clear that Hurricane Melissa ravaged much of the western part of the country.\n\n“It looks really, really difficult in many parts of Jamaica,” said Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica’s information minister, at a news conference. “The images we’re getting are really devastating.”\n\nShe said the storm’s historic arrival was “extremely difficult for a lot of people” and that authorities were working to restore communication services so families could connect with their loved ones.\n\n“We are a strong people, we are resilient people, and we will get through it together,” she said.\n\n'Everything was flying': American recounts sheltering from Hurricane Melissa\n\nAs Hurricane Melissa barreled across Jamaica, Janaya Herring and her family huddled in the living room of their Airbnb in a mountainous part of St. Ann Parish.\n\nThe storm’s fierce winds hurled outdoor furniture hundreds of feet away as rain came in under the doors and through cracks in the windows. The home’s power and water service was knocked out. And a tree in the backyard fell within inches of the house.\n\n“It sounded like it was going to tear the roof off,” Herring told USA TODAY, describing the storm’s winds. “Everything was flying.”\n\nHerring, 45, from Montgomery, Alabama, was in Jamaica for her brother’s wedding last weekend and, along with several of her relatives, was stranded on the island when her flight was canceled. She plans to return home on Friday.\n\n“This was my first time out of the states,” said Herring, a hairstylist. “I was scared before, and now I don’t think I’ll ever be leaving again.”\n\nTravelers stranded in Jamaica after Hurricane Melissa hits\n\nHoneymooners Tiera Coleman and Laquon Triplett have already had two return flights home to Milwaukee canceled because of Hurricane Melissa.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the couple said they are waiting out in their room at a resort about 40 minutes from Montego Bay. The resort was being powered by generators, with limited food available to guests. The newlyweds are working out how to get back home to Milwaukee, with Coleman telling USA TODAY their best hope is the end of the week if the roads are clear.\n\n\"There have been loud bangs on the ceiling, and our doors are shaking,\" Coleman said. \"Most of the palm trees are down, and some parts of the resort property are damaged.\"\n\nTheir experience is similar to the many other travelers stranded in the beloved Caribbean destination, seeking shelter and safety as their return home remains in flux.

There have so far been no reported deaths or serious injuries across the islands, Williams added.\n\nFiona, a Category 3 storm with sustained winds of 125 mph, was continuing to hammer parts of the islands around 8 p.m. ET Tuesday and was strengthening, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm was centered about 75 miles north of North Caicos Island on Tuesday night, the hurricane center said.\n\nForecasters have warned of possible “life-threatening flooding” as the storm’s heavy rains continue pouring over parts of the British territory of about 38,000 people, the center said.\n\nThe islands of Grand Turk, South Caicos, Salt Cay, North Caicos and Middle Caicos were experiencing island-wide power outages Tuesday night, Williams said, adding restoration efforts will begin as soon as it’s safe.\n\nThe storm will slowly move away from the islands Tuesday night and Wednesday and begin approaching Bermuda Thursday, where it’s expected to dump up to 3 inches of rain and create “life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,” the center said.

Aurielys Esther Jimenez, 18, was traveling by motorcycle when she was struck by a power pole that fell due to strong winds, the director said. She was taken to a hospital where she was later pronounced dead.\n\nOfficials there on Monday also confirmed the death of a man in Nagua, in northeastern Dominican Republic, who died after powerful winds knocked down a tree that hit him. There was also one death reported in the French territory of Guadeloupe, which Fiona hit late last week, and two in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, 58-year-old Gilberto Ayala Aponte was swept away by a swollen river behind his home in Comerío. A second man, 70-year-old José Cruz Román, died in a fire accident that occurred when he was trying to put gasoline in his generator while it was turned on, officials said.\n\nParts of Puerto Rico will have seen rain totals of more than 30 inches, as Fiona pushed rivers to overflow and high water to collect in parts of the territory, flooding homes, streets and fields. Rushing waters wiped away a bridge, carrying its structure downstream, one video shows. Mudslides blocked some roads leading from coastal areas to the interior, a CNN crew saw.\n\nThe damage is catastrophic in the territory’s center, south and southeast regions, Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said Tuesday.\n\nMore than 1.16 million of the island’s roughly 1.47 million utility customers still were without power as of Tuesday night, according to estimates from PowerOutage.us, which notes updated information on restoration efforts is limited.\n\nMore than 2,000 people were working to restore power, Mario Hurtado, the chief regulatory officer for utility company LUMA Energy, told CNN’s Jake Tapper Tuesday. LUMA operates Puerto Rico’s power grid.\n\nOn the same day, New York’s attorney general called on federal authorities to investigate the energy provider, saying residents continued to experience frequent outages and high electrical rates five years after Hurricanes Irma and Maria and “after billions of federal dollars were spent to modernize and strengthen the island’s electrical grid.”\n\nFiona forecast to continue strengthening\n\nFiona intensified into a Category 3 storm as it moved away from the Dominican Republic’s northern coast early Tuesday.\n\nThis is the first major hurricane – Category 3 or higher – of this year’s Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nThe Turks and Caicos islands could see a total of 5 to 10 inches of rain from Fiona as well as storm surges – ocean water pushed onto land – of up to 3 feet above normal tide levels, the hurricane center said Tuesday night.\n\nHurricane conditions continued in Turks and Caicos Tuesday night and tropical storm conditions – winds of at least 39 mph – were expected over parts of the southeastern Bahamas for the next several hours, the hurricane center said.\n\nContinued strengthening is expected as Fiona turns from the Turks and Caicos. It could be a Category 4 storm – with sustained winds of 130 to 156 mph – by late Wednesday over the Atlantic. It could still be at Category 4 when it passes Bermuda, forecasters say.\n\nOver the weekend, Fiona might make landfall in eastern Canada as a hurricane. It is too early to know exactly where or how strong it might be.\n\nFiona leaves behind devastated Puerto Rico\n\nTuesday marks five years since Hurricane Maria’s catastrophic landfall in Puerto Rico and some who lived through the 2017 crisis say Fiona’s flooding destruction could be even more severe.\n\nJuan Miguel Gonzalez, a business owner in Puerto Rico, told CNN that his neighborhood had still not finished its recovery from Maria when Fiona struck. But this time, he says, the flooding brought even more damage to their homes.\n\n“A lot of people – more than (during) Maria – lost their houses now … lost everything in their houses because of the flooding,” Gonzalez told CNN on Monday. “Maria was tough winds. But this one, with all the rain, it just destroyed everything in the house.”\n\nJetsabel Osorio stands in her house damaged five years ago by Hurricane Maria before the arrival of Fiona in Loiza, Puerto Rico. Alejandro Granadillo/AP\n\nWater service also was interrupted for most, because river flooding affected filtration processes and must recede before safe treatment can resume, officials said. On Tuesday morning, about 60% of customers on the island had no running water, the territory’s aqueduct and sewer authority said.\n\nMore than 1,200 people were staying in about 70 shelters on the island Tuesday, Pierluisi said.\n\nNational Guard troops direct traffic as resident Luis Noguera helps clear a road affected by Hurricane Fiona in Cayey, Puerto Rico, on Tuesday.

Kathy Hochul also announced the state would send 100 state troopers to assist relief efforts in Puerto Rico. She also said teams from New York Power Authority are available to help with power restoration.\n\nMore than 1 million customers without water service in Dominican Republic\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, where up to 20 inches of rain fell in places, emergency workers brought nearly 800 people to safety, Méndez García said Monday. At least 519 people were taking refuge in the country’s 29 shelters Monday, he said.\n\nMore than 2,100 households were affected by the storm and more than 600 homes destroyed, Méndez García said in a Tuesday update. And at least 23 roads and 18 bridges sustained damage, leaving 12 communities cut off.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, more than 1.85 million customers were without running water as a result of the storm’s damage, he said, adding that 68 aqueducts were out of service across the Dominican Republic, with a handful of others only partially working.\n\nSome in the Dominican Republic were also without electricity Monday as 10 electric circuits went offline, emergency management officials said. It’s unclear how many people are impacted by the outages.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated with the correct age of the second victim in Puerto Rico, after updated information from officials.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe Christina Maxouris Jason Hanna Melissa Alonso", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Christina Maxouris", "Jason Hanna", "Melissa Alonso"], "publish_date": "2022/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/30/weather/record-heat-west-labor-day-forecast-tropics", "title": "A prolonged and record heat wave builds over the West this week ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSome of the hottest temperatures of the year are on the way for the West Coast and possibly staying dangerously hot through Labor Day as a mega heat wave builds in for the long term.\n\nMore than 55 million people are currently under heat alerts from Southern California through the San Joaquin Valley and into portions of the Northwest, including 20 of the most populated cities up and down the West Coast.\n\n“Temperatures could exceed 110F in parts of the Southwest, where an excessive heat warning is currently in effect,” the Weather Prediction Center wrote.\n\nThe most dire areas will be in the Southwest, where the heat will be the most intense.\n\nCNN Weather\n\n“Some records may be broken but record max temps are very high at this time of the year,” said the NWS office in Los Angeles. “Record breaking or not, this prolonged heat wave is going to be very dangerous.”\n\nMore than 100 records could fall in the West.\n\nSign up for weekly forecasts from CNN meteorologists\n\nProlonged heat wave for the Southwest\n\nThe kind of heat that will be felt from San Diego to Los Angeles to even Phoenix will be difficult to endure even for the locals.\n\n“This heat may be record breaking and will produce a very high risk of heat illness,” said the NWS office in Los Angeles. “Triple digit heat is expected for many valley and mountain locations. Even hotter conditions are expected over the Labor Day weekend into early next week.”\n\nThe heat will begin Tuesday, with a gradual warm-up each day through the week, and it will peak by the end of the week.\n\nThe reason for the extreme conditions is a stubborn area of high pressure sitting over the region, creating what meteorologists call a “heat dome.”\n\nThis intense heat dome causes high pressure to act as a lid on the atmosphere. As hot air attempts to escape, the lid forces it back down, warming even more as it sinks.\n\nThe result will be intense summer heat, running 10-15 degrees above normal.\n\nCNN Weather\n\n“Excessive Heat warnings are in effect for almost the entire forecast area starting Wednesday and continuing all the way through next Monday,” noted the NWS office in Los Angeles.\n\nThe forecast shows temperatures of 110-115 degrees in the deserts and San Fernando Valley, with temperatures running 90-100 along the coast.

How close the storm gets to the US will determine just how strong the winds and rip currents will be. Closer to the coast they will be stronger, farther from the coast they will be weaker.\n\nThe NHC is no longer tracking the area in the western Caribbean for development. However, that region is still producing clouds and rain that will pump tropical moisture into the Texas coast. That will increase the rain chances in South Texas through the Labor Day weekend.\n\nHow to prepare for hurricane season\n\nAnother area to watch is a tropical wave just off the coast of Africa. This area could also become a tropical depression during the next few days though its life span could be short-lived.\n\n“By late this week, the disturbance is forecast to move over cooler waters and further development is not expected,” said the NHC.", "authors": ["Jennifer Gray"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/25/weather/tropical-storm-ian-florida-hurricane-sunday", "title": "Florida officials urge residents to prepare for Tropical Storm Ian ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFloridians are bracing for Tropical Storm Ian, which is expected to rapidly intensify and become a hurricane on Monday before hitting western Cuba, bringing with it the threats of strong winds and storm surge as high as 9 to 14 feet, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nIan’s exact path beyond Tuesday remains unclear: The storm, which developed Friday in the central Caribbean Sea, is expected to reach the US later this week, but with models showing a wide spread of possible scenarios, it’s too early to know where the storm will hit, when – and how strong it will be.\n\nThe storm began strengthening Sunday night, with sustained winds of winds of 60 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. “Additional strengthening is forecast tonight, followed by more rapid strengthening on Monday and Tuesday,” the center said.\n\nThe first US tropical storm watches associated with Ian were issued Sunday and are in effect for the lower Florida Keys from Seven Mile Bridge to Key West and including the Dry Tortugas, the hurricane center said.\n\nThe storm is forecast to become a hurricane on Monday and then a major hurricane on Tuesday, meaning Category 3 or higher, the center said.\n\nMeteorologists predict the storm will peak at Category 4 strength over the eastern Gulf of Mexico in three days, but Ian is then expected to weaken before reaching Florida.\n\nStill, Florida officials are urging residents to be prepared for the worst, and the hurricane center warned Sunday morning of a “risk of dangerous storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall along the west coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle” by the middle of the week, regardless of the storm’s exact track and strength.\n\n“We’re going to keep monitoring the track of this storm, but it’s really important to stress the degree of uncertainty that still exists,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a news conference Sunday, warning residents that even if the storm weakens before landfall, it would “still have significant impacts.”\n\nCNN Weather\n\nFloridians can expect “heavy rains, strong winds, flash flooding, storm surge and even isolated tornadoes,” the governor said. But the director of Florida’s Division of Emergency Management was particularly focused on the storm surge threat, cautioning that whatever surge develops while Ian is a major hurricane could persist as it nears land, even if the storm weakens.\n\n“We could see a situation where we have Cat 4 storm surge and potentially a Cat 1 or 2 hurricane landfall,” Director Kevin Guthrie said.\n\nAnne Bink, associate administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Office of Response and Recovery, kept the message simple: “Prepare now.”\n\nFlorida residents should know their evacuation routes and have preparedness kits that can last them at least three days, Bink told CNN. “Things like food, water, battery chargers for your phone. Even things like your insurance documents – take pictures of them so you have them with you,” Bink said.\n\n“We expect rapid intensification with this storm,” Bink said. “My message is: Please take this seriously, and please listen to your local officials.”\n\nIn the meantime, Ian is expected to be a major hurricane by the time it passes near or over western Cuba, the hurricane center said Sunday morning, and forecasters are becoming more confident residents there will face life-threatening storm surge and hurricane force winds.\n\nAs of Sunday night, Ian was about 160 miles south of Grand Cayman and about 430 miles southeast of western Cuba.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for Grand Cayman and several Cuban provinces, including Isla de Juventud, Pinar del Rio and Artemisa, while a tropical storm warning has been issued for the provinces of La Habana, Mayabeque and Matanzas.\n\nThe Cayman Islands government has issued tropical storm watches for Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, according to the hurricane center.\n\nTropical storm conditions are possible across Cuba on Monday afternoon, and hurricane conditions will likely follow late Monday into Tuesday, the hurricane center said. Ian is forecast to bring 6 to 10 inches of rain with isolated totals up to 16 inches possible in western Cuba. That could contribute to flash flooding or even mudslides in areas of high terrain. And storm surge is forecast along the coast of western Cuba from Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the hurricane center, Ian will keep its major hurricane status as it moves north through the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nFlorida readies for potential hurricane, flooding and winds\n\nAuthorities in Florida are distributing sandbags and asking Floridians to prepare their property to reduce the risk of storm damage and to stock up on supplies like radios, water, canned food and medication. Residents should also pack up important documents and know their evacuation routes.\n\n“This is the calm before the storm,” Naples Mayor Teresa Heitmann told CNN on Saturday. “We experience this kind of adrenaline before a storm and the path could change at any time, but we want our citizens to be ready.”\n\nDeSantis echoed that Sunday, telling reporters at his news conference, “It’s better to be prepared and not have to use those preparations.”\n\nTo that end, DeSantis on Saturday expanded an emergency order to include every county in the state, saying conditions are “projected to constitute a major disaster.” President Joe Biden declared an emergency for Florida and ordered federal assistance to supplement response efforts. On Sunday, DeSantis announced 2,500 National Guardsmen had been activated ahead of the storm.\n\nSt. Petersburg, southwest of Tampa, is in a vulnerable position as a “peninsula within a peninsula within a peninsula,” Mayor Kenneth Welch told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday.\n\nDespite the storm’s unpredictable course, Welch said he’s encouraging residents to prepare emergency provisions for at least a week.\n\n“As we’re watching the storm, certainly praying it continues to move west, we at the same time are asking folks to prepare, make sure they have a plan, know their evacuation zone, take care of those things like food and water for seven days,” Welch said.\n\nAny evacuation orders will be given at least 72 hours in advance, the mayor said.\n\nIn Daytona Beach, Bethune-Cookman University issued a mandatory evacuation order and canceled classes Monday with plans to resume online Tuesday. Concerns over Ian’s arrival have also delayed the Artemis I rocket’s third launch attempt planned for Tuesday. And in Cape Coral, Mayor John Gunter said the city’s emergency operation center was operating at an “enhanced level.”\n\n“Right now, of course, we are like many other cities,” Gunter said. “We’re preparing for the worst.

This is the primary reason Miami-Dade County residents are asked to evacuate before a hurricane, according to county officials.\n\n“We’re outside of the cone of uncertainty. We can’t relax,” Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told CNN on Saturday. “We know there’s always a possibility it will shift. The storm has continued to move westward. This is the time everyone should make sure they have a plan.”\n\nLevine Cava urged residents to ensure they have enough food and water and check their storm surge planning zone.\n\n“We’re very hopeful that even with a major rain event, we’ll be able to manage it,” she said. “We’re on standby. We have extra pumps, and we’ve worked with the South Florida Water Management District to lower canal levels.”\n\nMiami-Dade County is preparing its “extensive shelter system,” including for those fleeing the Florida Keys if evacuations are ordered there.\n\nHeitmann is already seeing lines at the gas stations in Naples as residents brace for the potential hurricane, she said.\n\n“They’re taking it serious, and I encourage those that are not to always take a storm serious, because you can never estimate where that storm might turn. And we need to be prepared and if it’s not coming directly for us, it might have strong winds,” Heitmann said.\n\nIn Sarasota, authorities are checking on generators, planning with local police, trying to estimate how much flooding is possible and warning residents to be prepared, Mayor Erik Arroyo told CNN.\n\n“Don’t underestimate the dangers that come with gusts, with storm surges, with flooding, especially us being a coastal city. So we’re telling them to go now, be prepared early,” Arroyo said.\n\nIn neighboring Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp ordered the State Operations Center to prepare for any potential impact from the storm.\n\n“Though models suggest it will weaken before making landfall on Thursday, and its ultimate route is still undetermined, Ian could result in severe weather damage for large parts of Georgia,” a Sunday news release from the governor’s office said.\n\n“I urge my fellow Georgians to monitor this storm as it evolves and calmly take the necessary precautions to keep their families and neighbors safe, if the storm continues to intensify,” Kemp said.", "authors": ["Haley Brink Dakin Andone Nouran Salahieh", "Haley Brink", "Dakin Andone", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}]}

USDA issues message on food ...", "text": "The 42 million Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will go without their benefits come Nov. 1 because of the government shutdown, according to a new message from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nSNAP, also known as food stamps, is a federal program that provides low-income families monthly benefits to afford healthy food.\n\nIn recent weeks, the USDA – which oversees the program – warned that SNAP money for November could be in jeopardy if the shutdown continues. But in a prominent new message on its website as of Oct. 27, the USDA said no benefits will be issued on Nov. 1.\n\nParts of the government effectively stopped operating Oct. 1 after lawmakers in Congress failed to agree on funding allocations for the 2026 fiscal year.\n\nHealth care policy remains a key sticking point in the shutdown for Democrats, who are pushing to reverse Republican cuts to the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. Republicans have argued that heath care can be debated after the shutdown is over.\n\nWill SNAP benefits go out in November?\n\nThe USDA confirmed in a new message on its website that no SNAP benefits will be issued come Nov. 1.\n\n\"Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 1,\" the message reads, in part.\n\nEchoing similar comments from Republicans and officials from President Donald Trump's administration, the message pointed blame at Democratic lawmakers for the shutdown. The USDA is led by Trump appointee Brooke Rollins.\n\n\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,\" the message said. \"They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.\"\n\nSNAP money is allocated monthly, so October benefits went out as usual despite the government shutdown.\n\nUSDA says it can't tap into contingency funds for SNAP\n\nThe USDA's shutdown contingency plan said the agency has a reserve of contingency funds, which can be used to pay benefits directly. The plan, which was issued in September, has since been removed from the USDA's website.\n\nIn a letter shared with USA TODAY, however, the USDA said the contingency money is available only \"to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits.\"\n\n\"The contingency fund is not available to support FY 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists,\" the letter said.\n\nThe letter also said states can't pay for SNAP payments and be reimbursed, even if they are willing to do so.\n\n\"The best way for SNAP to continue is for the shutdown to end,\" the letter said.\n\nUSDA warned about funding lapse earlier in October\n\nThough the USDA's new statement provides a definitive answer on November SNAP benefits, the agency had been warning about the lapse in funding.\n\nIn a letter to state agencies dated Oct. 10, the agency said there would be \"insufficient funds to pay full November SNAP benefits\" if the shutdown continued.\n\nUsually, states send data about eligible households' SNAP benefits to its Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) vendor each month.\n\nBut in the letter, which was signed by SNAP development director Sasha Gersten-Paal, the USDA directed states to pause on sending that information \"until further notice.\"\n\nThen, in a statement to USA TODAY on Oct. 22, the USDA said \"an inflection point\" was approaching for SNAP and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC.\n\nWhat can SNAP recipients do for assistance in November?\n\nThose who typically rely on SNAP benefits can use food banks and other subsidized meal programs amid the funding lapse.

Therefore, SNAP recipients should check with their individual state agency to find other food assistance for November.\n\nAlso, while benefits are issued monthly through an EBT card, they do not expire for a full calendar year, so recipients who have leftover money on their EBT card can still use it in November, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services.\n\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

The state received word from the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture that, due to the federal government shutdown, there may be a delay in November Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits because there aren't enough funds to pay for it if the shutdown persists. SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, provides benefits to low-income families and is regarded as the largest anti-hunger program in the country.\n\n“SNAP is more than a food assistance program; it’s a lifeline for many Michigan families,\" Hertel said.\n\nIn Michigan, where nearly 13% of households receive SNAP benefits, news of the pause had families, from Detroit to Interlochen, preparing to go to food pantries and worried about what's to come. Food banks and pantries, meanwhile, have already seen an uptick in need but resources are stretched thin. And Detroit grocers say, with the Thanksgiving holiday approaching, the benefits pause will soon hit customers — or already has.\n\n\"This is not delay,\" said Phil Knight, executive director of the Food Bank Council of Michigan. \"This is loss.\"\n\nDOUBLE UP FOOD BUCKS: What's changing as SNAP benefits pause\n\nMichigan families already feeling the pressure\n\nIn anticipation of the SNAP pause next month, Detroiter Symone Wilkes is trying to come up with a game plan but she's on a time crunch.\n\n\"I really don't know how we're gonna survive in November. I've been calling around to food pantries, but they're full to capacity,\" said Wilkes, who works part-time as a community outreach specialist at an early childhood organization.\n\nThe pause is putting her in a tough spot as she tries to find other food pantries, but that means driving out there, which in turn means spending more money on gas. She worries about how she will feed her kids.\n\nWilkes, a single parent, was \"in a frenzy\" when she learned that her SNAP benefits — money she depends on — were at risk. SNAP dollars, the $540 she receives a month, allowed the mom of two young boys to purchase food until her next paycheck.\n\n\"We don't have a real family village, so it's just us. And that helped me feed them throughout the month along with the little money I have leftover once I pay bills,\" she said.\n\nWilkes said she tries to set aside at least $100 in SNAP benefits so she has money on the first of the month, but as November approaches, she has no benefits left. She's spent the remaining $60, trying to buy foods that will last.\n\nIn northern Michigan, Dana Tuller is starting her third job as a warehouse sorter. She's also a part-time job office administrator at her church and does advocacy work, representing parents and families.\n\nIn August, her husband — who was the primary earner in her family — had unexpected open-heart surgery and hasn't been able to work, putting the family in a \"big lurch.\" They never qualified for food assistance benefits because he made too much money. But, with the loss of his income and bills pouring in, the family applied for benefits at the end of September when her husband's paychecks officially dried up.\n\n\"It's always what do I pay and what don't I pay,\" said Tuller, now the primary breadwinner in her family.\n\nConsidering the time and effort it took to apply for assistance, Tuller is grappling with the news that SNAP is on hold — her family finally got the benefits this month after getting approved. The mom of four kids, ages 8 to 12, was able to go to the grocery store and buy what she needed. She didn't have to count empty pop cans to return to have enough to buy a gallon of milk. She didn't have to go to the pantries. In Interlochen, where she lives, it's a drive to go anywhere, she said. Now, she'll have to go back to the pantries.\n\n\"I don't have any other choice,\" she said.\n\nCRISIS AHEAD FOR MICHIGAN FAMILIES: Food assistance in Michigan: SNAP benefits to stop in November due to federal shutdown\n\nMary Short, of Kalamazoo, knows what it's like for SNAP benefits to stop suddenly. After years, her benefits were cut off in February after paychecks from December got wrapped up into January, putting her over the income qualifications, she said.\n\n\"I was scared and terrified and I wanted to cry because I know that feeling. It's very terrifying to feel like the rug is pulled out from underneath you,\" Short said.\n\nWith two teenagers, Short's grocery bill is about $1,100 a month. Short — who works full time as a project manager, cleans houses and is a bartender — was getting $600 a month in benefits and she had to figure out how to make up for that gap. Despite working 70 to 90 hours a week, she still has late bills and has visited food banks.\n\n\"My pantry is very empty and my kids feel very anxious about it when there isn't a lot of food in the fridge and that's when I start picking up extra work,\" Short, a single parent, said.\n\nOver in Hillsdale, Melissa Miles said that, as a full-time university student who doesn't have a job, SNAP is the \"root of our food source.\"\n\n\"It's for fresh fruits and vegetables, making sure there's always milk in the house. Without those essential items then we have to then rely on other family members to help provide for us,\" said Miles, a single mom of a 5-year-old.\n\nThe unknown is what worries Miles.\n\n\"When you don't know where your next meal is gonna come from, life gets really chaotic and scary all at once,\" she said. \"It also feels like, bureaucratically, our government doesn't care.\"\n\nShe doesn't have savings to supplement the loss of $463 in SNAP benefits. Come November, Miles said she'll have to visit the food pantry weekly. Her son is her priority, she said. If she has to go without a meal so he can eat, that's what she'll do. Miles has $300 remaining in benefits she's holding onto, to portion out, in the hopes that the government \"changes its mind.\"\n\n“We're a week away from November. Nobody had time to prepare,\" Miles said.\n\nFood banks, pantries brace for impact\n\nCharitable organizations and the federal food benefits program are part of the safety net working to catch vulnerable families struggling to make ends meet and living paycheck to paycheck. And so, the SNAP pause knocks down an important pillar of that system, adding pressure onto the state's already squeezed food banks and pantries, agency leaders told the Free Press.\n\n\"The mission for the food banks does not change, regardless of policy, politics or programming. We're there to try to help people bridge that gap between what they have and what they need. And we can supplement, but we cannot substitute for a federal program like SNAP, we cannot scale charity,\" Knight, of the food bank council, said.\n\nResources are already \"stretched thin\" for organizations like Forgotten Harvest, according to Chris Ivey, chief marketing and communications officer for the Oak Park-based food rescue nonprofit. Expenses have gone up in the past few years and it's essentially costing more to do the same business.\n\n\"As the number of guests we have to serve goes up, there is going to be the same amount of food, so we either have to give less food per distribution or we'll have to buy more food to keep that level even. ... We hope that this shutdown ends quickly,\" he said. If the pause continues, Forgotten Harvest will extensively fundraise.\n\nThe SNAP pause comes at a time of already increasing need and local organizations are preparing for a new influx.\n\nIn January 2022, the Detroit-based Capuchin Services Center, providing food and clothing, saw 1,170 families and the number has grown. In July of this year, the organization served 3,083 families.\n\nThat number is likely going to climb to upward of 5,000, according to Fred Cabras, director of social services for the Detroit-based Capuchin Soup Kitchen. Households rely on food pantries and food assistance as a supplement, so they can pay their utilities and rent, especially if they don't make enough income to cover the basics, he said.\n\nThe pause, he said, is going to be \"devastating\" for working families, who are already struggling with high food costs. It's also hitting families' budgets as they head into the holidays.\n\n\"Our busiest months often are November and December because of the holidays, so this is coming at a very inopportune time for families,\" Cabras said.\n\nIn Troy, Kristin Olmedo, CEO of the United Community Family Services, said calls to sign up for the food pantry had gone up \"exponentially\" even before the news of the pause was official. The day before, for instance, the organization received 15 calls to register for the pantry. That's how many calls the organization got for the whole month of June.\n\n\"We've been trying to keep up with the demand of new people wanting to register for our food pantry in preparation of this,\" Olmedo said.\n\nKristin Sokul, senior director of advancement communications for Gleaners Community Food Bank, said the organization plans to be responsive and buy more food, but the \"longer resources are unavailable, the greater the influx of need.\"\n\nFood banks are nimble and resourceful, but can't fill the gap alone, amid high food costs and heightened need.\n\n\"You can't just pull SNAP out of the economy and put food banks in and think everything's the same,\" Knight said.\n\nImpact of SNAP in Michigan\n\nSNAP benefits are a key tool to combat poverty and food insecurity, nutrition experts told the Free Press.\n\n\"SNAP is ... the most effective strategy we have to reduce poverty for children and families,\" said Kate Bauer, associate professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health.\n\nBauer, who led a research project surveying nearly 1,300 Michigan families facing food insecurity, said the pause will have a ripple effect on the community.\n\nMore than a third of SNAP households in Michigan have older adults while nearly half include children. According to MDHHS, 492,225 children benefit from the food assistance. In the 2024 fiscal year, the average Michigan household receiving SNAP benefits got about $335 a month, which breaks down to $173 per person a month, or $5.68 for each person a day.\n\n\"We have very strong evidence that SNAP addresses food insecurity and that it addresses food insecurity among some of our most vulnerable families, households with children. Risk of food insecurity is particularly high among households with children, among households with older adults, and among individuals and households managing one or more disabilities,\" said Jennifer Garner, a registered dietitian and food security researcher at the University of Michigan.\n\nGrocers ready to help\n\nOn the business front, more than 9,700 retailers accept SNAP, allowing them to redeem more than $3.6 billion in 2023 alone.\n\n\"SNAP is really an economic infusion for communities, because where do those SNAP dollars get spent? They get spent, mostly, at local retailers, local food stores, local grocers,\" Garner, the U-M researcher, said. Removing that \"stimulus\" will strain an already frayed system where healthy food is hard to come by, she said.\n\nElizabeth Aboona, owner of Americana Foods on Plymouth Road on Detroit’s west side, is prepared to help customers.\n\n“We have been anticipating this news and are currently doing contingency planning on how we can help our customers, from food giveaways to other means of assistance.” Aboona wrote in an email to the Free Press.\n\nWhile Aboona said they have not seen changes in consumer purchases, it likely will happen.\n\n“We know losing benefits will affect them in significant ways, in particular with Thanksgiving coming soon,” she wrote. “As a business owner, we may also see some customers seeking out Big Box options — retailers with significant buying power — outside the area. This could also be a day-to-day reality.”\n\nGreenfield Market on Puritan in Detroit has been serving the community for nearly 50 years. The market's front-end manager, Sheila Doss, said with the news of November SNAP benefits being halted “people are panicking and we are trying to reassure them that we are there for them.”\n\n“They already have been gravitating toward our discounted items and shopping wisely overall, especially focused on inexpensive staples such as bread and cheese,” she said in an email.\n\nDoss added that with the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, customers are buying items in advance.\n\n“We are praying for a resolution. Our customers depend on us and their benefits to feed their families and we depend on them for our livelihoods,” Doss said.\n\nHow to get help\n\nTo find area food pantries and other resources, go to www.fbcmich.org/food-bank-network; pantrynet.org; www.forgottenharvest.org/find-food, or call the Michigan 211 line.\n\nContact reporter Nushrat Rahman at nrahman@freepress.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/10/15/snap-benefits-government-shutdown/86708230007/", "title": "November SNAP benefits could be impacted if shutdown continues", "text": "Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to buy food may be affected as soon as November if the ongoing government shutdown continues.\n\nIn a letter to state agencies dated Oct. 10, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said there will not be enough funding to pay the entirety of November SNAP benefits if the shutdown continues.\n\n\"If the current lapse in appropriations continues, there will be insufficient funds to pay full November SNAP benefits for approximately 42 million individuals across the Nation,\" reads the letter, which was signed by SNAP development director Sasha Gersten-Paal and provided to USA TODAY by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS).\n\nSome government agencies effectively shut down beginning Oct. 1 after congressional leaders failed to agree on federal funding allocations for the 2026 fiscal year. Without an end in sight, the shutdown appears slated to continue further into October. The longest government shutdown lasted 35 days between December 2018 and January 2019.\n\nHere's what to know about SNAP benefits during the shutdown.\n\nStates brace for possible SNAP benefit shortage in November\n\nState health officials across the country, including in North Carolina, Wisconsin and Minnesota, have begun warning recipients of the possible lack of funds for November.\n\nNormally, states send data about eligible households' SNAP benefits to its Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) vendor each month. But the USDA is directing states to pause on sending that information \"until further notice,\" the agency's letter reads.\n\nThe USDA said its Food and Nutrition Service has begun gathering information for a potential contingency plan regarding SNAP benefit operations, should the shutdown continue.\n\nIn the meantime, state officials are still grappling with what an extended shutdown would mean for SNAP recipients in their state.\n\n\"We are working to get a better understanding of exactly what that disruption will mean for North Carolina,\" NCDHHS said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to USDA for more information.\n\nWhat happens to SNAP during a government shutdown?\n\nPrograms like SNAP rely on cooperation between states and the federal government, which, during a shutdown, may not have the personnel or funds to keep things moving.\n\nSNAP benefits are allocated the month prior, meaning October payments were not impacted. However, without regular funding available for November, it remains uncertain if all benefits will be paid.\n\nAccording to the USDA's government shutdown contingency plan, the department has multiyear contingency funds meant for administrative expenses and/or to pay participant benefits directly. It is unclear how much money is currently available in that reserve.\n\nIf the shutdown lasts beyond October, it could exhaust the USDA's contingency plan, and the Trump administration could decide whether to tap into the multiyear fund, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Food Research & Action Center.\n\nDuring the 2018-2019 shutdown, the USDA paid February benefits early, at the end of January, and Congress passed emergency funding to keep payments going out in March.\n\nWhat is SNAP?\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, sometimes known as \"food stamps,\" is a U.S. federal program designed to help low-income individuals and families afford nutritious food.\n\nIt provides monthly benefits via an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, which works like a debit card that can be used to buy groceries at authorized retailers, including supermarkets and convenience stores.\n\nIn 2024, SNAP was used by a monthly average of 41.7 million people, or about 12.3% of the U.S. population, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

We will continue to process applications and stand ready to issue benefits as quickly as possible once we receive authorization and funding from our federal partners.\"\n\nSNAP serves 1.4 million people in North Carolina, according to the state health department.\n\nAs of April 2025, more than 29,000 Buncombe County residents participated in the program, according to state data. In Henderson County, more than 9,000 people were enrolled.\n\nGov. Josh Stein pressed the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, to take “immediate action,” calling on the agency to use federal contingency funds to prevent a disruption in benefits.\n\nIn an Oct. 24 notice the USDA sent states, the agency blamed Congressional Democrats for the pause in benefits and said using contingency funds isn’t allowed under federal law. It also said states would not be reimbursed if they decided to cover SNAP benefits themselves.\n\n“The administration’s refusal to use these available funds as temperatures cool and the Thanksgiving holiday approaches is a cruel abdication of the responsibility to support families and communities,” Stein said in a statement. “Congress owes it to the American people to return to the negotiating table and come together to reopen the government, stop health care premiums from skyrocketing, and ensure stability for hardworking people across our state and country.\"\n\nIn its release, the state health department also said benefits under the Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, program, could also be disrupted. The program provides food, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and other services to approximately 262,000 people across the state.\n\nIn Buncombe County, more than 4,600 people participate in WIC, according to the state health department. In Henderson County, more than 2,100 people are enrolled.\n\nA pause in SNAP benefits, slated to go into effect Nov. 1, would arrive just four months after Republicans in Congress passed a sweeping tax bill that is expected to cut more than $250 billion from the program over the next 10 years.\n\nThe state health department said the bill, signed into law by President Donald Trump in July, could put North Carolina on the hook for $420 million in extra cost share. It could even force the state to withdraw from the program entirely, which would further strain food banks and nonprofits already facing a surge of need in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Helene, the Citizen Times previously reported.\n\nWhat to do if SNAP benefits are delayed\n\nIf benefits are delayed, the state health department suggests people who rely on SNAP for food assistance to:\n\nContinue to apply and renew: All residents should continue to apply for SNAP benefits and submit renewal paperwork on time, the department said. County DSS offices remain open and are processing all applications to prevent a backlog when funding is restored.\n\nCheck balances: Any benefits currently on EBT cards are still available to use, according to the state health department. Check your balance on the ebtEDGE app, at www.ebtEDGE.com, or by calling 888-622-7328.\n\nIf you, or your family, are in immediate need for food resources, dial 211 to be connected with local resources.

The message comes as the USDA warned that SNAP money for November could be in jeopardy if the shutdown continues.\n\n\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" USDA posted on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"\n\nSNAP, also known as food stamps, is a federal program that provides low-income families monthly benefits to afford healthy food. Forty-two million Americans rely on SNAP, according to USA Today.\n\nThe USDA did not clarify when benefits will be issued again, but did write that the pause was due to the government shutdown, which is a result of lawmakers in Congress failing to agree on funding allocations for the 2026 fiscal year.\n\nAttorneys general and governors from 25 Democrat-led states filed a lawsuit on Oct. 28 in an attempt to force the Trump administration to fund the nation’s largest food aid program benefits amid the federal government shutdown.\n\nUSA Today said the lawsuit argues suspending SNAP benefits is avoidable, arbitrary and is being carried out in violation of the Food and Nutrition Act, which requires that “assistance under this program shall be furnished to all eligible households.\"\n\nImpact on Fairfield County\n\nAs of now, about 7,500 SNAP clients in Fairfield County will not receive November benefits because of the ongoing shutdown.\n\n\"There are not funds available to issue the SNAP benefits for November,\" said Corey Clark, county job and family services director. \"We are letting customers know that at this time SNAP benefits will not be issued for November. Obviously, that's kind of an hour-by-hour situation because it's entirely dependent on the federal shutdown.\n\n\"Once that is resolved, SNAP benefits, I would predict, would be issued shortly thereafter. But they will not be until that federal shutdown is resolved or until they come up with some type of federal resolution.\"\n\nFairfield County gives out about $1.5 million each month in SNAP benefits.

Forty-two million Americans rely on SNAP, according to USA Today.\n\nThe USDA did not clarify when benefits will be issued again but did write that the pause was due to the government shutdown, which is a result of lawmakers in Congress failing to agree on funding allocations for the 2026 fiscal year.\n\nAttorneys general and governors from 25 Democrat-led states filed a lawsuit on Oct. 28 in an attempt to force the Trump administration to fund the nation's largest food aid program benefits amid the federal government shutdown.\n\nUSA Today said the lawsuit argues suspending SNAP benefits is avoidable, arbitrary and is being carried out in violation of the Food and Nutrition Act, which requires that “assistance under this program shall be furnished to all eligible households.\"\n\nLocal pantries and hot meal programs\n\nTom Cover, head of the Coburn United Methodist Church food pantry, is expecting an increase in people served once the SNAP benefits are paused.\n\n\"We are expecting more because there's going to be more affected in a serious way,\" he said. Though, they won't know the full extent until a few weeks into November, he added.\n\nCoburn typically serves around 80 households and 180 people per month.\n\n\"It's kind of like a storm.

Shutdown could impact food ...", "text": "Millions of Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) could be left scrambling for food come November if the government shutdown continues.\n\nSNAP, sometimes known as food stamps, is a federal program that provides low-income families monthly benefits to afford healthy food. Funds for the program are allocated monthly, so October benefits went out as usual despite the government shutdown.\n\nHowever, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees the SNAP program, said earlier this month that there will not be enough funding to pay all benefits for November if the shutdown continues.\n\nSome government agencies effectively shut down beginning Oct. 1 after congressional leaders failed to agree on federal funding allocations for the 2026 fiscal year. As of Oct. 22, the shutdown is the second longest ever.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nWill SNAP benefits go out in November?\n\nThere will not be enough funding to pay the entirety of SNAP benefits in November if the shutdown continues, the USDA said in a letter to state agencies dated Oct. 10.\n\n\"If the current lapse in appropriations continues, there will be insufficient funds to pay full November SNAP benefits for approximately 42 million individuals across the Nation,\" reads the letter, which was signed by SNAP development director Sasha Gersten-Paal.\n\nThe USDA, which is led by Trump-appointee Brooke Rollins, pointed blame at Democratic lawmakers for the shutdown, echoing familiar comments made by Republicans and other Trump administration officials throughout the month.\n\n\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for healthcare for illegals or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments,\" the USDA said in the Oct. 22 statement to USA TODAY.\n\nWhose fault is the government shutdown? Watch Americans in 8 key states lay the blame\n\nWhat can SNAP recipients do if benefits aren't issued in November?\n\nSNAP relies on cooperation between state agencies, which oversee benefits, and the federal government, which funds them.\n\nTherefore, SNAP recipients should check with their individual state agency to find other food assistance for November if needed.\n\nNormally, states send recipients their SNAP benefits through an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, which works like a debit card to pay for food at eligible stores.\n\nWhile these benefits are issued monthly, they do not expire for a full calendar year, so recipients who have leftover money on their EBT card can still use it in November, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services.\n\nFood banks likely to face increased need if shutdown continues\n\nThose who typically rely on SNAP benefits can utilize food banks and other subsidized meal programs in the wake of the funding lapse. To find a local food bank, enter a zip code on Feeding America's website.\n\nGeorge Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program, a Philadelphia food bank, told USA TODAY that with the lapse in SNAP benefit funding, his organization is ramping up donations and buying additional food.\n\nHowever, Matysik emphasized that food banks were already operating under federal funding cuts earlier this year before the government shutdown.\n\n\"The amount of food that SNAP provides has been estimated to be nine times larger than the entire food bank network combined, so to think that we at food banks alone can be the sole resource to pick up this slack for government's failure in this moment, it's very unreasonable,\" Matysik said.\n\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

But Americans probably won't see any movement until after 42 million people miss out Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.\n\nThe potential shift also comes as shutdown-related disruptions are multiplying, and as President Donald Trump returns from a week-long trip to Asia.\n\nIn the Senate, Democrats tried Wednesday to extend benefits under SNAP before the money dries up on Nov. 1. But Republicans blocked the maneuver by arguing that Democrats should join them in reopening the entire government.\n\nDemocratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states, and Washington, DC, also filed a federal lawsuit in Boston on Tuesday aiming to force the Trump administration to fund the nation’s largest food aid program despite the shutdown.\n\nJoel Berg, the CEO of Hunger Free America, has warned the impending crisis will be the \"greatest hunger catastrophe in America since the Great Depression.\"\n\nTop US airlines call for Congress to pass GOP’s ‘clean’ bill to reopen government\n\nUnited Airlines, Delta Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines on Thursday each called on Congress to approve a Republican-backed “clean” funding bill to reopen the government.\n\nThe statements from the nation’s four largest airlines followed a White House meeting between leaders in the aviation industry and Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.\n\nThe airlines’ endorsements apply additional pressure on Democrats, who have blocked a short-term funding bill 13 times as they push for policy changes to health care.\n\nDelta Airlines, in its statement Thursday, said the company “implores Congress to immediately pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government” so that air traffic controllers and other federal workers in the aviation industry are paid.\n\nAmerican Airlines echoed that statement, saying \"a prolonged shutdown will lead to more delays and cancellations — and the American people, especially during the busy holiday season, deserve better.”\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nUS judge skeptical Trump administration can legally suspend food benefits\n\nA federal judge in Boston on Thursday said it appeared to her that the Trump administration cannot legally suspend all food aid for millions of Americans amid the ongoing government shutdown as it plans to do starting Saturday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Indira Talwani said she planned to decide later on Thursday whether she should force the U.S. Department of Agriculture to use some of the $5.25 billion in contingency funds it has on hand to pay for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.\n\nLawyers for 25 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia during an hour-long hearing asked the judge to issue a temporary restraining order that would ensure the government at least partially funds the SNAP benefits, which 42 million Americans rely upon.\n\nThe USDA has said insufficient funds exist to pay full benefits, which cost $8.5 billion to $9 billion per month. Justice Department attorney Jason Altabet told the judge that USDA lacked the authority to disburse any funds for the benefits until Congress passes a spending bill ending the shutdown that began October 1.\n\nBut Talwani, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, questioned how the administration came to conclude it could pay out nothing at all when Congress provided the USDA with contingency funds it still has available in case of an emergency.\n\n\"It's hard for me to understand how this isn't an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,\" she said.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nVance, Duffy warn of ‘disaster’ air travel ahead of Thanksgiving\n\nVice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned the situation at airports could be a “disaster” if the government remains shut down ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, when travel typically spikes across the nation.\n\n“At that point, you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks, they’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.\n\n\"What happens when the security lines are not an hour long, but they’re four hours long? What happens when pilots start not showing up to work?” the vice president added.\n\nAbout 64,000 Transportation Security Administration employees and 13,000 air traffic controllers ‒ considered \"essential\" workers ‒ are working without pay during the shutdown. TSA employees missed their first full paycheck on Oct. 24, while air traffic controllers missed their first full paychecks on Tuesday. They would miss a second paycheck in November if the shutdown is still going on.\n\n“A lot of our people can go through the miss of one paycheck - and it's hard for them, but a lot of them can get through it,” Duffy said. “None of them can get through two paychecks.”\n\nDuffy painted a bleak scene at airports if the shutdown is not ended before Thanksgiving travel. “Our traffic will be snarled. It will be a disaster in aviation,\" he said.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nVance says White House won’t give in to Democrats’ ‘hostage taking’\n\nVance said the White House won’t give it to “hostage taking” from Democrats amid the government shutdown as he warned of mounting strains on air travel the longer the stalemate drags on.\n\n“You do not get to take the American people’s government hostage and then demand that we give you everything you want in order to pay our air traffic controllers,” Vance told reporters Thursday, Day 30 of the shutdown. “It’s a ridiculous set of demands.”\n\nVance addressed members of the media outside of the White House, where he was joined by Duffy, Teamsters President Sean O’Brien, and United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby.\n\nSenate Democrats have repeatedly blocked a Republican-backed continuing resolution to fund the government as they demand the extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies be included in any package to end the shutdown.\n\n“Let’s reopen the government, and then let’s sit down and talk about how to compromise on policy for the American people,” Vance said, reasserting the administration’s position from the beginning of the shutdown.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nDelays at DCA due to staffing issues\n\nSome senators are set to jet out of Washington, DC for the weekend with little movement to end the government shutdown, but they may be met with delays.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday afternoon issued a ground delay of an average of 90 minutes at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, citing staffing issues.\n\nThe FAA has had long-standing staffing issues, and air traffic controllers routinely had to work significant overtime, even before the shutdown began.\n\nAmid the government shutdown, about 13,000 air traffic controllers and some 50,000 Transportation Security Administration officers must work without pay.\n\nAir traffic controllers missed their first full paychecks on Tuesday and TSA officers missed their first full paychecks on Oct. 24.\n\nLawmakers are at an impasse to fund the government and did not vote on the House-passed temporary funding bill on Thursday, even as key food assistance programs are set to lapse on Nov. 1.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nNY governor declares emergency to fund 40 million meals\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared an emergency Oct. 30 over the looming lapse of SNAP benefits, in order to shift $65 million in state funding to provide food assistance.\n\nNew York has 3 million participants in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. But benefits are set to lapse Nov. 1 because of the shutdown. The emergency funding is projected to provide 40 million meals.\n\n“Unlike Washington Republicans, I won’t sit idly by as families struggle to put food on the table,” Hochul said.\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nLoss of SNAP benefits ‘a one-two punch’: North Carolina food bank chief\n\nClaire Neal, the CEO of MANNA Foodbank in Asheville, North Carolina, said the demand for food in the region is even greater than during the COVID pandemic or after Hurricane Helene devastated the state a year ago.\n\n“We were already in a situation where food was flying off the shelves,” Neal told USA TODAY. “It’s a one-two punch. It’s going to mean that children are going to go without food, families are not going to be able to put food on the table.”\n\nMANNA collects food and wheels it out to 220 pantries and 100 schools in western North Carolina, Neal said. The pantries aim to provide enough food to tide people over for a couple of weeks, she said. But for every one meal the pantries provide, SNAP benefits provide nine meals, she said.\n\n“Nobody could make up a gap that big,” Neal said.\n\nThe community is already stressed economically while recovering from Helene. The threatened loss of SNAP benefits has people worried, particularly senior citizens on fixed incomes, Neal said.\n\n“There is a very high level of fear right now. So many people rely on SNAP to get them through,” Neal said. “Our neighbors are scared about what this is going to mean.”\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nNo Senate votes scheduled to reopen the government\n\nThe Senate is not scheduled to vote Thursday on the House-passed temporary funding bill to reopen the government, just two days before SNAP benefits are set to lapse.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson on Thursday made a plea to “moderate and centrist” Democrats to pass the Republicans’ bill ahead of Nov. 1, which will see money for SNAP benefits run dry, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and Head Start funding at risk.\n\nWhen asked about Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s decision to not hold votes for the bill on Thursday, Johnson said he’s “not going to second-guess” the Senate Republican Leader’s position.\n\n“He's probably about had it with their nonsense,\" Johnson said. \"When they tell him, and they thumb their nose at him, and say other things, they like to drop the F-bomb now for fun, for emphasis apparently, when they tell him those things, he probably recognizes it's a futile effort.”\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nRecipients, states scramble to put food on the table\n\nTaylour Grant is trying to keep her four kids from finding out there won't be money for food in a few days.\n\nThe 29-year-old former medical assistant in Tampa, Florida, hasn't been able to work since May because one of her children, who has autism, needed her full attention. So she doesn't have a cushion to replace the money she's gotten the first of every month through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps.\n\n“I try not to … show what's happening on the forefront because of my kids, but I mean, ultimately, what? What can we do? It is out of our hands,” said Grant, whose oldest is 14 and youngest, just 1. “I haven't been working, things are getting behind. I'm already facing eviction. I have other bills piled up.\"\n\nWhen SNAP benefits don't arrive for Grant and 42 million other Americans on Nov. 1, it will be the first time that food safety net money has been delayed in the program's 60-year history.\n\nRead more about how recipients and state officials are scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table with just a few days' notice.\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire\n\nJohnson says ‘the money doesn’t exist’ to fund SNAP\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson on Thursday said there is no legal avenue to allocate money to keep food samps funded as benefits are set to lapse for the first time in the programs history.\n\n“When it comes to SNAP, some of the Democrats have argued you can use this contingency fund but the truth is there is no legal mechanism to do it,” Johnson said during a daily press conference. “There’s no such legal avenue to give SNAP funding now.”\n\nSNAP has been funded through every government shutdown, including the longest shutdown during Trump’s first presidential term in 2019 that lasted 35 days. More than 42 million people are on food stamps, and some states are coming up with contingencies to help families who will not see their benefits come Nov. 1.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture initially released a contingency plan that said the agency has a reserve of contingency funds, which can be used to pay SNAP benefits directly. However, the agency now says contingency money is available only \"to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits.\"\n\n“The president has lamented this,” Johnson said of SNAP benefits. “He has informed USDA and everybody, do as best you can. But the money doesn’t exist to do it.”\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nAre Medicare and Medicaid impacted by the shutdown?\n\nIf you have Medicare or Medicaid, you should still be able to see your doctor.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will continue operations during the shutdown, the agency said, adding that it has funding for Medicaid through the end of this year.\n\nHowever, other issues could surface as the shutdown drags on.\n\nExperts warn that doctors, hospitals and other health providers could see delays in Medicare and Medicaid payments during a longer-term shutdown.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nMayors search for ways to replace SNAP benefits\n\nMayors across the country are urging U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to prevent a disruption in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food for 42 million low-income people and is scheduled to run out of funding Nov. 1.\n\n“Disrupting SNAP means American children will go hungry,” said Quinton Lucas, mayor of Kansas City, Missouri. “Families will miss meals, food pantries will reach their breaking point, and local communities will bear the burden of Washington's paralysis – once again, failing the American people.\"\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said 60,000 of his residents rely on SNAP benefits to “put food on the table and make ends meet.”\n\n“Cutting or restricting this important support doesn’t just harm individuals – it harms entire communities,” Frey said.\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Mayors urged Rollins in a letter Oct. 23 to prevent a lapse in funding.\n\n“The anticipated disruption to SNAP will not only increase poverty but also weaken ongoing city efforts to promote food security, improve public health, and support local economies,” wrote Tom Cochran, the conference’s executive director, and Matt Tuerk, mayor of Allentown, Pennsylvania.\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nNevada officials shift funding to provide food aid\n\nAs Congress remains deadlocked over reopening the federal government, states are scrambling to provide food to low-income families whose Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits are set to lapse Nov. 1.\n\nTop Nevada officials voted Oct. 29 to approve $30 million for food banks for the anticipated suspension of federal SNAP benefits, but that amount covers only a third of the monthly benefits.\n\nThe state Board of Examiners – Gov. Joe Lombardo, Attorney General Aaron Ford and Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar – agreed to tap an emergency fund to provide the food assistance as a short-term remedy. A state legislative panel must still vote on the funding shift.\n\n“l voted for this funding today, but let's be clear, this is a Band-Aid and kids are still going to struggle to be fed,” Ford said in a statement.\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nBipartisan talks for options to end shutdown gather steam\n\nIn recent days, several lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, have suggested there's been a renewed vigor in bipartisan back-channeling among rank-and-file lawmakers.\n\nThe political movement comes as shutdown-related disruptions are multiplying, and as President Donald Trump is set to return from a weeklong trip to Asia on Oct. 30.\n\nThe latest pressure to end the shutdown came Oct. 29, when the Federal Aviation Administration cited staffing issues as it ordered a ground stop at Newark Liberty International Airport, an important transportation hub. All flights to Los Angeles International Airport were briefly halted for similar reasons over the weekend.\n\n\"There's been a significant uptick in bipartisan conversations,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. \"That's the good news.\"\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of thousands of federal workers have been furloughed, leaving agencies working at mere fractions of their usual capacities.\n\nDemocratic SNAP funding bill blocked by GOP senator\n\nA bill to keep funds flowing to food stamps and nutritional programs for low-income women, infants, and children was blocked on the Senate floor Wednesday.\n\nMoney for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, could run out soon, even with a recent emergency cash infusion earlier this month.\n\nSen. Ben Ray Luján asked the Senate to pass through a procedural step known as unanimous consent his bill that would fund SNAP and WIC through the government shutdown.\n\n“Pass this bill now,” Luján said on the Senate floor. “Fund SNAP, fund WIC, before this hunger crisis hits our communities.”\n\nMajority Leader John Thune forcefully objected to it on the Senate floor, calling for lawmakers to instead pass the House-passed temporary funding bill.\n\n“The senator from New Mexico is absolutely right. SNAP recipients shouldn’t go without food. People should be getting paid in this country, and we’ve tried to do that 13 times. And you voted no 13 times,” Thune said.\n\n“This isn’t a political game,” he added. “These are real people’s lives we are talking about, and you have all just figured out 29 days in that, oh, there may be some consequences?\"\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nHouse staffers won't get paid Friday, memo says\n\nWages for staffers in the House of Representatives will be delayed until the government reopens, according to an email sent to employees Wednesday.\n\nTheir October paychecks were originally scheduled to be disbursed Friday.\n\nLawmakers in the House haven't taken a vote in weeks.

The average monthly benefit for a Wisconsin household was $161.\n\nThe federal government shutdown is set to enter its third week. Monday marked the 13th day of the shutdown, and Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill appeared no closer to coming to a deal to reopen it.\n\nHouse Republicans last month passed a seven-week stopgap funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, that included millions of additional dollars in security for members. But the measure stalled in the Senate as Democrats have demanded provisions extending Affordable Care Act insurance plan subsidies that will expire at the end of the year. Republicans need support from a handful of Senate Democrats to bypass the chamber's 60-vote filibuster.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who sits on the House Agriculture Committee, said Monday that the solution to preventing a lapse in funding for food assistance programs was for Senate Democrats to help Republicans reopen the government.

Streaming sliced it into bite-size pieces and marginalized the once-ubiquitous cable box.\n\nAnd the NFL’s growth and appetite for global domination now commands attention three nights a week in the autumn, chasing the World Series off the hallowed Sunday night airwaves.\n\nYet the baseball industry now has a gift four decades in the making: The Bronx vs. the beach, Aaron Judge and Juan Soto vs. Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts.\n\nAnd for better or worse, it’s about to find out just how good it can get in this atomized landscape.\n\n“They must be jumping for joy, getting the top two markets and such a great rivalry, going back to their first World Series in 1941,” says Dennis Deninger, Syracuse University Sport Management professor emeritus and author of Live Sports Media: The What, How and Why of Sports Broadcasting.\n\n“The stars are important, too. You’ve got big markets and a history in the rivalry between these two teams and big stars.”\n\nDeninger predicts big things, based on the appetizer: The L.A.-New York National League Championship Series pitting the Dodgers against the Mets drew some startling numbers, most notably Game 1, which averaged 8.26 million viewers, most for an NLCS since 2009 and rivaling last year’s World Series number.\n\nNLCS Game 1 also went up against Sunday Night Football and did some actual damage, with SNF losing 8% of its audience year-over-year even as its 15.4 million viewers nearly doubled the baseball playoff game.\n\nFor this World Series?\n\nIt’s once again the two biggest markets, with the more hallowed Yankees supplanting the Mets, and no NFL interference. And Deninger projects average viewership around 16 million, which would be highest for a World Series since the 2017 Dodgers-Houston Astros seven-game battle averaged 18.9 million viewers.\n\nAfter four consecutive years of World Series ratings that all ended among the lowest-rated in history, it would be a nifty reversal of the clock. And MLB has made some progress in that area of late.\n\nThe kids stay in the picture\n\nThe erstwhile national pastime has always battled the existential crisis of an aging fan base, a trendline that dovetails with the times when TV ratings were king.\n\nThose coveted 18-to-34 viewers in the 1980s are now eligible for Medicare, and their children and grandchildren born into a traffic jam of entertainment options and social media distractions.\n\nYet the league’s aggressive efforts to speed up and present a more aesthetically pleasing game seem to be bearing fruit.\n\nFox Sports, which broadcast the NL Division Series and NLCS, has experienced a 39% boost in viewership among the 18-to-34 demographic entering the World Series, according to MLB.\n\nThat jump comes after nearly all of MLB’s broadcast partners experienced double-digit growth – Fox was at 9% - in the 18-to-34s.\n\nAt season’s end, MLB reported that the median age for ticket buyers has decreased from 51 to 46 since 2019, a span in which the percentage of ticket buyers aged 18-35 has jumped 8.5%.\n\nThe league credits its pitch clock and liberal base-stealing rules with the upticks; though there are any number of other reasons – most notably being several years removed from the height of the pandemic – it makes sense that a younger, more distracted audience might vibe more with a sports contest that averaged 2 hours, 38 minutes this year – down from 3:11 as recently as 2021.\n\nPut simply, commissioner Rob Manfred says the “increased enthusiasm baseball fans of all ages have shown the last two seasons is evident in all of the ways we track fan engagement.”\n\nThe gains at the box office and with national television partners are all the more important given the uncertainty in the regional sports network space, where cable cord-cutters and the eventual bankruptcy of the Sinclair-owned Diamond Sports Group has thrust numerous franchises into revenue limbo.\n\nThe bankruptcy and an extended court battle has resulted in MLB producing and taking over the broadcast rights for six teams, with Minnesota, Cleveland and Milwaukee joining San Diego, Arizona and Colorado in 2025.\n\nDiamond has committed to continuing to broadcast games for Atlanta and Miami, under the rebranded FanDuel Sports Network. The Texas Rangers mutually agreed to shop their own rights on the market.\n\nThat leaves six teams – Detroit, Tampa Bay, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Kansas City and the Los Angeles Angels – in flux as bankruptcy proceedings continue.\n\nWhile revenue and spending aren’t a direct line to on-field success, there is a significant correlation. And while there are no such things as have-nots in Major League Baseball – more like haves and have-mores – the RSN situation has the potential to exacerbate revenue disparities.\n\nEssentially: Clubs who own or have significant shares of their own networks – or massive deals in major markets – will continue flourishing. That includes Boston, both New York teams, the Dodgers and to a lesser degree Philadelphia and San Francisco.\n\nGiven that three of this year’s final four came from that group – and the Cleveland Guardians were quickly dispatched in a five-game ALCS – it could serve as a coming attraction for an eventually unappealing caste system. And a playoff structure where a handful of teams do dominate – as opposed to the relative parity of the past 23 seasons, where 16 teams have won the Fall Classic.\n\nFor this year, though, the ultimate matchup is very much a novelty.\n\n'They don't want to be third'\n\nIt’s not exactly like the NFL is the bear in the woods, and MLB and the NBA in a race to finish second, lest the bear consume it.\n\nBut it certainly helps a league’s self-esteem to know it’s not No. 3. And that’s a plateau MLB might be shooting for with this Dodgers-Yankees clash.\n\n“The number to beat this year is 11.3 million viewers per minute that the Celtics vs. Mavericks got,” Syracuse’s Deninger says. “I’m sure they’ll be jumping for joy if they clear that number.\n\n“It’s, ‘Where are you in the pecking order of American sports?’ MLB, in relinquishing Sunday nights to NFL knows it’s behind the NFL. They don’t want to be a regular third behind the NFL and NBA. It’s a marketing thing and a pride thing.\n\n“And, if it’s reaching more people, you can charge more for those championships.”\n\nThe NBA Finals have drawn a larger audience than the World Series in five of the past six full seasons, with only the 2021 Atlanta-Houston World Series outpointing a Milwaukee-Phoenix Finals.\n\nIn 2016, both championships went the full seven games, and the Chicago Cubs’ championship that ended a 108-year drought trumped a Warriors-Cavaliers LeBron-Steph battle, averaging 22.8 million viewers to 20.2 million watching Golden State famously blow a 3-1 lead.\n\nThat Cubs-Cleveland 2016 Game 7 shattered decades of ratings doldrums, its 40.8 million average viewers making it the most-watched Series game this century, and the largest audience since Games 6 (40.8 million) and 7 (50.3 million) in 1991, when Minnesota and Atlanta went the distance.\n\nNew York and L.A. will aim for that ceiling.\n\n“It’s what the people wanted,” the Dodgers’ Betts said after clinching the NL pennant.\n\nNow, we’ll find out just how many people.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.

And its combined Game 1-2 audience of 19.8 million in the USA and Canada was up 24% from last season, also the highest since that historic 2016 Cubs-Cleveland battle.\n\nExpert MLB daily picks: Unique MLB betting insights only at USA TODAY\n\nFor Fox Sports, the presence of a Canadian team was always going to make this World Series an uphill climb. Yet the prevailing conditions – from Ohtani’s presence to an 18-inning epic that captivated casual viewers, to a Series lasting at least six games – have been an undeniable boon.\n\nFox appears to have weathered the punishment that comes with one participant coming from a Canadian market, robbing it of massive numbers from a stateside city fired up for its home team. Through Game 4, the network averaged a 5.4 rating and 12.4 million viewers per game, down from 2024’s Yankees-Dodgers bicoastal jackpot that produced a 7.3 number, but up 15% from 2023’s Arizona-Texas ratings nadir.\n\nAnd the growth from Game 2 (5.2 rating, 11.4 million viewers on a Saturday night) to Game 4 (7.2/14.5 million on a Tuesday) and Game 5 (14.6 million) suggests both the rapidly-evolving Series narrative combined with a football-free evening have spiked interest.\n\nIn Canada, Sportsnet – which has rights to all World Series – has broken viewership records throughout the Blue Jays’ postseason run, peaking at 7.7 million viewers for Game 1, a mark that almost certainly will be broken as the Blue Jays aim to clinch their first title since 1993 this weekend.\n\nAnd the combined Game 5 audience in the USA and Canada across all Fox and Sportsnet platforms reached 22 million, most since 2019 Game 7.\n\n\"I mean, the numbers this World Series is doing not only in Canada, but everywhere, is unbelievable,\" says Blue Jays infielder Bo Bichette before Game 6. \"I even had to kind of take a step back and be like, dang, this is pretty cool.\"\n\nFor decades, the Blue Jays have been toxic for American networks during the regular season. They have not appeared on ESPN’s Sunday Night Baseball since 1999, for the same reasons that Yankees-Red Sox annually appear the maximum number of times: It’s tough for ESPN or Fox to pull a ratings number during the regular season without significant domestic eyeballs from one of the teams’ markets.\n\nBut the World Series is a different animal. John Kosner, president of his eponymous sports media advising, investing and consulting company, says the best comp for this World Series is not the Dodgers-Yankees dream matchup that preceded it, nor the 2023 Rangers-Diamondbacks five-game battle that, predictably, was the worst-rated Series of all time.\n\nInstead, he cites the 2019 NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and Toronto Raptors that featured a polarizing defending champion led by a global superstar battling a Canadian squad with a well-known personality himself.\n\nABC survived the Canadian hit: The Finals averaged 15.4 million viewers, including 18.3 million in the decisive Game 6. That crushed the decisive Game 4 a year earlier, when the Curry-LeBron James closeout game drew 16.2 million viewers.\n\nFast-forward six years, and the circumstances are eerily similar.\n\n“You’ve got the defending champion superteam, No. 2 market, No. 1 payroll Dodgers,” says Kosner. “You have Shohei Ohtani instead of Steph Curry. And you’re playing a terrific Toronto team that beat the Yankees, that has Vlad Guerrero Jr.\n\n“It’s always been the conventional wisdom that you want two U.S. markets, preferably two big U.S. markets. My point of view is, it really matters more the teams that can capture people’s attention. There was a lot of interest in Kawhi Leonard and Toronto in 2019. There’s a lot of interest in the Toronto Blue Jays and how they dispatched the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners.”\n\nOf course, all these numbers come amid the shifting backdrop of how ratings are formulated and viewers counted. In 2020, Nielsen began including out-of-home measurements in ratings, such as watch parties, bars and other communal viewing situations. In 2024, they expanded that metric beyond the top 44 markets, to include smaller, NFL-centric markets like Green Bay, Buffalo and New Orleans.\n\nAnd in September, it integrated its “big data plus panel” measurement for live programming into its ratings, incorporating data from of homes with smart TVs and streaming devices, in an effort to create a more accurate rendering of actual viewership.\n\nThe counting metrics have provided a near-term boost to ratings – NFL and college football numbers have skyrocketed – and, since the 2020 out-of-home counting revolution, have stanched some of the ratings bleed borne of cable TV cord-cutting and the rise of streaming.\n\nBut beyond the spinnable boosts, the measures do provide at least a partially more accurate look at actual viewership in this atomized audience era.\n\nNow a Game 6, for the first time since 2022. That matchup – featuring a large and thirsty Phillies fanbase and the increasingly reviled Astros – pulled a 6.1 rating and 12.5 million estimated viewers for Fox.\n\nThere’s a decent chance this truly international affair might outpoint it – even with one market essentially tied behind its back. That it is trouncing 2023’s Diamondbacks-Rangers matchup – matching the Nos. 4-8 Nielsen markets, not exactly Mayberry vs. Stars Hollow – speaks to the fact that the who is almost as important as the where.\n\n“You had two US markets, but many people weren’t familiar with either team,” says Kosner.\n\n“In this case, you’ve got a pretty big marquee.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2016/10/23/cubs-indians-world-series-drought-raises-stakes/92661710/", "title": "Cubs, Indians World Series droughts raise stakes", "text": "Bob Nightengale\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nCLEVELAND -- Yes, just in case anyone has forgotten outside the 216 area code, there’s another long-suffering legion of fans, with generations never having seen their team win a World Series championship.\n\nThey are the Cleveland Indians, the American League’s version of the Chicago Cubs.\n\nThe Indians last won a World Series in 1948 during the Truman administration.\n\nThe Cubs, who hadn’t even been in the World Series for 71 years, last won in 1908 while Teddy Roosevelt was in office.\n\nWhen the teams meet Tuesday (8 p.m. ET, Fox) at Progressive Field for Game 1 of the 112th World Series, it will be the longest combined championship drought — 174 years — in World Series history.\n\nExpert MLB daily picks: Unique MLB betting insights only at USA TODAY\n\nWorld Series, first glance: Cubs and Indians battle each other - and history\n\nOne team will give its fans a memory of a lifetime, sending them running to graveyards, placing caps on the tombstones of their loved ones who weren’t around to see it.\n\nThe other’s anguish will last at least another year.\n\n“That’s why I wanted it to be us against the Cubs,” Indians DH Mike Napoli said. “I thought it would be a cooler thing to be part of. To go to Wrigley on the road, to see that atmosphere. To see it here. That’s something I live for.\n\n“The Cubs have a lot of history.\n\n“We have a lot of history.”\n\nIt just happens to be a whole lot of bad history.\n\nThe Indians, who dominated the AL Central in the 1990s, at least have recent World Series experience. They were in the World Series in 1997, two outs away from finally winning that coveted title, but blew a ninth-inning lead to the Florida Marlins and lost Game 7 in 11 innings. They lost in six games to the powerful Atlanta Braves in 1995. And before that, you’ve got to back to 1954 against the New York Giants.\n\nThe Cubs haven’t been to the Fall Classic since 1945, two years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier.\n\nDexter Fowler, Jason Heyward and Addison Russell will make history as the first African Americans to play World Series games in a Cubs uniform.\n\n“This erased a lot of failures that the teams have had,” said Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg, the most beloved Cub of his generation. “It’s a long time coming.”\n\nPerhaps this Series would be even more compelling if the city of Cleveland still had not won a championship of any kind in any sport. The NBA’s Cavaliers took care of that in June, ending the city’s 52-year drought, and will unfurl their championship banner about an hour before Game 1 across the street when they begin defense of their NBA title at Quicken Loans Arena.\n\nDoes it ease the Indians’ pressure knowing they don’t have to carry Cleveland’s burden?\n\n“Maybe,” Napoli said.\n\nHe paused.\n\n“Probably.”\n\nIt’s no different than Chicago, of course. Chicago had a World Series winner in 2005, it just happened to be the White Sox. The Bulls won six NBA titles from 1991 to 1998. The Blackhawks have won six Stanley Cups, including three since 2009. The Bears were Super Bowl champions in the 1985 season.\n\nNone of the past will matter in one town.\n\nCubs' young core set for first of what could be several World Series\n\n“To win a championship here after all of this time, that would be pretty cool,” Napoli said. “Friends from here have let me know that if the Indians ever won a World Series, the city would be out of control. It would be bananas.”\n\nLet’s see, will there be 2 million fans watching a parade on Euclid Avenue in downtown Cleveland — or 3 million watching a parade on Michigan Avenue in Chicago?\n\nThere are enough enthralling story lines in this World Series to make a Hollywood movie.\n\nCleveland manager Terry Francona resigned in 2011 after eight years with the Boston Red Sox. Three weeks later, Francona’s boss, Theo Epstein, resigned, too, and went to Chicago to head up the Cubs’ baseball operations.\n\n“We were together eight years, and eight years in Boston, I would say is almost miraculous,” Francona said. “There’s a lot of fond memories.”\n\nCubs manager Joe Maddon and Francona interviewed for the Red Sox managerial vacancy in 2004. Francona got the job and immediately led the Red Sox to their first World Series title in 86 years, then did it again in 2007. Maddon wound up in Tampa Bay and led the Rays to the 2008 World Series, but he’s still looking for his first ring.\n\n“We loved him,” Epstein said of Maddon, “but we thought taking over a veteran team in a big market, there would have been some risk involved because he’s so unique. For us having Tito, who had already managed in the big leagues, it obviously worked out great for both.”\n\nCubs pitchers Jon Lester and John Lackey won World Series rings with the Red Sox, yes, playing for Francona.\n\n“A lot of history there, great man,” Lester said. “I’m glad we’re facing Cleveland, just because Tito is a friend.”\n\nNapoli won the 2013 World Series with the Red Sox and is close friends with Lester, Lackey and David Ross.\n\nCubs closer Aroldis Chapman and Cleveland relief ace Andrew Miller were teammates with the New York Yankees this season, then were traded within six days of one another.\n\nMiller, the AL Championship Series MVP, saw his career revived as a reliever when Francona insisted the Red Sox re-sign him after trading for and then non-tendering him in 2010.\n\nThen, of course, there is the Cubs general manager Jed Hoyer, who actually helped make Cleveland’s championship run possible.\n\nThe Cubs will be facing Corey Kluber, who could win his second Cy Young Award in three seasons, in Game 1. Yes, the same Corey Kluber who once was a Class AA pitching prospect in the San Diego Padres organization. The prospect that Hoyer, as GM of the Padres at the time, traded to Cleveland in 2010, only to see him emerge as one of the finest pitchers in baseball.\n\n“We kid him all of the time about it,” Epstein said, laughing.\n\nThe Padres were going for the division title in 2010, needing one more bat, and pulled off a three-way deal with the Indians and the St. Louis Cardinals. The Padres landed Ryan Ludwick, the Cardinals got Jake Westbrook and the Indians came up with Kluber.\n\n“Our offense needed help, big-time,” said Cubs vice president Jason McLeod, who was Hoyer’s assistant GM. “And at the time Kluber wasn’t rated high as a prospect in our system. I remember while the trade was being made, Jed asked a lot about people on the staff. We had only been there one year, so we didn’t really have a lot of history with Corey.\n\n“We debated about it, and I remember a few of us saying, ‘Hey, Jed, he’s the one starting pitcher in our minor league system that can miss bats, I think he can be a starter.’ He said, ‘No, he’s a reliever type of guy.’\n\n“We all saw what happened.’’\n\nHoyer, of course, has been involved in plenty of deals that turned out brilliantly, including the acquisition of Cy Young winner Jake Arrieta and reliever Pedro Strop, but his colleagues can’t help but tease him.\n\nNow, with Epstein sending a congratulatory text to Francona after the Indians knocked off the Toronto Blue Jays in the ALCS, and Francona responding an hour later to say, “Hope to see you next week,” the time has arrived.\n\n“I think every city would be going crazy in the World Series,” Miller said. “I can’t imagine Yankee fans got tired of their dynasty. I don’t think Boston was underwhelmed with their third World Series in 10 years.\n\n“But this year, considering the droughts, I’ve got to think this one will be pretty special.”\n\nCall it epic.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale and Facebook\n\nGallery: World Series matchup", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2025/03/18/dodgers-vs-cubs-tokyo-series-score-highlights/82506303007/", "title": "Dodgers vs Cubs highlights: Ohtani leads LA in MLB Tokyo Series win", "text": "The 2025 Major League Baseball season is officially underway.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs have the honor of getting things started in the two-game Tokyo Series.\n\nWith Japan natives Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Shota Imanaga taking the mound and a sellout crowd packing the Tokyo Dome, the Dodgers began defense of the World Series title they won last fall by claiming a 4-1 victory in the season opener.\n\nMLB 2025: 100 Names to Know for the new baseball season\n\nReigning National League MVP Shohei Ohtani singled, doubled and scored a pair of runs to lead the L.A. offense.

Ohtani moved to third on Tommy Edman's groundout and then came in to score his second run of the game on Teoscar Hernandez's RBI single to left field, expanding the Los Angeles lead to 4-1.\n\nTo the ninth: Dodgers 3, Cubs 1\n\nThe Cubs and Dodgers have been trading zeroes, heading into the ninth inning with Los Angeles leading 3-1. Both teams squandered scoring opportunities in the eighth, each unable to bring in a runner from second with one out.\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto done after five\n\nStarting the MLB season opener in his return to Japan, Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched five strong innings for the Dodgers, giving up one run on three hits with one walk and four strikeouts. Anthony Banda came on to pitch the sixth inning with Yamamoto in line for the win departing with a 3-1 lead.\n\nDodgers take 3-1 lead in fifth\n\nThe Dodgers finally broke through in the top of the fifth inning.\n\nHeld hitless through the first four frames against Cubs starter Shōta Imanaga, the defending World Series champs jumped on reliever Ben Brown for three runs in the fifth.\n\nAfter center fielder Andy Pages drew a one-out walk, Shohei Ohtani recorded the Dodgers' first hit with a sharp single to right field. Tommy Edman then tied the game at 1 with an RBI single to left. Ohtani scored the go-ahead run when Teoscar Hernandez grounded into a force out. And Hernandez came around to score after advancing on a throwing error and a Will Smith single.\n\nThrough five innings, the Dodgers lead 3-1.\n\nShōta Imanaga holds Dodgers hitless through four\n\nThe Chicago Cubs got pretty much everything they wanted out of starting pitcher Shōta Imanaga.\n\nImanaga departed after tossing four no-hit innings against the Dodgers – and doing it in an unexpected way.

The Bruins and Blackhawks are battling for the Stanley Cup in cathedral-like arenas in Boston and Chicago.\n\nAnd in sleepy Omaha, Neb., UCLA and Mississippi State will battle for college baseball’s national championship.\n\nAnd while it may not come with the glitz and glamour of the NCAA’s football and basketball championships, the College World Series may be more compelling than either of them.\n\nFor years, college football fans have been pleading for a new way to pick a champion. Coaches’ polls, media polls, computer polls and the BCS have all failed -- at one point or another, -- to define an undisputed champion. Even college football’s playoff system, which is still a year away from being implemented, is already drawing criticism from many coaches and athletic directors.\n\nWhile the tournament has expanded since it was first played in 1947, the College World Series remains virtually unchanged: The country’s eight best teams meet for a double-elimination bracket, with the two finalists playing a best-of-three series.\n\n\n\nRELATED: Diamond in the rough: A beginner’s guide to the College World Series\n\nThe tournament begins with 64 teams in eight “super regions,” and the regional winners advance to Omaha. The tournament may seem large, but champions like Fresno State in 2008 prove that the glass slipper could fit for any team.\n\nIn basketball, the NCAA has opted to go big for its tournament games. Perhaps too big.\n\nThe 2012 men’s championship game was played in front of 70,000 fans in Houston’s enormous Reliant Stadium. While the NCAA cashes in at the box office, the play on the court suffers. With such an enormous backdrop, shooters have had a difficult time putting the ball in the hoop. Only 94 points were scored in the 2012 national championship, a sloppy game between Butler and The University of Connecticut.\n\nInstead of jumping from city to city, like the NCAA has done for so many of its other championships, the College World Series has been played in Omaha since 1950. For 60 years, the championship was held in Rosenblatt Stadium, a minor-league ballpark. Unassuming and utilitarian, Rosenblatt was a slice of Middle America.\n\nThough the NCAA recently abandoned Rosenblatt for newly constructed TD Ameritrade Park, a small max capacity of 35,000 helps retain the small-town feel of the series.\n\nIn football and basketball, it is easy to get lost in the commercialism. Crowd shots show fans wearing jerseys with players’ numbers on them. Celebrities are sitting in the first row. Even the football coach’s trophy is sponsored.\n\nIn crowd shots at the College World Series, you’re more likely to find the parents of the player at bat. Or a family at the ballpark.\n\nRules like the NBA’s one-and-done rule may keep talented players in the NCAA, but at a price.\n\nCollege fans never get the chance to connect with these rising stars. And even though these “super freshmen” will do everything to help their team win, it can be difficult to root for a player who will inevitably abandon his team in a few short weeks.\n\nCollege baseball gives its players options.\n\nA player can enter the major leagues after high school, but if he commits to a college, he must remain there for three years. Everyone on the field wants to be there and is committed to the team. And because the MLB draft takes place in early June, juniors and seniors have their baseball futures sorted out. The only focus is a championship.\n\nOh, and the baseball is pretty good, too.\n\nUCLA’s pitching staff comes into the CWS final with an ERA of 1.00, and will face a potent Mississippi State offense led by Hunter Renfroe.\n\nWhether it’s the ping (not crack) of the bat, or the entire team leaving the bench to greet the guy who just hit a homer, the College World Series offers something that can be hard to find in big-time college sports: sincerity.\n\n\n\nAlex Hider is a Summer 2013 USA TODAY Collegiate Correspondent.

IndyCar’s Leaders Circle program is an annually evolving list of 22 entries, derived from the top 2 points-scoring entries from the previous season among those eligible (this year, meaning Ganassi’s Nos. 8, 9 and 10 entries and the other 22 on the grid). From that pool of 25, the top 22 will each receive just over $1 million in earnings directly from the series next season.\n\nIndyCar points picture: Series championship points standings after Milwaukee Race 2\n\nFor weeks now, the first 18 of those spots have been locked-in, but entering the final race of the year, those final four spots are still up-for-grabs, with entries ranked 19th-23rd separated by just 15 points. Barring a colossal upset from Dale Coyne Racing – the owner of the 24th- and 25th-ranked cars at the moment – only one of those aforementioned cars will be on the outside looking in come the checkered flag.\n\nHere’s where those bottom entries currently sit:\n\n19. Juncos Hollinger Racing No. 78: 189 points\n\n20. Meyer Shank Racing No. 66: 187 points\n\n21. Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing No. 30: 177 points\n\n22. AJ Foyt Racing No. 41: 175 points\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n23. Ed Carpenter Racing No. 20: 174 points\n\n24. Dale Coyne Racing No. 160: 160 points\n\n25. Dale Coyne Racing No. 18: 137 points\n\nPast 10th-place, which receives 20 points, IndyCar’s point system awards one point fewer to each successive position down the finishing order, down to five points for 25th. Cars finishing 26th and 27th also receive five points. But even with that in mind, positions 21st-23rd are separated by just three points, meaning every spot will count for these seven cars on Sunday.\n\nFoyt, Ferrucci on the rise\n\nEver since he logged four top-10 finishes over his first six starts of the year in AJ Foyt Racing’s No. 14, 2024 has felt like a hallmark season for Ferrucci. And to the surprise of many, the roll hasn’t stopped. What last year was a team and driver that shined on the IMS oval but did little elsewhere, has become a tandem among the best of IndyCar’s midfield.\n\n'This isn't my end goal': Santino Ferrucci eyeing new Foyt deal, even more success in 2025\n\nWith solid performances at Nashville, here’s what the driver and team could have within their grasp:\n\n∎ Following a pair of 4th-place finishes across the doubleheader at The Milwaukee Mile, a top 5 for the No. 14 Chevy would give Foyt three straight for the first time since a stretch that spanned the 2001-02 IRL seasons.\n\n∎ A top 10 would mark the 11th for Ferrucci this season, which would be a team record.\n\n∎ A fact Alexander Rossi bluntly mentioned on his podcast last week he sorely hopes to keep at bay, Ferrucci is within 11 points of Rossi in the points. Should the Foyt driver finish enough places ahead of Rossi on Sunday to overtake the Arrow McLaren driver in the championship, a 9th-place points finish would mark the team’s best since 2002, when Airton Dare matched it.\n\nSalvaging a rollercoaster 2024 for Newgarden\n\nA win for Josef Newgarden, IndyCar’s oval master who won at World Wide Technology Raceway last month and who qualified 1st and 2nd at The Mile last weekend, only for disaster to strike twice, would move the Team Penske driver into solo 10th place on the series career wins list. He’s tied with fellow Penske legend Helio Castroneves, Dario Franchitti and Paul Tracy.\n\nAnother win would also put 9th place (Al Unser Jr., 34 wins) and 8th place (Bobby Unser, 35 wins) squarely in reach for 2025 for the two-time champ and two-time 500 winner.\n\nMilestone wins on the line\n\nSeveral drivers are looking for their first IndyCar win: Ferrucci, Ganassi’s Marcus Armstrong and Linus Lundqvist and Juncos Hollinger Racing’s Romain Grosjean and Conor Daly.\n\nA victory on the D-shaped oval 40 minutes outside Nashville would also represent the first oval win for Palou, Colton Herta, Kyle Kirkwood, Christian Lundgaard, Felix Rosenqvist and Rinus VeeKay.\n\nPower, Dixon eyeing keeping streaks intact\n\nNot only is it something that would position Power well for his finale battle with Palou, as well as earn a crucial point for the weekend, a pole for the Team Penske veteran would carry additional significance. On the road to amassing 70 career poles, Power has captured at least one pole in each of the last 15 years, but he’s yet to snag one in 2024.\n\nEight times this year – in half of the 16 races run – Power has started in the first two rows (4th or better), and in four of those instances, Power qualified 2nd. Missing out Sunday would mark his first season without a pole since 2008 and his second full-time season without one. A winless season a year ago snapped Power’s streak of 16 years with at least one victory.\n\nOne of Power’s contemporaries, six-time champ Scott Dixon, has a streak on the line, too. The Ganassi veteran sits 5th in the championship, 19 points back of 4th-place Colton Herta with as many as 54 points up for grabs. Should Dixon fail to make up that ground to the Andretti Global driver (and also not catch Scott McLaughlin, who’s 32 points ahead in 3rd-place), Dixon would finish outside the top 4 in the championship for just the second time in 19 seasons.\n\nOver that stretch, Dixon has captured five of his six IndyCar titles, finished runner-up three times and taken 3rd in the championship six times.\n\nHerta, McLaughlin chasing career bests\n\nShould they shine Sunday, Herta and McLaughlin have outside shots of moving up in the championship to as high as 2nd-place. They sit 4th and 3rd, respectively, at the moment, with gaps to 2nd-place Power currently 30 and 17 points, respectively.\n\nBoth drivers have finished no higher than 3rd in the championship during, with Herta’s personal best coming in 2020 and McLaughlin’s a year ago. Catching Power and finishing behind Palou would mark personal bests.\n\nPalou, Ganassi could be in a class of their own\n\nFor Palou and Power, a championship would be the third, a mark only five other drivers have topped in the history of American open-wheel racing. But there’s additional historic significance on the line for the Ganassi driver, including:\n\n∎ Becoming the first back-to-back series champ in IndyCar since Dario Franchitti, now the driver coach for CGR, strung together three consecutive titles from 2009-11. It’s only happened three other times this century: Sebastien Bourdais’ four-peat in Champ Car (2004-07), Sam Hornish Jr. in the IRL (2001-02) and Gil de Ferran doing the same in CART (2000-01).\n\n∎ Among those drivers who’ve won at least three American open-wheel championships, only Bourdais did so as quickly early in a career. Palou’s would come in his fifth IndyCar season, while Bourdais did so in four, though you could certainly argue that with Bourdais doing so during The Split in Champ Car − and with IndyCar’s fields presently as deep as ever − Palou’s accomplishment is marginally more impressive.\n\n∎ With a top-9 finish, Palou would ensure a championship. Finishing 5th or better at Nashville would be the Spaniard’s 14th such finish this year, the most in a single season since Castroneves recorded 15 in 2008.\n\n∎ We talk about IndyCar being a two-team, top-heavy sport over the last 15 years or so, but when it comes to championships, Chip Ganassi Racing has had no equal. A title for Palou would give his team 11 in the last 17 seasons; Team Penske has grabbed five and Andretti Global just one.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2024/10/21/dodgers-yankees-world-series-shohei-ohtani-aaron-judge/75773389007/", "title": "Dodgers vs. Yankees, Ohtani vs. Judge: Classic World Series awaits", "text": "LOS ANGELES − The Los Angeles Dodgers, their shirts stripped off, wading in a pool of beer and champagne nearly up to their ankles in the clubhouse Sunday night, were drunk with emotion trying to explain what this meant to them.\n\nThey had just pounded the New York Mets 10-5 and won the National League pennant at Dodger Stadium, but this title was nothing more than the warmup act.\n\nNow comes the moment that Major League Baseball, its TV partners, its corporate advertisers and millions of baseball fans have been clamoring for the past 43 years.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees, for the first time since 1981, will face each other in the World Series.\n\nHollywood vs. Broadway.\n\nExpert MLB daily picks: Unique MLB betting insights only at USA TODAY\n\nRodeo Drive vs. Fifth Avenue.\n\nShohei Ohtani vs. Aaron Judge.\n\nMookie Betts vs. Juan Soto.\n\nFreddie Freeman vs. Giancarlo Stanton.\n\nThe rich vs. the richer.\n\nTwo of the most iconic franchises in sports, which had the best records in their respective leagues this season, playing for baseball’s ultimate prize.\n\n\"As a fan of baseball, how can you not be excited about this?\" Dodgers infielder Max Muncy asked. \"You’re talking about two of the biggest franchises. The biggest stars in the sport. We got Shohei, Freddie and Mookie. On the other side, you got Aaron Judge, Giancarlo, Juan Soto, Gerrit Cole.\n\n\"The game’s biggest stars on the absolute biggest stage.\n\n\"So how can you not be excited about this? This is the World Series.\"\n\nThis is Magic Johnson vs. Larry Bird.\n\nThis is Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier.\n\nThis is Jack Nicklaus vs. Arnold Palmer.\n\nThis is Coke vs. Pepsi.\n\n\"It’s what the people wanted,\" Betts said. \"What we all wanted.\"\n\nJust the idea of Judge and Ohtani being on the same stage, the two MVP favorites who are fighting for the same ultimate team prize, could cause an international meltdown with all of the hype.\n\n\"I can’t even imagine how excited the whole nation of Japan is now,\" said Dodgers shortstop Tommy Edman, the MVP of the National League Championship Series with 11 RBI, tying a postseason franchise record. \"If they weren’t already fans of baseball before, even more so now. Everybody wants to see these two teams play on the biggest stages. It’s a World Series full of superstars.\"\n\nJudge, who led the American League with 58 homers, and Ohtani, who led the National League with 54 homers, will mark the World Series’ first matchup between home-run leaders since the Yankees’ Mickey Mantle and the Dodgers’ Duke Snider met in 1956.\n\nIt will be the first time Ohtani and Judge have ever played in a World Series.\n\n\"I really feel like we finally arrived, I finally arrived at this stage,\" Ohtani said. \"The goal was to get to this far. I also pictured myself getting this far with the contract that I've signed (10 years, $700 million). Just being able to play on this kind of stage with the team effort, and all the games were really hard. But I'm just glad that we're at this stage right now.\"\n\nDodgers center fielder Kevin Kiermaier, who’s retiring after the season, battled emotions trying to describe what this means to him. He was on that Tampa Bay Rays team that lost to the Dodgers in the 2020 World Series. It was the COVID World Series, played on a neutral site in Arlington, Texas, with limited fan seating.\n\nWhen the Dodgers won that World Series, they passed out masks instead of champagne bottles. There was no parade in downtown Los Angeles, or anywhere else.\n\nNow there will be a parade for the ages in New York or Los Angeles, with the Yankees hoping to celebrate their first championship since 2009 and the Dodgers their first in a full season since 1988.\n\n\"This is great for baseball,\" Kiermaier said. \"Two iconic organizations, two perennial powerhouses, teams that are always in the thick of it. It doesn’t get better than this.\n\n\"I play baseball, but I’m a fan of baseball. The amount of talent that’s going to be on the field for the next few weeks, it’s going to be must-see TV.\n\n\"It should be one hell of a Series. I can’t wait to see how it unfolds.\"\n\nThe World Series starts Friday night (8 p.m. ET, FS1) at Dodger Stadium, and when the two teams see each other and exchange pleasantries, they will share a deep appreciation knowing what it took to get there.\n\nThe two teams have been carrying a heavy burden with enormous expectations and pressure to win the World Series.\n\nNo one cares that the Yankees have been to the playoffs 25 times since 1995, or that they haven’t had a losing season since 1992.\n\nNo one cares that the Dodgers have been to the playoffs 12 consecutive years, winning four pennants.\n\nAll that matters is whether they won a World Series trophy at the end of the year.\n\nIt’s World Series or bust every year.\n\nIt’s life in New York and LA.\n\n“There’s a lot of pressure, a lot of expectations,\" said Muncy, who set a postseason record by reaching base 12 consecutive times. \"Especially this year when you’re talking about some of the names we have. It definitely played heavy.\"\n\nThe Dodgers, knocked out of the playoffs in the first round the past two years, knew that another first-round exit could have serious repercussions. There were people whose jobs were on the line.\n\n“We changed things about how we went about it this year,’’ Muncy said. “This year, it was very player-driven. The past couple of years, we kind of sat around waiting for the organization to tell us what we were going to do. They tried to do certain things. They wanted to up the intensity.\n\n\"This year, all of us players that have been here, we said: 'Hey, no. This is what we’re doing. We’re changing things up. This is what we want to do.'\"\n\nSo instead of letting their first-round bye become a hindrance because of the five off-days, they took advantage of the opportunity, hanging out together and bonding, asking their families to understand.\n\n\"Everyone stresses about having five days off,\" Muncy said. \"We said, 'This is a reward.' So we wanted to treat it as a reward. We had a lot of fun. So the biggest thing we all did was we were here as a group at the stadium, seven or eight hours a day, hanging out, getting closer, having fun, eating good food, talking about what we wanted to do.\n\n\"So instead of spending five days at home, we spent five days here at the field, and that brought us all together.\"\n\nIt was similar to the rallying cry they had in Atlanta in mid-September when they were told starter Tyler Glasnow was out for the season. The players openly wondered if it ended their World Series hopes. Manager Dave Roberts told them to quit feeling sorry for themselves, and if he believed in them, they should believe in one another.\n\n\"We were talking about a starting rotation that was supposed to have All-Stars, Hall of Famers, and that just didn’t happen,’’ Muncy said. \"When you’re talking about your ace that’s done for the year, that was a kick in the gut. You could tell everyone was down. It was like, 'Oh, man, not again.’\n\n\"Then we had a meeting, and it was: 'Guys, look around. We still have Hall of Famers in this room. We have guys that are getting paid a lot of money in this room. We can still do this.’\n\n\"Well, look at us now.\"\n\nThe bulk of the credit, says Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers' president of baseball operations, goes to Roberts. He held the team together when it seemed things were unraveling with all the devastating injuries, requiring the use of a franchise-record 40 pitchers.\n\n\"This is as determined of a group as any I’ve been around,\" Friedman said. \"The professionalism. The way they prepare. The way they complete. It’s a really special group.\n\n\"Beyond the talent, which is obvious, the passion to win was something that was so apparent during the year with the adversity we faced.\"\n\nRoberts, who watched his team score an NLCS record 46 runs, shouted to the sellout crowd of 52,674 while accepting the National League trophy: “I’ve never believed in a group of guys more than I believe in these guys. Most importantly, they believe in each other.\"\n\nNow, here they are, about to play the biggest Series of their lives, resurrecting memories of the ’81 World Series with Reggie Jackson, Dave Winfield, Goose Gossage, Fernando Valenzuela, Ron Cey, Steve Garvey and Tommy Lasorda.\n\n\"The whole world was hoping for this potential matchup, this showdown,\" Roberts said. \"I think it’s going to be great.\"\n\nNot just for the Dodgers.\n\nNot just for the Yankees.\n\nBut all of baseball.\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2020/11/09/jeff-luhnow-lawsuit-claims-firing-saved-astros-world-series-title/6226683002/", "title": "Jeff Luhnow lawsuit claims firing saved Astros' World Series title", "text": "Former Houston Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow filed a civil lawsuit Monday against his old team, alleging that Major League Baseball’s investigation into the sign-stealing scandal that cost him his job was a “negotiated resolution” between the league and Astros owner Jim Crane that ensured Luhnow would be fired and the team would retain its tainted 2017 World Series title.\n\nLuhnow received a one-year suspension from MLB on Jan. 13, upon conclusion of its investigation, and was fired later that day by Crane. Now, his suspension served, Luhnow is seeking the $22 million that remained on his contract from the franchise that, he claims in his legal filing, he “transformed from the worst team in Major League Baseball to one of the best in less than a decade.”\n\nMLB and the Astros both declined comment on the suit.\n\nLuhnow’s well-documented teardown and buildup of the Astros – who lost at least 106 games in three consecutive seasons, two under his watch beginning in 2012 – resulted in a 2017 World Series championship, three consecutive American League West titles and a 2019 AL pennant.\n\nLuhnow’s hyper-efficient management doctrine spread to other franchises and even to MLB’s central office. Yet Luhnow turned from visionary to villain just weeks after the 2019 World Series, when The Athletic first reported that the Astros’ 2017 championship was won while an elaborate and illegal electronic sign-stealing scandal was executed in the bowels of Minute Maid Park.\n\nExpert MLB daily picks: Unique MLB betting insights only at USA TODAY\n\nMLB’s investigation launched soon thereafter and found Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch failed to properly inform staff and players of league mandates against illegal sign-stealing. The league also claimed Luhnow, in acknowledging emails from lower-level staffers, had direct knowledge of the scheme – which involved illegally viewing a TV monitor and banging on a trash can to pass on opposing teams’ signs.\n\nFREE AGENCY PREVIEW: Ranking the 81 best players in the 2020-2021 class\n\nLuhnow’s lawsuit, filed in Harris County District Court, paints a different picture: That MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred and Crane – who hired Luhnow in December 2011 – reached an agreement that would absolve Crane of responsibility while ensuring Luhnow took the fall.\n\n“MLB’s ‘investigation,’ ’” Luhnow’s claim says, “actually was a negotiated resolution between Astros owner Jim Crane and MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred that enabled the team to keep its World Series championship, went to great lengths to exonerate Crane and scapegoated Luhnow for a sign-stealing scandal that he had no knowledge of and played no part in.”\n\nThe lawsuit provides no evidence of an agreement between Manfred and Crane to salvage the team's World Series title.\n\nLuhnow’s lawsuit comes days after Hinch – suspended and fired the same day as Luhnow – was hired to manage the Detroit Tigers. Additionally, the Boston Red Sox re-hired manager Alex Cora, with whom they parted ways two days after his role in the sign-stealing scandal as Astros bench coach was revealed.\n\nLuhnow’s future in the game is far murkier. His lawsuit, then, pulls few punches.\n\nIt insists that no credible evidence exists of Luhnow’s knowledge of the scheme, and that despite interviewing 68 witnesses and reviewing voluminous electronic communications, “produced only one untrustworthy source – the actual ringleader of the Astros’ sign-stealing schemes who ‘implicated’ Luhnow to save his own job.”\n\nThat would be Tom Koch-Weser, the team's director of advance information who remains employed by the club. Luhnow’s suit berates MLB for failing to reference, in its report, any of the 22,000 text messages sent and received by Koch-Weser – messages it claims do not reference Luhnow.\n\nThe suit claims the Astros told Koch-Weser he’d keep his job “so long as his actions were sanctioned by his supervisors, including Luhnow,” and that Koch-Weser’s testimony to MLB that Luhnow had knowledge of the scheme remain uncorroborated.\n\nLuhnow claims Manfred “ignored his findings that the players and video room staff – not the Astros’ front office – were responsible for the sign-stealing schemes. That is because the commissioner vetted potential penalties with Crane, and the two exchanged a series of proposals.”\n\nMLB fined Crane $5 million and stripped the club of four draft picks but allowed the Astros to retain their title.\n\n“I don’t think I should be held accountable,” Crane said in February, when Astros players apologized for their role in the scheme on the first day of spring training.\n\nCrane was certainly emboldened by MLB’s report, which noted that “our investigation revealed absolutely no evidence that Jim Crane, the owner of the Astros, was aware of any of the conduct described in this report. Crane is extraordinarily troubled and upset by the conduct of members of his organization, fully supported my investigation, and provided unfettered access to any and all information requested.”\n\nUltimately, Luhnow said he believes his termination was without cause; of the four conditions that would justify a firing with cause in Luhnow’s contract, it’s likely the Astros would contend Luhnow was fired for “any material failure or refusal of the Employee to follow the material, lawful instructions of the club relating to his duties.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2024/12/05/shohei-ohtani-contract-dodgers-world-series-exclusive/76771449007/", "title": "Exclusive: Shohei Ohtani on Dodgers' World Series title, $700 ...", "text": "In a city brimming with Hollywood stars, celebrities and wealth, one of the most celebrated and recognizable of them all is sitting in the green room at a Los Angeles production studio Wednesday afternoon, taking a break from a commercial shoot and reflecting on his momentous decision that rocked the sports world.\n\nIt was a year ago this week that Shohei Ohtani agreed to a historic 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the largest in sports history – and 64% more than the highest deal for a baseball player.\n\nIt was one of the most lucrative and franchise-altering contracts in baseball history, the gold standard for free agent outfielder Juan Soto and those who follow him for generations.\n\nIt instantly created a revenue stream to make the Dodgers the most profitable team in baseball, while sustaining a World Series championship-caliber team for the next decade.\n\nThe Dodgers not only won their first World Series in a full season since 1988 in Ohtani’s first year, but he also produced one of the greatest seasons in history with 54 homers and 59 stolen bases, unanimously winning the National League MVP award.

We won the World Series. What more can you ask for?\"\n\nThe Dodgers decline to say how much they added in corporate sponsorships, merchandising and ticket sales after signing Ohtani – with Japanese companies signing lucrative endorsement deals with the club – but industry estimates have hovered around $120 million.\n\n“I wanted organizations to understand and appreciate Shohei’s real value,\" Nez Balelo, Ohtani’s agent, told USA TODAY Sports. “For teams to justify that amount of money to sign him, you have to really capitalize on the off-the-field opportunities, his ability to attract sponsors and brands. And there’s a whole frenzy of memorabilia and novelty items. You had to quantify that as value.\n\n“There were teams that didn’t really see the vision we had, the attraction he would bring to an organization. If they didn’t get that part, we weren’t on the same page. ...\n\n“They either got it or didn’t. Clearly, the Dodgers got it. The Dodgers (front office) from Mark Walter to Stan Kasten to Andrew Friedman to Lon Rosen, they understood me from Day 1. They understood the value.\n\n“Look where it got them.\"\n\nSho-Time\n\nThe Dodgers will tell you they had enormous expectations when they signed Ohtani, but nothing quite prepared them for quite this extravaganza, with Japanese companies battling for advertising rights with the Dodgers.\n\n“I’ve been in this business for 40 years,\" said Lon Rosen, Dodgers executive vice president and chief marketing officer, “and he’s as popular as any athlete or celebrity I’ve ever seen. There are a lot of famous people in this country, but the impact he’s had is incredible. You can talk about Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, Kobe, Magic, this guy is in a place where very few have ever been.\n\n“He’s so popular in Japan that 80 to 90% of all Japanese tourists that come here will stop at Dodger Stadium.\"\n\nOhtani, 30, a national hero in Japan, tries to downplay his popularity. He’ll remind you that the Dodgers are filled with plenty of stars like Clayton Kershaw, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman.\n\n“It’s very humbling,\" Ohtani said. “Obviously, I appreciate it. I’m very thankful for what I have, just how everybody has been supportive of me. That being said, what I do doesn’t really change. I’m going to continue to focus on the sport of baseball and just try to get better each day, laying it all on the field and doing the best I can.\n\n“But at the same time, hopefully, the popularity of baseball continues to increase and baseball becomes more popular in different countries.\n\n“Hopefully, the growth of this sport will continue.\"\n\nThere’s a reason MLB chose the Dodgers to open the 2024 season in South Korea, and again in 2025 against the Chicago Cubs in Tokyo.\n\n“I can’t imagine the reception it will get,\" said Kasten, president and CEO of the Dodgers. “It should be one of the great, great spectacles in the history of baseball. Everyone wants to see Shohei.\"\n\nThe 2024 trip to Korea was largely overshadowed by the scandal and revelations that Ippei Mizuhara, Ohtani’s interpreter, had stolen $17 nearly million from the star's bank account to cover gambling debts. Ohtani was quickly cleared of all wrongdoing.\n\n“It was just a real learning experience,\" Rosen said. “He didn’t do anything wrong, someone did something terrible to him. Ippei was not just his interpreter, he was his manager. But even when that happened, he handled everything behind the scenes, and it never took away his focus on the team or on the field.\n\n“I still remember walking into the trainer’s room, right before he was going to speak about that to the rest of the world, we asked him if he was nervous. He said, 'Why would I be nervous? I didn’t do anything.’\n\n“He kept his focus the entire time. Really, he’s as focused as any athlete I’ve ever seen.\"\n\nThe $700 million man\n\nIt was no different than his negotiations as a free agent, always cool and never sweating the outcome.\n\nThe intensity of the pursuit to sign Ohtani is comparable to this winter's courting of Soto. The difference is that while there have been constant leaks throughout Soto's free agency, some designed simply to help create a bidding war, Ohtani and Balelo operated under the cloak of secrecy.\n\nOhtani and Balelo privately met with the Dodgers, San Francisco Giants and Toronto Blue Jays, but refused to divulge, or even confirm they traveled to meet with team officials. Balelo traveled alone and negotiated with other teams. The only time Balelo even spoke publicly during the entire negotiations was to refute an erroneous report that Ohtani was on a plane traveling to Toronto to sign a contract with the Blue Jays, and another saying the deal was already consummated.\n\n“I didn’t want what happened to create a frenzy in the country of Canada,\" Balelo said. “These are good people, quality people, and for the journalist to do what he did was so reckless. It hurt the organization, the fans of the organization, and the country of Canada.\n\n“Organizations we were still having discussions with reached out to me, and I said, 'No, I’m not on a plane to Toronto. Shohei is not on a plane to Toronto. We are here.’ The only organization that didn’t reach out to me was Toronto. They knew I wasn’t on a plane.\n\n“I felt really bad for the fans, the organization, and the country, because for a minute there, they all felt he was coming. That was the biggest disappointment in the process. Everything was so seamless, so good, and for that to happen.\"\n\nOne year later, Soto is enduring the same narrative. There were several erroneous reports on Thanksgiving that he already reached a deal with the Boston Red Sox. There have been reports that he was offered $660 million by the Red Sox before a proposal was exchanged. One day he’s signing with the Mets, the next the Yankees, and Blue Jays, too. The reports have all been vehemently denied by Scott Boras.\n\n“That’s why Shohei and I kept quiet,\" Balelo said. “I didn’t want speculation. I didn’t want the negotiations to go public. ... I didn’t want anything interfering with the discussions that I was having with the various organizations.\n\n“I didn’t want any speculation or rumors to affect the results of what we wanted to go. It’s just a healthy way to go about your business ... We ultimately wanted to control the narrative and wanted to control the results.\"\n\nOhtani and Balelo accomplished their goal when Balelo telephoned Friedman, Dodgers president of baseball operations, on Saturday morning, Dec. 9, to inform him that Ohtani had chosen the Dodgers. Friedman, who was watching his son’s soccer game in Anaheim, where Ohtani had played the first six years of his career for the Angels, was told that the news would soon be announced by Ohtani on his Instagram. Friedman quickly called Kasten, and minutes later, Ohtani let the world know of his decision.\n\n“Nez was completely truthful with us every step of the way,\" Kasten said. “There’s no reason for him not to have been. He could have driven the contract anyway he wanted. And I would have said that even if that plane going to Toronto was really carrying [Ohtani].\n\n“It was all very professional. He said, 'We want this done quietly. We don’t want it to be a circus.' So, it was professional, respectful and quiet from both sides.\"\n\nOhtani contract deferrals\n\nThe next uproar was the news that Ohtani was deferring $680 million of his $700 million without interest, paying him $68 million a year beginning in 2034, and it was completely Ohtani’s idea.\n\n“I remember when I first heard that from Andrew,\" Kasten said, “I said, 'Can you repeat that please?’ That was my honest reaction. Andrew says, 'Can we make that work?'\"\n\nThe way Ohtani saw it, he didn’t need the $70 million annual salary with his off-the-field endorsements. The savings, in turn, would permit the Dodgers to build around him. The deferrals reduced the Dodgers’ luxury tax commitment from $70 million to $46 million annually.\n\n“I don’t think we’ll ever see this type of unselfishness in an athlete to give up as much as he did,\" Balelo said. “It was a huge splash in the industry that’s never been done before to that level. It was very, very important to Shohei not to hamstring an organization. He just said, 'What would happen if we defer all or part of that salary? I’m fine financially.’\n\n“It was important to him to allow the Dodgers to ultimately be competitive year after year and go out and be able to sign players to bring together a championship-caliber team. That was really his ultimate goal here.\n\n“He had a vision, and that vision all came to fruition.\"\n\nThe Dodgers promptly went out and traded for starter Tyler Glashow and signed him to a five-year, $136.5 million contract extension, signed starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto one week later to a record 12-year, $325 million contract, and then signed free-agent outfielder Teoscar Hernandez to a one-year, $23.5 million deal.\n\n“It definitely was rewarding,\" Ohtani said. “You know, Mark, Andrew, the owners, we all made a promise to each other that we would go out and create the best team to put out on the field. And we were able to win the World Series, so in that sense we were able to keep our promise towards each other.\n\n“I know they’re renovating the field [$100 million on clubhouses] right now, putting in even more resources to sign possibly other players, so it was refreshing and rewarding to know that we all did our part to help the Dodgers win the World Series.\"\n\nIt’s why Ohtani insisted on the first key man clause by a player in baseball history, enabling him to opt out of his contract if Walter ever left the ownership group or Friedman departed. It’s the only opt-out language in Ohtani’s deal.\n\n“When you sit down with people and you form a bond and a partnership,\" Balelo said, “it’s important that you keep the band together. If the band falls apart, at least you have options. We felt like it was important to say that as long as everyone stays together, we’re all in.’’\n\nThe Dodgers not only are staying together, but they’re doing everything possible to assure they’re not a one-hit platinum record, signing free-agent starter Blake Snell to a five-year, $182 million contract and infielder/outfielder Tommy Edman to a five-year, $74 million extension. The two even followed Ohtani’s lead by deferring $91 million, with the Dodgers now having $1.006 billion in deferrals from 2028-2046.\n\n“Nobody is getting off free,\" Kasten said. There’s nothing mysterious about it. We were doing deferrals since the ‘70s in the NBA. The only thing unique was the amount.\"\n\nYet, without the deferrals, who knows if the Dodgers are able to still build a championship around him.\n\n“He wants to be the most amazing baseball player in the history of the world,\" Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly told the LA Times during the postseason. “How do you do that? You win World Series. And how do you win World Series? You help figure out how to make the club that much better.\n\n“He made the club that much better when he came to that decision.”\n\nNine more years\n\nOhtani, the first player in history to hit 50 homers and steal 50 bases in a season, could even have a bigger impact as a two-way player again in 2025. He underwent elbow surgery in September 2023, rehabbed all season, and even after dislocating his left shoulder during the World Series, says he should be ready to pitch again in April.\n\n“So far, so good,\" Ohtani said in English. “Everything is going well.\"\n\nOhtani, of course, didn’t sign with the Dodgers to win just one World Series. He has nine years left on his contract, and nine more fingers for rings.\n\nHe never experienced a playoff game with the Angels in his six years, but now after spending the entire month of October in the postseason, he’s addicted to playing on baseball’s biggest stage.\n\n“The Dodgers had a lot of success and were making the playoffs almost every year,\" Ohtani said. “Obviously, I was on the Angels, and looking from the outside, it looked like it was easy for the Dodgers to make the playoffs. But when you’re part of the team, it was actually really grinding and a big struggle just to make the playoffs. The Padres were making a big push at the end, and then to fend them off, it was a tough experience.\n\n“But it was very special, very emotional, I really enjoyed it.\"\n\nThe feeling, of course, is quite mutual. The Dodgers are the best team in baseball. They have the biggest star in the sport. And they have a partnership that should make them deliriously happy for as long as Ohtani wears a Dodger uniform.\n\n“This guy is all in on everything,\" Rosen said. “He’s sending out recruiting videos to players. He came to our gala. He came to our fanfest. He’s great with sponsors. I recommended that he have his dog, Decoy, be part of his bobblehead night. So what does Shohei do? He trains Decoy to bring out the first pitch.\n\n“I got a front-row seat with Magic Johnson, and saw the respect his teammates and the entire league had for him, and this is just like it. He has not only made an impact on the Dodgers, but every team in baseball.\n\n“We knew he’d be popular with us, but, oh, is he special.\"\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale\n\nWORLD SERIES CHAMPION DODGERS: Celebrate with this commemorative coffee table book!\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.

The two iconic franchises have not met in the Fall Classic since 1981, and plenty of big-name stars like Aaron Judge, Juan Soto, Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts add sizzle to the proceedings.\n\nYet for fans of middle-class Major League Baseball clubs, who don’t enjoy the large payrolls of these coastal elites, the World Series might prove a dispiriting point: That championships can be bought, that their efforts to compete are futile when faced with the big boys’ big bucks.\n\nWith that, USA TODAY Sports takes a look at the dollars and sense of this 120th World Series:\n\nDo the Yankees and Dodgers have the two highest payrolls?\n\nNot exactly. There are various methods to calculate payroll, and myriad sources to cite, but the undisputed No. 1 by any methodology are the New York Mets.\n\nExpert MLB daily picks: Unique MLB betting insights only at USA TODAY\n\nSteve Cohen’s team was a significant disappointment for much of the season, until catching fire in mid-summer and making it all the way to Game 6 of the National League Championship Series. You might say he finally got what he paid for: The Mets ranked No. 1 in preseason payroll ($305.6 million, per USA TODAY Sports), end-of-season allocations ($317.7 million, per Spotrac) and projected competitive balance tax payroll ($356.2 million, per Cot’s Baseball Contracts).\n\nA large chunk of the Mets’ expenditures is dead money, with the club covering more than $50 million of salary for pitchers Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer, both traded in 2023.\n\nYet the Yankees and Dodgers are right behind: The Yankees were No. 2 preseason ($303.3 million) and the Dodgers No. 3 ($249.8 million), while they flipped spots for the luxury tax – or CBT – payroll, the Dodgers at $351.7 million, the Yankees at $314.8 million, per Cots.\n\nIs Shohei Ohtani the highest-paid player in the game?\n\nYes – kind of. His 10-year, $700 million contract easily sets records for both total value and average annual value. Yet the contract is so heavily deferred – Ohtani receives $2 million per season and will be paid $68 million annually from 2034 to 2043 – that the present-day value is far less. It’s calculated at $28 million for current payroll purposes and $46 million for CBT payroll.\n\nBut Ohtani will certainly enjoy a comfortable retirement – and as an international superstar, earns well north of $50 million annually in endorsement income.\n\nDoes that make Aaron Judge the highest-paid player in 2024?\n\nJust about. His nine-year, $360 million contract pays him an even $40 million per year. In 2024, that was a tad less than Verlander and Scherzer, who made $43.3 million. And next year, it will be just shy of Philadelphia ace Zack Wheeler’s $42 million as he begins a three-year, $126 million extension.\n\nJudge’s salary was also matched by Texas right-hander Jacob deGrom, who made $40 million this year and also in 2025, before dropping down to $38 million in ’26. While ace pitchers are in such rare supply that Judge’s single-year salary might get superseded, his average annual value stays right at the top.\n\nFor now.\n\nWill Juan Soto make more than Aaron Judge?\n\nAlmost certainly, which seems mildly blasphemous given Judge’s two MVPs to Soto’s none. Yet Judge was 30 when he re-signed with the Yankees coming off an MVP season in 2022.\n\nSoto is just 25 – he turns 26 on Friday, Game 1 of the World Series – and has maintained a largely MVP-caliber level of production since he was 20 and leading the Washington Nationals to the 2019 World Series title.\n\nSoto made $31 million this season in his final year of arbitration eligibility. Once he hits the open market – with the Yankees still a decent bet to re-sign him – he will likely land a guarantee north of $500 million.\n\nIn other words, somewhere between Judge and Ohtani.\n\nHow many $100 million men do the Dodgers and Yankees have?\n\nIf there’s one thing that separates high-revenue teams from others, it’s the willingness to throw around a nine-figure contract and believe it won’t sink you should it go awry.\n\nThe best teams are both aggressive and wise in such expenditures, and the Yankees and Dodgers, with four and six nine-figure stars, respectively, are no different.\n\nAs such, the Yankees and Dodgers’ massive investments greatly impacted their seasons and into the playoffs:\n\nJudge (nine years, $360 million): 58 regular season home runs with a 1.159 OPS.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton (13 years, $325 million, with Marlins paying $30 million): Four homers, 1.222 OPS this postseason.\n\nGerrit Cole (nine years, $324 million): Yankees are 3-0 in his postseason starts after reigning Cy Young winner’s season delayed by elbow injury.\n\nCarlos Rodón (six years, $162 million): Started and won Game 1 of ALCS and also started clinching Game 5.\n\nOhtani (10 years, $700 million): The first 50-50 season in major league history, and a .934 OPS and 11 RBIs in 11 playoff games.\n\nBetts (12 years, $365 million): .863 OPS in season shortened by hand injury, but a .296/.404/.659 line with four homers this postseason.\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto (12 years, $325 million): 3.00 ERA in 18 starts, five shutout innings in NLCS Game 5.\n\nFreddie Freeman (six years, $162 million): 22 homers, .854 OPS, but slowed by ankle injury in playoffs.\n\nWill Smith (10 years, $140 million): 20 homers, 116 adjusted OPS, key homer in NLCS Game 6.\n\nTyler Glasnow (five years, $136 million): 3.49 ERA in 22 starts before elbow sprain shut him down.\n\nHow were the Yankees and Dodgers built?\n\nNot entirely through their trust funds. Of the 26 players on the Dodgers’ NLCS roster, seven were fully homegrown – drafted or signed and developed. Seven more were acquired in trade, largely using homegrown minor league assets. And four others – three members of their stout bullpen and slugger Max Muncy – were waiver claims.\n\nFour of their eight free agent acquisitions – old friend Kiké Hernández and relievers Ryan Brasier, Blake Treinen and Daniel Hudson – were hardly of the big-bucks variety.\n\nThe Yankees? Six homegrown players including three big ones: Judge, shortstop Anthony Volpe and starter Clarke Schmidt. Four were acquired through waivers and six via free agency but the bulk of the roster – 11 in all – came via trade.\n\nMany of those deals did involve flexing financial might, such as acquiring Stanton and the $265 million obligation that came from Miami with the slugger. A strong package of major league-ready players landed Soto and his $30.1 million due via arbitration. Yet there’s plenty of savvy in there, too – most notably rookie starter, Luis Gil, acquired from Minnesota for Jake Cave.\n\nIn short, there’s plenty of ways to dial up a championship roster. But a loose checkbook doesn’t hurt.\n\nWith money so key, do the same teams always win the World Series?\n\nNot at all. In the 23 seasons since the Yankees were the last team to repeat as World Series winners – claiming three consecutive championships and four in five years from 1996-2000 – 16 franchises have won the Fall Classic.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox won four titles (2004, 2007, 2013, 2018) in that span, the San Francisco Giants three (2010, 2012, 2014) and the Houston Astros (2017, 2022) and St. Louis Cardinals (2006, 2011) two each. The rest? A true mélange, from mid-market Kansas City to big bad Philly and quite stunningly, two teams from Chicago – the famously cursed Cubs and the White Sox, who broke up decades of ineptitude with a 2005 championship.\n\nDo fans prefer watching World Series involving lower-payroll teams?\n\nNot really. The 2023 World Series, pitting the Arizona Diamondbacks (21st in payroll) against the Texas Rangers, who had a top 10 payroll but had never won a championship in franchise history, was the lowest-rated Fall Classic in history.\n\nSo why all the griping?\n\nGood question. And there’s a pretty good chance those swearing off this big-bucks battle will find themselves sneaking a peek at it all.

As eye-popping as that valuation was, there were headlines speculating about how long it would be before Apple and its rivals topped $5 trillion.\n\nThe tech industry, already dominant, only seemed destined to grow even bigger at the start of this year. The spread of the Omicron variant suggested a continued pandemic-fueled demand for digital goods and services, which had buoyed many tech companies. Near 0% interest rates meant startups still had easy access to the funding that had fueled their high valuations and risky ventures.\n\nBut the year is ending on a much different note. A perfect storm of factors have forced a dizzying reality check for the once high-flying tech sector, making it one of the biggest losers of 2022.\n\nOver the course of the year, pandemic-era demand for many tech tools shifted; inflation soared; interest rates rose and fears of a looming recession weighed on consumer and advertiser spending, the latter of which makes up the core business of many household names in tech.\n\nThe result was a bloodbath unlike anything the tech industry has seen in the past decade. Tech stocks plunged, amid a broader market downturn. Tens of thousands of rank-and-file tech workers lost their livelihoods amid mass layoffs, both at tech giants like Amazon and Facebook-parent Meta as well as at smaller tech companies like Lyft, Peloton and Stripe. The crypto world all but imploded. And an entire industry known for burning cash on ambitious moonshots instead started shutting down projects and announcing cost-cutting efforts.\n\nEven the title of world’s richest man, which previously belonged to serial tech founder Elon Musk, ended up passing to Bernard Arnault, the chairman of French luxury goods giant LVMH, after Musk’s chaotic purchase of Twitter appeared to sour investors on his car company, Tesla.\n\nThe sharp shift in sentiment not only removed the air of invincibility for the industry; it also exposed some of its underlying myths. For years, Silicon Valley has held up its founders as visionaries who can see far into the future. But suddenly, many of its most prominent founders had to admit a harsh truth: they couldn’t even predict two years ahead.\n\nAs Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg put it in a memo to staff last month announcing the company would cut 11,000 employees: “Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.”\n\nHe was far from the only one in the industry caught off guard.\n\nSilicon Valley’s rude awakening\n\nWhen the pandemic upended the broader economy in early 2020, tech firms only seemed to grow bigger and more powerful as people were forced to live out their lives online. Facebook (now Meta) could afford to nearly double its headcount and make multi-billion-dollar bets on a future version of the internet dubbed the metaverse. Amazon similarly went on a hiring spree and doubled its fulfilment center footprint to meet the surge in online shopping demand.\n\n“At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth,” Zuckerberg wrote in his memo to staff last month. “Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments.”\n\nThen the market shifted.\n\nA person walking past the offices of Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, in King's Cross, London, on November 9. Meta has confirmed it plans to cut more than 11,000 jobs globally as part of a major restructuring of the tech giant. The cuts will reduce the size of the company's workforce by about 13 percent. Joshua Bratt/PA Images/Getty Images\n\n“People are terrible at predicting the future, and we always think that what’s happening now is going to happen forever,” Angela Lee, a professor at Columbia Business School who teaches venture capital, leadership, and strategy courses, told CNN. “But the reality is that the pandemic was a black swan event, and none of us knew what would happen going forward.”\n\nOne by one, the visionaries of Silicon Valley issued mea culpas. The founders of Stripe, Twitter and Facebook each took turns admitting they either grew their companies too quickly or were overly optimistic about pandemic-fueled growth in their sector.\n\n“We were much too optimistic about the internet economy’s near-term growth in 2022 and 2023 and underestimated both the likelihood and impact of a broader slowdown,” Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, wrote in a note to employees last month announcing 14% of the staff would be cut.\n\nIt wasn’t only a shift in consumers living their lives offline again that hurt the industry. The tech sector was particularly pummeled by the impacts of rising interest rates this year. Silicon Valley as a whole is arguably more sensitive to interest rate hikes than other industries, as many tech companies rely on easy access to funding to pursue their ambitious projects, typically before even turning a profit.\n\nIn a move to tame inflation, the Fed approved seven-straight rate hikes in 2022. Since the beginning of the year, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index shed more than 30% as of Dec. 21. By comparison, the Nasdaq soared more than 40% in 2020 and a further 20% in 2021. And the S&P 500’s Information Technology sector shed more than 28% this year through Dec. 21, considerably higher than the broader S&P 500’s fall of just 19% over that same period.\n\nApple’s market cap now hovers just above $2 trillion. Amazon’s stock has shed some 50% year to date. And shares for Meta have been hit even harder, losing nearly two thirds of their value in 2022. Once a trillion-dollar business last year, Meta has since seen its market value drop below companies like Home Depot.\n\n‘Return to sanity’\n\nThe shift in sentiment for tech has also hit the next generation of companies that aspire to be household names.\n\nGlobal venture funding hit a nine quarter low of $74.5 billion in the third quarter of 2022, according to data from analytics firm CB Insights. This marked the largest quarterly percentage drop in a decade (34%), and a 58% decline from the investment peak reached in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nIn another sign of how this played out in the startup world: more than two new unicorns (startups valued at $1 billion or more) were born on average per business day in 2021, according separate data from CB Insights. That rate dropped to a pace of less than one new unicorn for every other business day in the third quarter of 2022, per CB Insights’ most recent analysis, the lowest since the first quarter of 2020.\n\nLee, who is also the founder of investing network 37 Angels, said when she met with tech founders this year, “I have said these words, which is, ‘I might have done this deal last year, but I am not going to do it now.’ And I’ve heard a lot of other people say that as well.”\n\nWhile the belt tightening might be painful for tech founders, Lee says she views it as a good thing for the tech industry overall. Many industry insiders have long said these sorts of corrections can help weed out some of the excess in the market and ensure more financially viable companies are the ones that survive.\n\n“Right now, there are like a lot of headlines that are just like, ‘The sky is falling, the end is near,’ and the way that I describe it is more of like a return to normalcy,” said Lee, noting that most charts tracking VC spending (from the number of mega-rounds to the number of IPOs) had a huge hump in 2020 and 2021 when interest rates were low, and now these charts are starting to look like how they did in 2019.\n\n“I would just call it like a ‘return to sanity,’ versus like, ‘the sky is falling,’” Lee said. “I do not think venture is cratering, or the tech industry is cratering as an industry.”\n\nBut for now, at least, there appears to be no end in sight to the pain for Silicon Valley and those who work in it.\n\nIn his own memo acknowledging job cuts at Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy said the layoffs at Amazon, reported to total some 10,000 roles, would continue into 2023. At a conference last month, he called the earlier hiring spree a “lesson” for everybody.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/01/05/china-stocks-shanghai-wall-street/78302892/", "title": "Shanghai stock shock eases", "text": "Hannah Gardner\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nBEJING Chinese stocks had a far-reaching effect again Tuesday -- this time a positive one -- as a mixed showing there helped global markets recover from the thumping they suffered on Monday.\n\nA day after a 7.0% plunge in the combined CSI300 index triggered new circuit breakers and a nationwide halt to trading in China that in turn sent global markets reeling, the CSI300 closed up 0.3% and the Shanghai Composite index lost just 0.3%.\n\nThe meager showing was enough to calm the shock waves the Chinese sent through other markets on Monday.

CEOs, portfolio managers, politicians, news pundits, second cousins and even Cardi B are sounding the alarm: Hear ye! Hear ye! Economic downturn awaits all who dare enter 2023!\n\nBut those predictions contradict the slew of positive economic data we’ve seen: The job market is healthy, wages are growing, Americans are spending and GDP is strong. Business is also good: Companies are largely beating revenue expectations and reporting positive earnings results.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s regimen of painful interest rate hikes meant to tame persistent inflation could certainly cool the economy — as could events in Eastern Europe and China — but the economy has been able to successfully endure nearly a year of hikes and war in Ukraine with barely a dent.\n\nIt’s possible that recession chatter is just that. Chatter.\n\nWhat’s happening: No one would ever accuse investors of shying away from their emotions: Passions run high on trading floors where feelings are often as valid as facts and fear and greed can sometimes run the show. Economists, on the other hand, are a data-dependent, stoic bunch. The US economy is not Wall Street, and market downturns are not recessions — but sometimes they get jumbled together in the public eye and their borders become hazy.\n\nThat appears to be the case: The Fed’s attempts to tamp down sky-high inflation are having an outsized impact on markets — the S&P 500 is down about 18% so far this year — but there has so far been little impact on the US economy as a whole.\n\nThis week, a number of top executives warned of an economic slowdown in 2023. CEOs from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, General Motors, Walmart, United and Union Pacific all said they were making plans for less-profitable times ahead. But hidden behind those “CEO PREDICTS RECESSION” headlines lies a lot of uncertainty.\n\nRising interest rates and geopolitical chaos are pointing towards storm clouds on the horizon, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC on Tuesday: “When you look out forward, those things may well derail the economy and cause this mild-to-hard recession that people are worried about.” When pressed to predict what was coming, he deflected. “It could be a hurricane. We simply don’t know,” he said. What was left unsaid was that sunny days are also a possibility.\n\nFeedback loop: United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby also told CNBC on Tuesday that “we’re probably going to have a mild recession induced by the Fed.” He then went on to say that demand in his industry is higher than ever and United entered the fourth quarter with profit margins near all-time highs. He doesn’t see any indication of a slowdown on the horizon, either.\n\nSo why does he think a recession is coming? “If I didn’t watch CNBC in the morning, the word ‘recession’ wouldn’t be in my vocabulary,” he said. “You just can’t see it in our data.”\n\nIt’s almost as though Kirby predicted recession was imminent because other prominent voices predicted that recession was imminent. And it’s possible that we’re all stuck in a feedback loop that amplifies unjustified fear.\n\nProphecies are often self-fulfilling. If CEOs believe recession is coming, they preemptively batten down the hatches — and that means less spending and more layoffs, which in turn can trigger an economic downturn.\n\nGoldman CEO David Solomon said Tuesday that the bank may soon terminate staff and exercise caution with its financial resources due to the mounting economic uncertainty. Morgan Stanley will reportedly slash its workforce by about 1,600 people, roughly 2% of the total.\n\nThe upside: Some parts of Wall Street seem to be avoiding the recession fervor. ​​A recent study by Goldman Sachs found that smart money is betting on a soft landing. Money managers have been favoring industrial and commodity stocks that are sensitive to economic downturns. Stocks that act as a buffer during economic downturns like consumer staples and utilities have fallen out of favor at investment funds with assets totaling almost $5 trillion, Goldman strategists found.\n\n“Current sector tilts are consistent with positioning for a soft landing,” they wrote.\n\nOil plunges below $75 for the first time in a year\n\nOil prices have tumbled to their lowest level since Christmas as worries about the health of the economy weigh on crude, overshadowing concerns about new restrictions imposed on Russian energy, reports my colleague Matt Egan.\n\nBrent crude, the world benchmark, lost nearly 3% on Thursday to around $77.45 a barrel.\n\nThe oil selloff comes after the West hit Russia with new restrictions that, so far at least, do not appear to be derailing global energy markets.\n\nThe European Union on Monday imposed a ban on seaborne oil imports from Russia, while the West placed a $60 cap on Russian oil. Both moves are designed to hurt Russia’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine, without hurting consumers by causing Moscow to slash oil production.\n\n“Russia oil is still on the market. As of now, it appears Russia is willing to play ball,” said Robert Yawger, vice president of oil futures at Mizuho Securities.\n\nThe tame reaction from energy markets is a welcome gift for Americans heading on long drives this holiday season, as prices at the gas pump are expected to continue their recent plunge.\n\nUS oil this week hit its lowest level since December 23, 2021, before recovering a little on Thursday to trade up 2% at $73.60 a barrel. That leaves oil down by 43% since briefly topping $130 a barrel in March amid fears about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe national average price for regular gasoline dipped by three cents to $3.33 a gallon on Thursday, according to AAA. Gas prices have dropped 14 cents in the past week and 47 cents in a month. The national average is a cent lower than a year ago when they averaged $3.34 a gallon.\n\nUK strikes to hit ambulance services, hospitals, trains in runup to Christmas\n\nBritain is bracing for further disruption from strikes heading into the Christmas period, as ambulance drivers and nurses join rail operators and postal workers in the worst wave of walkouts the country has endured for at least a decade, reports my colleague Hanna Ziady.\n\nMore than 20,000 ambulance workers, including paramedics and call handlers, are expected to strike on December 21 in a dispute over pay, according to statements from labor unions GMB, Unison and Unite.\n\nThe strike will involve just under half of all ambulance drivers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, although unions have said they will cover life-threatening emergencies during the walkouts. More than 10,000 ambulance workers represented by the GMB Union will strike again on December 28.\n\nStrikes have swept the United Kingdom this year, as workers grapple with a cost-of-living crisis and stagnating wages. Consumer prices rose by 11.1% in the year to October, a 41-year high. Once inflation is taken into account, average wages fell by the biggest drop on record earlier this year, and were still declining in the June-September period.\n\nAccording to The Times newspaper, one million UK workers are set to strike in December and January. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows Britain has already lost at least 741,000 days to strike action this year, putting it on track for its worst year of labor disputes in at least a decade.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/08/27/nvidia-earnings-report/85853126007/", "title": "Did Nvidia beat earnings?

For all of last year, U.S. employers added 4.8 million jobs, second most behind the 7.3 million added in 2021.\n\nFood recall: More than 400 food items in nine states recalled over potential listeria contamination\n\nAnd unemployment fell to a 54-year low of 3.4% in January.\n\n“That means we have created more jobs in two years than any (four-year) presidential term, than any time, in two years,” Biden said Friday.\n\nBiden deserves credit for spearheading the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which further juiced the economy as the U.S. was still emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2021, Faucher says.\n\nBut the massive job gains can also be traced to the nation’s 22 million job losses in the spring of 2020 during the pandemic's early days. Businesses such as restaurants, bars, shops, and hotels laid off so many workers they had lots of room for a comeback as Americans resumed dining out, traveling and other activities.\n\nInflation rate is slowing\n\nAnnual inflation eased to 6.5% in December from 7.1% the previous month and a 40-year high of 9.1% in June.\n\nEconomists largely cite easing supply chain bottlenecks and product shortages, as well as the declining price of commodities such as oil, corn, and wheat amid global recession fears.\n\nYet Biden gets kudos for drawing down 180 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when gasoline prices were topping out at a record $5 a gallon in June, Faucher says.\n\n“We did see energy prices start to descend after the president decided” to tap the reserve, he says.\n\nConsumer spending has held up\n\nConsumer spending slowed last year after a sizzling 2021. But it still grew a solid 2.8% despite soaring inflation and the Fed's largest bump in interest rates in four decades, which was aimed at damping household outlays to curb price increases.\n\nFaucher partly credits Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which sent $1,400 checks to most individuals in March 2021. COVID-19 stimulus checks, which began under the Trump administration, along with savings amassed during COVID-19 lockdowns, bolstered Americans’ pandemic-related cash reserves to $2.6 trillion.\n\nTheir finances, though, already were in good shape. Household debt was at a historically low 9.7% of disposable personal income in the third quarter.\n\nBusiness investment has been solid\n\nBusiness spending on computers, factory machines, trucks, and other goods was also solid last year, growing 3.6%, despite rising interest rates as companies responded to healthy consumer demand.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nInflation is still high\n\nAlthough inflation has eased to 6.5%, that’s still the highest level since 1982, excluding the current bout of price run-ups that began in spring 2021.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has noted that while goods price increases have moderated, lowering inflation for the long term will mean slowing wage growth in service industries such as health and education – which could be a thornier challenge.\n\nIf Biden gets praise for giving consumers a financial cushion, he also gets some blame for contributing to inflation in the first place with the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, Faucher says. The extra cash, he says, helped set off a consumer spending spree that likely contributed to inflation, along with the supply troubles and high commodity prices.\n\nHousing market is in a deep slump\n\nIn December, the number of homes that builders started to construct fell for the fourth straight month and existing home sales declined for the 11th consecutive month to the lowest level since 2010.\n\nEconomists trace the slump to Fed rate increases that drove up mortgage rates from 3% in early 2022 to 7% before a recent pullback to 6.1%. The Fed’s hiking campaign was triggered by high inflation spurred partly by Biden’s stimulus bill.\n\nHome prices, meanwhile, likely have peaked and economists expect declines of up to 15% this year.\n\nLess housing construction means fewer jobs for workers and less investment in the economy. And lower home prices reduce household wealth, hurting consumer spending.\n\nManufacturing is contracting\n\nHigh-interest rates have similarly hurt manufacturing as businesses buy goods when borrowing costs are high.\n\nManufacturing activity declined for a third straight month in January.\n\nPart of the reason for the industry's troubles is unrelated to Biden's policies. As the pandemic eased, consumers who bought TVs, appliances, and furniture while stuck at home during the pandemic have shifted their purchases to services such as traveling and going to the theater.\n\nMost economists say a recession is likely\n\nAlthough consumer spending and business investment grew solidly in 2022, they began to weaken late last year as inflation and Fed rate hikes took a growing toll. Most economists expect a mild recession this year, according to those surveyed by Wolters Kluwer Blue Chip Economic Indicators.\n\nAfter the nation’s gross domestic product grew 2.8% in 2022 – based on averaging the four quarters –— Faucher expects GDP to be flat this year as the nation loses about 2 million jobs.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2018/01/09/amazons-jeff-bezos-now-richest-all-time-sort/1017247001/", "title": "Jeff Bezos is now the richest of all time — sort of", "text": "Robert Frank\n\nCNBC\n\nJeff Bezos' fortune has topped $105 billion, leading to a flood of headlines about the Amazon founder being \"the richest man of all time.\"\n\n\n\nBy one measure, this is true. Bill Gates had been the richest man ever, with a fortune that topped $100 billion in 1999. So in simple dollar terms, Bezos is now richer. And while some say Vladamir Putin is probably richer, we have no way of knowing since his wealth is kept secret.\n\n\n\nBut wealth is all relative. In inflation-adjusted terms, and as a share of a national economy, Bezos still has a ways to go to be the richest man in history.\n\n\n\nLet's start with Gates' fortune. In 1999, he became the first person to have 11 zeros. But $100 billion isn't what it used to be. If you adjust for inflation, Gate's $100 billion fortune in 1999 would be worth about $147 billion today. So in inflation-adjusted terms, Bezos is still about $42 billion short of passing Gates.\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller is often called the richest American ever, since he was the first billionaire. His fortune was estimated at $1.5 billion in 1918, which in inflation-adjusted terms would be about $24 billion today.\n\n\n\nThat doesn't sound like much. But relative to the economy, $1.5 billion meant a lot more in 1918.\n\nAside from adjusting for inflation, fortunes can also be measured as a share of national GDP. And by that measure, Rockefeller's fortune was the equivalent of nearly 2% of total U.S. economic output at the time. To have the same share today, with a U.S. GDP of over $18 trillion, Bezos would need to be worth over $350 billion.\n\n\n\nHistorians often say that Augustus Caesar was the richest in relative economic terms, since he ran an empire that accounted for more than a quarter of the global economy at the time. And some say Caesar's fortune was equal to about 20% of his empire's economy. That would be the equivalent of nearly $5 trillion today.\n\n\n\nSo Bezos is the richest in pure dollar terms. But while Amazon may be out to rule the world, Bezos still has trillions to go before he can truly claim to have conquered history's rich list.\n\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

If inventory continues to rise at its current pace, there will likely be more opportunities for buyers to negotiate.”\n\nHow did Hurricane Ian play into the many new listings?\n\nA factor contributing to the significant rise in new listings this October was the need for many homeowners to postpone listing their properties for sale last October until damage from Hurricane Ian could be repaired, according to Realtors.\n\nAnd while there will be more to choose from for seasonal returnees to purchase, they may not immediately jump right in locally with their checkbooks since some of them haven't been able to sell their northern places in markets that largely haven't been as strong, real estate agents said.\n\nWhat is the housing forecast for 2024?\n\nHowever, some strong economic indicators bode well, with National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun forecasting a 13.5% rise in national 2024 home sales.\n\nAs in previous quarters, the economy's annual growth rate continues to handily beat economists’ expectations, with a 5% expansion in the most recent third quarter, propelled heavily by consumer spending. Sellers of new housing will also benefit next year thanks to the economy, according to RCLCO Real Estate Consulting, which tracks stats.\n\n\"The strength of market demand for new homes tends to move in sync with job growth and the overall economy, so its worth noting that U.S. job growth has continued at surprisingly healthy levels much of this year,\" Gregg Logan, RCLCO managing director, said this week. \"Strong demographic fundamentals and expected stronger job growth suggest new home sales could accelerate further by mid to late 2024 or early 2025.\"\n\nWhat are 'stronger' economic indicators going into next year?\n\nManufacturing as a whole has added nearly 900,000 jobs in just over the past two years, employing the most workers since 2008, as other sectors also have been climbing and unemployment hit its lowest point this year in more than a half-century, national data shows.\n\nA surprise to some, the economy has seldom been stronger, according to a new Los Angeles Times report, which analyzed federal data and info from University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics in the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy: The country has gotten richer the past two years, and for the first time since before the Great Recession, income distribution has become a bit more equal as the biggest gains have gone to low-wage workers.\n\n“There’s this disjunction between reality and perception that’s as large as I’ve ever seen in my career,” Wolfers said, noting the \"difficult\" pandemic year of 2020 played a role in that. “If you’d fallen asleep in 2019 and woke up in 2023, you would discover pretty much the sort of economy you would have expected, (and) in fact, we've got a stronger economy than we had when we went into it.\"\n\nIn analytic company WalletHub’s Consumer Spending Report released Thursday, it found Americans spent $18.86 trillion in October, the most ever for a month in the nation's history.\n\nWhat did Lee-based Royal Palm's housing do in October?\n\nCompared to October 2022's 1,368, Lee County-based Royal Palm Coast Realtor Association had an 86.4% increase in October new listings to 2,550. The median closed price of homes for Royal Palm during October decreased 0.3% to $358,950 from $360,000.\n\nOverall closed sales in October increased 18.5% to 1,106, as compared to a year ago's 933 total.\n\nFor October, days on market increased 50% to 36 days from 24. Overall, the percent of list price received has decreased 0.7% from 97.1% a year ago to 96.5% now.\n\nWhat is median price for NABOR houses in the Naples area?\n\nThe Naples Area Board of Realtors, also known as NABOR, had a 31.8% increase in October new listings to 1,231 from 934 in October 2022. The report also showed the median closed price of homes in Naples during October increased 4.5% to $580,000 from $555,000 in October 2022.\n\nOverall closed sales in October decreased 12.8$ to 594 closed sales from 681 closed sales in October 2022.\n\nWhat is the most expensive house sold in Collier County?\n\nFor October, days on market increased 36.6% to 56 days from 41. The percent of list price received has decreased 2.7% and 3.5% in the single-family and condominium market over the past 12 months, respectively.\n\nOctober's most expensive single-family dwelling in Collier sold for $12.2 million at 146 Myrtle Road, Naples, after being listed at $14 million, according to Royal Shell Real Estate. The 7,238-square-foot house built in 2021 that has 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms sat on the market for 137 days.\n\nBased at the Naples Daily News, Columnist Phil Fernandez (pfernandez@gannett.com) grew up in Southwest Florida.

It's perhaps the most boring financial news out there, given that many market watchers expected just what the Fed delivered.\n\nAnd now the natural question is: What's next?\n\nOne rate cut won't solve anyone's financial woes. The expectation, though, is that economic conditions could give the Federal Reserve more room to cut rates possibly two more times from here this year.\n\nOn Sept.17, the Fed cut short-term rates to a target range of at 4% to 4.25%. We learned that the Fed board's decision wasn't unanimous.\n\n\"Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,\" according to the Fed's statement, and also noted that \"downside risks to employment have risen.\"\n\nTrump's Fed battle creates odd cloud over meeting\n\nIf the rate cut is rather dull, the political dance at the Fed certainly wouldn't nab anything lower than a 9 on \"Dancing with the Stars.\"\n\nThe riveting tango at the Fed created by President Donald Trump's push to dominate the central bank continues to provide its own quirky twists and turns.\n\nThe September meeting's highlights include the addition of new Fed governor Stephen Miran, a White House adviser who was nominated by Trump, confirmed by the Senate and sworn in Sept. 16 before the meeting began.\n\nNot surprisingly, Miran wanted a more aggressive rate cut and was the lone vote against the Fed's action. Miran, according to the Fed's statement, preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by half a percentage point at the September meeting.\n\nThe embattled Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, who has filed a lawsuit against Trump for attempting to fire her, was able to take part in the September meeting.\n\nLate Sept. 15, a federal appeals court issued an emergency ruling that allowed Cook to remain for now as she fights Trump's unprecedented action for firing a Fed governor. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, was appointed to a 14-year term but Trump maintains he has the right to fire her over allegations of mortgage fraud.\n\nAnd the headline bombshells continue in the who-did-what-when mortgage dustups. On Wednesday, Sept. 17, before the Fed rate decision was announced, Bloomberg reported a situation that suggests a double standard in the Trump administration.\n\nThe allegations against Cook involve her reportedly claiming a \"primary residence\" on different mortgage documents for a home in Ann Arbor and a condo in Atlanta. The mortgage documents were taken out at two different credit unions within weeks of each other in 2021. Trump called her actions “deceitful and potentially criminal conduct.”\n\nAccording to the Sept. 17 Bloomberg report, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent once made similar claims that two of his homes were his \"principal residence\" on mortgage documents in 2007.\n\nBessent — who media reports say threatened to punch Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, in the face at a private dinner in early September — took out mortgages on a Georgian manor in Bedford Hills, New York, that would be his “principal residence” over the next year. According to Bloomberg, on the same day, Bessent made the same residency pledge about a beachfront house in Provincetown, Massachusetts.\n\n\"But there’s no sign of any wrongdoing on his part, mortgage experts say. Rather, his case demonstrates that an incongruity in home-loan filings isn’t necessarily proof of fraud,\" according to Bloomberg.\n\nBessent’s lender, according to Bloomberg, appears to have not expected him to occupy both homes as primary residences. \"Cook’s situation appears similar,\" Bloomberg stated.\n\nReuters reported earlier that Cook declared her Atlanta property as a \"vacation home\" on some forms.\n\nBloomberg notes that Bessent’s mortgages were signed by his lawyer, while Cook signed her own documents. Bessent was a hedge fund manager at the time; Cook was a Michigan State University professor of economics and international relations when she applied for her two mortgages.\n\nThe bigger picture here: Any growing power by the White House over the independent central bank ultimately could rattle markets. Thus far, Wall Street is taking much in stride.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading at 46,142.11 shortly before 2:30 p.m. after the Fed's no-news decision. The Dow had gained 384.21 points or 0.84% in trading.\n\nHow many more rate cuts can we expect?\n\nTrump would have liked a half-point cut on Sept. 17; he got a quarter point. But more rate cuts could be ahead.\n\nThe Fed could initiate a quarter-point cut at its next meeting Oct. 28 and Oct. 29 and another quarter-point cut at its last meeting this year on Dec. 9 and Dec. 10, according to Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst for Bankrate.com.\n\nIn 2026, he said, \"rates could drift downward further, or the Fed might pause.\"\n\nBill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Dallas, said Comerica is tentatively forecasting for the Fed to hold rates steady in October and make another quarter percentage point cut in December.\n\n\"But if the Fed surprises, it will be by cutting more aggressively,\" he said.\n\nMore aggressive action, Adams said, could end up mirroring the rate cuts that the Fed initiated at its last three meetings in 2024, when the Fed ultimately reduced rates by a full percentage point.\n\n\"The Fed is pulled in opposite directions by rising inflation on the one hand and weak hiring on the other,\" Adams said.\n\nHiring is likely to pick up for a variety of reasons, he said, including that provisions in One Big Beautiful Bill Act that will drive up spending on defense and immigration enforcement.\n\nTax cuts in the bill will help many people when they file their tax returns next year — including retirees and many affluent households who pay high state and local taxes — giving both consumer spending and possibly hiring a shot in the arm.\n\nOn the inflation front, Adams said higher tariffs put pressure on profit margins and can lead to price hikes on many goods. The risk that inflation hangs around is elevated since inflation expectations could be up, Adams said.\n\n\"The Fed understands that fiscal policy will be more supportive of economic growth in 2026 and will incorporate that into their outlook for job growth and inflation,\" Adams said.\n\nWhat's next for credit card rates?\n\nThe Fed's rate cut is welcome news for many borrowers. But it's important to realize that the impact will be modest initially when it comes to what this all means for your money.\n\nCredit card rates are directly influenced by any moves that the Federal Reserve makes when it comes to cutting or raising the federal funds rate.\n\nRight now, the average credit card rate is 20.12%, down from 20.79% in August 2024, according to Bankrate.com.\n\nAll things being equal, a quarter-point cut only brings that average rate down to 19.87%.\n\nSome people making minimum monthly payments, Rossman said, might only save $1 a month in interest now if they're carrying a balance of nearly $6,500.\n\nMore rate cuts — if the Fed continues to move in that direction — would mean more savings in the months ahead.\n\nThe best way to save money is to pay down as much credit card debt as possible. Try to maintain a high credit score by paying down debt, make payments on time and do not load up debt anywhere close to the maximum available line of credit. One guideline: Keep outstanding debt on each of your credit cards below 30% of the available line of credit.\n\nWhat does the Fed rate cut mean for mortgage rates?\n\nAnyone having trouble selling a home right now might hope that the Fed's latest action will send the 30-year mortgage rate tumbling.\n\nBut mortgage rates aren't pegged directly to the short-term federal funds rate, which the Federal Reserve sets at its policy meetings.\n\nThe trend for mortgage rates will depend on activity in the 10-year U.S. Treasury market, which serves as the benchmark for mortgages and other long term rates.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage soared in the 7% range through much of January and even had been as high as 6.89% in late May, according to data from Freddie Mac's primary mortgage market survey.\n\nRates have fallen already. The 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate averaged 6.35% as of Sept. 11, down from 6.5% the prior week but still up from 6.2% a year ago.\n\nRossman maintains the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate could fall below 6% by early next year — the first time we've seen that level since summer 2022. But much will depend on the outlook for inflation.\n\n\"The wind is blowing in the direction of lower interest rates, particularly the short-term rate set by the Fed,\" Rossman said, \"but there's still a lot of uncertainty regarding long-term rates.\"\n\nLenders reported that would-be homebuyers hesitated more this spring in light of higher rates, economic uncertainty and tariffs. But some relief might be in sight.\n\nPontiac-based United Wholesale Mortgage has seen a significant increase in loan volume across the board, particularly with 30-year fixed mortgages, as rates have fallen, according to Alex Elezaj, UWM's chief strategy officer, said in a statement.\n\n\"We expect this momentum will continue to build,\" Elezaj said in a statement.\n\nSavers will need to shop even more for higher rates\n\nInterest rates on savings could go down a tad from here. Right now, the average rate on a one-year certificate of deposit is 2% — or nearly where it was at a year ago when the average was 2.06%, according to data from Bankrate.com.\n\nSpecial rate deals will be offered by banks that want to get more of your business. Shop around for higher rates. The highest two-year CD yield is 4.10% in mid-September, roughly double the national average, Rossman said.\n\nCD rates could fall further, especially if the Fed continues on a rate-cutting path.\n\n“Fed rate cuts are great for people with debt, but they stink for savers,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree’s chief consumer finance analyst.\n\nSavers can lock in some higher rates by opting for a longer-term CD, such as a five-year CD. But Schulz warns that savers should take into account when they’ll need the money in that CD because the early withdrawal penalties for CDs can be substantial.\n\nWhat's next for auto loans?\n\nOddly enough, auto loan rates could be trending somewhat up, not down, initially.\n\nJonathan Smoke, chief economist for Cox Automotive, told the Detroit Free Press on Sept. 17 that given the strong sales in July and August, the car and truck supply has tightened.\n\n\"As a result of tighter supply, incentives have declined,\" Smoke said, \"including fewer low or zero rate offers.\"\n\n\"And that is a factor we are seeing driving average new loan rates up in September even as longer bond yields have declined with expectations of a Fed rate cut,\" Smoke said.\n\nSofter car sales tend to encourage automakers to offer lower promotional rates on some makes and models to move cars and trucks off the lot. But stronger sales tend to put a lid on attractive promotional rates.\n\nAnd a consumer's credit score matters a great deal right now, as lenders grow more concerned about economic uncertainty ahead and a borrower's financial ability to repay that loan.\n\n\"For a car buyer, a good credit score matters far more than any Fed decision,\" Smoke wrote in late July. He indicated that 0% financing rates started returning earlier this summer, but typically only buyers with stellar credit qualified.\n\nJuly saw a higher share of new loans with 0% interest rates than any month over the last three years, Smoke said. The shift followed very low levels of 0% offers in the spring, when the tariff-induced buying frenzy drained the supply of new cars and trucks.\n\nNearly 7% of consumers financing new vehicle purchases at dealers in July locked in a 0% annual percentage rate, according to Cox Automotive.\n\nThe average new auto loan rate was 9.03% in July, which was down 31 basis points from June and lower year over year by 65 basis points, according to Cox Automotive.\n\nSome lenders, though, are offering better car loan rates than they did a year ago.\n\nNow, the average five-year rate for a new car or truck is 7.19% — that's down from 7.71% a year ago, according to Bankrate.com research. Bankrate's data is based on a survey of banks in large markets around the country, based on what is being offered directly to consumers with at least a 700 credit score. The data doesn't include dealer or manufacturer financing.\n\nThe auto loan rate that you end up with could be much higher or much lower than that average.\n\nVariables that influence what rate the consumer obtains include the lender, how much you need to finance, the length of the loan and overall economic conditions. Consumers should review their credit score first, and shop for a car loan, before heading to a dealership.\n\n\"Many consumers are on the sidelines waiting for a green light,\" said Jessica Caldwell, associate vice president and head of insights at Edmunds, in a statement.\n\n\"Signals like rate cuts or low-APR promotions can be the spark.\"\n\nShe noted that interest rates for both new and used vehicles remain above historic norms. A small rate cut won't dramatically slash monthly payments. \"But it does boost overall buyer sentiment,\" Caldwell said.\n\nIn general, Caldwell said window stickers have not been hit yet with a significant increase in new vehicle prices due to tariffs. But the possibility still looms and creates concern for shoppers who already cannot afford high prices on many cars and trucks.\n\nWhile some year-end deals and promotional rates will give shoppers a psychological boost, it remains essential to read the fine print. Many offers might be on four-year or five-year car loans when some consumers want six- or seven-year loans to reduce monthly payments.\n\nCaldwell told the Detroit Free Press that it's hard to predict next year's interest rates for new vehicle loans.\n\n\"Even if the Fed continues to lower rates, the biggest factor is automaker-subsidized loans — and given the current tariff situation, those subsidies seem unlikely, even with lower borrowing costs,\" Caldwell said.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

What that means.", "text": "This story was updated to add new information.\n\nWASHINGTON — In the end, the Fed decided to go big.\n\nThe Federal Reserve lowered its key interest rate by a hefty half percentage point Wednesday, moving ahead with its first rate cut in four years and cheering markets that expected an emphatic move amid a softening jobs picture.\n\nWith the slowing labor market posing a growing risk to the economic expansion, Fed officials opted for a bold approach to launch a projected flurry of rate cuts now that inflation is easing.\n\nBut the central bank forecast a total of just a half point in additional cuts the rest of the year, signaling officials don’t believe the job market is collapsing.\n\n“The (Fed) has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance,” the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. “The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Fed is attentive to the risks of both sides of its dual mandate.”\n\nFed officials also said “inflation has made further progress toward (their) 2% goal.”\n\nFed Governor Michelle Bowman was the lone dissenter, preferring a quarter-point cut.\n\nAt a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that job growth has slowed.\n\n\"Clearly, payroll job creation has moved down in the last few months and that bears watching,\" he said. \"The upside risks to inflation have really come down and the downside risks to employment have increased.\"\n\nBut he added the economy and job market are still on solid footing.\n\n\"Our intent with our policy move today is to keep it there,\" he said. \"The time to support the labor market is while it's strong, not when you start seeing layoffs... You can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind.\"\n\nIn a research note, Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist of Oxford Economics, said the Fed likely should have started lowering rates in July and Wednesdays' big cut was an attempt \"to get caught up.\" Powell told reporters officials may have started lowering rates in July if a report on unusually weak job growth that month had been available at the time.\n\n\"The September decision is a preemptive strike to increase the odds that the central bank can pull off a soft-landing\" in which the Fed's high rates bring down inflation without causing a recession, Sweet said.\n\nWhat is the current Fed interest rate?\n\nThe Fed’s decision lowers its benchmark short-term rate to a range of 4.75% to 5% from a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5%. The move is expected to ripple through the economy, providing the first dose of relief in years to Americans who have struggled with high borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, and auto and other loans.\n\nYet it also will trim bank savings account yields that finally have provided significant returns.\n\nAre interest rates expected to go down in 2024?\n\nBesides forecasting a dip in the federal funds rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% by year’s end, Fed policymakers penciled in the equivalent of four more quarter-point cuts next year and another two in 2026, according to their median estimate. That roadmap that would reduce the key rate to about 2.9% by the end of 2026.\n\nYet officials were divided, with nine looking for a smaller drop in rates by December, nine seeking a percentage point drop and one projecting a steeper drop. Powell said Fed officials can speed up or slow the pace of rate cuts depending on how the economy and inflation evolve.\n\nBefore the decision, futures markets correctly predicted the Fed would approve a half-point cut Wednesday. But they forecast a total 1.25 percentage points in reductions this year and officials’ median estimate fell a quarter point shy of that.\n\nThe economy has been sturdy, growing at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, giving the Fed another reason to whittle down rates at a measured pace. But the central bank Wednesday slightly downgraded its economic growth forecast for 2024. And it raised its estimate of the year-end unemployment rate while lowering its inflation projection.\n\nIn recent months, Fed policymakers have said they were drawing closer to reducing the fed funds rate now that risks to their mandates of stable prices and maximum employment have become more balanced. Some forecasters have said the rate already should be at a “neutral” level of less than 4% – which theoretically would neither spur nor slow the economy – and the Fed was behind the curve.\n\nThe Fed lifts rates to curb borrowing and economic activity to bring down inflation. It lowers rates to stimulate the economy and stave off, or propel the nation from, recession.\n\nIs inflation really going down?\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, the Fed hiked its key rate from near zero to subdue a pandemic-induced inflation spike. Annual inflation has fallen from a 40-year high of about 7% in mid-2022 to under 3% as COVID-19-related product and labor shortages have faded, according to the Fed’s preferred measure. But prices surged unexpectedly early this year, leading officials to put off long-awaited rate decreases.\n\nSince April, however, inflation has steadily drifted lower, boosting officials’ confidence that it’s headed sustainably to the Fed’s 2% goal. In July, a different inflation measure, the consumer price index, eased broadly but a core reading that excludes volatile food and energy items accelerated.\n\nBefore the Fed's announcement, some forecasters said that should have solidified a more modest quarter-point rate cut Wednesday. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, though, has been tamer. Barclays estimates a report later this month will show it fell from to 2.2% in August from 2.5% the previous month while the core measure ticked up to 2.7% as goods prices fell while the cost of services such as rent and health care marched higher.\n\nIs the job market weakening?\n\nMeanwhile, a job market that was sizzling as recently as last year has been wobbling. Catch-up hiring following the health crisis has largely run its course, pandemic-related labor shortages have eased and many businesses have curtailed hiring and investment because of high borrowing costs.\n\nFrom June through August, average monthly job gains slowed to 116,000 from 211,000 the previous three months. And the unemployment rate rose from 3.7% in January to a still-low 4.2% last month. Job openings have tumbled to the lowest level since January 2021 and hiring has slid below prepandemic levels.\n\nSome economists have downplayed the rising unemployment rate. Noting that layoffs have remained low, they say it has been driven by a surge of immigrants into the labor force who haven’t yet found jobs.\n\nHow high will inflation be in 2024?\n\nFed officials estimated Wednesday their preferred measure of annual inflation, the personal consumption expenditures index, will fall from 2.5% to 2.3% by December, below the 2.6% they predicted in July.\n\nA core PCE inflation reading the Fed watches more closely is expected to hold stay at 2.6% by the end of the year, below the prior 2.8% estimate. It’s projected to drop to 2.2% by the end of next year.\n\nWill the job market get better?\n\nThe 4.2% unemployment rate is projected to end 2024 at 4.4%, above the July forecast of 4%, the Fed’s median estimate shows. The rate is expected to close out 2025 at 4.4%.\n\nHow is the US economy doing right now?\n\nThe Fed said it expects the economy to grow 2% this year, below its prior 2.1% estimate. It also predicts 2% growth in 2025.\n\nConsumer spending, which makes up 70% of economic activity, has been surprisingly resilient despite high interest rates and inflation. But low- and middle-income households are feeling the effects as they cope with record credit card debt and high delinquency rates. They have largely depleted their pandemic savings.\n\nWant to learn more? USA TODAY explains the news on interest rates.

But it was a big cut.\"\n\nJD Vance, Trump's running mate, during an appearance in North Carolina, said the rate cut won't mean much to people who have seen the cost of living rise in recent years: \"A half-a-point is nothing compared to what American families have been dealing with for the last three years.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nHarris welcomes rate cut, touts economic policies\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, said the rate cut is “welcome news,” but more work is necessary to bring prices down for consumers.\n\n“I know prices are still too high for many middle- and working-class families, and my top priority as president will be to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care, housing and groceries,” she said\n\nShe cited her plans to cut taxes for middle- and working-class people, ban corporate price gouging, and giving people assistance with down payments for buying a house.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nHow could the Fed decision affect international travel?\n\nAn interest rate cut typically means the value of the dollar abroad will go down, but travelers shouldn't worry too much about that scenario.\n\n“Exchange rates tend to adjust when a decline is expected,\" said Laura Veldkamp, a professor of economics and finance at Columbia Business School. \"The level of the exchange rate is set for people to not lose.”\n\n- Zach Wichter\n\nHow did the stock market react to the Fed meeting?\n\nThe stock market offered mixed signals as trading opened Wednesday, with stocks already buoyed on hopes the Fed would deliver its first interest rate cut in four years. U.S. stocks ticked up immediately after the Fed’s announcement before losing their gains. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq composite all ended the day down roughly 0.3%.\n\nAbout two-thirds of forecasters expected a half-point rate cut, while roughly one-third foresaw a more modest quarter-point cut.\n\nStock indexes have been trading at or near record highs in recent days, partly in expectation of Wednesday's rate cut.\n\n- Daniel de Visé, Bailey Schulz\n\nInterest rate cuts praised by lawmakers, but Republicans call it 'shamelessly political'\n\nPolicymakers and advocates took the opportunity to tie the rate change to the presidential election Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats and their allies praised the change, which they argued should have happened a while ago.\n\n\"This cut in interest rates is yet another acknowledgement that Powell waited too long to reduce rates,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on X. \"The Fed has finally changed course to follow its dual mandate on prices and jobs.\"\n\nAFL-CIO President Liz Schuler called the decision \"long overdue\" and said the decision \"provides a measure of relief to working people.\" She added the inflation rate has slowed over the last year \"as a result of Biden-Harris economic policies.\"\n\nSome Republicans argued that the Fed chose to cut rates right before the presidential election in order to benefit Democrats.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve claims political independence,\" Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., wrote on X. \"They could have waited to move rates until after the election to confirm it.\"\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., called it \"shamelessly political.\"\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., said in a statement that the Federal Reserve is \"finally\" lowering interest rates, \"even though prices are still 20 percent higher, paychecks are worth less, and more families are taking on credit card debt.\"\n\n\"Americans aren’t just looking for relief from high interest rates, they’re looking for relief from the same old failed Biden-Harris policies that crushed them to begin with,\" he said.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nWill credit card rates drop?\n\nYes: If interest rates drop, credit card rates will “almost certainly fall from record highs in coming months, (but) no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,” said Matt Schulz, credit analyst at online marketplace LendingTree.\n\nFor example, September’s average new credit card rate was 24.92%, unchanged from August and the highest figure since 2019, when LendingTree began tracking the data. If you have $5,000 of credit card debt at a 24.92% APR and are paying $250 per month, it will take you 27 months and $1,528 in interest to pay the balance off.\n\nBe aware, however, that financial institutions aren’t necessarily tying their annual percentage rate for credit cards to what the Fed does, said Daniel Milan, managing partner at advisory firm Cornerstone Financial Services.\n\n“They’re pegging their rates to their own risk,” Milan said. “If credit risk is increasing ‒ balances are up, defaults are up, and savings are down ‒ then we could see (Fed) rates go down and APR go up or stay about the same, because (banks) are inputting different data.”\n\nCredit card debt rose to a record $1.14 trillion between April and June, government data shows.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nWill consumers have better access to credit?\n\nWhile lenders in recent months have preferred less risky borrowers, the interest rate cut could open credit to more consumers, according to a note from Michele Raneri, vice president and head of U.S. research and consulting at TransUnion.\n\n\"It remains to be seen whether this interest rate reduction will see lenders once again offering credit to a larger segment of the consumer population, but it could help in that regard,” Raneri said.\n\n- Bailey Schulz\n\nWill a Fed cut help the housing market?\n\nHow much impact will a rate cut have on the housing market? Not a whole lot, experts think.\n\n“Rates have already come down a bit in expectation that the Fed will cut,” said Rick Sharga, CEO of CJ Patrick Company, a real estate consultancy.\n\nLast week, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage touched its lowest in over a year and a half, after falling steadily throughout 2024. At an average of 6.2%, that’s down sharply from the peak of 7.79% last October. The Fed doesn’t control mortgage rates, but they tend to follow the same trajectory as the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which does respond to central bank monetary policy changes.\n\nMortgage rates are likely to chart a “a gradual, steady decline” over the next year or so, Sharga said. Roughly 75% of all Americans with a home loan are paying 5% or less, and he thinks rates will have to decline to about that level before many homeowners can be induced to sell and move on.\n\nAffordability is hovering near all-time lows right now, Sharga notes, so “anything that lowers rates will be a boon.”\n\n- Andrea Riquier\n\nWhat will ‘unlock’ the housing market?\n\nMortgage rates are at the lowest in a year and a half – and nearly every American with a home loan still has a rate that’s lower.\n\nThe popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit a recent high of 7.79% in October 2023, according to Freddie Mac data, and was as low as 6.2% in the week preceding the Fed meeting. But a recent analysis from Redfin suggests 86% of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 6%.\n\nThat “lock-in” effect keeping many homeowners on the sidelines is very apparent in the Ponte Vedra area of Florida, where broker Mark Good runs Prime Properties of NE Florida.\n\nMany people are simply biding their time, Good thinks. “It’s a common misconception that the Fed changing their rates is going to cause rates to come down even further for mortgages,” he said. Some are holding out hope for a better deal, while many others simply can’t afford to give up the rate they have now. Others have expressed a desire to wait until after the November election.\n\nGood worries that it could take a while for lower rates to work their way through the market. “The public has to accept that rates are never going to get back to 3%.”\n\n- Andrea Riquier\n\nHas the U.S. achieved a 'soft landing'?\n\nIn a speech last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell explained why he believes federal regulators may have achieved a “soft landing,” meaning the Fed manages to tamp down the nation's inflation crisis without setting off a recession.\n\nThe pandemic set off the inflation spike as workers in factories, ports and warehouses were idled by COVID-19. At the same time, Americans hunkered down at home and, flush with stimulus checks, bought massive amounts of furniture, computers and other goods. Inflation, Powell said, was amplified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which drove up the price of energy and other commodities.\n\nBut eventually, those pandemic-induced distortions waned as the health crisis improved. Widespread labor shortages eased. And there were so many job openings – a record 12 million in March 2022 – that the labor market was able to rebalance itself.\n\nThe Fed, Powell said, played a key role. Its rate hikes succeeded in keeping inflation expectations “anchored,” or stable, despite the sharp rise in prices.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nWhat are some arguments for a quarter-point rate cut?\n\nSome economists expect a half-point interest rate cut from the Fed today. Others anticipate only a quarter-point reduction. As of midday Wednesday, forecasters are almost evenly split, with the half-point scenario holding a slight edge.\n\nBill Nelson, chief economist at Bank Policy Institute, predicts a quarter-point cut, because August's so-called core inflation rate \"surprised on the upside, most likely taking a 50-basis-point cut,\" or half a point, \"off the table.\" The core inflation rate excludes the volatile food and energy sectors.\n\nArnim Holzer, global macro strategist at Easterly EAB Risk Solutions, also expects a quarter-point cut, pointing to the strike at Boeing as instructive. \"The rejection of a 25% pay (over 4 years) increase is a headline that is hard to miss and shows inflation expectations are top of mind and likely to remain at a higher level,\" he wrote in a note.\n\n- Charisse Jones\n\nWhy would a half-point rate cut make sense?\n\nSome forecasters expect the Fed to cut interest rates by a quarter-point Wednesday. Most, however, expect a half-point reduction. The CME FedWatch forecast tracker favored a half-point cut by a 55-45 margin at midday. (Earlier Wednesday, forecasters rated the probability of a half-point reduction even higher.)\n\nMichael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J. P. Morgan, leans toward a half-point cut because \"downside employment risks are growing, and upside inflation risks are ebbing.\" But \"we don’t have full confidence that the (Fed) committee agrees just yet,\" he said.\n\nAt a conference in Singapore on Friday, former New York Fed President Bill Dudley said, \"I think there's a strong case\" for a half-point cut. Dudley thought the Fed should have lowered rates at its last meeting in July, \"so the question is: 'Why don't you just get started?'\"\n\n- Charisse Jones, Daniel de Visé\n\nWhat will be the Fed's focus at today's meeting?\n\nWith annual inflation easing to a more than three-year low in August, rising prices are now less of a concern for the Fed. Instead, the panel has turned its focus to the other half of is dual mandate: maximum employment.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell offered these words in an August speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming: “The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability.”\n\nSince that speech, the labor market has continued to show signs of cooling. August saw a smaller-than-expected payrolls gain and sharp downward revisions to employment figures for the previous two months. The report cemented forecasts the Fed would cut rates Wednesday to keep the job market buoyant, but the size of the cut remains a mystery.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nWhen is the last time the Fed cut rates?\n\nIt seems a lifetime ago, but the last time the Federal Reserve cut interest rates was in March 2020, at the dawn of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Fed unleashed much of its arsenal that month to combat the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus, cutting short-term interest rates to zero, pumping cash into the financial system and encouraging more bank loans to households and businesses.\n\nThe moves, cheered by then-President Donald Trump, were aimed at combating a recession, which forecasters considered likely.\n\nThat month, central bank policymakers agreed to lower the Fed’s benchmark federal funds rate by a full percentage point, to a range of zero to 0.25%. And that would be the last pandemic-era rate cut.\n\n- Daniel de Visé, Paul Davidson\n\nWhy would the Fed decrease interest rates?\n\nThe central bank reduces interest rates to trim consumer and business borrowing costs, jolting a weak economy or propelling it from recession. It raises rates, or keeps them higher for longer, to dampen growth and bring down inflation. Historic inflation drove the campaign of rate increases in 2022 and 2023, leaving the Fed's benchmark rate perched at a 23-year high.\n\nNearly every forecaster expects the Fed to cut rates Wednesday, but economists are split on how large the cut might be: one-quarter point, or half a point. With most Fed moves well telegraphed ahead of meetings, that point of uncertainty provides some rare drama.\n\n“It is a coin toss,” said Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nHow does the Fed interest rate work?\n\nInterest rates don’t magically reset when the Federal Reserve raises or lowers its benchmark federal funds rate.\n\nWhat, then, should consumers expect in the hours and days after an interest rate cut?\n\nWhen the Fed lowers rates, it reduces the interest commercial banks pay when they borrow and lend excess reserves to each other overnight, according to Investopedia.\n\nA Fed rate cut doesn’t immediately transform interest rates across the economy. Some types of interest rates take time to adjust. Others, including mortgage rates, have already been falling in anticipation of the Fed cutting rates this week. But many categories of loans react more or less instantaneously, experts say.\n\n“It normally happens the next day,” Nathan Rogge, CEO of First Pacific Bank, told Marketplace. “So, if it was a Wednesday, by Thursday, you would have a different interest rate.”\n\n- Daniel de Visé\n\nHow high is inflation?\n\nInflation, a sustained increase in prices throughout the economy, has been well above the 10-year median of 2.1% for more than three years. The Fed policymakers say they prefer a low and stable inflation rate, so they can \"make sound decisions regarding saving, borrowing and investment.\"\n\nInflation has fallen significantly in the past two years but remains elevated – largely because of housing costs. In August, the annual inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index fell to 2.5%, from 2.9% in July. The reading was the lowest since March 2021, a year before the Fed started pushing up interest rates.\n\n- Jim Sergent\n\nWhat can borrowers expect?\n\nIf the Fed cuts interest rates today, borrowers will likely see interest rates ease off their peaks on things like credit cards and auto loans, but they shouldn't expect any great immediate relief, analysts said.\n\nSeptember's average rate for new credit cards was 24.92%, unchanged from August and the highest since 2019, when LendingTree began tracking the data.\n\n\"While they’ll almost certainly fall from record highs in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree credit analyst. \"Barring the Fed unexpectedly stomping on the gas pedal when it comes to lowering rates, credit card APRs are still going to be high for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nThe same goes for rates on auto loans and other types of debt, he said.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nWhen is the next Fed meeting in 2024?\n\nAfter today’s meeting, the Federal Reserve has two more opportunities to consider interest rate moves in 2024.\n\nThe remaining Fed meetings planned for 2024 are scheduled for Nov. 6-7 and Dec. 17-18.\n\n- Medora Lee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/09/17/federal-reserve-september-rate-cut-live-updates/86178612007/", "title": "Fed announces quarter-point interest rate cut. What it means", "text": "After nine months of staying on the sidelines, the Federal Reserve on Sept. 17 announced a quarter-percentage-point cut, likely the first in a series of reductions to usher in lower borrowing rates for consumers.\n\nThe rate cut – the Fed’s first since late 2024 – lowers the Fed’s benchmark interest rate to a range of 4% to 4.25%. Officials signaled the possibility of two more rate cuts this year.\n\nTypically, the Fed hikes rates or keeps them steady to tame inflation. The central bank lowers rates to juice the economy. While the Fed previously held back on rate cuts due to inflation concerns, a series of disappointing jobs reports showed a weakening labor market. While there are signs that tariffs are starting to show up in consumer prices, Powell previously said a “reasonable base case” is that tariffs spur a one-time price shift rather than a more persistent inflationary effect.\n\n\"Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated,\" the Fed said in a Sept. 17 statement.\n\nNew Fed Governor Stephen Miran dissented, saying he preferred a half-percentage-point cut.\n\nIt was the first meeting to include Miran, President Donald Trump’s pick to fill a vacancy on the Federal Reserve board of governors. He was narrowly confirmed on Sept. 15. Fed Governor Lisa Cook also participated in the meeting after an appeals court gave her permission to continue her duties as she battles Trump’s move to fire her.\n\nIn a related action, the Board voted to approve a quarter percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 4.25%.\n\nHigher inflation likely here through 2028, according to Fed\n\nThe Fed is projecting inflation to be higher than previously expected by the end of next year, and says the economy is unlikely to return to the Fed's 2% target until 2028.\n\n\"We fully understand and appreciate that we need to remain fully committed to restoring 2% inflation on a sustained basis. And we will do that. At the same time, we've got to weigh the risk to the two goals,\" Powell said, adding that he believes the risks of higher and more persistent inflation have softened because the labor market is weakening and GDP has slowed.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nWall Street ends day mixed\n\nThe Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed lower in choppy trading on Wednesday, after the Fed cut interest rates by an expected 25 basis points and Powell cited the weak job market. The Dow closed higher after meandering during Powell's speech.\n\nThe cut was already priced in by investors, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nAccording to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 6.63 points, or 0.10%, to end at 6,600.13 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 73.10 points, or 0.33%, to 22,260.85. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 262.26 points, or 0.56%, to 46,012.75.\n\n– Reuters\n\nPowell watching FICO scores after 2-point drop\n\nDuring a press conference after the decision, Powell said he is watching FICO scores after the average score fell 2 points in 2025.\n\nHe said while he doesn’t think the September rate cut alone will have a visible effect on consumers’ credit, the stable prices, strong economy, and strong labor market the committee is targeting “should help” over time.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhat does the rate cut mean for mortgage rates?\n\nPowell said while the Fed’s rate decisions tend to impact mortgage rates, the Fed would likely need to launch “pretty big” rate changes for it to matter “a lot” for the housing sector.\n\n“There’s a deeper problem here, not a cyclical problem the Fed can address, and that’s pretty much a nationwide housing shortage,” Powell said, “A lot of places in the country just don't have enough housing for people.”\n\nHe added that achieving maximum employment and price stability – which can require higher interest rates – can promote a strong economy, which is “a good economy for housing.”\n\nThe average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.35% as of Sept. 11, according to Freddie Mac.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nAddressing a 'low firing, low hiring' job market\n\nPowell said the September rate cut presumably will be better for a “low firing, low hiring” labor market that is particularly challenging to navigate for recent college graduates, younger people, and minorities.\n\n“The concern is if you start to see layoffs, there won’t be a lot of hiring going on,” which would lead to higher unemployment, Powell added.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nPowell refuses to comment on Lisa Cook case\n\nPowell refused to comment on Fed Governor Lisa Cook’s legal battle with President Donald Trump over his move to fire her from the board.\n\n“I see it as a court case that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on,” Powell said.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nPowell says Fed continues to work independently\n\nDespite pressure to cut rates from President Donald Trump, Powell said the Fed will continue to work independent of politics.\n\n“It’s deeply in our culture to do our work based on the incoming data and never consider anything else,” Powell said.\n\nIf the FOMC made decisions based on political outcomes, Powell said “you would be able to tell” by the way he and other governors spoke about the committee’s decisions.\n\n“I don’t think we will ever get to that place,” Powell said. “(We’re) doing our work exactly as we always have now.”\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nPowell talks about tariffs' impact on labor market, inflation\n\nPowell said it’s “certainly possible” tariffs are driving the slowdown in the labor market, but immigration likely plays a bigger role.\n\n“There's very little growth, if any, in the supply of workers. And at the same time, demand for workers has also come down quite sharply,” Powell said.\n\nAs for inflation, Powell said “a reasonable base case” is that tariffs’ effects on inflation will be relatively short-lived. It’s the Fed’s job, he said, to make sure the one-time increase in prices doesn’t become an ongoing inflation problem.\n\n“We have begun to see goods prices showing through into higher inflation. And actually, the increase in goods prices accounts for most of the increase in inflation, or perhaps all of the increase in inflation, over the course of this year,” Powell said, adding that the effects so far are small but are expected to build over the course of the year and into 2026.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nPowell says Fed is committed to independence\n\nPowell kept his response short when asked about whether the recent appointment of Miran, who has ties to the executive branch, would compromise the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics.\n\n\"The committee remains united in pursuing our dual mandate goals,\" Powell said. \"We're strongly committed to maintaining our independence, and beyond that, I really don't have anything to share.\"\n\nMiran said he would take an unpaid leave of absence from his role as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers while serving on the Fed's board of governors.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nWhat did the dot plot reveal?\n\nNine Fed officials went with a rate between 3.5% and 3.75% for 2025. One went with a rate between 2.75% and 3.0%. Six went with a rate between 4.0% and 4.25%.\n\nEstimates for 2026, 2027, 2028, and the longer run all show members estimating lower rates under 4.0%.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhat time is the Fed news conference today?\n\nFed Chair Powell is expected to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time, shortly after the Fed's September decision is announced at 2 p.m.\n\nYou can watch through this link.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nWhy did the Fed stop cutting interest rates?\n\nThe Fed began to hike interest rates in 2022 to cool rapid inflation, which hit a peak of 9.1% that June. Rates rose from nearly 0% to a two-decade high of 5.25% to 5.5% in July 2023.\n\nThe Fed began to trim rates in 2024 as inflation cooled, but has so far this year held rates steady as officials waited to see how Trump’s tariffs impact consumer prices.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nWill there be more rate cuts in 2026?\n\nThe Fed is set to release its quarterly dot plot, which outlines where officials believe interest rates will move next.\n\nThe estimates “will be closely scrutinized,” Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic wrote in a note, “particularly to see” if the median interest rate estimate still calls for two quarter-point cuts by year's end.\n\nEconomists are split on whether the Fed will cut rates two or three times this year, according to a Bloomberg survey.\n\nThe Fed could also shift its predictions for 2026. Last quarter, Fed officials projected just one quarter-point cut for the year. Bostjancic expects that to double to a total of 50 basis points cut, while the bond market is pricing in cuts totaling 75 basis points.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nAre any Fed officials expected to dissent?\n\nWhile most economists expect a quarter-point reduction in September, some Fed officials may push for a more aggressive rate cut.\n\nGovernors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, Trump appointees who dissented for a cut in July, as well as newly appointed Stephen Miran could dissent for at least a half percentage point cut, according to a note from economist Michael Feroli of JP Morgan.\n\nThere’s also a chance a regional Fed president or two vote for steady rates, according to a Sept. 12 note from Deutsche Bank Research economists, who say the decision is “unlikely to be unanimous.”\n\nThe meeting has the potential to be the first with three dissenting governors since 1988.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nJobs market shows signs of weakness\n\nThe U.S. economy added a disappointing 22,000 jobs in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate hit 4.3%, the highest level since October 2021, while revisions show the economy shed 13,000 jobs in June, the first month of job losses since December 2020.\n\nOther reports also suggest the jobs market is weakening. The jobs report for July revealed gains for the previous two months were revised down by an eye-popping 258,000. Another report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics published Sept. 9 showed firms hired nearly a million fewer workers than previously estimated in the 12-month period ending in March.\n\nTrump ordered the firing of U.S. Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer shortly after the weak July jobs report was published, accusing her without evidence of manipulating the data.\n\n– Bailey Schulz, Andrea Riquier\n\nHow high is inflation?\n\nConsumer prices accelerated modestly in August at 2.9%, according to the Labor Department, while core inflation ‒ which excludes more volatile items like food and energy ‒ held steady at 3.1%.\n\nWhile inflation has cooled significantly since its 2022 peak of 9.1%, it remains above the Fed’s 2% target.\n\n– Bailey Schulz, Andrea Riquier\n\nUS stocks ahead of Fed decision\n\nWall Street's main indexes opened subdued on Sept. 17 ahead of the Fed's widely anticipated decision.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.47% Wednesday morning, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.38% and the benchmark S&P 500 was down 0.094%.\n\nThe Fed meeting will be a test of Wall Street's recent rally, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hitting record highs in the last six sessions, boosted by rate-cut expectations and revived enthusiasm around AI-stock-linked trading.\n\nInvestors say the resumption of Fed rate cuts can add to Wall Street's rally, though such a boost would depend on whether lower interest rates could help the U.S. economy avoid a downturn.\n\n– Reuters, Bailey Schulz\n\nHow are tariffs affecting the Fed's rate decisions?\n\nTariffs pose a challenge to the Fed because they are expected to both increase consumer prices and curb growth, leaving the Fed torn between its dual mandate to support stable prices and maximum employment. Recent reports indicate the labor market is weakening while inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target.\n\nRecent economic data “pushes the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) into an uncomfortable position,” Scott Anderson, BMO Capital Markets’ chief U.S. economist, said in a Sept. 11 note.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nHow much is the Fed expected to cut?\n\nThe CME FedWatch tool suggests a 94% chance of a quarter percentage point cut in September and 6% chance of a half percentage point cut from the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\nFed funds futures markets are betting on three rate cuts total this year. More than 40% of economists in a recent Bloomberg survey agree, although the survey's median respondent anticipates just two. Those respondents were divided on whether the second would happen in October or December.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nIs Lisa Cook at the Fed meeting?\n\nAn appeals court on Sept. 15 ruled that Fed Governor Lisa Cook can carry on her duties as she battles President Donald Trump's attempt to remove her from the central bank in court.\n\nThe Trump administration has accused Cook of committing mortgage fraud by claiming two properties as her primary residence, and says this allows Trump to fire Cook “for cause.” Cook has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime.\n\nRecent reporting by Reuters showed Cook has claimed her second property as a vacation home, and appears to counter the documents cited by Cook's critics.\n\nTrump's unprecedented move to fire Cook – the first Black woman on the Fed's board – has raised concerns over the central bank's independence from politics. Trump has demanded the Fed make aggressive rate cuts, and in August said he was expecting to soon have a majority of appointees on its board who would lower interest rates.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nWill Stephen Miran be at the Fed meeting?\n\nThe Senate on Sept. 15 confirmed President Donald Trump’s pick to join the Fed's board of governors, just one day ahead of the two-day rate decision meeting.\n\nStephen Miran, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, is set to fill the empty seat left by former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who stepped down from the role in August. Both he and Cook will cast votes at the September meeting.\n\nMiran’s appointment has spurred concerns over the Fed's independence from politics. Trump has demanded the Fed make aggressive rate cuts, and in August said he was expecting to soon have a majority of appointees on its board who would lower interest rates.\n\nMiran has maintained that he will be committed to preserving the Fed’s autonomy and told lawmakers he is \"very independently minded.\"\n\nBMO Capital Markets deputy chief economist Michael Gregory expects Miran to call for at least a half percentage point cut.\n\n“Amid the likely decision to cut rates by 25 bps (basis points), we’ll probably see at least one dissenting vote in favour of a larger reduction,” Gregory said in a Sept. 17 note.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nWhen was the last Fed rate cut?\n\nThe benchmark federal funds rate has remained unchanged at 4.25% to 4.5% since December, when the Fed last announced a quarter percentage point drop.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nWhy does the Fed adjust interest rates?\n\nThe Fed adjusts interest rates to support stable prices and maximum employment.\n\nWhen inflation is high, the Fed can raise rates to make borrowing more expensive and cool economic activity. When the labor market is weak, cutting rates can promote economic growth and hiring by making borrowing less expensive.\n\n– Bailey Schulz", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2025/10/30/mortgage-rates-jump-interest-rate-letdown/86991668007/", "title": "Mortgage rates jump amid interest rate cut uncertainty. What it ...", "text": "Mortgage rates climbed to the highest level since Oct. 9 amid disappointment a third consecutive rate cut in December may not materialize, analysts said.\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Oct. 29 lowered its short-term benchmark rate by a quarter point to 3.75%-4%.

Still, that's a far cry from the 91.1% probability a week earlier.\n\nMortgage rates, which were sitting near their lowest levels of the year heading into the meeting around 6.13%, rose to 6.27% right after Powell's comments. They rose further to 6.33% on Oct. 30.\n\n\"The tone of Chair Powell’s comments poured some cold water on hopes for a faster pace of cuts, coming in less friendly than anticipated and pushing yields modestly higher across the curve,\" said Jeff DerGurahian, chief investment officer and head economist at nonbank mortgage lender loanDepot.\n\nWas this deja vu?\n\nBefore the Fed lowered interest rates in September, mortgage rates fell to 6.13%, the lowest level in nearly a year in anticipation of a rate cut. After the Fed produced a 0.25-percentage point reduction, mortgage rates rose.\n\nSimilarly, even as the Fed cut rates by a point over several meetings in late 2024, mortgage rates moved in the opposite direction, rising nearly a point, according to online financial products marketplace Bankrate.\n\nWill mortgage rates drop again?\n\nMortgage rates may ease slightly to aroound 5.9% to 6.0%, BOK Financial predicted.\n\nCooler inflation and a slower labor maket could continue to support the potential for lower rates, but even if they don't fall, DerGurahian noted that mortgage rates still hover near annual lows.\n\nWhat does this mean for home buyers?\n\nAn expected dip in mortgage rates isn't likely enough to help house hunters much, analysts said.\n\n\"With over 80% of mortgages below 6%, the “lock-in effect” continues to constrain inventory and keep (home) prices elevated,\" BOK Financial said.\n\nFannie Mae projects 2026 home sales at 5.16 million, lower than earlier forecasts for 5.23 million, partly due to affordability issues.\n\nBut for those who already own a home, \"on the bright side, Wednesday’s cut will immediately lower HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) rates,\" DerGurahian said.\n\nA HELOC is a revolving line of credit secured by the equity in your home. It allows you to borrow funds as needed up to a specific limit and pay back what you use, plus interest.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

He said he still thought interest rates could be lower in \"nine to 12 months.\"\n\nRates on 30-year mortgages began escalating from historic lows in 2021 and reached a high of nearly 8% in late 2023. They have been entrenched between 6% and 7% for about a year, according to federal lender Freddie Mac.\n\nEconomists from U.S. Bank and financial services firm Bankrate said that before the April 2 tariff announcement, home mortgage rates had appeared likely to drop. But now, they say, it's unlikely there will be any decline soon.\n\nBankrate.com Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said that even if the Federal Reserve lowers its benchmark interest rate in the next few months, mortgage rates are unlikely to drop below 6% anytime soon “unless the economy rolls over.”\n\n“If the economy really slows, mortgage rates could fall, but that’s not the backdrop where most people are comfortable buying a house,” McBride said. “If we avoid a recession, mortgage rates are more likely than not to remain above 6% for the balance of the year.”\n\nJohn Hummel, U.S. Bank head of retail home lending, also had thought earlier this year that a rate drop was coming.\n\n\"We all stepped into 2025 thinking it would be a more favorable rate environment,\" Hummel said. \"It's been anything but that.\"\n\nWhy haven't rates fallen?\n\nMcBride shared Goolsbee's outlook earlier in the year that with stable employment and moderating prices and inflation, rates were likely to come down.\n\n\"I think that’s a very accurate assessment because with inflation moving closer to 2%, the economy growing, but slower, the labor market expanding, but slower, things would be set up nicely for the Fed to start taking the foot off the brake pedal, cutting short-term rates to a less-restrictive level,\" McBride said.\n\nBut then came Trump's fluctuating tariff policies, creating uncertainty for consumers and businesses.\n\n\"The reason they haven’t done that is because there’s a lot of uncertainty about what’s going to happen with inflation in the coming months due to tariffs,\" McBride said. \"So if it wasn’t for that, I would agree with him that interest rates would otherwise be poised to be coming down.\"\n\nHummel said U.S. Bank expected a 2025 average 30-year-mortgage rate of “about 5.8%.”\n\n\"I don’t think we ever anticipated something really low,\" he said. \"We just thought there would be a modest decline in rates and maybe we could find ourselves back below 6.5%.”\n\nHowever, \"In early January, we started realizing that we're looking at probably an average rate of anywhere from 6.5% to 6.8%, and we've been touching on 7%,\" he said.\n\nCould the Federal Reserve lower interest rates this year?\n\nThe Fed cut its benchmark rate by a combined total of 1 percentage point last year but so far in 2025 has made no further cuts.\n\nThat could change, Hummel said, noting encouraging signs for the economy. Iowa’s unemployment rate is below the national average and the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% over the last 12 months, close to the Fed's goal of keep inflation at 2%.\n\n“I think the Fed needs to start to see that come down and stay at a sustained level\" before it cuts rates more, Hummel said.\n\nU.S. Bank believes that the Fed may cut interest rates in the fourth quarter, he said, adding, “I think they’re being overly cautious.”\n\nMcBride is worried that with the turmoil surrounding the tariffs, interest rates will only fall if the economy is in a downturn.\n\n\"It’s been the single biggest factor in the economy in the past few months,\" McBride said of the tariffs. \"Businesses that have a lot of uncertainty, they don’t go out and hire a bunch of people. They don’t expand production. They don’t make investments. That in and of itself becomes an economic headwind.\"\n\nBy December, he said, the impact of tariffs could be clear and could set the stage for the Fed to cut rates, but ”we want the Fed to be cutting rates because inflation pressures have subsided. We don’t want the Fed cutting rates because the economy is rolling over.”\n\nHow strong are home sales?\n\nMeanwhile, despite the stalled interest rates, Des Moines metro home sales are up, rising 2.4% year over year in May, according to the Des Moines Area Association of Realtors. Nationally, home sales decreased 2% in April from the same month in 2024, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\"Pent-up housing demand continues to grow, though not realized,\" National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a news release. \"Any meaningful decline in mortgage rates will help release this demand.\"\n\nMortgage rates around 7% robbed homebuyers of one-third of their purchasing power as compared to December 2020, when the average 30-year mortgage rate hit a 30-year-low of 2.65%, McBride said.\n\n\"That in and of itself is akin to a 35% increase in home prices, which comes on top of very heady price appreciation,\" he said.\n\nNo matter what happen with interest rates, prospective home buyers should pay reduce their debts and save money, he said.\n\n\"Control what you can control,\" he said. \"Pay down debt. Boost your savings. Invest in yourself. Finish up that certification. Get that additional training that leads to the promotion or pay raise.\"\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nPhilip Joens covers retail and real estate for the Des Moines Register.

Alternatively, it could be a brief hiatus if inflation swiftly resumes a pullback and officials believe the President’s policies will modestly nudge up consumer prices.\n\n“In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the (Fed) will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,” the Fed said in a statement following a two-day meeting.\n\nThat mirrors the guidance Fed officials provided in December and signals “some patience” as they weigh further reductions in the key rate while navigating myriad economic and policy crosscurrents, according to Barclays.\n\nInflation broadly has eased since a pandemic-related surge but stayed elevated in recent months. The economy and job market have been remarkably resilient, though hiring has slowed substantially. And it’s unclear to what extent Trump will slap certain imports with tariffs and deport millions of immigrants who lack permanent legal status, and what the effects will be on the economy and inflation.\n\nIn its statement, the Fed removed its assertion in December that inflation “has made progress” toward the Fed’s 2% goal, simply noting that “inflation remains somewhat elevated.”\n\nIt also gave a nod to a job market that has picked up steam lately - with unemployment edging down to a historically low 4.1% - and doesn’t seem to need a boost from Fed rate cuts.\n\n“The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid,” the Fed said. That’s an upgrade from the previous statement that noted “labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.”\n\nNoting that inflation is still above the Fed's 2% goal while the economy and job market are strong, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters Wednesday, We don't need to be in a hurry to adjust\" interest rates.\n\nTrump accuses Fed, Powell of failing to stop inflation\n\nAfter Wednesday’s Fed meeting, President Trump accused the Fed and Powell of creating and failing to stop pandemic-era inflation, which has fallen but has yet to return to the Fed’s 2% goal.\n\nTrump, who appointed Powell as Fed chair in 2018, said he would lower inflation himself through various initiatives including energy production, American manufacturing and \"slashing regulation.\"\n\n“The Fed has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “Treasury is going to lead the effort to cut unnecessary Regulation, and will unleash lending for all American people and businesses.”\n\nThe president’s message also accused the Fed of being too focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and climate change.\n\nFed keeping an eye on Trump economic policy plans\n\nPowell said the Fed would be carefully watching the Trump administration’s new stance on tariffs, immigration, fiscal policy and regulatory policy but would not rush its response.\n\n\"The (Fed) is very much in the mode of waiting to see what policies are enacted,\" he said, adding there are many details about any tariffs that are unclear, including how they could affect consumer prices.\n\n“It's one thing to do that, to make assessments about what might happen and begin to think about what you might do in that case, but you don't act until you see much more than we see now,” he added.\n\nStock market reaction\n\nU.S. stocks fell after the Fed kept rates steady, as expected, but seemed to shift its view on inflation.\n\nBut while the Fed dropped its reference to inflation making “progress, Powell downplayed the change as a technical one and said recent inflation readings generally have been positive.\n\n“The market is already jumping on the omission of inflation progress from the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) statement as a hawkish signal,” or wanting to fight inflation, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. Doves are less concerned with inflation.\n\nThe S&P 500 ended the day down 0.5% at 6,039.31; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.31% to 44,713.52 and Nasdaq fell 0.5% to 19,632.32.\n\nPowell addresses Trump’s plan to 'demand' interest rate drop\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s comment last week that he would “demand interest rates drop immediately,” assuming oil prices soon fall, presumably lowering inflation, Powell declined to comment.\n\n“The public should be confident that we will continue to do our work as we have, focusing on using our tools to achieve our goals, and really keeping our heads down and doing our work,” Powell said, adding that he hasn't been in contact with Trump.\n\nPowell later reiterated that the Fed would continue to operate independently.\n\n\"That's always what we're going to do. And people should have confidence in that,\" he said.\n\nThe Fed’s decision comes nearly a week after he told the World Economic Forum he’ll “demand that interest rates drop immediately” after OPEC takes steps to lower oil prices. Such a move presumably would help push down inflation.\n\nTrump's remark set up a clash with Powell and the central bank, which is structured as an independent agency insulated from political influence so it can make decisions based on the best interests of the economy. Trump repeatedly badgered Powell to cut rates during his first term, though it didn’t appear to affect Fed moves.\n\nWhat causes the Fed to change interest rates?\n\nThe Fed raises interest rates or keeps them higher for longer to lower inflation by discouraging borrowing and economic activity. It cuts rates to juice a flagging economy or bring rates back to normal as inflation moderates.\n\nWhat is the current Fed interest rate?\n\nWednesday’s decision to hold the Fed’s benchmark short-term rate steady comes after officials reduced it by a total percentage point at three straight meetings late last year. That has lowered borrowing costs for credit cards, some mortgages and auto and other loans, and sparked a stock market rally. It also has pushed down bank savings yields that were finally generating healthy returns.\n\nIs inflation really going down?\n\nAfter raising the federal funds rate to a 23-year high to curb a pandemic-related price surge in 2022 and 2023, the Fed slashed it as its preferred annual inflation measure fell from 5.6% in early 2022 to 2.8% in November – still above its 2% goal.\n\nBut inflation has been stuck at that mark in recent months and economists predict a report Friday will reveal a similar figure. That has led Fed officials to predict fewer rate cuts and a pause at this week’s meeting even apart from Trump’s policies.\n\nMonthly cost increases, however, have been tamer and that should translate to milder annual price rises the first half of 2025 due to favorable comparisons with year-ago figures, Goldman Sachs said in a research note. That could give the Fed some leeway to cut rates again within months.\n\nWhat's the state of the job market?\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market heated up in December, with employers adding 256,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dipping. Hiring, however, has slipped below pre-pandemic levels and net job growth is robust chiefly because of low layoffs, possibly foreshadowing a slowdown.\n\nThe government this week is expected to report the economy grew close to a sturdy 3% annual rate in the fourth quarter and for all of 2024.\n\nHow many rate cuts are expected in 2025?\n\nEconomist Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics said the Fed could still agree to as many as three quarter point rate cuts this year, starting as soon as March, if inflation resumes its descent and the job market slows.\n\nFed Governor Chris Waller recently told CNBC he wouldn’t rule out a March rate cut. “As long as data comes in good on inflation, then I can certainly see cuts coming sooner than markets are pricing,” he said. He has said he doesn’t think tariffs will have a big impact on inflation.\n\nBoth Fed officials’ median estimate and futures markets forecast two rate cuts this year. Markets reckon the first will come in June.\n\nYet some Fed officials have said the recent high inflation readings suggest they should be cautious, especially in light of a solid economy that doesn’t appear to need the Fed’s help. Toss in tariffs that are likely to be passed along to consumers through higher prices and an immigration crackdown that shrinks the labor supply and could raise wages. Both policies could reignite inflation by the second half of the year, Barclays says.\n\nDeutsche Bank estimates 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would raise inflation nearly a percentage point to 3.7% by the end of the year. Additional duties on China could lift inflation further.\n\nAs a result, Barclays predicts just one rate cut this year in June while Deutsche Bank doesn’t foresee any. Even a pivot to rate hikes is possible, Barclays says, if Trump’s planned tax cuts rev up the economy while tariffs and deportations boost inflation expectations that drive inflation itself higher.\n\nOthers project small price bump from tariffs, saying say a drop in imports would strengthen the dollar, lowering import prices for Americans and at least partly offsetting the duties.\n\nUnder a worst-case scenario, tariffs and deportations could both goose inflation and reduce consumer spending and economic growth. That would present a thorny dilemma for the Fed - keep rates high to beat back inflation or lower them to jolt the economy.\n\nHow will Trump’s economic plans affect interest rates?\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s plans to cut taxes, impose hefty tariffs on imports and deport millions of immigrants who lack permanent legal status have generated an unusual level of uncertainty about the course of the economy, inflation and interest rates.\n\nUSA TODAY previously looked at various scenarios that could result from Trump's economic policies.\n\nIn one predicted scenario, his policies could modestly stoke inflation while the economy slows but posts solid growth. That could move the Fed to order two, or possibly three, rate cuts this year.\n\nOr, Trump’s initiatives could more emphatically reignite inflation while the economy grows sturdily or even heats up. That would probably mean fewer rate cuts from the Fed in 2025 -- perhaps none. It might even put rate hikes back in play, forecasters say.\n\nAnother possibility: Trump’s blueprint could drive inflation higher while also weakening the economy, an unusual tandem that would pose a vexing dilemma for the Fed: Cut? Hike? Stand pat?\n\nFed 'reviewing' Trump’s anti-DEI orders\n\nPowell at a 2021 conference said he believes the most successful organizations \"are often the ones that have a strong and persistent commitment to diversity and inclusion.”\n\nWednesday, Powell said he still believes that to be true, but the Fed is reviewing Trump’s executive order to end diversity and inclusion efforts in the federal government.\n\n“We are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,” he said.\n\nPowell addresses Fed staffing levels\n\nTesla CEO and Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk last month accused the Fed of being “absurdly overstaffed.”\n\nWhen asked for his thoughts, Powell said the Fed runs a “very careful budget process.”\n\n“We owe that to the public, and we believe we do that,” he said.\n\nWhy would the Fed stop cutting interest rates?\n\nThe Fed chose to reduce its benchmark interest rate three times at consecutive meetings in late 2024.\n\nWhy stop now?\n\nIf the Fed pauses in its downward path on interest rates, the regulatory pause will have lot to do with inflation. Consumer prices have continued to rise in recent months, albeit at a slower pace than in most of 2022 or 2023. The Fed’s perfect-world inflation target is an annual rate of 2%. The current inflation rate, as of December, is 2.9%. The figure represents a five-month high.\n\nEven as the Fed ordered the last of its 2024 rate cuts, at its December meeting, the panel forecast a significantly slower pace of cuts in 2025, citing lingering inflation and strong economic growth.\n\nIn that meeting, the Fed projected only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four they had envisioned in September.\n\nWill interest rates ever go down?\n\nThe Fed didn't budge on interest rates, which means American consumers may have to wait a while to see borrowing costs go down on, well, pretty much everything.\n\n“Anyone hoping for the Fed to ride in as the cavalry and rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email. “That's true whether you're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else. That means it is maybe more important than ever to get that high-interest debt under control.”\n\nThe average annual interest rate on a new credit card is 24.26%, LendingTree reports. That would be a prime example of high-interest debt.\n\nThe average interest rate on a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage is 6.65%, according to Zillow. Bankrate puts the national average at 7.05%. Either way, mortgage rates are much higher now than three or four years ago, when they sat near historic lows.\n\nWhy does the Fed raise or lower interest rates?\n\n\"Part of the mission Congress has given to the Federal Reserve is to keep prices stable. This means not letting prices rise or fall too quickly,” the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland says on its website.\n\nWhen inflation is running high, the Fed typically raises interest rates to slow the economy and bring inflation down. When inflation is too low, the Fed might lower interest rates to stimulate the economy and raise the inflation rate.\n\nThe central bank also lowers rates to stimulate a soft economy and job market, or just to give the economy some breathing room. That, economists say, is what the Fed has been doing over the past year.\n\nWhy did the Fed cut interest rates in 2024?\n\nThe Fed hiked interest rates to a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% to fight a historic inflation surge. After holding rates at that level through parts of 2023 and 2024, the Fed began lowering its benchmark rate in September, signaling that inflation was coming under control. The annual inflation rate has eased from a peak of 9.1% in mid-2022 to 2.9% in December: much lower, but still above the Fed’s 2% inflationary goal.\n\nA series of rate cuts brought the benchmark federal funds rate down a full percentage point between September and December 2024, to the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\n(This story has been updated with new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/09/14/fed-interest-rate-cut-september-preview/86065144007/", "title": "The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates. How low will it ...", "text": "After nine months of holding its key interest rate steady, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a rate cut after its two-day September meeting.\n\nThe central bank’s decision, to be announced Sept. 17, follows months of President Donald Trump browbeating Fed Chair Jerome Powell for lower rates. While Trump’s name-calling failed to sway the Fed, a string of disappointing job market reports may have been enough to finally do the trick.\n\n“The fourth month of sub-par employment performance signals a dramatic stall in hiring and fully supports the Fed starting rate cuts at the next meeting,” Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic said in a Sept. 5 note.\n\nThe \"real question now,\" she said, is how many rate cuts will follow.\n\nWhy would the Fed want to cut interest rates?\n\nThe Fed is tasked with maintaining maximum employment and low inflation.\n\nWhen the labor market is weak, cutting interest rates can make borrowing costs cheaper for businesses and consumers, which can juice the economy and promote hiring. When consumer prices are surging, the central bank can raise rates to cool economic activity and ease inflation.\n\nThe dilemma the Fed has faced this year is that tariffs are expected to both curb growth and raise consumer prices, leaving the central bank torn between its dual mandate.\n\nWhy is the Fed expected to cut rates now?\n\nThe U.S. economy added just 22,000 jobs in August as companies grapple with new trade, immigration and federal layoff policies, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate rose to the highest level since October 2021, and revisions revealed the United States shed 13,000 jobs in June, the first month of job losses since December 2020.\n\nThe findings follow a disappointing July report that revealed a dramatic downward revision for employment gains in May and June. Powell signaled that the Fed was open to rate cuts shortly after the report was released.\n\nAnother report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics published Sept. 9 showed firms hired nearly a million fewer workers than previously estimated in the 12-month period ending in March, offering the Fed yet another reason to cut rates, according to a note from BMO Capital Markets senior economist Sal Guatieri.\n\nBut isn't inflation still high?\n\nWhile inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, August inflation numbers likely weren’t high enough to prevent the Fed from cutting rates.\n\nConsumer prices accelerated modestly in August at 2.9%, according to the Labor Department, while core inflation ‒ which excludes more volatile categories like food and energy ‒ held steady at 3.1%.\n\nA rise in jobless claims “overshadows the importance of the inflation report” and “underscores that the labor market is losing steam and reinforces that the Fed needs to start cutting rates,” Bostjancic said in a recent note, adding that September will likely be the start of a series of rate cuts.\n\nThe jobs reports were revised down: What does it say about the economy?\n\nWhy has the Fed held rates steady?\n\nThe Fed has been reluctant to cut rates since late 2024, opting instead for a “wait-and-see\" approach to parse out how Trump’s tariffs will impact consumer prices.\n\nWhile Powell in August said tariffs’ effects on prices are “now clearly visible,\" a “reasonable base case” is that they result in a one-time price bump with relatively short-lived effects. Meanwhile, he warned the downside risks to employment are rising.\n\n“In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, and risks to employment to the downside – a challenging situation,” he said during a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. “When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate.”\n\nWill the Fed cut interest rates in September?\n\nInvestors are betting on a rate cut this month, with CME's FedWatch tool suggesting a roughly 96% chance for a 25 basis point cut ‒ or 0.25 percentage point ‒ and 4% chance for a 0.5 percentage point cut as of Friday. The Fed’s key interest rate is currently in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\nUnless Fed officials believe the economy is heading into a recession without an aggressive rate cut in September, \"the possibility of a 50 bp (basis point) cut in September may be off the table,\" Raymond James Chief Economist Eugenio Aleman said in a note.\n\nSome Fed officials may push for more aggressive cuts at the September meeting, according to a note from economist Michael Feroli of JP Morgan. Republican Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, who dissented for a cut in July, could dissent for a 0.5 percentage point cut. Stephen Miran, who appears to be on track to be confirmed by the Senate before the meeting, could also dissent for a larger cut, according to Feroli.\n\nDeutsche Bank Research economist Matthew Luzzetti said there's also a chance \"a regional Fed president or two\" vote for no change to the policy rate.\n\n\"This decision is unlikely to be unanimous,\" Luzzetti said in a note. \"Depending on the outcome, it could be the first meeting where three governors dissent since 1988 and the first with dissents on both sides since September 2019.\"\n\nHow many times will the Fed cut rates this year?\n\nMany economists expect a 0.25 percentage point cut in September, but there's less clarity on how many cuts will follow.\n\nFed funds futures markets are betting on three rate cuts in 2025, while economists are split on whether the Fed will announce two or three reductions this year.\n\nOverall, the median respondent in a recent Bloomberg survey anticipates two rate cuts before the end of the year, with economists divided on whether the second cut would take place in October or December. More than 40% of economists expect three.\n\nWill Lisa Cook be at the Fed meeting?\n\nAn appeals court gave Fed Governor Lisa Cook the OK to continue her duties as she battles Trump's move to fire her in court.\n\nThe Trump administration claims Cook committed mortgage fraud by listing two properties as her primary residence, and has argued that this allows the president to fire Cook \"for cause.\" Cook has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime.\n\nAn appeals court on Sept. 15 said Cook can remain on the board for the time being, blocking the Trump administration's move to oust her just before the central bank's September meeting. The administration is expected to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump's unprecedented move to fire Cook – the first Black woman on the Fed's board – has raised concerns over the central bank's independence from politics. Trump has demanded the Fed make aggressive rate cuts, and in August said he was soon expecting to have a majority of appointees on its board who would lower interest rates.\n\nCook's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, argued that firing Cook \"would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law.\"\n\nA loan estimate for an Atlanta home purchased by Cook shows she claimed the property as a “vacation home,\" which appears to counter other documents Cook's critics have pointed to when accusing her of mortgage fraud, according to Reuters.\n\nReuters also reported that the property tax authority in Ann Arbor, Michigan, has \"no reason to believe\" Cook has broken the rules for tax breaks on a home she declared as her primary residence.\n\n(This story was updated with new information.)\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen and Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/09/25/mortgage-rates-could-fall-but-not-as-far/75380773007/", "title": "Mortgage rates could fall further but not as far as some expect", "text": "Homebuyers who are hoping that mortgage rates ultimately tumble to a 3% to 4% range after a much-anticipated string of Fed rate cuts in the upcoming months probably will be sadly disappointed.\n\nThough many economists and others say there's room for the 30-year mortgage rate to drop a bit more next year, they're not forecasting a return to ultra-low pandemic level rates.\n\nThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage averaged 6.09% as of Sept. 19, according to data from Freddie Mac's latest primary mortgage market survey.\n\nIt's quite a drop from an average of 7.19% a year ago and the 7.79% spike in late October 2023.

The Freddie Mac survey is focused on conventional home purchase loans for borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit.\n\nRates aren't likely to tumble much from here soon.\n\n\"I expect the fixed rate to be near 6% at the end of this year,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's, \"and closer to 5.5% by the end of next year. Long run, it should settle between 5.5% and 6%.\"\n\nZandi said his mortgage forecast reflects expectations that the Fed will aggressively cut the federal funds rate through the end of 2025 to get the short-term federal funds rate closer to 3%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve cut rates by a good chunk − a half point rate cut − on Sept. 18 to bring the short-term federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%. It was the first rate cut since the Fed raised rates 11 times from March 2022 through July 2023 to cool down skyrocketing inflation.\n\n\"My best guess is that the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate will be around 5.5% a year from now,\" said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst for CreditCards.com and Bankrate.com.\n\nMany factors − the health of the U.S. economy, the jobs market, the Fed's rate-cutting path and more − will influence mortgage rates ahead, so rates can be hard to forecast.\n\nA key point to consider: Mortgage rates can fluctuate even at times when the Fed is holding rates steady. Consider the spike last October when rates soared to the highest level in more than 23 years on inflation fears.\n\nSharply lower rates also can hit when the outlook for the economy is at its worst.\n\nWhat kind of mortgage rates are homebuyers seeing?\n\nAlex Elezaj, chief strategy officer for Pontiac-based UWM, said many mortgages are being made now in the 5.5% to 5.75% range, which is below the 6.09% average rate that's often quoted. United Wholesale Mortgage expects to be very busy in the last quarter of this year into next year.\n\nHomeowners who have a mortgage at 6.5%, 7% or 7.5% may be able to save money today by refinancing now, depending on their situation, he said. He recommends MortgageMatchup.com powered by UWM to find a broker or run numbers through some calculators.\n\nOthers may want to hold on to a mortgage in the 3% range, he said, but still want to take advantage of lower rates now to tap into the equity in their homes to cover high-cost bills.\n\nHe noted that the average homeowner in the U.S. gained about $28,000 in equity in the past year. The figure reflects price changes year over year through the first quarter, according to CoreLogic. Michigan homeowners on average gained $20,000 in equity. California saw the largest average equity gain in the country at $64,000. High home prices in many markets with high demand drove up averages.\n\n\"What the Fed rate announcement drives is people to really look at their current situation and figure out if there are options that work for them,\" said Elezaj, who is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the economic outlook.\n\nAny action that the Federal Reserve takes regarding short-term rates has a direct effect on credit cards and home equity lines of credit, which can improve a borrower's financial picture.\n\nMortgage rates do not follow Fed rate cuts as directly. Instead, mortgage rates track the market for 10-year Treasury bonds, and the bond market has already baked in some more Fed rate cuts ahead.\n\n\"The more that the Fed looks at reducing rates,\" Elezaj said, \"the more that we would foresee that mortgage rates will also come down.\"\n\nSome variables will be key to watch in the months ahead.\n\n\"If jobs data comes in weaker than expected, that could be a catalyst for (mortgage) rates falling,\" Bankrate.com's Rossman said. \"On the flip side, rates could move higher if the political winds blow in favor of more borrowing and higher deficits. Or if inflation proves stickier than anticipated.\"\n\nIf, for example, you took out a mortgage at nearly 8% roughly a year ago, Rossman said, you might consider refinancing at around 6% or so. On a $300,000 loan, Rossman said, it costs $364 less per month for your payments on principal and interest if you're borrowing at 6.2% versus 8%.\n\nBut Zandi said it is not a good time for many homeowners to refinance right now, especially when the average rate across all existing mortgages is close to 4%. A good rule of thumb is to refi, Zandi said, when a new mortgage rate is at least 2 percentage points below your existing rate and you plan to remain in your home for at least a few years.\n\nHome equity: How to get the best HELOC rates\n\nFirst-time homebuyers see some relief\n\nSome first-time homebuyers might find an opening here, though. Much will depend on whether they're able to afford the property taxes, whether they qualify for low rates, how much savings they've built to cover repairs, and how long they want to live in that home.\n\nAnd do you feel secure in your job? Or confident in your ability to find another well-paying job?\n\nThough the overall U.S. economy continues to expand, signs of a slowdown are taking place. The latest Freddie Mac economic forecast says the trend is \"consistent with a soft landing.\" The report noted that the \"labor market is cooling with unemployment up and job growth moderating.\"\n\nChris Sbonek, mortgage broker and owner of Mitten Mortgage Lending in Wyandotte, said the Fed's big first rate cut announcement led to \"a lot more phone calls, a lot more texts, a lot more emails.\" It's a 50-50 mix so far, he said, between potential homebuyers and homeowners looking to refinance to a lower rate.\n\nSome potential buyers got pre-approved for a mortgage during the past year to 18 months, but they then got burned out and stopped looking. Now they're more interested in resuming a search, thanks to lower rates.\n\nYour ability to get a low rate will depend heavily on your credit score. \"Credit is as, or more, important than it has ever been before,\" he said.\n\nBorrowers with good credit, he said, are seeing average rates in the mid- to low-6% range based on the 10 lenders he works with generally. With some UWM programs, he said, some borrowers have been able to lock in rates in the high 5% range.\n\n\"Everyone is not walking away with a 5-something right now,\" Sbonek said, \"but we do have borrowers, ones with the really good equity, ones with really good credit, sliding into the high 5 percents right now.\"\n\nSbonek noted that rates had trended down in recent weeks as the markets anticipated a rate cut and then edged somewhat upward after it.\n\nThose with higher credit scores typically qualify for lower rates than those with low credit scores. Other factors come into play, too, such as the size of your down payment and how much of your monthly income already goes toward paying your debt each month. Experts say less-qualified borrowers, including those with good but not excellent credit scores, could end up looking at mortgage rates that run into 6.5% to edging up to nearly 7%.\n\nSomeone with fair credit, say a credit score between 580 to 669, could see an average mortgage rate now around 6.75%, said Jeff DerGurahian, chief investment officer and head economist for loanDepot.\n\nSome consumers with scores in the fair range can be viewed by some lenders as having unfavorable credit, and they could see credit applications declined, according to Experian. But other lenders could offer options, often at higher costs.\n\n\"Lower rates should help first-time homebuyers engage the market a little better,\" said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH.com, a mortgage information website.\n\nSomeone with a slightly lower income level could even have a better chance at qualifying when their monthly payments are lower, thanks to the latest drop in mortgage rates.\n\nFor example, he said, consider someone buying a median-priced home in metro Detroit for $280,700.\n\nAt a 6% mortgage rate, he estimated that the homebuyer would likely need an income of $72,665 or higher to qualify. If rates were at 7%, he said, the borrower would need an income of $78,993 to qualify. That's assuming the buyer had a 20% down payment.\n\nAt 6% with only a 10% down payment − probably more realistic for a first-time homebuyer − the buyer would need an income of $83,306 to qualify for that mortgage, he said.\n\nIn this example, the loan amount with a 10% down payment would be $252,630. And he noted that there are costs for PMI, or the required private mortgage insurance, as well, which raises the income needed to qualify.\n\n\"Affordability − the intersection of price and financing costs relative to incomes − is what's keeping home sales from improving much,\" Gumbinger said.\n\n\"But perhaps the biggest roadblock is a lack of desirable, affordable homes available to buy. Yes, inventory levels are said to be improving, but the market doesn't just need more inventory.\"\n\nThe right kind of inventory is needed, he said, for home sales to improve. Seeing more higher-end luxury homes up for sale won't help boost sales overall, he said, if buyers remain on the sidelines because more starter-size homes are needed in a community.\n\nPotential homebuyers typically should not try to time the market and wait to see if they can snag a lower rate, he said. \"There are no guarantees that more favorable conditions will come or will come at a time when you can take advantage of them.\"\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

The couple has lived in the Chapel Hill area of North Carolina, where Boyd grew up, for many years. But now, Hare wants to be closer to her family in the West Hartford area of Connecticut.\n\nWith plenty of equity built up in their home, located in a booming local economy, the couple is in a position many Americans would envy: They likely won’t need to take out a mortgage on a new property. The biggest challenge, Hare thinks, will be the long-distance house-hunting.\n\nStill, she’s well aware that the recent decline in borrowing costs will be helpful when the couple goes to sell their own home. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage just touched 6.09%, its lowest level in over 18 months, down sharply from the recent peak of 7.79%.\n\n“Lower mortgage rates will definitely help,” Hare said. “It will open up the market for us. When rates were lower, things were really, really cranking around here.”\n\nWhat is holding back the housing market?\n\nMortgage rates don’t dictate the housing market – until they do. Ask any real estate agent why buyers aren’t buying, and most will say it’s the lack of inventory. But most housing-market inventory is simply houses that other people want to sell, and with nearly 90% of all Americans with a mortgage enjoying a rate below 6%, there’s no reason to move on unless absolutely necessary. With new listings scarce, the few properties that are on the market get snatched up quickly, and prices keep getting bid higher.\n\nThat means the housing market looks a lot like the situation Hare and Boyd are about to encounter. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a point Wednesday, and mortgage rates are likely to move in tandem as the central bank continues to ease.\n\nYes, prices may tick up as demand increases. Still, most observers think the entire housing ecosystem, not just those applying for a mortgage, will benefit from the \"unlocking\" effect. Many are hoping for a much healthier market after a few years of boom and bust.\n\n“It’s market whiplash,” said Rick Sharga, CEO of CJ Patrick Company, a real estate consultancy. “We had a zero-interest rate policy for a few years to help with the unknowns of COVID. That pulled demand forward and made homes relatively affordable even though prices rose. Right now, affordability is at all-time lows, except for a period of the 1980s, so anything that will lower rates will be a boon.”\n\nOn Thursday, the National Association of Realtors said that sales of previously owned homes fell 2.5% in August. At an annual pace of 3.86 million, sales are running roughly where they were at the depths of the foreclosure crisis a decade ago.\n\n“Home sales were disappointing again in August, but the recent development of lower mortgage rates coupled with increasing inventory is a powerful combination that will provide the environment for sales to move higher in future months,” the group’s chief economist said in a statement.\n\nTime to get off the sidelines?\n\nStill, there are some green shoots in the market. In August, homebuilders started construction on more homes and applied for more permits for future projects than in previous months. That will help bring much-needed inventory to the market.\n\nMore people applied for mortgages to purchase homes last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday, suggesting many Americans are looking for an opportunity to get off the sidelines.\n\nSelma Hepp, chief economist for real estate data firm CoreLogic, says she doesn't think the market will pick up considerably for the remainder of 2024, but with a continued steady decline in rates over the next several months, hopes for the best kind of spring selling season: one with a sense of normalcy after all the zigs and zags.\n\n\"We should be going back to pre-pandemic norms,\" Hepp said in an interview. \"The pent-up demand is there, but the lower the rate, the better.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2025/10/22/another-fed-rate-cut-soon-doesnt-matter/86751788007/", "title": "A Fed rate cut is expected and it may save you money. Why most ...", "text": "The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates again on Oct. 29, but most Americans don't seem to care much, even if lower rates could ultimately save them money, according to personal finance app company WalletHub.\n\nNearly two-thirds (65%) of Americans feel indifferent or unhappy about Fed rate cuts, with 59% saying another quarter-point cut wouldn't make a difference in their lives, said WalletHub's online survey of 200 people between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3.\n\nThose views may be surprising as another rate cut could save consumers billions of dollars, WalletHub said. Credit card rates would fall in tandem with a Fed rate cut and save credit card users at least $1.92 billion in interest over the next 12 months, it estimated. Meanwhile, the average APR on a 48-month new car loan should drop by around 0.12% in the months following a 0.25 percentage point rate cut, it said,\n\n\"A second Fed rate cut in as many months will save consumers billions of dollars in the next year alone,\" said John Kiernan, WalletHub editor. But Americans \"still have trillions of dollars in debt, and the interest is still very expensive. Many lenders are also becoming more selective, in response to a dicey economic forecast, so low rates are still hard to come by.\"\n\nWhere are interest rates now and where are they expected to go?\n\nThe Fed trimmed its short-term fed funds rate last month by 0.25 percentage point to a range of 4.00% to 4.25%. It was the first drop since December 2024 and was done to support a slowing labor market.\n\nCME's FedWatch tool, which tracks the probabilities of an interest rate move at each Fed meeting, shows a 99% chance of another quarter-point rate cut at the next central bank meeting on Oct. 29, dropping the fed funds target range to 3.75% to 4.00%. Another 0.25 percentage point cut is expected, also with almost a 99% probability, at the Dec. 10 meeting, which would bring rates down to 3.50% to 3.75%.\n\nWhy don't people care about rate cuts?\n\nStill, \"a lot of people are too preoccupied with inflation to care about a quarter-point rate cut,\" Kiernan said.\n\nA whopping 93% of respondents still see inflation as an issue, WalletHub's survey showed. Forty percent of Americans surveyed said the Fed has a bad job taming it, too.\n\n\"The irony is that cutting rates too quickly could reignite inflation,\" Kiernan said. Lower interest rates make borrowing less expensive, which should fuel spending and the economy. More people chasing goods and services generally leads to higher prices.\n\nAre Americans worried about the job market?\n\nMost Americans (60%) think the economy is getting worse rather than improving and that it's hard to find a job right now, but they generally still see inflation as the scarier bogeyman, WalletHub's survey showed.\n\nMore than 2 in 3 respondents (78%) are more worried about inflation stealing their money than artificial intelligence stealing their job, the survey said.\n\nWhere is inflation now and expected to go?\n\nAnnual consumer inflation in August rose 2.9%, up from 2.7% in July. The core rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, gained 3.1%.\n\nAugust was the last monthly inflation report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics before the government shutdown began on Oct. 1. When the government closed, all but one of the bureau’s 2,055 employees were furloughed. The September report, which was due Oct. 15, was postponed.\n\nHowever, the government is still shut with no signs of reopening soon, and the BLS is making an exception. BLS said it will release September inflation data on Oct. 24 at 8:30 a.m. ET so the Social Security Administration can calculate and release Social Security cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) information.\n\nWithout September's inflation report, the annual COLA can't be calculated. Annual COLA is based on average annual increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) from July through September.\n\nWells Fargo economists predict annual September inflation ticked up to 3.1%, and the core rate stayed at 3.1%. \"The release date of the September consumer price index may have changed, but the stubborn state of inflation has not,\" they said in a report.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Experts warn that communities with low immunization rates, such as these, are primed for measles' spread.\n\n“We’re still in free-fall,” Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, told USA TODAY.\n\n“It still has a lot of energy and steam behind it,” he said of the measles outbreak. “And that energy and steam are all the unvaccinated kids.”\n\nHow did measles outbreak start?\n\nThe outbreak began less than a month ago when several unvaccinated children in Gaines County, Texas, were identified as having measles.\n\nAt this time, it's unclear how the first person was exposed, and there's no indication that any early patients traveled outside the United States, said Lara Anton, a spokesperson for Texas' health department.\n\nAs of Tuesday, 124 people were known to be infected, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, including 18 of whom had been hospitalized. In abutting New Mexico, state health officials suspect their measles outbreak, with nine people identified, is connected to the Texas cases.\n\nTexas health officials announced Monday that more people were likely exposured to the virus after a contagious Gaines County resident traveled to several locations in and around San Antonio, nearly 400 miles away. The person visited two public universities, tourist attractions around San Antonio's famed River Walk, and a Buc-ee's along Texas' Interstate 35, among other locations, officials warned.\n\nMeasles is so contagious that, typically, kindergarten vaccination rates have to reach 95% for a community to remain protected against outbreaks. If vaccinated twice in early childhood, adults typically do not need additional protection against measles, according to the CDC.\n\nSix other states, from Alaska to New York, have also recently seen separate, isolated cases of measles, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.\n\nLast year there were 285 measles cases nationwide ‒ a record number since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC data showed. In 2019 there was a large outbreak among unvaccinated Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. In 2022 there were 121 measles cases reported nationwide and last year, an outbreak in a Chicago migrant shelter ended up infecting 57 people.\n\nSince vaccines became widely available in the 1960s, cases have declined precipitously. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated. However, outbreaks have resurfaced with declines in vaccination rates, due in part to vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.\n\nMost measles cases in the U.S. are brought by international travelers and then spread, largely among unvaccinated Americans.\n\nRural, under-vaccinated community at center of outbreak\n\nIn Gaines County, the epicenter of Texas' outbreak, 80 cases have been identified by state health officials so far. Just over 20,000 people live in Gaines, a rural county that touts itself as a leader in peanuts, cotton, oil and natural gas.\n\nA week ago, Anton had said the outbreak was concentrated in a close-knit, under-vaccinated Mennonite community, where many opted to homeschool children or send them to private schools.\n\nIn an email Saturday, she said the biggest factor in measles’ spread was among people who are “under-vaccinated.” The region is very rural, with people having to travel at least 30 to 40 miles to get preventative care, including vaccinations, she said.\n\n“We’d like to draw attention to how the virus spreads and why that makes it particularly difficult to contain if people are not vaccinated,” Anton said.\n\nLast school year, state data showed vaccination coverage for students in Gaines was among the lowest in Texas and well below the 95% considered protective.\n\nFewer than 82% of kindergartners in Gaines were vaccinated against measles.\n\nIn the county’s small Loop Independent School District, with about 150 students, only 46% of kindergarten students were vaccinated.\n\nEight other Texas counties also have cases, state data shows. Most of those also have vaccination rates below 95%.\n\n“It will spread if it is not at 95%,” Dr. Richard Lampe, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, in Lubbock, told USA TODAY. “I’ve seen it happen, and it’s happening right now in our area.”\n\nClose call in Lubbock clinic for highly infectious disease\n\nTwo weeks ago, Lampe's clinic saw a family who traveled about 60 miles from Gaines to see a pediatric specialist. While the child was in the room with the doctor, the mother told clinic staff he had had measles the week before. The child was not vaccinated.\n\nClinic staff was initially worried the boy might have been contagious but his rash had subsided four days earlier, which meant he was no longer infectious.\n\nThe measles virus is highly contagious, remaining in a room for up to two hours after an infected person leaves, according to the CDC. Someone who is contagious can infect as many as 18 others.\n\nA challenge with the Gaines outbreak is many people have limited English, speaking the German dialect of the Mennonite community, or a combination of German and Spanish, Lampe said. West Texas and eastern New Mexico have tight-knit communities that travel back and forth across state lines, he said.\n\nIn a German-language Mennonite newspaper community brief dated Jan. 27 — three days before Texas officials announced cases in Gaines County — two people from Seminole, the county's largest city, wrote about measles in their community.\n\n“Oh yes, there are a lot of sick people here,” Johann and Katharina Neustädter said in Die Mennonitische Post. “Many have fever or diarrhea, vomiting or measles. Also headaches and colds. That's not good.\"\n\nJust across from Gaines County, in eastern New Mexico, nine cases have been identified in Lea County.\n\nReligious affiliation isn’t a factor in New Mexico’s outbreak, David Morgan, a spokesperson for the state health department, said in an email. Of the nine identified cases, Morgan said, all four school-age children weren't vaccinated, while two adults weren't vaccinated and three other adults had no known vaccination status.\n\nWhat are measles symptoms?\n\nPeople can spread measles before they even show symptoms of the viral infection, which can present like other circulating respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19 and flu. But measles is even more contagious.\n\n“It’s probably one of the most infectious diseases that exists,” Dr. Meghan Brett, a hospital epidemiologist at the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque, told USA TODAY.\n\nIn addition to respiratory symptoms, people with measles may also have conjunctivitis, or eye redness. Small white bumps can begin to appear in a person's mouth two to three days after symptom onset, CDC said.\n\nOnce a fever subsides, the person develops a rash, the telltale sign of measles, which starts at their head and goes down to their toes. Someone is infectious from before symptoms show, until four days after the rash appears, said Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin.\n\nAbout one in five unvaccinated people who catch measles require hospitalization, according to CDC. One in 20 children infected end up with pneumonia, the most common cause of death among children. Around 1 in 1,000 children who contract measles develop encephalitis, or brain inflammation, that can lead to deafness, convulsions or intellectual disabilities.\n\nBetween 1 and 3 out of 1,000 children infected die from respiratory or neurologic complications. Unvaccinated women who are pregnant can have babies born prematurely or low birthweight, which can cause long-term issues for a child's development. People with weakened immune systems, such as those in cancer treatment, are also at increased risk of severe illness from measles.\n\nThe measles vaccine, which comes along with protection against mumps and rubella, is 97% effective against measles with two doses. Even one dose can provide 93% protection, and it can be protective even after exposure to the virus.\n\n“Let’s prevent what’s preventable,” Brown said. “And this is a highly preventable infection.”\n\nMary Walrath-Holdridge of USA TODAY contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/13/us-could-lose-measles-free-status-if-outbreak-continues-new-york/2300281001/", "title": "Measles outbreak 2019: US could lose elimination status in October", "text": "Measles is a one of the world's most contagious viruses. What starts as a fever can cause serious health complications and even death.\n\nThe U.S. eliminated the disease in 2000.\n\nBut an ongoing outbreak in New York could change the country's 'measles-free' status.\n\nMillions of Americans suffered from measles in the decades before the U.S. eliminated the disease in 2000. But if an ongoing outbreak in New York state continues into next month, the U.S. could lose its \"measles-free\" status.\n\n\"As a global leader in public health, it is mortifying that (the U.S.) may lose its measles elimination status,\" said Dr. Paul Spiegel, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health. \"The measles outbreaks should not have occurred as vaccination against measles is very effective.\"\n\nThe U.S. isn't alone. Four countries — Albania, Greece, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom — recently lost their measles elimination status, which the World Health Organization defines as the absence of continuous disease transmission for greater than 12 months.\n\nThe U.S. would immediately lose its elimination status if there is any case connected to the current outbreak on or after Oct. 2, according to CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund. If there's a case that was not transmitted through the current outbreak, however, then the U.S. would not lose elimination status.\n\nMeasles cases surpass 1,000 in 6 months: Medical experts worry\n\nUS sees 400 reported cases of measles: What are states doing about it?\n\nReported cases worldwide rose by 300 percent in the first three months of 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, according to preliminary data from the WHO. And that's likely an underestimate: WHO estimates that less than 1 in 10 cases are reported globally.\n\n“Re-establishment of measles transmission is concerning. If high immunization coverage is not achieved and sustained in every community, both children and adults will suffer unnecessarily and some will tragically die,” said Dr. Günter Pfaff, chair of the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination, in a press release last month.\n\nBefore the introduction of a vaccine in 1963, measles epidemics occurred about every two to three years worldwide and caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year, according to the WHO. In 2017, about 110,000 people died from measles, mostly children under the age of 5 years.\n\nThree outbreaks ongoing in the US\n\nThis year, the U.S. has seen its highest number of reported cases since 1992. There were 1,241 individual measles cases confirmed across 31 states from Jan. 1 to Sept. 5, according to CDC.\n\nOnly two states — New York and Texas — are currently experiencing outbreaks (defined as three or more cases). The nation's largest outbreak this year, concentrated in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods of New York City, ended earlier this month.\n\nBut three others are ongoing: in El Paso, Texas, and in New York's Rockland and Wyoming counties.\n\nMeasles in Ohio: State reports first case in two years amid national outbreak\n\nMore than 75% of the cases reported this year are linked to outbreaks in New York. They can be traced back to travelers who brought measles from other countries such as Israel, Ukraine and the Philippines, where large measles outbreaks are occurring, CDC says.\n\nThe ongoing outbreak in Rockland County began when an international traveler who had measles flew through Newark Liberty International Airport on Sept. 28, 2018, potentially exposing others to measles from Sept. 28 to Oct. 1, according to local authorities. Reports of rash onset in the county began on Oct. 1, 2018.\n\nNew York Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said Friday that his department was working closely with community stakeholders and local health departments to stop any continued transmission of measles in the state.\n\n\"Since the outbreak began last October, more than 71,000 doses of MMR vaccines have been administered in the counties where we’ve sustained our most aggressive public health response, a 70% increase in the number of vaccines administered from the previous year,\" Zucker said.\n\nMeasles is a one of the world's most contagious viruses. What starts as a mere fever can cause serious health complications and even death. CDC estimates that about 1 in 5 people in the U.S. who get measles will be hospitalized, and 1 to 3 out of 1,000 will die.\n\nWhy is measles back?\n\nThe global resurgence has been fueled in part by the anti-vaccination movement. While the measles vaccine is 97% effective, most cases in the U.S. this year have occurred among people who were not vaccinated, CDC says.\n\nProponents of the movement push the discredited theory that the MMR vaccine, administered to children, causes autism. Celebrity anti-vaxxers and social media campaigns have continued to champion this viral theory.\n\n“Probably the No. 1 factor we have to fight is misinformation, this concept some people have that vaccines are dangerous,\" Judd Hultquist, assistant professor of infectious diseases at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told USA TODAY earlier this year.\n\nVaccines not linked to autism: Facts you can throw at anti-vaxxers\n\nThis year, New York City bore the brunt of that misinformation campaign, which targeted Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods. In April, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency and required unvaccinated people living in designated ZIP codes to receive the vaccine.\n\nThe city's health commissioner Oxiris Barbot said at the time that the outbreak was \"driven by a small group of anti-vaxxers\" in the targeted neighborhoods.\n\n\"They have been spreading dangerous misinformation based on fake science,” she said. “We stand with the majority of people in this community who have worked hard to protect their children and those at risk.\"\n\nThe best way forward is to launch a \"robust response to the anti-vaccine empire,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, professor of Pediatrics and Dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College.\n\n“We need to take aggressive steps to restore vaccine confidence and vaccine acceptance,\" Hotez said.\n\nMeghan McCain goes after anti-vaxxers: Slams 'stupidity' for endangering children\n\nHow can the US regain elimination status?\n\nTo requalify for elimination status, the U.S. would need to demonstrate that there was no continuous measles transmission in the country for at least a year.\n\nNordlund said the CDC plans to publish a webpage on elimination status sometime next week.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/04/17/covid-19-patients-most-contagious-1-2-days-before-symptoms/5143641002/", "title": "COVID-19 patients may be most contagious one to two days before ...", "text": "COVID-19 patients may be most infectious in the days before they began showing symptoms, a new study from researchers in China found.\n\nResearchers examined \"viral shedding\" in 94 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital, according to a small study published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal \"Nature.\"\n\nScientists took throat swabs from the patients and found that viral loads were highest when symptoms began and gradually decreased towards the detection limit at about day 21. This finding is consistent with other small studies done at two hospitals in Hong Kong and with patients in Zhuhai in the Guangdong province of China.\n\nThe study also modeled COVID-19's infectiousness from a separate sample of 77 pairs of people in which one had infected the other with coronavirus.\n\nUsing pairs obtained from publicly available sources within and outside mainland China, researchers estimated that 44% of the transmissions occurred during the index patient's presymptomatic stage, \"in settings with substantial household clustering, active case finding and quarantine outside the home.\"\n\nThey were then able to infer that infectiousness started 2.3 days and peaked 0.7 days before symptoms appeared. Infectiousness was estimated to decline quickly within a week.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that viral shedding may begin 2 to 3 days before the appearance of the first symptoms,\" researchers wrote. \"More inclusive criteria for contact tracing to capture potential transmission events 2 to 3 days before symptom onset should be urgently considered for effective control of the outbreak.\"\n\nThese findings align with previous guidance from the World Health Organization which found infected people can be contagious and test positive 1 to 3 days before they develop symptoms. Presymptomatic transmission was seen in several cases in Singapore.\n\nTara Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University who was not involved in the study, said the research confirms both previous findings of presymptomatic transmission and that infected people seem to have a high viral load right around the time they began showing symptoms.\n\n\"That seems to be when they are maximally infectious,\" Smith said.\n\nPresymptomatic transmission is also seen in viruses like influenza and measles, Smith said, but is not seen with other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS.\n\nSmith said more testing needs to be done to determine the role presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission is playing in the current pandemic. She said these findings emphasize how important it is to keep social distancing measures in place to prevent those kinds of transmission.\n\n\"That's why its important to avoid people as much as possible, to wash your hands, to wear masks,\" she said. \"To prevent you from spreading the virus.\"\n\nFollow N'dea Yancey-Bragg on Twitter: @NdeaYanceyBragg", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/03/14/detroit-traveler-measles/425446002/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=usatoday-newstopstories", "title": "Measles confirmed in Detroit Metro Airport traveler", "text": "Robert Allen and Susanne Cervenka\n\nUSA TODAY Network\n\nVisitors to airports in Detroit; Newark, N.J.; and Memphis may have been exposed to measles after cases were confirmed in two international travelers, health officials in two states said Tuesday.\n\nBut people who received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine twice as children are considered protected for life, federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said. Others who have not been vaccinated or had only one shot could come down with the disease, which can be life threatening.\n\nThe specifics:\n\n• Detroit. People who visited the North Terminal at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on the afternoon of March 6 likely were exposed to the highly contagious virus, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Someone infected could develop symptoms as late as next week\n\n• Newark. Passengers in terminals B and C of Newark Liberty International Airport also were exposed and could develop symptoms as late as April 2, according to the New Jersey Department of Health.\n\n\n\n• Memphis. The young child diagnosed with measles arrived in Newark from Brussels and flew to Memphis International Airport that evening, exposing others along the way, New Jersey health officials said.\n\nIn Detroit, \"anyone who was in customs or baggage claim in the airport's North Terminal between 2 and 5 p.m. (ET) that day should seek medical attention from their primary care provider if they develop symptoms of the disease,\" Michigan health officials said in a news release.\n\nBut call the doctor first. A person with measles sitting in a reception area waiting for treatment can transmit the disease.\n\nDetroit Metropolitan Airport is a hub for Delta Air Lines in its McNamara Terminal. Various airlines have international flights — many based in the North Terminal — that fly to and from Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Mexico and the Netherlands.\n\nPassengers at Newark airport between 12:45 and 9 p.m. Monday could have been exposed to the measles virus, New Jersey officials said. It was not immediately known what flight the infected child boarded to Memphis and when the youngster arrived, but United does have a 7 p.m. Monday flight to Memphis that arrives around 9:10 p.m. CT.\n\nInternational travelers who arrived in Newark's Terminal B on flights from Amsterdam; Beijing; Bogota; Brussels; Cancun, Mexico; Copenhagen; Dublin; Edinburgh; Frankfurt; Geneva; Havana; London; Madrid; Manchester, United Kingdom; Lisbon, Portugal; Lomé, Togo; Mexico City; Monrovia, Liberia; Munich; Oslo; Panama City, Panama; Paris; Quebec; Reykjavik, Iceland; Santiago, Chile; Shanghai; Tel Aviv, Israel; Toronto; and Zurich were potentially exposed. Domestic flights from Atlanta; Cincinnati; Detroit; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Minneapolis; Myrtle Beach, S.C.; Orlando; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; and Salt Lake City also arrived during that time, according to Newark airport's flight list.\n\nOther travelers were exposed as the child made the trek to Terminal C, sat on the flight to Memphis and arrived at the airport terminal there.\n\nMeasles begins with a \"high fever, red eyes, cough, runny nose\" and extreme sensitivity to light, according to the department.\n\nNot only is measles very contagious — it spreads through a cough or sneeze and even by being in a room up to two hours after an infected person has left — children younger than 5 can face serious complications, including permanent hearing loss from ear infections; pneumonia, which is a lung infection; or a swelling of the brain called encephalitis. Pregnant women are susceptible to giving birth prematurely or having a low-weight baby.\n\nThe illness has a 10- to 12-day incubation period. After the earlier symptoms, it develops into a red, raised body rash that starts on the head and face before progressing to the rest of the body.\n\nPeople may be contagious for a few days before symptoms become noticeable, health department officials said.\n\nThe first of two measles vaccinations that also combine protection from mumps and rubella, often called German measles, generally is given to children 12 months old. But infants as young as 6 months can get a measles vaccine if they're traveling internationally, Michigan health officials said.\n\nThe measles case reported Tuesday was confirmed in Washtenaw County, whose county seat is Ann Arbor, and it's Michigan's first in 2018. The person had returned from travel abroad March 6 and was contagious at the time, according to the Michigan health department.\n\nThe Michigan measles patient was hospitalized and is now recovering.\n\nIn 2017, measles cases numbered 118 in the United States, and the majority of people diagnosed had not been vaccinated, according to the Michigan health department. The average number of measles cases from 2001 to 2012 nationwide has been about 60.\n\nSo far as of Feb. 24 this year, 13 people in seven states — Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas — have contracted measles, the CDC has reported. On Jan. 2, an Indiana University student who later developed measles arrived on an international flight in Newark's Terminal C and departed for Indianapolis.\n\nMany of the 188 cases reported in a 2015 outbreak were tied to an infected person who visited Disneyland. More than half of the 667 measles cases reported in 2014 occurred in unvaccinated Amish communities in Ohio.\n\n“This case underscores the importance of following vaccine recommendations and being up-to-date on vaccines,” said Dr. Eden Wells, the Michigan health department's chief medical executive. “Immunizations are the best way to protect our families and communities from the harmful, sometimes deadly consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles.\"\n\nRobert Allen reports for the Detroit Free Press; Susanne Cervenka reports for the Asbury Park (N.J.)

You may need vaccination", "text": "DETROIT — Check yourself, public health officials say, as the number of cases in a Michigan measles outbreak climbed Friday by five more people to 39 cases — the largest statewide outbreak since 1991.\n\nEven if you think you've been vaccinated for the measles, ask your doctor to check your immunization record to be sure.\n\nIf you have proof you received two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR), you should still ask to have the antibodies in your blood checked, especially if you've been to one of the growing number of exposure sites.\n\nEven if you had measles as a child or were born prior to 1957 and are considered immune by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, double check. And again, that's especially true if you've been to a known exposure site.\n\nThere's a chance you're not as safe as you think you are.\n\n\"All these people walking around are vulnerable and don't know it,\" said Dr. Janet Snider, a Bingham Farms, Michigan, pediatrician. \"We're learning in the trenches because we don't usually see measles,\" which was pronounced eradicated in the United States in 2000 but is surging right now in pockets of the country.\n\n\"All those suppositions we have aren't holding up,\" she said. \"It's like you think your basement is waterproof if you live in the desert. But then all of a sudden, there's a flash flood, and then you really learn if it is.\"\n\nFor many people born after 1957 but before 1989, they may have gotten only got one dose of the MMR vaccine, which might not be enough to protect them in an outbreak situation. The CDC changed its recommendations for the MMR vaccine in 1989, urging people to get two shots rather than just one, said Leigh-Anne Stafford, a spokeswoman for the Oakland County Health Division.\n\n\"For a lot of people who were born after 1957 but prior to 1989-1990, there was only one dose that was recommended at that time,\" Stafford said. \"A lot of people might feel they are up to date on their vaccines because their parents may say, 'Oh, you’re up to date. We vaccinated you.' But they're not.\n\n\"So that’s why we keep talking about knowing your status. Are there two doses documented somewhere with a doctor? Or Is it listed in MICR (Michigan Care Improvement Registry), which is the Michigan registration database for immunizations? If you don’t, then get vaccinated.\"\n\nTwo doses of the MMR vaccine are believed to offer people up to 97% protection against measles, which is highly contagious and is spread by person-to-person contact and through the air, most often when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n\nOf the 39 confirmed Michigan cases, those infected with measles range in age from 8 months old to 63 years old. At least three of them had two documented doses of the MMR vaccine, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. But at press time, the MDHHS did not know how many were unvaccinated or could not document their immunizations.\n\n\"The measles vaccine is safe and extremely effective,\" Snider said. \"Two doses confer 97% immunity to the population. But that still means that 3% of people may not respond to the vaccine.\"\n\nThat means that if 100 vaccinated people are exposed to measles, three may catch it, she said. \"But if 100 unvaccinated people are exposed to measles, 90 would likely contract it.\n\n\"People of all ages (should) check their vaccination status and make sure that they have had two documented MMRs after 1 year old, or they have had a blood test to confirm their immunity to measles.\n\n\"This local outbreak was started by a traveler in his mid-40s who assumed that he was vaccinated as a child, who was exposed to measles in New York weeks before arriving in our area.\n\n\"He, like the many people in his age group exposed here, found out the hard way that the recommendations from those years are inadequate in the face of an actual measles outbreak. Some people born before 1957, although supposedly 'presumed immune,' also found they lacked immunity.\"\n\nOne such person is Oakland County Commissioner Helaine Zack, whose 18th District includes Oak Park, a community hit hard by the measles outbreak.\n\nZack said she had measles as a child, but when her blood was drawn to check for immunity in 2006, doctors discovered she had no measles antibodies.\n\n\"They gave me an MMR (vaccination) then,\" she said. \"Then, later, I had a physical, and my antibodies were not as high as the health department would like them to be given the measles outbreak, so I went and had a second MMR last week.\"\n\nShe and her husband have been to several of the exposure sites in Oakland County. So he got an MMR vaccine, too.\n\nOf the people with confirmed cases of measles in Michigan this year, 38 are from Oakland County and one is from Wayne County. Exposure sites are largely in southern Oakland County and include grocery stores, pharmacies, hardware stores, health care facilities, a post office, Derby Middle School, dozens of religious institutions and houses of worship. Exposures occurred at a bank in Macomb County as well as government offices and a food manufacturer in Detroit.\n\nSymptoms of measles usually begin 7-14 days after exposure, but can appear up to 21 days after exposure and may include:\n\nHigh fever (may spike to over 104˚F)\n\nCough\n\nRunny nose\n\nRed, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)\n\nTiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums, and roof of the mouth (Koplik spots) 2-3 days after symptoms begin\n\nA rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms, and legs 3-5 days after symptoms begin.\n\nIf symptoms develop, call your doctor or emergency room before arriving so they can take precautions to prevent exposure to others.\n\nFollow Kristen Jordan Shamus on Twitter: @kristenshamus", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/politics/white-house-vaccine-covid-19", "title": "White House sketches a future in which normal life and Covid-19 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBiden administration health officials on Wednesday outlined a long-term vision for a future in which the nation coexists with Covid-19 without living in crisis and facing disruption to normal life.\n\n“We continue to move toward a time when Covid won’t disrupt our daily lives. A time when Covid is no longer a crisis, but rather something we protect against and treat,” White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said during Wednesday’s White House Covid-19 response team press briefing.\n\nZients pointed to vaccines and other treatments as tools to manage the virus, but, when pressed on what it will take to get there, Dr. Anthony Fauci said the US is not at that phase yet.\n\nFauci said there is still a “way to go” before cases and hospitalizations decline to what he described as an “acceptable situation.”\n\n“We are not there right now. As (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director) Dr. (Rochelle) Walensky said, when you have over 2000 deaths, 150,000 hospitalizations, and you have people who are now getting infected to the tune of somewhere around 700,000 a day, we’re not there yet,” Fauci said.\n\nFauci did not offer specific metrics on what that would look like.\n\nFauci said the aim is to get to a place “sufficient control,” which he explained was not “eradication” like with smallpox or “elimination” like with the polio epidemic and measles, but rather, “a level of control that does not disrupt us in society, does not dominate our lives, not prevent us to do the things that we generally do under normal existence.”\n\nHe compared that control to the way Americans currently live with other viruses.\n\n“That would be a level of infection, but more importantly, concentrating on the severity of disease, hospitalizations, and deaths that fall within the category of what we generally accept. We don’t like it, but we accept it with other respiratory viruses: RSV, paraflu, and even influenza,” Fauci said.\n\nFauci said vaccines, boosters and infection will “hopefully, get us to the point where we have antivirals to be able to treat people who are at high risk that we no longer are in a situation of threat – threat to our equanimity, threat to our economy, the threat to allow us to live a normal life.”\n\nPart of that strategy will include sharing vaccines to get more people vaccinated outside the US.\n\nThe Biden administration also marked a milestone of vaccines shipped abroad Wednesday, announcing that the US has shared 400 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine around the world.\n\n“In addition to driving vaccination progress here at home, the US continues to lead the effort to help vaccinate the world. At President Biden’s direction, we’re donating 1.2 billion vaccine doses – the largest commitment in the world. And today, we will hit a major milestone in our global effort: 400 million vaccine doses shipped to 112 countries. 400 million doses shipped for free with no strings attached,” Zients announced at Wednesday’s Covid-19 response briefing.\n\nThe US is shipping an additional 3.2 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine to Bangladesh and 4.7 million doses to Pakistan through the COVAX global vaccine sharing program, a White House official told CNN.\n\nPakistan has received the most doses from the US, with a total of 47.4 million doses shipped as of Wednesday.\n\nThe US has donated more doses than any other country, Zients noted, for a total commitment of 1.2 billion doses.\n\n“To put America’s leadership into perspective, we have shipped four times more free doses to the world than any other country,” he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced to the UN General Assembly last fall that the US had purchased another 500 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine, which would begin shipping this month, with 800 million vaccines expected to be shipped abroad through September of this year.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/10/12/free-covid-19-tests-expire/75626532007/", "title": "The free COVID-19 tests are set to expire soon.

Emails are optional for individuals who want to receive shipping notifications.\n\nDo you have to pick up the tests in person, or can they be mailed to you?\n\nThe at-home tests will be mailed to individuals' residences across the U.S. Shipping is free of cost.\n\nCOVID-19 tests will be more accessible\n\nHHS said that the tests will be \"more accessible\" for people with disabilities which includes improving test technology for people who have difficulty using their hands and people who are blind or have low vision.\n\nIn addition, HHS plans to reach marginalized households across the United States.\n\n\"These efforts complement ASPR’s ongoing distribution of free COVID-19 tests to long-term care facilities, low-income senior housing, aging and disability networks, and other community organizations to support older adults and people with disabilities living in the community, uninsured individuals, and underserved communities,\" the HHS release said.\n\nHHS also adds that \"more than one billion over-the-counter tests have been provided to date through this community access program.\"\n\nWhat if I test positive?\n\nThe tests will be able to detect the dominant COVID-19 variants now circulating, according to the CDC.\n\nThe at-home tests typically provide results within 30 minutes or less and can be administered to vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Many COVID-19 tests now have extended expiration dates.\n\nIndividuals who test positive should follow the latest CDC guidance to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThough positive results are accurate, the HHS warns that negative results don't necessarily rule out a COVID-19 infection.

That's the highest annual total since more than 950 cases were reported in 1994 – and this year isn't half over yet.\n\nMeasles have been reported in 24 states; Oklahoma joined the list this week. The majority of cases remain in New York City and its suburbs.\n\nThe upside: The number of additional cases was the lowest in several weeks. The previous week saw 75 new cases.\n\nMeasles made a comeback in part because of a movement against vaccination in the U.S. The outbreaks are linked to travelers who brought measles back from countries such as Israel, Ukraine and the Philippines, where large measles outbreaks are occurring, the CDC said.\n\nThe travelers then interact with Americans who are not vaccinated, spreading a disease that ranks among the most contagious on the planet.\n\n\"The reported new case in Oklahoma resulted from international travel,\" Ogbonnaya Omenka, an associate professor and public health specialist at Butler University, told USA TODAY. \"Although the actual number of cases from international travel may pale in comparison to local cases, the highly infectious nature of measles means one case from international travel could result in an outbreak.\"\n\nMeasles, though best known for its itchy rash, is actually a respiratory disease.

But a mandate is not likely anytime soon, and likely not to come from the federal government. Instead, employers and states may condition return or access to workplaces, schools and colleges upon getting the vaccine and mandate it once the FDA issues full approval, potentially months later.\n\n\"It's much more likely that a private organization or company will require you to be vaccinated to get certain access to places,\" said Arthur Caplan, a professor of bioethics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. \"People worry about the president, governor, or county executive telling them what to do. I don’t think that’s going to happen.\"\n\nAt an August town hall hosted by Healthline, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the vaccine won't be mandatory in the U.S. \"I don’t think you’ll ever see a mandating of vaccine, particularly for the general public,\" Fauci said. \"If someone refuses the vaccine in the general public, then there’s nothing you can do about that. You cannot force someone to take a vaccine.\"\n\nAnd on Friday, President-elect Joe Biden told reporters that he would not make vaccinations mandatory. \"But I would do everything in my power – just like I don't think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide – I'll do everything in my power as president of the United States to encourage people to do the right thing,\" Biden said.\n\nHistorically, states have had the power to mandate vaccinations. In 1905, as smallpox was spreading through Massachusetts, the Supreme Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws in the case of Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n\"There’s a long history in our constitution that permits the state to act for public health and safety, and that has always included vaccination,\" said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.\n\n\"But although they have the power, I think it will be very unlikely that they will exercise that power,\" he said. \"They would be fearful of causing a backlash and politicizing the vaccine.\"\n\nIt's more likely that vaccination requirements will play out as they have in the past. Once fully approved by the FDA, a vaccine may eventually be required for children in public and private schools and day care settings, for college and university students, and for some health care workers and patients, Gostin said.\n\nIs this ethical? Continuing COVID-19 vaccine trials may put some volunteers at unnecessary risk\n\nAll 50 states and Washington, D.C., have laws requiring certain vaccines for students, and exemptions vary by state. All states grant exemptions to children for medical reasons, 45 states grant religious exemptions, and 15 allow philosophical exemptions for those who object to immunizations because of personal, moral, or other beliefs, according to the National Conference of Legislatures.\n\nHealth care facilities across the country are increasingly requiring health care workers to be vaccinated against various diseases, and some facilities are adding these requirements due to mandates in state statutes and regulations, according to the CDC.\n\nWhen it comes to the flu, 24 states have flu vaccination requirements for long-term care facility health care workers, and 32 have them for long-term care facility patients, according to the CDC. As of 2016, 18 states had flu vaccination requirements for hospital health care workers.\n\nOther employers also require certain vaccinations.\n\n\"Will the general public be required to get it? That’s highly unlikely. That’s not the American tradition or culture,\" said Peter Meyers, professor emeritus at the George Washington University law school and former director of the school's vaccine injury litigation clinic.\n\n\"We recommend it. We make it as easy as possible to get it. We make it free. If enough people take it, we’ll have herd immunity.\"\n\nSide effects from the COVID-19 vaccine: Means 'your body responded the way it's supposed to,' experts say\n\nBut officials have mandated vaccines beyond school and employment settings in the past. Following a 2019 measles outbreak in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood fueled by a growing movement against vaccinations, New York City ordered mandatory measles vaccinations for anyone living, working, or going to school in four ZIP codes in the neighborhood.\n\nThe order required all unvaccinated people who may have been exposed to the virus to get the vaccine, including children over 6 months old, unless immune or medically exempt. The city first threatened civil and criminal repercussions but eventually settled on a $1,000 fine. A Brooklyn judge upheld the order.\n\nThat order was for a vaccine that had been fully licensed by the FDA. The two coronavirus vaccines currently under review would be \"authorized\" by the agency based on early data, at the discretion of FDA scientists. The FDA only ever issued an emergency use authorization, known as an EUA, for a vaccine once before – for an anthrax vaccine in 2005.\n\nIf authorized, a coronavirus vaccine's EUA status would make legal questions about theoretical mandates in the immediate future more complicated. There are also logistical issues of supply and distribution. There's no data on how vaccine candidates affect children or pregnant people. And it's still unclear if the vaccines prevent the transmission of the virus, in addition to preventing disease.\n\n\"Institutions may require individuals to take an FDA-approved vaccine or apply for an exception. However, EUA products are still considered investigational,\" FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told USA TODAY last week.\n\nIt's unclear whether schools or employers could legally mandate a vaccine under an EUA, said Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law. She submitted comment to the FDA requesting that the agency's EUA documentation offer guidance on the question of mandates.\n\nIn the past, members of the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said that employers cannot require a vaccine under EUA, Reiss said. But the Secretary of Health and Human Services, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, can establish the conditions of an EUA, including whether people have the option to accept or refuse the vaccine, and the consequences of doing so, if any.\n\n\"I’m sure no government will be requiring anything in the short run as long as we’re operating under EUA,\" Caplan said. \"It would be very strange to require something that hasn’t been licensed or approved. The military could certainly require things, but for civilians, no.\"\n\nVaccine mandates: Flu vaccine now required for all Massachusetts students\n\nShould employers force workers to get COVID-19 vaccine? Some experts say they should\n\nWhen a coronavirus vaccine is first authorized and then eventually approved by the FDA, it may well take years before it becomes a requirement for schoolchildren or anyone, said Dr. Howard Koh, a professor at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and former Assistant Secretary for Health under Barack Obama.\n\n\"For every vaccine that’s new, it takes a while to gain familiarity and general acceptance. Much of that involves assuring the effectiveness of the long-term safety profile. There’s a comfort level that should be reached by everyone – parents, families, employees. That process is going to take time,\" he said.\n\nSome companies in industries that present a high risk of transmitting the virus – such restaurants, gyms, salons, meatpacking, pro sports and nursing homes – may also eventually require vaccinations for their employees, Caplan said. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has previously said employers have the right to mandate flu vaccines, but employees can request medical or religious exemptions.\n\n\"You could face a situation where your income is dependent on getting a vaccine,\" said Robert Field, law and public health professor at Drexel University.\n\nIf employers in service industries required vaccinations for employees, once a vaccine is licensed, they would \"have a strong argument that termination would be objectively fair,\" Field said. For the time being, Field said he expects employers to avoid the legal risks of mandating a vaccine that has not been licensed.\n\nThe best strategic approach to promote vaccination is to maximize communication and minimize barriers, said Ross Silverman, a professor at Indiana University’s Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health and Robert H. McKinney School of Law.\n\n\"What can we do to make this as easy as possible for people to say yes to?\" he said. \"The best approach to be taking in the near term is engaging communities, answering questions, and letting people know what the benefits and risks are, where they’re going to be able to get access to it and that there are no costs associated with getting the vaccine.\"\n\nThe question, for now, isn't who has to be vaccinated but who gets to be, said Michelle Mello, a professor at Stanford Law School.\n\n\"Most people will come around, so I’m not even sure that we even need to have a conversation about mandates,\" Mello said. \"If it’s eight months from now and we’ve got ample supply and we’ve run through all the people who wanted to get the vaccine, and we’re still nowhere near herd immunity, it may be a different conversation.\"\n\nContributing: Elizabeth Weise and Adrienne Dunn, USA TODAY\n\nFollow Grace Hauck on Twitter at @grace_hauck.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/03/21/march-madness-vasectomies-urologists-appointments/73019724007/", "title": "Do more men really get vasectomies before March Madness? We ...", "text": "Amid the impending start of March Madness, college basketball fans across the country may happily forgo a few days of work or house chores to instead park themselves in front of the nearest screen airing the NCAA tournament.\n\nBut for those men savvy enough to schedule vasectomy procedures timed to a good TV lineup, they have a valid excuse: \"Don't like that I'm lazing about while watching hours and hours of basketball? Sorry, doctor's orders.\"\n\nThe idea that many men choose to schedule the common outpatient contraceptive procedure to coincide with the annual tournament is a pervasive one – so much so that a nickname has arisen to describe the perceived trend: \"vas madness.\"\n\nIs there any truth to it at all? Are scores of men really timing their vasectomies with the tourney? Or is it a myth, one perpetuated by saturated media coverage and some clever marketing?\n\nHere's what urologists told USA TODAY:\n\nWhat is 'vas madness?'\n\nA vasectomy itself takes no time at all: The quick outpatient procedure takes a matter of minutes, but the recovery itself can take a few days.\n\nDuring that time, patients are under strict medical orders to rest and avoid strenuous activity while periodically icing the groin area. With all that free time to lounge around, men are likely to want to have something planned.\n\nThe early stages of the March Madness tournament present an opportunity for basketball fans to watch game after game after game. Meanwhile, most men getting vasectomies are younger and more likely to be interested in watching the tournament.\n\nBecause of that overlap, the myth of \"vas madness\" was born.\n\n“Given that March Madness televises multiple games on back-to-back days, especially in the early rounds of the tournament, it provides a great activity for men to lay low and successfully recover from their procedure,” said Dr. Alexander Rozanski, assistant professor in the Department of Urology at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. \"This creates a great opportunity for men to recover successfully while also doing something they like to do.\"\n\nMen's NCAA Tournament: 10 bold predictions for March Madness\n\nDo urologists see vasectomy appointments increase in March?\n\nBut how common is it for men to want to do this?\n\nPretty darn common, it turns out.\n\nSome urologists who spoke to USA TODAY, including Rozanski, said they are aware of patients who have specifically requested appointment dates that fall right before the NCAA tournament begins.\n\nMedical literature further supports the idea that vasectomy appointments spike to a year-high in March, rivaled only by December when many patients have met their deductibles, according to one 2018 study from the National Center for Biotechnology Information.\n\nDemand has become so high that the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio provides more appointment slots every year in March, said Dr. Sarah Vij, the director for the hospital's Center for Male Fertility.\n\n“March is one of our busiest vasectomy months of the year every year,” Vij said. “It is certainly not rumor.”\n\nMyth becomes reality with clever marketing (and some news coverage)\n\nThe rise of \"vas madness\" may have resulted with the help of some clever marketing – and plenty of news coverage, to boot.\n\nIn fact, multiple urology practices around the country, including the Cleveland Clinic, specifically advertise appointments for vasectomies in March.\n\nHowever, Vij is skeptical that the college basketball tournament itself is the sole driving factor. In fact, one study she co-authored suggested the spike can at least partly be attributed to the 2022 fall of Roe V. Wade.\n\n“It prompts men to say, ‘You know what, I have been meaning to get that procedure done,’ and they go ahead and schedule,“ Vij said, adding that the number of procedures she performs in March typically doubles per week. ”I often ask my patients who are having the procedure done during the tournament if they did this intentionally and rarely do they say yes.\"\n\nDr. Ajay Nangia, a urologist at the University of Kansas Health System, said one of his former trainees helped to popularize the idea around 2014 by offering vasectomy procedures during March Madness along with pizza. National media was quick to cover the story, sparking the urban legend, Nangia said.\n\n“From urban legend it became fact,” Nangia said.\n\nNow, organizations like Planned Parenthood have picked up on the trend and marketed expanded services offering the procedure. Even Rozanski participated last year in an article for the UT Health San Antonio website about vasectomies increasing for March Madness.\n\nBut regardless of the reason that men are getting the procedure, the March frenzy hasn't been without plenty of benefits, said Dr. Nahid Punjani, a men's health and infertility specialist in the urology department at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona.\n\n\"This has importantly provided exposure, awareness and acceptance to a fairly simple and effective method of contraception,\" Punjani said.\n\nWhat to know about a vasectomy procedure\n\nIn clinical terms, a vasectomy involves cutting and sealing the tubes that carry sperm to prevent it from being transferred to the ejaculate and causing a pregnancy.\n\nIn colloquial terms, it's male birth control.\n\nThe procedure is quick, taking no longer than 30 minutes from start to finish, urologists say.\n\nThose without strenuous jobs can typically return to work as soon as the next day but are still advised to avoid excessive activity for about a week – and yes, that means waiting to have sex, Punjani said.\n\nAlthough vasectomy reversals are possible, experts also warn potential patients to consider the procedure to be permanent, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Visit modernismweek.com for more information.\n\nModernism Show started it all\n\nBefore there was Modernism Week, there was just the Modernism Show, the annual event where collectors peruse various furniture, decor and art pieces — and it all began in 2000.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nIn 1993, Jacques-Pierre Caussin, an antique dealer, began producing the Miami Modernism Show. After a few years, he got \"tired\" of doing the show by himself, so he approached the company Dolphin Promotions about co-producing it. With a deal signed, he headed to Palm Springs, where he had purchased a home.\n\nWhile in the desert, he realized a similar modernism showcase would thrive in the city, especially because modern architecture was being \"rediscovered\" in the late 1990s, he said. There were a number of factors, Caussin said, that led to the rebirth of Palm Springs during that time period, including the restoration of the iconic Kaufmann House by Brent and Beth Harris and articles about preservation efforts.\n\n\"From day one, really, we knew it would work, and then a couple of years later it became a huge success,\" Caussin said. \"It takes a couple of years to start, but we had no problems recruiting the exhibitors. Because people were rediscovering Palm Springs and its architecture, they were buying modern homes, so what do you do when you buy a modern home? You put modern furniture (in it).\"\n\nAt that first show, there were about 40 exhibitors and about 1,500 attendees over two days, Dolphin Promotions President Rosemary Krieger recalled.\n\n\"It was wonderful, and it just grew and grew and grew and grew,\" she added. Today, the Modernism Show, which is slated for Feb. 15 through 17 (a preview party is scheduled for Feb. 14), features 125 national and international dealers and sees around 15,000 attendees.\n\nShowcasing how some 'live like this'\n\nAs the Modernism Show continued to gain attention, it became apparent that there was a lot of enthusiasm for mid-century modern architecture and that there should be activities and events available to those in town.\n\nWillam Kopelk, currently the Modernism Week Board Chairman, was the president of the Palm Springs Preservation Foundation in 2005. He and vice president Stewart Weiner are credited as co-founders of Modernism Week, and other members of the initial steering committee included representatives from the Palm Springs Modernism Show, the Palm Springs Modern Committee, the Palm Springs Historical Society and the Palm Springs Art Museum.\n\nKopelk and Krieger began working together in the early 2000s because the Palm Springs Preservation Foundation was the beneficiary of the opening night Modernism Show ticket sales. Seeing how many people flocked to the desert for the show during President's Day weekend, as well as a symposium held at the Palm Springs Art Museum the next weekend, Kopelk and Weiner realized they needed to \"figure something out to keep these people here during the week.\"\n\nWhat came were the first few events offered during Modernism Week in 2006. Held Feb. 17 through 25, the lineup included tours of Frey House II and the then-named Horizon Hotel, a screening of the film \"Desert Utopia,\" architectural photographer Julius Shulman receiving a star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars and a number of lectures. Kopelk said there were around 300 people that participated in the weeklong event.\n\n\"I said, well, let's do this again, it could catch on,\" he said. \"So 20 years later, here we are.\"\n\nModernism Week CEO Lisa Vossler Smith, who has been with the organization since the beginning, said the comments people shared about the tours and events back then are nearly identical to what people say now.\n\n\"People still marvel and wonder at the fact that people get to 'live like this,'\" she said, \"in this incredibly gorgeous resort-style atmosphere, in these timelessly beautiful architectural gems of a home.\"\n\nBecause Kopelk had his finger on the pulse of preservation efforts, he knew many people in town who were restoring their homes, and he would often ask them if they were interested in showcasing their home on a tour. Over the years, as the event caught on, the number of events offered continued to grow.\n\n\"As interest grew, not only in tourism, but among the homeowners themselves, they became very good advocates for Modernism Week in getting their neighbors and friends to participate in future years,\" Smith said. \"That's still part of the beauty today.\"\n\nEven famed Palm Springs architects William Krisel, E. Stewart Williams and Hugh Kaptur were able to see their work be appreciated so many years later.\n\nThe architectural showcase \"increased people's awareness\" of what Palm Springs had to offer, Kopelk said, and that mid-century modern charm soon became a trend nationwide. The series \"Mad Men,\" set in the 1960s, premiered in 2007 and became a hit.\n\n\"It brought back, in terms of nostalgia, a pleasant time,\" Kopelk said. \"Nostalgia has a great part to do with the popularity of Modernism Week. The Rat Pack, anything Sinatra, sells out.\"\n\nBut, to Smith, the \"secret ingredient\" to Modernism Week's success is Palm Springs. One comment she heard from an attendee years ago is that the mid-century modern buildings and homes \"only look correct here in Palm Springs.\" She attributes that to the area's mountain views, climate and topography.\n\nThe festival has expanded beyond just Palm Springs over the years. Tours take place in various Coachella Valley cities and even in Joshua Tree, and lectures often spotlight mid-century modernism architecture around the world.\n\nBut more than just giving people a better sense of appreciation for architecture, officials with Modernism Week are especially proud of the ways they're able to give back to the community. Since 2011, Smith said the nonprofit has given away more than $300,000 in scholarships to local students. During Modernism Week – October and Modernism Week 2024, participating partner organizations raised more than $2.5 million, which included more than $860,000 raised by local neighborhood organizations from home tours, according to Modernism Week. The estimated economic impact of Modernism Week 2024 was $68 million.\n\nWhat's ahead for Modernism Week? 'Worldwide domination' for starters\n\nAs Modernism Week officials look ahead to the next chapter, both Smith and Kopelk have similar goals to expand — and Kopelk hopes for \"worldwide domination.\"\n\nThe nonprofit has plans to dive into the origins of modernism and modernism around the globe. The group has already been taking a few trips abroad to explore the architectural style, like in Mexico City and various cities in Europe, and Kopelk will travel to Havana, Cuba next month. Trips to other modernist cities in the United States, including Columbus, Indiana, and Sarasota, Florida, have also occurred.\n\nModernism Week's lecture series is another opportunity to see what's happening beyond the desert. This month, attendees will learn about efforts to preserve visionary architect Luis Barragán's mid-century development Jardines del Pedregal in Mexico City; restoration efforts of the Villa Tugendhat in Brno, Czech Republic; and learn about the Bauhaus, a design school in Germany that served as the embassy of modernist design.\n\n\"We will continue exploring modernism in all of its evolution into the future,\" Smith said. \"There are many designers and architects working today who are inspired by the mid-century period, but who are working with today's technologies and materials, and we are equally interested in talking about those future practices.\"\n\nEma Sasic covers entertainment and health in the Coachella Valley.

Know the meaning, origins of May 5 holiday", "text": "So much more than just a day of drinking and partying, Cinco de Mayo is a day rich in history and culture for Mexico.\n\nCelebrated annually on May 5, Cinco de Mayo recognizes Mexico's victory over the Second French Empire led by Napoleon III at the Battle of Puebla in 1862. The holiday has since become perhaps more popular in the U.S. than in Mexico and is often celebrated by people of Mexican American heritage.\n\nThe holiday's name, Cinco de Mayo, translates to the fifth of May. This year, it is on Sunday, May 5.\n\nCities around the U.S. celebrate every year with parades, festivals, music and more, from Los Angeles to Chicago and everywhere in between. Restaurants and brands have gotten in on the action as well, offering food and drink deals throughout the weekend.\n\nHere's what to know about the origins of Cinco de Mayo, and why it's celebrated in the U.S. today.\n\nWhat does Cinco de Mayo celebrate? Origins tied to 1862 battle\n\nMexican Independence Day, or Día de la Independencia, came on Sept. 16, 1810, when the country broke free of Spanish rule.\n\nCinco de Mayo came more than 50 years later when French Emperor Napoleon III wanted to claim Mexico for himself.\n\nThe French sent troops to force Mexico's President Benito Juárez and the government out of Veracruz. On May 5, 1862, in a small town in east-central Mexico called Puebla, 2,000 Mexican soldiers faced 6,000 French troops at daybreak. Incredibly, Mexico claimed victory by the evening, and Juárez declared May 5 a national holiday.\n\nThe battle also played a role in the American Civil War. With the French defeated and leaving North America, the Confederacy wasn't able to use them as an ally to win the war.\n\nSo, why are so many Americans still confused?\n\n\"Everyone thinks that it's just party time, it's Corona time,\" Mario García, a Chicanx historian from the University of California at Santa Barbara, previously told USA TODAY.\n\n\"It's OK for people to go out and have a good time on a holiday like Cinco de Mayo − at least they have some sense that it's some kind of a Mexican holiday,\" García said. \"But we should go beyond that. We should have Cinco de Mayo events that go beyond partying and drinking, where we call attention to what the history is.\"\n\nPart of the confusion among many Americans about what Cinco de Mayo celebrates is likely because it's much catchier-sounding and easier for English speakers to say than the day of Mexico's independence (Diez y seis de Septiembre), García said last year.\n\nThe holiday serves as a reminder of the importance of Chicanx history and its people's contributions to the U.S.\n\n\"When you study the history of Chicanos and Latinos, of course, they've been history makers,\" García said previously. \"They've been involved in all aspects of American history, not to mention the wars ... In World War II alone, almost half a million Latinos – mostly Mexican Americans – fought in the war. And they won a disproportionate number of congressional Medals of Honor.\"\n\nWhy is Cinco de Mayo more popular in the U.S. than Mexico?\n\nWhile there are Cinco De Mayo celebrations throughout Mexico, notably in the city of Puebla, the event doesn't compare to the celebrations of Día de la Independencia, García said.\n\nMeanwhile in the U.S., Cinco de Mayo has become an annual celebration of Mexican American culture.\n\nThe celebration of Cinco de Mayo began as a form of resistance to the effects of the Mexican-American War in the late 19th century. The holiday gained popularity during the Chicano Movement of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\"It becomes a Chicano holiday, in many ways, linked to the Chicano movement, because we discover Mexicans resisting a foreign invader,\" García said. \"They link the struggle of the Chicano movement to Cinco de Mayo.\"\n\nBy the 1980s, companies began commercializing the holiday, especially beer companies and restaurants offering Cinco de Mayo specials and cocktails. García jokingly refers to the day as \"Corona Day.\"\n\nThis Cinco de Mayo, García hopes everyone enjoys their Coronas, but perhaps with a little history lesson to wash it down.\n\nCinco de Mayo events around the U.S.\n\nSan Diego: San Diego's Cinco de Mayo celebrations will be held May 4 and 5 in Old Town San Diego. Activities include live music, folklorico, dining and drink specials.\n\nDenver: The Mile High city has a whole host of holiday-related activities over the weekend of May 4 for Cinco de Mayo Denver, from a community parade to a taco eating contest.

Escobar\n\nTejano Talks\n\nNote from Tejano Talks editors: Last week we celebrated the famous Cinco de Mayo battle at which Mexican forces defeated the French in Puebla in 1862. Again, many thought this was Mexico’s Independence Day. Many national and local broadcasters dressed up with sombreros and fake mustaches to signal it was time to drink cerveza and tequila and eat tacos. This misappropriation of the battle and Mexican culture is a slap in the face to the heroes — many of them from South Texas — who fought valiantly to repress the French invaders and prevent them from overtaking Mexico and joining the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War. The heroes of Cinco de Mayo may have saved the Union and impacted the history of our nation. Today, Cinco de Mayo is an American celebration, especially in Texas, since the hero of that battle was Gen. Ignacio Zaragoza, who was born in Goliad. Here is a recap of how it all began.\n\nBy Judge Juan Escobar/Tejano Talks\n\nBenito Juarez was elected President of Mexico in 1861 and took over a government that was in financial crisis. On July 17, 1861, Juarez decided to freeze all foreign debt, for two years. Mexico’s decision to default on their debt was met with resistance from France, Spain and Britain. As a consequence, these countries sent their naval forces to block the Port of Veracruz and force Mexico to pay its debt.\n\nSpain and Britain came to a settlement with Mexico and withdrew. France, under the leadership of Napoleon III, however, saw this as an opportunity to conquer Mexico and expand its empire.\n\nOn the eve of 1861, France landed a well-armed Army at Veracruz and forced the Mexican Army into a full retreat. Some historians estimate that there were 8,000 soldiers and others that there were 6,000 soldiers under General Charles Latrille de Lorencez. This well-trained force set forth to a small village, Puebla de Los Angles, setting the stage for what became known as the “La Batalla del Cinco de Mayo.”\n\nThe date for this battle was May 5, 1862. More than 2,000 Mexican peasants, led by Goliad, Texas-born General Ignacio Zaragosa awaited their fate as they defended the forts at Guadalupe and Loreto in Puebla, with the assistance of many South Texas and Rio Grande Valley vaqueros. The Mexicans were poorly trained and armed with short supplies of ammunition, weapons and practically no artillery. Zaragoza and the South Texans did their best to prepare for battle.\n\nIn the early morning of May 5th the French attacked the small forts and were met with fierce resistance by the Mexicans under Zaragosa’s command. The battle lasted until the late evening hours. The French were defeated and lost more than 600 men. The Mexicans lost 100.\n\nSeveral of the illustrious leaders of the Battle of Puebla had direct roots to South Texas. According to some leading historians, more than 500 Tejanos were recruited to fight at Puebla. A list of some of these men has been compiled at the University of Puebla.\n\nCaptain Porfirio Zamora y Galvan, another leader of the battle, was born in Matamoros and later live in a ranch near Palito Blanco, Texas, south of Alice. He was under the command of Gen. Porfirio Diaz, who would become president of Mexico.\n\nZamora’s bravery and actions during the battle of Puebla did not go unrecognized. He was awarded “La Condecoración de Segunda Clase,” Mexico's second-highest award for bravery. He also was promoted to the rank of major. Many of Zamora's descendants live in Jim Wells County.\n\nAfter the battle, the name of the city of Puebla de Los Angeles was changed to Puebla de Ignacio Zaragosa in honor of Zaragosa’s victory.\n\nThis victory gave Mexico a much-needed morale boost and a reason to unite as a country. The victory was celebrated all over Mexico and President Juarez declared that this would be a holiday named “El Cinco de Mayo.”\n\nThe victory at Puebla was short-lived. The French Army eventually attacked Mexico City, with a force of more than 30,000 troops, setting Emperor Maximilian I as ruler of Mexico.\n\nFrench forces continued fighting all over Mexico. Napoleon III and his Emperor Maximilian I were determined to gain control of Mexico and eventually the United States, in clear violation of he Monroe Doctrine. At the time of the battle of Puebla the United States was involved in the Civil War. Historical records indicate France intended to help the Confederacy.\n\nThe French continued to march toward the United States-Mexican border. They saw a weakness in the United States with the cost incurred by the Civil War and were determined to invade the United States. On June 16, 1866, Mexican Forces under the command of Gen. Servando Canales confronted the French at La Mesa del Ebanito, about three miles east of Rio Grande City, Texas, on the Mexican side of the river. The Mesa is on hills known as Lomas de Santa Gertrudis. According to Ernesto Garza-Saenz historian from Camargo, Tamaulipas, Mexico (This community is located across the Rio Grande River from Rio Grande City, Texas), Saenz states that after a one-hour battle, forces from Camargo defeated the French. This battle became known as the Battle of Santa Gertrudis. Nine days later, French forces surrendered at Matamoros. This was the beginning of the end of the French intervention in Mexico. With the assistance of the United States, the French surrendered to Mexico five days after the Battle of Santa Gertrudis on June 21, 1867.\n\nMexican historian Justo Sierra (1848-1912), in his writings “Political Evolution of the Mexican People,” states, that had the French won the Battle of Puebla the Mexicans would have lost their fighting spirit. This would have expedited the war in Mexico and the French would have joined forces with Confederate Army with a higher probability of defeating the Union. The Battle of Santa Gertrudis was also significant, because it this was the beginning of the end of French occupation of Mexico. Five days after the battle the French finally surrendered.\n\nJuan M.

Even though (Mexico) is far away for us, this is bringing a little bit of our culture and country, the music and food ... It’s to come together on one day to celebrate the independence of Mexico,” he explained.\n\nThe vast majority of Salinas residents are of Latino descent, and it’s important to celebrate that, Sanchez added.\n\n“I think it’s good to remember. I think we’re all proud Americans, and we’re also very proud of the culture we come from … It’s an opportunity to bring people together and truly celebrate our culture and heritage,” he said.\n\nThe event is free to enter and open to the public.\n\nIt kicks off at 3 p.m Saturday with a parade featuring 40 to 50 horses, elected officials, local school bands, dancers and more. The parade begins and ends at Vineyard Christian Fellowship Church on East Alisal Street.\n\nThen, the El Grito Festival opens at 11 a.m. on Sunday and will spread out over five blocks of East Alisal Street for hours. The festival has regularly attracted tens of thousands of people in the past, Sanchez said, and will feature two stages of entertainment and 120 vendors this year.\n\nThere will also be a children’s area, cultural exhibits and performances.\n\nSanchez advised that people should arrive hungry as the scent of a wide array of authentic Mexican dishes will fill the streets.\n\nAround 2 p.m. on Sunday, representatives from the Mexican Consulate in San Jose will be on hand to hold the actual El Grito ceremony.\n\n“El Grito” refers to the “El Grito de Dolores,” or “Cry of Dolores,” when a priest named Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla rang a bell and gave a call to arms against Spain in Dolores, Hidalgo, Mexico on the morning of Sept. 16, 1810.\n\nThis signified the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence, and Mexico has celebrated the day as its Independence Day since 1825.\n\nEach year on Sept. 16, the president of Mexico stands on the balcony of Mexico City’s National Palace and shouts the names of heroes from the Mexican War of Independence, ending with three shouts of “Viva Mexico!” to an enormous crowd assembled in the Zócalo, or main square. The president then rings a bell and waves Mexico’s flag as the national anthem is played.\n\nThe Salinas celebration will also include a moment of silence honoring first responders and others lost in the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nThen, this year’s Señorita El Grito and her two runner-ups will be crowned\n\nAlthough the actual Mexican Independence Day falls on Saturday this year, the Salinas celebration is always held on the Sunday closest to Sept. 16 to accommodate farm workers or laborers who typically must work on Saturday, Sanchez explained.\n\n“We want to make sure all families, all workers can participate, and Sunday is a day off for workers, agriculture related and others,” Sanchez said. “In the Latino community, Sunday is a perfect day to take your family out.”\n\nSalinas’ El Grito celebration has a long history going back to the early 80s, and a number of organizations have hosted it over the years, including the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Central Coast and the Salinas United Business Association.\n\nSeveral years ago, local business owners worked together to set up the nonprofit EL Comité Cultural de Salinas which now hosts the annual El Grito Parade and Street Festival, said Sanchez, who also serves as the committee’s president.\n\nSanchez has been involved with the celebration for the last 19 years and said people often don’t want to allow the popular event to end.\n\n“We expect another great event, another great turnout. We hope to reach over the 50,000 people we reached last year,” Sanchez said. “We’re excited and hope the weather is good. It’s a good celebration for the community.”\n\nIf you go..\n\nWhat: El Grito Parade and Street Festival\n\nWhere: East Alisal Street in Salinas\n\nWhen: Parade at 3 p.m. Saturday; festival opens at 11 a.m. on Sunday", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/05/05/what-is-cinco-de-mayo-2025/83456386007/", "title": "Cinco de Mayo 2025: Mexican holiday's meaning, origin explained", "text": "Before Cinco de Mayo became associated with tacos and margaritas, the day served as a reminder of Mexico's triumph over the French.\n\nCelebrated annually, Cinco de Mayo commemorates the Mexican army's victory over the Second French Empire, led by Napoleon III, at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862, hence the name. The holiday is celebrated across the U.S. and in parts of Mexico, particularly in the City of Puebla, where the epic battle took place.\n\nAmericans, including people of Mexican American heritage, along with our neighbors in Mexico, celebrate with parades, festivals, music and food. This year, Cinco de Mayo falls on Monday, May 5.\n\nWhile Cinco de Mayo honors Mexico's resilience and bravery in the face of strife, the holiday has also become, for some, an excuse to party.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that it's just party time, it's Corona time,\" Mario García, a Chicanx historian from the University of California at Santa Barbara, shared in a May 2023 interview with USA TODAY.\n\n\"It's OK for people to go out and have a good time on a holiday like Cinco de Mayo -- at least they have some sense that it's some kind of a Mexican holiday,\" García said. \"But we should go beyond that. We should have Cinco de Mayo events that go beyond partying and drinking, where we call attention to what the history is.\"\n\nHere's what to know about the origins of Cinco de Mayo, and how it's celebrated in the U.S. today.\n\nWhy is Cinco de Mayo often confused with Mexico's Independence Day?\n\nThough many might know the lore behind Cinco de Mayo, it is often confused with Mexico's Independence Day, which falls on Sept. 16. It is known as the Día de la Independencia in Mexico.\n\nPart of the confusion about what Cinco de Mayo celebrates likely stems from the names of the two holidays, which might be harder for some English speakers to say. Cinco de Mayo is much catchier than the day of Mexico's independence (Diez y seis de Septiembre), García said.\n\nAnother issue is that not enough American schools teach the importance of Chicanx history and its peoples' contributions to the U.S.\n\n\"When you study the history of Chicanos and Latinos, of course, they've been history makers,\" García said. \"They've been involved in all aspects of American history, not to mention the wars ... In World War II alone, almost half a million Latinos – mostly Mexican Americans – fought in the war. And they won a disproportionate number of congressional Medals of Honor.\"\n\nThe Battle at Puebla also occurred more than 50 years after the country broke free of Spanish rule. The reason the battle happened in the first place was because French Emperor Charles-Louis Napoléon Bonaparte wanted to claim Mexico for himself.\n\nThe French sent troops to force President Benito Juárez and the government out of Veracruz, Mexico.\n\nAn outnumbered band of Mexican soldiers faced 6,000 French troops at daybreak in Puebla, a city in east-central Mexico, on May 5, 1862. Mexico, miraculously, was able to claim victory by the evening, at which time Juárez declared May 5 a national holiday.\n\nThe victory also helped prevent the French from settling in and helping the American Confederacy in the Civil War, according to History.com.\n\nWhy is Cinco de Mayo more popular in the U.S. than in Mexico?\n\nCinco de Mayo celebrations do occur in Mexico, most notably in the City of Puebla; those events don't compare to Día de la Independencia celebrations, García said. Meanwhile, in the U.S, it's become an annual celebration of Mexican American culture.\n\nIt began as a form of resistance to the effects of the Mexican-American War in the late 19th century. The holiday gained popularity during the Chicano Movement of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\"It becomes a Chicano holiday, in many ways, linked to the Chicano movement, because we discover Mexicans resisting a foreign invader,\" García said. \"They link the struggle of the Chicano movement to Cinco de Mayo.\"\n\nCompanies, especially beer companies and restaurants, began commercializing the holiday in the 1980s, offering customers \"Cinco de Mayo\" specials and cocktails.\n\nThe holiday is now known to some as Cinco de Drinko, and to García as \"Corona Day.\" This Cinco de Mayo, García hopes everyone enjoys their Coronas, but perhaps with a little history lesson to wash it down.\n\nCinco de Mayo celebrated around the U.S.\n\nSan Diego: San Diego's Cinco de Mayo celebrations were held May 3 and 4 in Old Town San Diego. Activities included live music, folklorico, dining and drink specials.\n\nDenver: The Mile High City hosted several holiday-related activities over the weekend of May 3 for Cinco de Mayo Denver, from a community parade to chihuahua races.

In recent years, Día de los Muertos has also become a popular theme in mainstream culture and has been recognized and celebrated in different forms in various parts of the world. However, its most authentic and deeply rooted celebrations can still be found in Mexico.\n\nHere are interesting facts about Day of the Dead, including its most beloved traditions, why it's celebrated over two days and the meaning of sugar skulls.\n\nWhat is Day of the Dead?\n\nThe holiday has roots in ancient pre-Hispanic Mexico/Mesoamerica, and is celebrated to honor and remember deceased loved ones. It is a vibrant and festive occasion that takes place annually on Nov. 1 and 2.\n\nRather than being a somber or mournful occasion, Día de los Muertos is a joyous and colorful celebration of life and death. It is believed that during these days, the spirits of the departed return to the world of the living to visit their families and loved ones.\n\nThe celebration involves various customs and traditions, which differ regionally across Mexico.\n\nWhy is it called Day of the Dead?\n\n\"Day of the Dead\" is the English translation of the Spanish term \"Día de los Muertos.\" The name reflects the central focus and purpose of the holiday, which is to honor and remember the dead.\n\nWhen is Day of the Dead celebrated?\n\nThe holiday begins on the evening of Oct. 31 and continues through Nov. 2. These dates coincide with the Catholic holidays of All Saints' Day (Nov. 1) and All Souls' Day (Nov. 2).\n\nPreparations and festivities often extend beyond this time frame. In some regions, people start creating altars and decorating gravesites in the days leading up to Nov. 1, Mathew Sandoval, a professor at Arizona State University researching Día de los Muertos, said.\n\n\"I would say that most people, you could really say, celebrate it for a week or multiple weeks,\" Sandoval said. \"Because many people don't make the ofrenda on Nov. 1, they don't make it on Oct. 31, they don't make it on Nov. 2. They make it weeks in advance of the actual holiday.\"\n\nIn Mexico City, Day of the Dead is celebrated throughout October and many people add to and change up their altars as the month progresses.\n\nWhat are the dates of Day of the Dead?\n\nDía de los Muertos is observed on Nov. 1 and 2, to honor different groups of loved ones.\n\nNov. 1 is dedicated to honoring deceased children and is often referred to as Día de los Inocentes or Día de los Angelitos (Day of the Innocents or Day of the Little Angels). On this day, families create special ofrendas (altars), decorate gravesites and offer toys, sweets or other items that the children enjoyed in life.\n\nNov. 2 is known as Día de los Muertos or Día de los Difuntos (Day of the Dead or Day of the Deceased) and is a day to commemorate adult ancestors and friends. Families visit cemeteries, clean and decorate gravesites and create elaborate ofrendas in their homes or at burial sites. They offer food, drinks, flowers and personal mementos to honor and welcome the spirits of the deceased.\n\nBy observing two days, Día de los Muertos allows for separate remembrance of deceased children and adults, acknowledging the different stages of life and providing a specific focus for each day. It reflects a blending of indigenous Aztec beliefs and Catholic traditions, combining the pre-Columbian reverence for ancestors and the afterlife with Catholic teachings on saints and souls.\n\nWhat religion is Day of the Dead rooted in?\n\nDía de los Muertos combines several religious and cultural traditions.\n\n\"When the Spanish came over and colonized the Americas, they brought Catholicism with them,\" Sandoval said. \"And so we would be foolish to think that there aren't European, Spanish and Catholic roots to this holiday.\"\n\nSandoval said there is an African spirituality component to Día de los Muertos as well because Spain was invaded and held multiple times as an empire by North Africans. There was also African slave trade in Mexico.\n\nWhat does the Day of the Dead actually celebrate?\n\nDay of the Dead celebrates the belief that the spirits of the deceased return to the world of the living during this time. It is a joyful and colorful occasion that embraces death as a natural part of the human experience, rather than a somber or fearful event.\n\nTraditions vary across Mexico. Some universal aspects of Day of the Dead observances include:\n\nHonoring and remembering: Families create altars or ofrendas in their homes or at gravesites to celebrate their loved ones. These altars are adorned with photographs, candles, flowers (particularly marigolds), favorite foods, beverages and personal belongings of the deceased. The offerings are meant to welcome and nourish the spirits as they return to visit their families.\n\nFamilies create altars or ofrendas in their homes or at gravesites to celebrate their loved ones.

Celebration of life: Rather than focusing on loss and sorrow, Day of the Dead is a celebration of life and the connections that endure beyond death. Families gather to enjoy music, dance, traditional foods and other festivities. It is a time for joy, laughter, and appreciation of the preciousness of life.\n\nWhat countries celebrate Day of the Dead?\n\nDía de los Muertos is primarily celebrated in Mexico. Customs vary by region.\n\nFor example, Oaxaca is known for vibrant and elaborate celebrations, Michoacán's observances are deeply rooted in tradition and Mexico City is known for its wealth of events and activities.\n\nOutside Mexico, Día de los Muertos is celebrated in regions with significant Mexican and Mexican-American communities, particularly in Arizona and the rest of the Southwest, California and Texas.\n\nHow is Dia de los Muertos celebrated in Mexico?\n\nCustoms vary, but these are some common practices and elements of Día de los Muertos celebrations in Mexico:\n\nOfrendas (altars): Families create elaborate altars in their homes or at gravesites to honor their deceased loved ones.\n\nCemeteries: Families visit cemeteries to clean and decorate the graves of their departed loved ones.\n\nCalaveras and Catrinas: People paint their faces to resemble skulls or dress in costumes representing these figures.\n\nSugar skulls: Sugar skulls, or calaveras de azúcar, are intricately decorated edible skulls made of sugar or chocolate.\n\nMarigolds: Marigolds, known as cempasúchil or flor de muerto, hold special significance during Día de los Muertos. Their vibrant orange and yellow colors and strong scent are believed to guide the spirits to the altars and gravesites.\n\nParades and festivals: Participants wear colorful costumes, paint their faces as skulls and carry banners or puppets representing the deceased. These events often feature music, dancing, traditional performances and lively processions through the streets.\n\nWhat goes on a Day of the Dead altar?\n\nParts of a Day of the Dead altar include:\n\nPhotographs.\n\nCandles.\n\nMarigolds (cempasúchil).\n\nFood and beverages.\n\nPersonal belongings.\n\nPapel picado, colorful tissue paper cut into intricate shapes to create decorative banners.\n\nReligious symbols.\n\nIncense.\n\nPersonal offerings.\n\nDo people wear costumes for Dia de los Muertos?\n\nDía de los Muertos is not typically associated with costumes in the same way as Halloween. Instead, it is more focused on creating colorful and elaborate displays, altars and face paintings that honor deceased loved ones.\n\nHowever, some people dress in traditional Mexican attire during Día de los Muertos celebrations. These garments could include embroidered dresses (such as the dress called traje de Tehuana), colorful skirts or shirts with intricate patterns. Men may wear charro suits, which consist of decorated jackets, pants and sombreros.\n\nSome people incorporate sugar skull face painting or wear masks that represent calacas (skeletons) or catrinas/catrines, the elegantly dressed skeletal figures associated with Día de los Muertos.\n\nDay of the Dead costume meanings\n\nLa Catrina is an iconic symbol associated with Día de los Muertos. La Catrina was created by the Mexican artist José Guadalupe Posada in the early 20th century as a satirical illustration depicting a skeleton dressed in fashionable attire to mock the upper class of that time. Over the years, La Catrina has been embraced as a symbol of Mexican culture and has come to represent the idea that death is an inherent part of life and should be celebrated.\n\nDuring Día de los Muertos, it is common to see people wearing La Catrina-inspired costumes or paint their faces to resemble the skeletal features of La Catrina. Some people don elaborate dresses or suits reminiscent of the elegant fashion associated with the character. Flower crowns, shawls or hats complete the look.\n\nWearing a La Catrina costume or incorporating elements of La Catrina into one's attire is a way to pay homage to the cultural significance of Día de los Muertos.\n\nWhat is the meaning behind sugar skulls?\n\nSugar skulls are an integral part of the ofrendas created during Día de los Muertos. They serve as decorative offerings and are placed on the altars or given as gifts to friends and family. The skulls are often personalized with the names of the deceased.\n\nGot a story you want to share? Reach out at Tiffany.Acosta@gannett.com.

Letters in Hebrew fading over a storefront. A stained-glass Star of David set in a stone facade.\n\nMexico's new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has been famously quiet about her Jewish ancestry. Yet she will live and govern Latin America's second-largest economy from the Palacio Nacional, three blocks from Mexico's first synagogue and a neighborhood where Jewish immigrants first found refuge here.\n\n\"The Barrio Judío doesn't exist as a place\" per se, said Monica Unikel, who has spent three decades documenting the history of Jewish immigration in Mexico and leads tours of the old quarter. \"I started asking people where they lived, where they worked, where they prayed, and I started marking the places on a map.\"\n\nSheinbaum's four grandparents were Jewish: on her father's side, they were from Lithuania, arriving in Mexico in the 1920s, according to the Jewish Telegraph Agency; on her mother's side, they were Bulgarian, landing in Veracruz in 1942, barely escaping the Holocaust.\n\nSheinbaum was brought up with Jewish traditions, she has said. But her parents were academics and political activists in a country where politics have historically been fiercely secular, separated from the Catholic Church and religion generally.\n\nIn Mexico, Jewish identity is deeply tied to the synagogue and faith practices, Unikel said – unlike in the U.S. where Jewish identity can be as much ethnic and cultural as it is religious. While nearly 6 million adults in the U.S. identify as Jewish, about 2.4% of the population, according to Pew Research, in Mexico, there are only an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Jews in a country of 124 million people.\n\nStill, the first Jewish migrants left their mark on Mexico City's cultural heart.\n\nThey built a synagogue – where Jewish men still say their daily prayers – near the sprawling Zócalo public square and the city's sinking Cathedral, itself built upon the ruins of an indigenous Mexica temple.\n\nAt the Jewish new year, a tour of a historic and humble barrio\n\nOn a drizzly day last week, ahead of Sheinbaum's inauguration and the start of the Jewish new year, historian Vania Martínez began a tour of the barrio in front of the synagogue, Monte Sinaí, which opened in 1923.\n\nHer voice competed with the neighborhood roar. Haitian migrants heaved reams of fabric into the back of a truck. Motorcycles weaved through unmoving traffic. A fruit seller with a microphone hawked golden apples in a singsong pitch.\n\nInside the temple, prayers had ended and the sanctuary was quiet. Wooden chairs stood in perfect rows, framing a sacred chest where the Hebrew scriptures are carefully stored. Its simplicity is a reflection of the community's humble origins in Mexico, she said.\n\nTo Mexicans, the Barrio Judío is better known as part of La Merced, famous for its 500 years of market tradition, and for being a first stop for newcomers to the metropolis, akin to New York's Lower East Side or San Franciso's Mission District.\n\nDuring a migration that began in the early 20th century, Arab and Eastern European Jews brought their traditions to Mexico, Unikel said. They influenced, and were influenced by, Mexican customs.\n\nJewish immigrants introduced a business model in Mexico that endures today, Unikel said. Men often worked as peddlers, carrying their wares on their backs, and they sold their goods to poor Mexicans on interest-free credit, she said. They became known as aboneros and created what is still a feature of modern sales in Mexico: \"six months without interest,\" she said.\n\nAt the same time, Jewish immigrants were assimilating Mexican ingredients into their traditional foods, she said.\n\n\"You can't talk about Jewish food in Mexico, both Sephardic and Ashkenazi, without chile, avocados or tortillas,\" Unikel said. \"Dishes like gefilte fish a la veracruzana; guacamole with hard-boiled egg; kibbeh ‒ a ground meat and bulgur wheat dish ‒ stuffed with rajas con elote, chile and corn. There are kosher tamales made without pork lard. There is such an interesting mixture.\"\n\nAs Martínez gave the tour, she carried a folder and pulled out black-and-white photos of the people and places who once populated the barrio.\n\n\"Here is a beautiful one, where they've got their Shisha,\" she said, pointing to a photo of men seated around a table, sharing a water pipe, or Hookah. \"It was one of the few things they would have brought in their suitcase, the little that they could carry, and it was very representative.\"\n\nThe barrio was a place where a 14-year-old named Shimshon Feldman could find work, first in a Jewish bakery where he sold black bread and braided challah and later at a Yiddish daily newspaper.\n\nThere was a kosher meat market on Jesus Maria and a matzoh ball factory on Soledad and, in a shop beneath a figurine of the Virgin of Guadalupe, a woman called Sara Makowsky sold everything a Jewish family would need for their holiday celebrations, Martínez said.\n\nMakowsky was so successful and stable that she also ran a sort of community post office for the other Jewish migrants who were constantly moving, renting where they could.\n\nOnce a synagogue, now a cultural center\n\nTwo doors down from the Monte Sinaí synagogue, ornate wood doors in a neo-colonial facade give the impression of a mansion inside. But it's a false front: Inside, Jews, including those who fled the Nazis, built a synagogue hidden from view.\n\nMost of Mexico City's Jewish community lives outside the historic center today. Fourteen years ago, Unikel helped restore and convert the synagogue into a cultural center, called Sinagoga Histórica Justo Sierra 71.\n\n\"When we converted the synagogue, my goal was ... how can we share our culture with the whole world, with Jews and non-Jews and foreigners?\" she said. \"It’s Jewish culture for the world. For me, one of the objectives is to show who we are in all our diversity so that people who have false ideas about the Jewish people can get to know who we are, our traditions and philosophies.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel, the cultural center curtailed its public events. Even as the war worsens in Israel, Gaza and Lebanon, the cultural center plans to restart its programming this month, though with added security.\n\nPeople \"need to know us, not through stereotypes,\" Unikel said. \"There are so many ways to live a Jewish life.\"\n\nA visit by Claudia Sheinbaum\n\nSheinbaum, before she became president, served as mayor of Mexico City. The city invested in remodeling the then-rundown Plaza San Loreto in front of the Sinagoga Histórico, and Sheinbaum came to inaugurate it.

He is one of six Mexican drivers in Formula One history.\n\n\"I*m so excited to drive in my country. I never thought it would happen,\" Perez said. \"Mexico has a lot of history in the sport ... I have no doubts this race will become a modern classic of Formula One.\"\n\nWatch F1 champ Lewis Hamilton bodyslam a Mexican wrestler\n\nIf the 25-year-old Guadalajara native can manage his first win, or more realistically earn his sixth career podium, Perez could start a national party that could last all week.\n\nMexico City officials are expecting one anyway. Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera predicts more than 330,000 fans will jam the refurbished track from Friday to Sunday, when the race will take place on the Day of the Dead, a national celebration honoring friends and family who have died.\n\nAuthorities plan to install three big screens for fans to watch, something the capital city typically reserves for Mexico's World Cup matches or the Olympics.\n\nThey hope the world is watching.\n\n\"This is a great opportunity for us, it*s one of the biggest projects ... and can propel us internationally\", said Francisco Maass Peña, Mexico's undersecretary of tourism.\n\nMexico City hosted Formula One events from 1963-1970 and again from 1986-1992, and the race returns to a track full of exciting, dangerous and sometimes deadly racing.\n\nThe track opened in 1961, and disaster struck the next year when Mexico's Ricardo Rodriguez, a promising driver coming up with Ferrari, was killed in a non-championship grand prix event. The circuit was later named after Rodriguez and his brother Pedro, who won two grand prix races before he also was killed in a racing accident in 1971.\n\nIn 1970, about 200,000 packed into the venue on race day, breaking down fences as fans tried to get closer to the action. Some even sat on the track and wouldn't move until drivers Jackie Stewart and Pedro Rodriguez appealed for calm.\n\nTo get Formula One to return, the track needed a $50 million overhaul to eliminate some of the dangerous conditions, refurbish the garage areas and build new grandstands. That meant taking out the sweeping, high-speed banked curve where Rodriguez died, Ayrton Senna crashed in 1991 and every other driver took a deep breath as they ripped through.\n\nPurists will miss the potential for danger, but Formula One safety standards forced the move. The track also needed to be resurfaced to reduce its notoriously bumpy ride.\n\nMexico City officials had hoped the season championship would be decided here, but Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton clinched his second consecutive title and third overall at the United States Grand Prix last weekend.\n\nSebastian Vettel, Ferrari aim to challenge Lewis Hamilton in 2016\n\nHamilton's 10th victory of the season made him the first Formula One driver to win at least 10 races in consecutive years. With three races left on the 2015 schedule, he could tie Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel for most wins in a season with 13. Vettel set the record in 2013 with Red Bull.\n\nWith the pressure of the world title lifted, Hamilton has already shown he's ready to have some fun. On Wednesday, he got in the ring with Mexican wrestler Mistico where he was allowed to body slam his muscular opponent.\n\n\"I can attack the final three races now with nothing to prove and nothing to lose, so the aim is absolutely to put my name down as the first Mexican Grand Prix winner of the modern era,\" Hamilton said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/10/28/day-of-the-dead-dia-de-los-muertos-visual-guide/75790458007/", "title": "Day of the Dead: A visual guide to this Mexican holiday", "text": "Day of the Dead, also known as the Dia de los Muertos, is often mistakenly called the \"Mexican Halloween\" because of the year it's celebrated and its use of skeletons. This three-day Aztec celebration in late October, which has its roots in southern Mexico, honors the memory of departed family members, friends and even pets.\n\nIn late October, popular Day of the Dead symbols appear, including bright paper flowers and face painting. But are you familiar with the various parts of an ofrenda, the traditional altar, or the significance of sugar skulls on Dia de los Muertos?\n\nThe Day of the Dead is celebrated mostly in Mexico and Central America and has made its way into several cities within the U.S. Read on to discover more about this holiday’s traditions:\n\nDays of celebration for Day of the Dead\n\nThe Day of the Dead celebrations begin on Oct. 31 and finish on Nov. 2. Its combination of the Indigenous cult of death and ritual rites with Catholicism brought it over from Europe. The custom of inviting departed loved ones home for a day is a way to honor their lives and accept what will happen after death.\n\nTraditions of an Ofrenda\n\nUnable to view our graphics? Click here to see them.\n\nFood, flowers and altars are necessary components of the celebration. To honor the deceased, foods such as sugar skulls, sweetbread rolls and beverages are arranged on ofrendas, or house altars, along with clay ornaments and sentimental objects. Either at the cemetery itself or at a table at home, family members think their loved ones will feast on the “essence” of their offered treats.\n\nWhat the ofrenda offerings symbolize\n\nWhere did the use of skeletons come from?\n\nSkeletons are the most iconic representations of the Day of the Dead. People dress up in ornate costumes with skull faces today. A playful representation of life after death is a skeleton.\n\nOne of the many well-known representations of the Day of the Dead, La Calavera Catrina, which translates to \"elegant skull,\" first appeared in 1910 as a skeletal figure wearing an elaborate outfit. In Mexico, satirical artist Jose Guadalupe Posada was the first to draw her figure. It was intended to serve as a mocking reminder to those aspiring for social and political prominence that, at their core, all people are – just bundles of bones.\n\nAlebrijes: Even the dead need a spiritual guide\n\nPedro Linares, an artist in Mexico City, introduced the celebration to colorful, mythical creatures known as Alebrijes in 1936. With exaggerated bodies with stripes and dots, they are considered creatures from our dreams and the realm of the dead. They are typically made of paper mache or wood.\n\nThe basic meaning of the Day of the Dead celebration hasn't changed over thousands of years, despite its evolving traditions. This holiday serves as a moment to honor and celebrate those who have departed from this life while also presenting death as an inevitable part of life.\n\nSOURCE DayofheDead.holiday/history, History.com, The University of New Mexico, Britannica.com and USA TODAY research\n\nThis story was updated to add new information, a video and a clarification.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}]}

Open enrollment started Nov. 1 and runs through Dec. 15.\n\nThe news comes despite — or perhaps because of — efforts to repeal and replace the health law on Capitol Hill and attempts by the Trump administration to dismantle it.\n\n\"The administration has caused a lot of anxiety for people over the last year when it comes to health care but there’s also been a more in-depth conversation about what Obamacare really is about,\" said former Obama administration official Lori Lodes, co-founder of the group Get America Covered. So when most people logged onto HealthCare.gov they found plans that are more affordable than they expected.\n\nSign ups increased among new customers as well as those who were previously enrolled on Healthcare.gov, which handles enrollment for 39 states that didn't set up their own exchanges. These states tend to be controlled by Republican governors or legislatures that have not generally supported the law.\n\nAbout two times as many people on average signed up each of the first four days of open enrollment, which started on a Wednesday, so these first figures are for a partial week. Even more surprising, there were more than 34,000 new customers on average a day, compared to more than 26,000 daily last year.\n\nThere's especially good reason for those receiving federal subsidies to sign up. More than half of the nearly 6 million people eligible for financial help can buy a bronze plan on Healthcare.gov without having to pay a premium, according to an analysis also out Thursday by Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAbout 70% of people eligible for subsidies can get a bronze plan for $0 or less than the cost of the tax penalty this year.\n\nBronze plans are the least expensive plans, premium-wise, on the ACA exchanges that are available to everyone. These plans also cover just 60 percent of out-of-pocket costs, so they aren't for everyone, acknowledges Lodes.\n\nMore:\n\nObamacare 2018 enrollment opens Wed. with little federal mention, lower rates for some\n\nState Medicaid programs can require work, will get rated on how well they improve health\n\nFederal judge rules Trump can end health insurance cost sharing subsidies\n\nEven with zero or very low premiums, Louisiana insurance broker Ronnell Nolan says the options in her state aren't attractive for some of her clients. One couple with a $50,000 household income will have considerable trouble affording any of the options available on Healthcare.gov for their state, even with more than $2,100 monthly tax credit.\n\n\"The plans are horrible and they can't afford a decent plan based on their income,\" says Nolan, who also heads Health Agents for America. \"Why does a health plan cost over $2,000 for the absolutely worse plan you can buy?\"\n\nLaura Buten and her husband are both self employed and haven't fared nearly as well others who receive financial help to buy their plans. In fact, the bronze level plan premium for them and their 22-year-old son increased 50% to $1,630 a month for next year. The deductible is $6,350.\n\n\"To spend (that much) for health insurance and not get anything, is crazy,\" says Buten who is a real estate appraiser. \"It makes me sick to think what I could do with that money.\"\n\nShe and her husband, an optician, \"are not wealthy,\" she says, earning up to $200,000 a year. Buten sends her elderly mother money to supplement her Social Security check and wishes she could send more.\n\nShe also hopes President Trump's plan to allow insurance sales across state lines and for self employed people to group together to buy association plans becomes official. The couple lives a lives in northern Kentucky just miles from the border of Ohio, where there are more and better options on the insurance exchange.\n\nFor those who do receive subsidies, are healthy and/or can set aside money, especially in a health savings account, Lodes says this year does offer some great deals.\n\n\"If the administration were doing everything they could to help people enroll, instead of undermining the law every chance they get, imagine how many more people would be signing up right now,\" says Lodes, who was President Barack Obama's spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nWhat's your healthcare experience?

How some big companies got away with ...", "text": "Dozens of large corporations paid more money to their top executives than they shelled out in federal taxes between 2018 and 2022, according to a new watchdog report.\n\nThe analysis names 35 corporations, including Tesla, Netflix and Ford, that each reportedly spent more on compensation to their five highest-paid executives than they paid in federal income taxes over five years.\n\nCollectively, the 35 corporations spent $9.5 billion on their top executives over that span, the report said, while their combined federal tax bill came to – $1.8 billion: a collective refund.\n\nThe report, released Wednesday, is titled “More for Them, Less for US: Corporations That Pay Their Executives More Than Uncle Sam.” It comes from the Institute for Policy Studies, a nonprofit, left-leaning think tank, and Americans for Tax Fairness, a nonprofit advocating for progressive tax reform.\n\n“Lavish corporate compensation packages and inadequate corporate tax payments are not unrelated phenomena,” the report states.\n\nCorporate boards “have more money to spend on their highest-paid employees when they don’t have much or anything to pay in taxes. Until this self-reinforcing cycle is broken, we’ll have a corporate tax and governance system that works for top executives – and no one else.”\n\nNetflix, for example, paid its five top executives $652 million between 2018 and 2022, the report says, while paying only $236 million in cumulative federal income tax in the same years.\n\nIn response, the streaming company said, “Netflix complies with tax laws and regulations in the US and around the world. From 2018-2022 we paid global income taxes in excess of $2B and in 2023 we paid nearly $1.2B in global income taxes, the majority of which was US federal income tax.”\n\nAnother firm targeted in the report is FirstEnergy, the electric utility. According to the watchdog groups, FirstEnergy paid $121 million in executive compensation over five years, compared with $44 million in federal income tax, a net refund.\n\nFirstEnergy responded with a prepared statement.\n\n\"FirstEnergy pays taxes in compliance with federal, state and local tax laws. In addition to federal taxes, the company pays hundreds of millions in state, local and payroll taxes every year,\" it said.\n\nThe company said its executive pay programs are \"carefully designed to attract, retain, focus and reward our talented and diverse executive team,\" and that shareholders overwhelmingly support the firm's compensation structure.\n\nThe report also names Duke Energy, saying the firm paid $181 million to top executives over five years, compared with $1.2 billion in federal income taxes, a net refund.\n\nIn response, the company said, \"Duke Energy fully complies with federal and state tax laws as part of our efforts to make investments that will benefit our customers and communities. Duke Energy has a deferred tax balance – this does not mean Duke Energy is not paying these taxes, it means that our taxes are due in future years, and we will pay them. We have approximately $10.6 billion in deferred tax liabilities related to investments in the energy system on behalf of our customers.\"\n\nThe utility said it is investing private capital in \"our nation’s critical energy infrastructure,\" a corporate practice incentivized by the current federal tax code.\n\n\"It’s also important to note that at the state and local levels, we are often the largest taxpayer in many of those communities and much of the taxes paid are directed toward local services,\" the company said.\n\nSeveral other firms did not comment on the report.\n\nThe watchdog report draws on recent research by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, another nonprofit, left-leaning think tank. That group found 342 large corporations that paid a cumulative effective tax rate of 14.1% over five years, well short of the statutory corporate tax rate of 21%.\n\nThe data in the report come from financial documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Compensation figures include base salary, cash bonuses, perks, stock options, stock awards and changes in the value of retirement benefits.\n\nReport: 18 corporations paid no federal income tax in 5-year stretch\n\nThe new report cites 18 profitable corporations that paid no federal income tax in the five-year period. Instead, all but one received refunds. The same corporations paid their top executives a cumulative $5.3 billion in those years.\n\nThe watchdog report comes as the Internal Revenue Service is ramping up audits of large businesses and high-income Americans, leveraging billions in new funding from Congress.\n\nPresident Joe Biden added nearly $80 billion in IRS funding to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 with the hope that the investment would recoup as much as $400 billion over the next decade in unpaid taxes from wealthy people and companies.\n\nThe watchdog report charts a decadeslong decline in the tax rates paid by corporations. The top statutory tax rate has declined from 51% in 1986 to 21% today, according to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.\n\nCorporations also avoid taxes by shifting profits offshore, among other loopholes, the report says.\n\nWhile corporate tax revenue has stagnated, the report says, executive pay has skyrocketed. The typical CEO compensation package reached $14.8 million in 2022, according to The Associated Press, compared with $77,178 for the average worker in those companies.\n\nNot all economists agree with the report's conclusions.\n\nKyle Pomerleau, senior fellow at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute, said low corporate tax rates reflect big corporations doing what they can to reduce their tax burden, just like ordinary taxpayers.\n\n\"These low effective tax rates are not reflective of tax evasion,\" he said. \"It's tax avoidance. Tax evasion is illegal. Tax avoidance is legal.\" Whether you're a business or a private citizen, he said, \"if there's a tax credit or deduction you're entitled to, you're going to take it.\"\n\nPomerleau said many corporate tax breaks, such as tax credits for research and development, are tailored to encourage \"activities that have a broad positive effect on the economy.\"\n\nWhich firms spend more on executive pay than income tax?\n\nHere are snapshots of 10 large corporations, spotlighted in the watchdog report, whose executive pay reportedly exceeds their federal income tax payments.\n\nTesla\n\n5-year executive pay: $2.5 billion\n\n5-year federal income tax (and tax rate): -$1 million (0%)\n\nT-Mobile\n\n5-year executive pay: $675 million\n\n5-year federal income tax (and tax rate): -$80 million (-0.4%)\n\nNetflix\n\n5-year executive pay: $652 million\n\n5-year federal income tax (and tax rate): $236 million (1.6%)\n\nAmerican International Group\n\n5-year executive pay: $406 million\n\n5-year federal income tax (and tax rate): $385 million (2.2%)\n\nFord Motor\n\n5-year executive pay: $355 million\n\n5-year federal income tax (and tax rate): $121 million (1.5%)\n\nNextEra Energy\n\n5-year executive pay: $325 million\n\n5-year federal income tax (and tax rate): $287 million (1.2%)\n\nDarden Restaurants\n\n5-year executive pay: $120 million\n\n5-year federal income tax (and tax rate): $28 million (0.8%)\n\nMetLife\n\n5-year executive pay: $240 million\n\n5-year federal income tax (and tax rate): $96 million (0.8%)\n\nDuke Energy\n\n5-year executive pay: $181 million\n\n5-year federal income tax (and tax rate): -$1.2 billion (-7.9%)\n\nFirstEnergy\n\n5-year executive pay: $121 million\n\n5-year federal income tax (and tax rate): -$44 million (-0.7%)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/10/30/trump-reduced-access-to-overtime-project-2025-would-go-further/75795188007/", "title": "Trump reduced access to overtime pay as president. Project 2025 ...", "text": "Bryce Covert\n\nCapital & Main\n\nThis article was produced by the nonprofit journalism publication Capital & Main and is co-published here with permission.\n\nThough former President Donald Trump presents himself as a champion of the working class with promises to cut taxes on overtime, his record as both a businessman and president paints a different picture.\n\nTrump and his businesses have faced multiple accusations of failing to pay workers the overtime they were owed. Once he was in office, Trump’s Department of Labor issued a rule that reduced by millions the number of workers who would have become eligible for overtime pay under an Obama era rule.\n\nProject 2025, a Heritage Foundation blueprint for a potential second Trump term that the former president has alternately embraced and distanced himself from, goes even further. The 900-page document outlines plans for a sweeping overhaul of overtime protections that would give employers ways to avoid paying overtime to workers who have long qualified for time-and-a-half pay after 40 hours.\n\nWhen asked for comment on this story, including about Trump’s overtime proposals and the lawsuits against his businesses, a Trump campaign spokesperson replied only, “Project 2025 has nothing to do with the campaign.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Heritage Foundation, the think tank behind Project 2025, previously declined to comment on policy specifics when asked by Capital & Main, and added, “Project 2025 does not speak for President Trump or his campaign.” At least 140 people who worked for Trump were involved in crafting Project 2025, however, and in 2022 Trump said the Heritage Foundation was “going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.”\n\nOne worker who stands to suffer the financial consequences if Project 2025’s proposals become reality is Theresa Kinard. After working for 15 years at a Waffle House in Marietta, Georgia, her base pay is still $19 an hour. “It’s just not enough,” she noted. Even though her adult daughter also works at Waffle House, they have to live together “in order for both of us to survive,” she said.\n\nStill, Kinard’s pay stretches a bit further thanks to overtime. She’s scheduled to work 40 hours a week, and without overtime, she would earn an annual income of $39,520. But her restaurant is so short-staffed that she is always asked to work longer, earning her time-and-a-half pay for the extra shifts she takes on each week. At $28.50 an hour, the additional 10-15 overtime hours add up to about $400 a week.\n\n“Overtime, it helps a lot,” she said. “Without it, a lot of things wouldn’t get taken care of.” She would be short on paying each month’s bills, such as her car note or car insurance, or she wouldn’t be able to afford all of her groceries. Losing access to overtime pay could “possibly mean eviction,” she said, or it “could possibly mean me losing my car.”\n\nLosing overtime pay “would hinder us really bad,” she said. It’s a possibility she and millions of other Americans may face if a second Trump term mirrors the first and if he adopts the recommendations on overtime outlined in Chapter 18 of the Project 2025 blueprint.\n\nThe Project 2025 plan\n\nProject 2025 calls for undoing the Biden administration’s overtime pay expansions and also proposes ways for employers to avoid paying it to those who do qualify, eroding its status as a bedrock labor protection.\n\nIn each of Project 2025’s overtime provisions, “Workers do not get any additional benefits. It is only employers who get additional benefits,” said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with Economic Policy Institute Action, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on economic issues. Employers are granted various ways to avoid paying extra for extra work while benefiting from a worker’s labor. “It is an extremely anti-overtime agenda,” she said.\n\nDonald J. Boudreaux, a professor of economics at George Mason University, sees reducing overtime eligibility and requirements as a positive for workers. He argues that the American labor market is functioning well and employers must compete to attract talent. Given that, those employers that don’t offer adequate overtime will be “out-competed” by those who do. If the government intervenes, on the other hand, to mandate overtime pay for more workers, “You can bet there will be a reduction in workers’ pay,” he said, to offset that cost.\n\nBut Shierholz pushed back on the idea that workers and employers bring equal power to the table when setting compensation, pointing to rampant wage theft as evidence.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020, more than $3 billion was recovered in stolen wages, some of it from employers failing to pay overtime due to eligible workers. “If workers and employers really were on a level playing field, you just wouldn’t be seeing those kinds of numbers,” she said.\n\nWhile research on overtime requirements is limited, studies on minimum wage increases show they generally do not reduce pay or jobs. Those findings suggest that “there are huge swaths” of the labor market that lack competitiveness, and workers benefit from higher government standards and enforcement to ensure fair pay, Shierholz added.\n\nOvertime is “just an absolutely core labor standard,” said Shierholz. If an employer decides to ask employees to “add chaos to their lives” by putting in unusually long hours, she noted, overtime ensures “workers don’t work those hours for free.” It also puts a check on long hours – other employers will decide they would rather not pay extra and cap employees’ hours at 40 a week. When the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed in 1938, enshrining the right to overtime pay as well as the minimum wage, it helped standardize the workweek at eight hours a day, five days a week.\n\nWhile in office, Trump refused to support an Obama-era rule that would have expanded overtime pay to an additional 4 million workers. Instead, Trump issued his own rule that significantly reduced the number of people eligible for overtime, extending protections to only 1.3 million additional workers.\n\nAfter Trump left office, President Joe Biden finalized his own overtime rule, which this summer adjusted Trump’s $35,568 salary threshold for overtime pay eligibility to account for inflation. Biden’s rule will again raise the salary threshold from $43,888 to $58,656 by January 2025. Additionally, it mandates that the threshold be updated every three years to keep pace with inflation. Once fully implemented, 4.3 million more workers will be eligible for overtime pay when they work more than 40 hours a week.\n\nProject 2025 calls for reversing course yet again, saying the next Republican president should eliminate Biden’s overtime rule and return to the Trump administration version, with updates to account for inflation only every five years. Doing that would make Kinard and other workers like her who qualify under Biden’s actions no longer eligible for extra pay.\n\nThe document then goes further, calling on Congress to let employers calculate overtime pay over two or four weeks instead of one. While the document says this would give workers “greater flexibility,” in practice, workers would end up earning less. An employee who works 45 hours one week and 35 the next would earn overtime pay for those extra five hours in the first week under current law, but if averaged over two wouldn’t get any extra pay at all. “Employers would be able to game that like crazy,” Shierholz said. They could ask workers to put in incredibly long hours one week “and then smooth out their hours over the following week or weeks so that they just would never get paid overtime.”\n\nThose two provisions together – rolling back Biden’s rule and allowing employers to calculate overtime pay over more weeks – would strip overtime protection from 8 million workers, according to an analysis by Economic Policy Institute Action, which Shierholz characterized as a “super conservative estimate.”\n\nTrading overtime pay for time off\n\nProject 2025 contains other ideas that would similarly erode overtime pay and protections.\n\nIt calls for letting workers trade their overtime pay for paid time off. While on its surface the proposal seems to offer workers paid time off, which many Americans lack, it’s instead about allowing workers to “swap pay for time,” said Lynn Rhinehart, a senior fellow at the Economic Policy Institute. “It’s deceitful.”\n\nEmployers can already offer to let workers accrue paid leave when they put in extra hours under current law. This provision instead “gives workers no additional benefits,” Shierholz said. “It only gives employers extra rights.” Employers would have the power to dictate when workers would give up extra pay for leave. Workers would also have to ask employers to use the comp time they had saved up, and there is no requirement that they be allowed to when they need it.\n\nThe conservative blueprint says that Congress should pass legislation denying overtime pay for people who work remotely unless they log 10 hours every day – meaning someone who worked nine hours every day, five days a week, would not receive any extra pay for those additional five hours worked beyond 40.\n\nProject 2025 also calls for allowing unions to negotiate over existing workplace laws – including the minimum wage and overtime – instead of treating them as floors.\n\nThat would force unions to negotiate over what have long been considered minimum workplace standards. The provision is a “doozy,” Shierholz said, because it “just robs power from workers” while giving employers “a new bargaining chip.”\n\nFinally, it says states should be given waivers from federal labor laws to “encourage experimentation.” One of those would likely be the Fair Labor Standards Act, allowing states to grant businesses exceptions from overtime pay and the minimum wage, Shierholz said.\n\nRecently, while on the campaign trail, Trump floated a proposal to shield overtime pay from taxation. Analyses by the Budget Lab at Yale University and the Tax Foundation have found that, if such legislation were to be introduced and passed by Congress, it would be extremely expensive, costing hundreds of billions of dollars in lost tax revenue over a decade.\n\nThose estimates are very conservative, however, because they do not account for how highly paid workers could game the system by converting their pay to a low hourly rate and reaping the tax-free benefits of all overtime pay above that.\n\n“I think it is very, very unserious,” Shierholz said. “It’s super cynical. He has undermined overtime and workers left and right.”\n\nTrump has been accused personally of failing to pay workers. His companies were cited for 24 violations of overtime or minimum wage protections between 2005 and 2016, according to Department of Labor data analyzed by USA TODAY.\n\nA lawsuit in the early 1980s alleged his real estate company paid Polish immigrant contractors only $4-$5 an hour without overtime pay, even though they were working 12 hours a day, seven days a week. Some workers said they were never paid at all. The lawsuit ended in a sealed settlement.\n\nGuy Dorcinvil, a dishwasher at Mar-a-Lago, filed a lawsuit in 2007 alleging he hadn’t been paid overtime he was due over a period of three years, ending in a $7,500 settlement the next year. In 2016 Trump Miami Resort Management LLC settled with 48 servers for failure to pay overtime, paying an average of $800 per worker. The lawsuit alleged that some workers put in 20-hour days over a 10-day event.\n\nIn response to reporting about the last two lawsuits, Trump insisted that all contractors and employees are paid fairly and that the complaints represent a small fraction of his business dealings.\n\nTaken together, Trump’s past business practices, his presidency and the Project 2025 agenda indicate a focus on eroding overtime protection. “The ability to get overtime is security and stability,” noted Janelle Jones, vice president of policy and advocacy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. Project 2025 attacks workers’ “paychecks, their economic safety and security.”\n\nCopyright 2024 Capital & Main", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/08/26/kim-reynolds-iowa-unemployment-news-no-overtime-pay-iwd-worker/3437298001/", "title": "Iowa unemployment agency worker: No overtime pay for extra hours", "text": "CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story contained an error.

Know your rights | CNN Business", "text": "The abrupt and unceremonious way that thousands of Twitter employees got laid off last week was a spectacle.\n\nBut it was also a helpful reminder that while employers can get rid of many workers at will (and with zero graciousness), employees are not without rights when they are laid off en masse.\n\nHere’s a quick primer on what employees need to know.\n\nHow much advance notice should I get?\n\nFor a plant closing or a mass layoff, you should get at least 60 days notice, under the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. Some states may require more notice – New York, for instance, requires 90 days. And states also may set stricter standards than the federal law, such as requiring employers with fewer workers to comply with the WARN Act.\n\nIf an employer is found to have violated the WARN Act, in addition to paying penalties to the state, it will be required to pay out up to 60 days (or more, depending on the state requirement) of back wages and benefits to those laid off, depending on how many days’ notice the company actually gave.\n\n“Notice” in this instance means notifying the community at large but also each individual who will be laid off, said employment attorney Michael DuPont, who is managing shareholder at the Minnesota-based law firm Wagner, Falconer & Judd and also provides legal services through LegalShield.\n\nIf a company lays you off abruptly, it may be found to have complied with the WARN Act so long as the effective date of your layoff is at least 60 days after the day you got notice that you’re being let go, said employment attorney Alex Granovsky, cofounder of the New York-based law firm Granovsky & Sundaresh.\n\nTechnically you will remain on the company’s payroll and will continue to receive pay and benefits in the interim, and then any severance you’re given would kick in.\n\nHow much severance am I entitled to?\n\nUn-fun fact: No law – federal or state – requires employers to offer you any severance when they lay you off, unless you have a union or individual employment contract that includes a provision for it.\n\nThat said, many employers do offer some form of severance to protect themselves from any potential legal claims you might bring as a result of your employment or termination.\n\nA second reason many offer severance: “Good will and fairness to the employees and to the community as a whole. To offer additional compensation in recognition of the potentially tough time the employee and community would [experience],” DuPont said.\n\nWhat do I give up in exchange for accepting severance?\n\nAn employer will want you to waive certain rights in exchange for money.\n\nPut bluntly, “the company covers itself in every way a former employee can hurt [it],” Granovsky said.\n\nGenerally speaking you will waive your right to bring a claim against the company, such as discrimination, hostile work environment, pay violations or any other alleged wrongdoing.\n\nYou also typically will need to agree to several clauses that prohibit you from harming the company, he said. They include:\n\nA confidentiality clause: This clause prohibits you from sharing details of the company’s business or even the terms of your severance agreement.\n\nA non-disparagement clause: This prohibits you from badmouthing the place.\n\nA cooperation clause: You agree to assist the company if it gets sued in the future over a matter that you know something about as a result of your tenure there.\n\nA non-cooperation clause: This prohibits you from helping anyone else trying to sue the company.\n\nA non-solicitation clause: This typically means you can’t poach your soon-to-be former employer’s clients or employees should you start working elsewhere or launch your own business.\n\nWaiving these types of rights does not, however, excuse the employer from having to pay you what is already owed, such as a pension or earned vacation or sick leave. “The consideration offered for the waiver of the right to sue … must be something of value in addition to any of the employee’s existing entitlements,” the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) notes.\n\nCan I negotiate the terms of the severance?\n\nIf you think you have legitimate claims against the company, your employer would almost certainly rather you not sue, so it will likely be more open to negotiating the terms of your severance instead.\n\n“A company would rather pay $100 now to avoid having to pay $150 later,” DuPont said.\n\nIf you don’t have a strong case that could justify filing a lawsuit, which you could use as a bargaining chip, you can still try to make the case for why your employer might sweeten your severance package.\n\n“Asking is fine. You should ask. There’s no harm in asking,” Granovsky said.\n\nYou might ask for more months of paid health benefits if you or a family member on your insurance plan is battling cancer, DuPont noted as an example. Or if you’re a long-term employee in good standing or you have a special skill set that the employer might want to tap in the future, you might make a compelling case for why the company should offer you some additional pay.\n\nShould I hire a lawyer?\n\nSince a severance agreement is an important legal document that will affect your immediate future, it can be helpful to have an employment lawyer with experience in severance cases review the company’s offer.\n\nIf hiring a lawyer directly is too expensive, you might consider a less expensive service like LegalShield, which only charges about $30 a month to gain access to an employment attorney in your state who can review your offer, make sure it complies with the law and make a call on your behalf to your employer if you’re seeking modifications to the agreement.\n\nIf your case is complicated and involves further legal action, or if your severance agreement is more than 15 pages long, your costs will be higher, but you will get a discount on the hourly fees of the lawyer on your case.\n\nOr, if you just have some very simple questions, some employment lawyers might offer a free consultation by phone.\n\nHow long will I have to decide whether to accept a severance package?\n\nUnder federal laws, if you’re 40 or older, you must be given at least 45 days in a group termination (21 days if your layoff is not part of a mass layoff) to decide whether to sign your severance agreement.\n\nIn either case, if you accept the offer you also must be given a 7-day period afterward to change your mind.\n\nThat said, each state may have its own requirements above the federal minimum requirements, DuPont said. So check your state’s Department of Labor site to see what its specific requirements are.\n\nWill I lose my severance if I start earning income again?\n\nMany employers may stop your severance payments if the company rehires you for a new position.\n\nIf you find a job elsewhere or start freelancing for others, some employers may choose to reduce your severance payments if your new source of income is less than what you used to be paid.\n\n“They may say, ‘If you make less money we’ll only pay the delta,’” Granovsky said.\n\nIn either case, your severance agreement should state explicitly what the employer’s policy is. So don’t sign it until you’re clear about those terms.\n\nBut if the agreement is silent on the issue then you likely may continue to receive your full severance while also earning income from another source. “So that’s a win for the employee,” DuPont said.", "authors": ["Jeanne Sahadi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/03/21/amazon-gives-warehouse-workers-temporary-covid-19-overtime-pay-raise/2891603001/", "title": "Amazon gives warehouse workers temporary COVID-19 overtime ...", "text": "Amazon told U.S. warehouse workers it’s temporarily raising their overtime pay as they wrestle with a flood of orders from people hunkered down in their homes during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nInstead of time-and-a-half for every hour worked over 40 hours in a work week, warehouse workers will receive double their hourly rate until May 9, the online retailer said.\n\nThe temporary overtime pay hike took effect March 15, the company said.

Executive Director Jermaine Alerta said the Legislature had been working to pay employees of the new legislative term on Friday, covering the 40-hour work week that started Jan. 2.\n\nAlerta said the Legislature gets paid every other Tuesday, but a lack of manpower and delays in obtaining some of the newer employees’ paperwork prevented all staff from getting paid this week.\n\n“This week we were trying to make sure that we were going to meet payroll,” Alerta said. “So we had some new staff and lots of the senatorial offices were having to submit their paperwork. It was the manpower that was the problem.

Evans' tale is told by Tom Carter who previously published \"Unsavory Elements: Stories of Foreigners on the Loose in China.\"\n\nInitially, I'd planned to run a review of the book back in December that didn't end up finding its way to print. It was a topical read at the time with the Hong Kong protests in the news cycle and — while Hong Kong hasn't been the focus of recent coverage — China's arguably in the news cycle even more now than it was then.\n\n\"Bedlam\" by Kenneth Paul Rosenberg, MD\n\nGenre: Nonfiction Length: ~200 pages\n\nThe full title of the text is \"Bedlam: An Intimate Journey Into America's Mental Health Crisis.\" Rosenberg's book is intended to give readers an inside look at the American mental health system and its failings. After seven years of interviews, the book uses those accounts to shine a light on the criminalization of individuals with mental health issues among other topics.\n\nThis book and the author behind it are the exact kinds of things I love to cover. When it was first delivered to our office I showed it to everyone in the newsroom. The only reason why it's not pending on my personal reading list is I'm not sure I have the emotional fortitude to read about institutional, systemic failure, especially at this particular moment.\n\n\"Bloody Genius\" by John Sanford\n\nGenre: Mystery Length: ~375 pages\n\nThis is the most recent Virgil Flowers novel from New York Times bestselling author John Sanford, marking the 12th novel in a series that started in 2007 with \"Dark of the Moon.\" In this particular book, a culture war on a state campus between the science and medical departments is interrupted when a scholar turns up dead. Enter the series investigator Virgil Flowers, tasked with finding the killer.\n\nWhile this title was briefly alluded to in my write-up on the 2019 Iowa City Book Festival, it didn't end up receiving full coverage, even though Sanford is a Cedar Rapids native and University of Iowa grad. This fell by the wayside for me at the time partly because of my own ignorance of Sanford being a local name and the sheer volume of events surrounding the book festival.\n\n\"Deacon King Kong\" by James McBride\n\nGenre: Historical Fiction Length: ~375 pages\n\nSet in September of 1969, \"Deacon King Kong\" starts with the deacon of Five Ends Baptist Church shooting a 19-year-old-drug dealer in the face in South Brooklyn.

Second, I don't know that I could justify a picture book review to my editor as the four- to six-year-old age range does not make up a huge amount of our readership.\n\nBut now I can, so here's my one-paragraph review:\n\nAs a book about a bunch of kids stuck inside who turn to their grandude to entertain them, I think this book will resonate with kids in this very specific moment in time. While the plot is somewhat aimless, it's a fun read with pretty illustrations that takes its characters to the beach, to the American West and to the mountainside. All through the aid of a magic compass.\n\n\"The Mountains Sing\" by Nguyen Phan Que Mail\n\nGenre: Historical Fiction Length: ~350 pages\n\nThe 11th book from Nguyen Phan Que Mai, \"The Mountains Sing\" follow the Tran family as they navigate their way through a Vietnam wrapped in War.

I have never read this book, but, for what it's worth, it comes with my highest recommendation.\n\n\"One Night At the Lake\" by Bethany Chase\n\nGenre: Fiction Length: ~275 pages\n\nThe jacket description of this book pitches two straight forward premises. The first: Leah has been dating Ollie for four years and, upon being invited to his family's lake house, she suspects he's going to propose. The second: June is visiting her fiance's Ollie's lake house, \"a house haunted by long-buried memories of her lost friend\" Leah.\n\nIf this wasn't the first novel that hit my desk after I started at the P-C last year, it's one of the first. But I'd completely forgotten about it until I started putting this list together. It's not usually the kind of thing I'd go for, but if the description appeals to you, it strikes me as the kind of book that would be a pleasant distraction during turbulent times.\n\n\"Pitty the Reader\" by Kurt Vonnegut and Suzanne McConnel\n\nGenre: Nonfiction Length: ~375 pages\n\nHalf of this book's authorship is renowned author Kurt Vonnegut, the other half is Suzanne McConnell who was a student of Vonnegut's at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. The latter has collected everything she can about what Vonnegut as a teacher regarding the craft of writing.\n\nI seem to have a problem with not reading books by Kurt Vonnegut. I've been told I'd love \"Slaughterhouse-Five,\" which has nonetheless been gathering dust on my personal shelf for ages. Of all the books on my P-C shelf though, this is maybe the one I was most hoping to read most of all, and was only reminded of as I started to put together this list.\n\n\"Real Life\" by Brandon Taylor\n\nGenre: Fiction Length: ~325 pages\n\nThis is a story about an Alabama-born protagonist, Wallace, and his navigating of his sexuality and self-preservation while at a Midwestern university. Author Brandon Taylor is a staff writer Literary Hub and a graduate of the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. He read from this book at Prairie Lights in February.\n\nSometimes I like to imagine alternate realities. While putting this article together, I wonder if the version of me that's read all these books is a happier person. I feel like he is. I feel like he's somehow more attractive too. Yet, despite being interested and having months of notice, I slept on this book and ended up not writing any local coverage.\n\nIf you're interested in reading, this is your chance to not be like this realities me. Be like alternate-universe, happy/handsome me.\n\n\"These Boys and Their Fathers\" by Don Waters\n\nGenre: Memoir Length: ~250 pages\n\nA 2010 mission self-set by author Don Waters was \"to write a magazine story about a surfing icon who had known his absentee father\".\" That resulted in the investigative and introspective memoir we have today.\n\nThe book was published by the University of Iowa Press last year and Waters was another attendee of the Iowa City Book Festival who went uncovered by the P-C. From the very little I've read, the books seems to be in a similar vein as \"The Glass Castle\" by Jeannette Walls.\n\n\"Time After Time\" by Lisa Grunwald\n\nGenre: Fiction Length: ~400 pages\n\nThe release for this one pitches this love story as a fusion of \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" and \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.\" Joe is a railroad man and Nora is an aspiring artist who discover's she is stuck, in a very real sense, in Grand Central Terminal by a force she doesn't understand. The narrative charts the relationship between the two over roughly a decade.\n\nGod, I love the cover and title of this book. Yet another example of a text I'm not particularly inclined toward that I can't help but want to read whenever it catches my eye. Once again we see a character who is stuck in a place and, maybe it's just because of the time and place we're all currently stuck in, but that resonates.\n\n\"Surfside Sisters\" by Nancy Thayer\n\nGenre: Fiction Length: ~300 pages\n\nProtagonist Keely Green grew up in Nantucket with her best friend, Isabelle, with dreams of becoming a novelist. Years later she's achieved those dreams and is living the glamorous big city life of a successful New York novelist. Her dream life is interrupted by the one-two punch of her editor passing on her novel and her mom's health declining, forcing her to return to Nantucket to things she thought she'd put behind her.\n\nTechnically I have two Nancy Thayer books on my desk. (This and \"Let It Snow\" a Christmas themed novel.) But coverage for one of them felt like enough for our purposes here. I don't know much about Thayer, but going through the press releases included with her work here I've discovered she's famous for capturing the \"natural beauty\" of Nantucket. So for those of you stuck inside and wishing you were somehow in Nantucket, Thay surely has a book for you.\n\n\"When You Learn the Alphabet\" by Kendra Allen\n\nGenre: Nonfiction Length: ~150 pages\n\nA book of essays focusing on the parental relationships of author Kendra Allen, this shortish book touches on a wide array of topics. Marriage, race, mental health and feminism are just a few of the themes interwoven throughout the book.\n\nLike \"Bloody Genius\" this is one I didn't get a chance to cover in full because of the local event relating to it being positioned during the local literary festival. That said I've only heard good things and if someone demanded why I hadn't read this yet I would probably mutter something about \"having a lot on my plate\" and then failing to go to sleep because I'm questioning internally why I haven't read this book.\n\nIsaac Hamlet covers arts, entertainment and culture at the Press-Citizen.

If you’ve visited the library lately, you may have noticed staff sporting buttons with lines such as “Ask me what I’ve been reading” or “Ask me for suggestions,” designed to help stimulate conversations around the amazing items you may have missed.\n\nHere are a few highlights from the ICPL collection that I’ve promoted to patrons:\n\nNew Amsterdam Records recently released contemporary classical New York composer Missy Mazzoli’s “Vespers for a New Dark Age.” This piece is a collaboration between Mazzoli’s Victoire ensemble (vocalists, violin, clarinet, keyboards and double bass), Wilco percussionist Glenn Kotche, keyboard/synthesizer/producer Lorna Dune and three vocalists from Roomful of Teeth. Mazzoli designed this as a reinterpretation of a traditional Vespers evening prayer with hymns taken from the poetry of Matthew Zapruder (also found in our collection).\n\n“Vespers for a New Dark Age” consists of five movements, three interludes that serve to reinforce the musical themes, and a “remix” closing piece that, although not written with the others, sounds perfectly at home here.\n\nTerse violin and clarinet often are “speaking” over a keyboard or bass rumble, as if mimicking New York evening urban soundscapes. The lyrics are often addressed to a divine entity or ghosts, they confront loneliness and loss in a modern world, an operatic voice pleads, “Hello Lord, sorry I woke you because my plans are important to me and I need things no one can buy and don’t even know what they are.” Overall there is a romantic feeling to this music and it’s very accessible to listeners who generally stay away from classical music and prefer pop/rock song structures.\n\nShort story author Kelly Link has published a new book, “Get In Trouble: Stories.” This collection mostly reads as dark fairy tales or modern and nontraditional ghost stories often featuring adolescent protagonists making poor choices.\n\nThe opening story, “The Summer People,” concerns two rural teens tentatively forging an unlikely friendship while tending to a house occupied by fae/demon/alien visitors. The ghost story “I Can See Right Through You” follows an actor once famous for his “Twilight”-esque movie series attempting to rekindle a relationship with his co-star at a nudist colony, the setting of an episode for her psychic reality show.\n\nLink skillfully describes the paranoia that came with success: “Everyone watches you. Even when they’re pretending not to. Even when they aren’t watching you, you think they are. ... Becoming famous, this kind of fame: it’s luck indistinguishable from catastrophe.”\n\nThere’s plenty of humor scattered in with the disconcerting “Secret Identity,” set in a hotel hosting two conferences, one for dentists and the other for superheroes. “Men and women, oral surgeons, eighth-dimensional entities, mutants, and freaks who want to save your teeth, save the world, and maybe end up with a television show, too.”\n\nIf you appreciate short story authors like Aimee Bender, George Saunders or Karen Russell, you’ll want to check out this collection.\n\nJason Paulios is an adult services librarian at the Iowa City Public Library.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/04/13/minnesota-books-fiction-murder-thriller/497267002/", "title": "List of Minnesota-set fictional books", "text": "I am an Oregon girl, through and through. As of three months ago, I had never lived anywhere else. I had indulged my adventurous side only through short-lived vacations, traveling to places like Boston, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. I had burned my feet on the hot rock sands of Mexico, and traversed across five European countries with a backpack half my size on my shoulders.\n\nBut I never stayed in any new place long enough to plant roots.\n\nThen, in a decision driven by the need for change, I packed as many of my worldly belongings as would fit in my small Toyota Corolla and moved to Minnesota.\n\nAnd just days before I was about to turn the key in the ignition and start my new life, I realized: I knew nothing about the Midwest — beside the fact that it snows, a lot.\n\nBefore I left, I started trying to understand Minnesota by scouring shelves for books set in Minnesota, hoping to get some context, albeit based in fiction.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nIt didn’t take long for me to question my sanity in making this move once I found there is an abundance of murder-mysteries that take place in Minnesota woods. Seriously, there are A LOT of murder ideas coming out of this snowy state. It’s unsettling.\n\nEventually though, I found books with the potential of giving me a less-terrifying insight to the area. Below is what I found.\n\nThis list is by no means a comprehensive one. These books just jumped out at me as interesting for different moods and reading preferences. Also, as a basis for finding more popular novels, I turned to the expansive book-nerd website Goodreads. All the books here are written by popular authors and rated highly by 9,000 people or more.\n\nFor the Midwest hipster:\n\n\"Freedom\" by Jonathan Franzen\n\nGenre: Fiction / Goodreads score: ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆\n\n\n\nFranzen’s novel climbed to fame in 2010 after landing in the national spotlight as that year’s selection for Oprah’s Book Club. Taking place in St. Paul, the story looks at characters Patty and Walter Berglund who were the “gentrifiers, the hands-on parents, the avant-garde of the Whole Goods generation,” as described on the inside cover flap synopsis.\n\nAt first glance, this couple of characters screamed idealistic in their prime. But not anymore.\n\nWith the turning of the years, their seemingly shiny, model way of life and marriage flips on its head as they have to learn how to deal with a changing America. The book looks at all the aspects (good and bad) of what having “freedom” really means.\n\nBased on reviews, there seems to be hardly any middle ground for Franzen’s readers. You either love this book, or you hate it. While most seem to fall into the former, you can decide for yourself.\n\nFor the foodie:\n\n\"Kitchens of the Great Midwest\" by J. Ryan Stradal\n\nGenre: Fiction, Food / Goodreads score: ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆\n\n\n\nThis book seems to have all the components of a feel-good novel. Lars Thorvald’s wife has fallen in love with wine – and, unfortunately, the steward behind the bottle ­– leaving Lars to go forward as a single dad to their daughter, Eva. Using his chef skills to heal, he begins teaching Eva the tricks of his trade. As she grows up, she develops a love for food and finds home in them as part of her Midwest style – lutefisk, habanero peppers and peanut butter bars from the Lutheran church bake sale.\n\nWritten as a series of short vignettes if you will, Eva’s life comes into focus with each new chapter told from the perspectives of different people she’s come across in her life, the image of her character sharpening with each new addition.\n\nAlso, the book is jammed with vivid food imagery like butter melting on warm bread to describe the feeling of love. So prepare snacks ahead of time before cracking into this one.\n\nFor the rosé reader:\n\n\"Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons\" by Lorna Landvik\n\nGenre: Fiction, Chick-Lit / Goodreads score: ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆\n\n\n\nAt first glance, this book is \"Big Little Lies\" meets \"Beaches\" with a meta twist. The story follows five Minnesota women who together form a book club called AHEB (Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons) to spite one of their husbands who insists that’s all these women are. The name sticks and over time the club turns out to be the place they can run to for much more than book discussions.\n\nThere are characters like Slip, a small woman who, despite her size, doesn’t shy from confrontation, and Kari, a soft, wise widow. They are examples of counterpoints interacting in a way that works. The story follows the starkly different women through the ebbs and flows of life, like new jobs, marriage troubles and grandchildren, while they laugh and learn from each other along the way.\n\nClocking in at about 500 pages, this book could take you some time and several bottles of wine to finish. But it’s a tale of prevailing friendship over time, written for Midwest women by a Midwest woman, so feel free to break out the dessert and pop the cork over the pages with your own girlfriends.\n\nFor the time traveler:\n\n\"Ordinary Grace\" by William Kent Krueger\n\nGenre: Historical Fiction/ murder / Goodreads score: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\n\n\nFor those who read to be transported, consider going back to the year 1961 in the latest of Krueger’s only two stand-alone novels.\n\n\"Ordinary Grace\" is told from the perspective of narrator Frank Drum, who opens the book 40 years after the fact, and throws readers in reverse to a time when he was a young boy in New Bremen, Minnesota.\n\nDrum shows us the members of his family through hindsight vision, and his life growing up a middle child between a stuttering, smart younger brother and a Julliard-bound older sister. When unexpected death rocks their small community, the book grapples with themes of grief, secrets and dealing with loss. This book is about growing up and looking back on what that meant 40 years later.\n\nThis book has an air of nostalgia for a “simpler time.” It recalls the images of days packed with riding your bike and sipping root beers. It’s a life and feeling of freedom even those who didn’t live it can picture and relate to what it must have felt like to have it change. This book is Minnesota from another time between your fingertips.\n\nFor the Sherlock:\n\n\"Monkeewrench\" by P.J. Tracy\n\nGenre: Mystery, Thriller / Goodreads score: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\nReminiscent of the Netflix show “Black Mirror,” this book echoes the theme of how seemingly innocent technology can invite real-life chaos and destruction. This time, it’s through the entertainment realm of a new computer game created by a team of game developers called Monkeewrench. The game is “Serial Killer Detective” and allows players to follow detailed clues and evidence, tracking down the game’s killer through a series of fake digital murders.\n\nBut soon after the game’s release, two real-life murders are committed. When the details are revealed, the team realizes that they’ve seen these scenes before — they perfectly mimic the first two stages of their game.\n\nReaders follow a detective as he tries to solve the mystery of these murders and watch members of Monkeewrench wrestle with whether to tell the Minneapolis police about the connection. Even beyond the present-day puzzle, members of Monkeewrench have dark mysteries of their own from the past that creep into the narrative. The authors of the book (yes, plural) even lend themselves to a bit of secrecy — it is actually mother-daughter duo using one pseudonym.\n\nThis book combines the thrill of the Minnesota murder-mystery with the complexity of technology, being the choice for a reader who likes to string the clues together themselves.\n\nNow after checking out other depictions of the state, it's clear to me there is much more to Minnesota than mysterious people lurking in the dark — though you still won't convince me to take a weekend trip into the woods here.\n\nSo, what do you think about this Oregonian's picks?

Twenty years later, as a 38-year-old mother of two living in a mansion in Hyde Park, her flashbacks turn into murder attempts.\n\nGiven my love for the Hudson Valley, the novel includes locations such as the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, Vassar College and Hyde Park Elementary School.\n\nIn honor of my favorite authors, my novel has numerous suspects and clues with the murderer discovered at the conclusion, a la Agatha Christie. As in Armistead Maupin’s “Tales of the City” books, my characters are quirky, but believable and likeable. The suspects include Jana’s down-on-his-luck husband, Jana’s sister and Jana’s male best friend (who both have eyes for Jana’s husband), Jana’s has-been show business father, her deranged loyal fan, and Jana’s young Guy Friday, who covets her fame and shares an uncanny resemblance to Jana. Like Mary Higgins Clark’s, my novel is a romantic page-turner. So Jana embarks on a romance with the son of her old studio producer, a handsome filmmaker planning Jana’s comeback professionally and personally.\n\nGiven my background as an actor, Jana visits her old Hollywood movie studio to investigate her attacks (past and present) and unmask the murderer. In the process, she uncovers a web of secrets about everyone she loves.\n\nI wrote the outline in a few days and the first draft in a month. The characters took on a life of their own, as they told me what they wanted to do and say. After I showed the first draft to a trusted reader, my rewriting commenced for months until the book was completed.\n\nHolly McCabe designed a beautiful book cover, and Gerald Fierst and Jeff Walt reviewed the book (both raves) before publication and distribution on Amazon.com. Promoting the book on Facebook and Goodreads brought sales and good customer ratings. Interviews on blogs helped spread the word.\n\nBitten by the novelist bug, my second book, “An Infatuation,” (to be released by Dreamspinner Press in February) is a humorous and touching gay romance novella set in my hometown. With my background in children’s theater, I wrote a children’s book, “Nick the Nerd,” chronicling a nerdy kid’s transformation into the legendary Santa Klaus. Finally, using my experience in college academia, I am currently writing, “Drama Queen,” a comedy/mystery/romance novel set in a New England college town.\n\nWriting a novel is a bit like giving birth, incredibly difficult, but amazingly rewarding.\n\nJoe Cosentino has appeared in principal acting roles in film, television and theater, opposite Bruce Willis, Rosie O’Donnell, Nathan Lane, Holland Taylor and Jason Robards.

Hero. Rogue. And the one man you want on your side.”\n\nThat’s how global best-selling author Bernard Cornwell’s most famous hero, Richard Sharpe, is described as he resurfaces for the first time in 15 years in the just-released “Sharpe’s Assassin,” his 22nd adventure.\n\nCornwell, who lives much of the year in Chatham, says he had long expected to return to writing about the exploits of the Napoleonic-era British soldier – and scoundrel – who was played by actor Sean Bean in the popular “Sharpe” British TV series. Book and TV fans had been asking for years when the next Sharpe book would come out.\n\nWith “Sharpe’s Assassins” hitting No. 2 on the best-seller list in Cornwell’s native England, where it debuted earlier this fall, readers are happy to have the rogue return. This time — following retirement after the adventures in 2006’s “Sharpe’s Fury” — the “man with a reputation” is involved in the occupation of Paris in 1815, after being asked a favor by the Duke of Wellington following the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nHistory that's hard to believe\n\nSome of the history around Sharpe’s new 19th-century adventures may seem far-fetched, the author says, but it’s all true.\n\n“The events really happened, even the unbelievable ones,” Cornwell says in a phone interview. “That’s always nice when you can write a book and put something in it, and you think ‘Nobody will believe that that happened.’ But it did happen.”\n\nWhen asked for an example, Cornwell says, “Well, there was an attempt to blow up the Duke of Wellington, like the Gunpowder Plot (from 1605), and it was in a building that became the American Embassy. When I wrote it, I thought ‘No one will believe this. I should take it out.’ But I left it in because I just liked it.”\n\nHe had long thought of Sharpe’s return as a” retirement project,” Cornwell says, though, at 77, he doesn’t sound like he considers himself retired. Creating “Sharpe’s Assassin” followed a routine familiar to the prolific author of more than 50 novels: getting up in the morning and walking into his study to write.\n\nThere was little difference in creating this book during the early months of the pandemic, he says, considering that writing is a solitary enterprise, anyway. He couldn’t visit with his friends in real life, maybe, but Cornwell visited through the book with one of his oldest literary companions.\n\n“I just enjoy writing him. … I’d written 21 books about him before this last one. It’s a lot of books, so I’d spent at least a decade of my life in his company – at least,” Cornwell says. “And I like him. I enjoy his company, grumpy though he is.”\n\nSharpe was the start\n\nCreating Sharpe was how Cornwell began his writing career. He had been the head of current affairs television for the BBC in Northern Ireland when he met a visiting American named Judy and fell in love. She was unable to move to Britain for family reasons, Cornwell’s bio says, so he moved to the U.S. but couldn’t get a green card. Becoming a writer did not require one.\n\nConcerts, authors, monkeys & a serial killer: 7 top things to do on Cape Cod Dec. 10-16\n\nCornwell had long been an ardent fan of C.S. Forester’s Horatio Hornblower novels, about a Napoleonic War-era Royal Navy officer, and realized there was no literary counterpart on land. That led to his first literary creation being Sharpe in 1980, at about the same time he married Judy, and he found quick publishing success.\n\nThe Sharpe series, which includes a few short stories, has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide. After the early 2000s, though, other books had until now taken precedence for Cornwell — particularly the 13 books of the “Last Kingdom” series, which also became the basis for a British television show. That series starred the ninth-century Saxon warlord Lord Uhtred of Bebbanburg, reportedly an ancestor of Cornwell’s.\n\nIn the intervening years, there was also “Fools and Mortals,” Cornwell’s novel revolving around Shakespeare’s younger brother. The book was an ode to the former Monomoy Theatre in Chatham, where the best-selling author spent many summers acting – including as Prospero and other Shakespearean characters.\n\nOn the small screen: New Hallmark Channel Christmas romance movie is based on Nantucket author's book\n\nWhen asked why last year had become a good time to finally return to Sharpe, Cornwell responded: “I don't know if it was a good time, but it's something I wanted to do for a long time. I thought the moment I finished with Uhtred that it was a good time to go back to (Sharpe). … I just thought there's more to be done there. I think there still is. I think I'll do another one, at least one more.”\n\nAnd, he adds with a laugh, “I couldn’t think of what else to write.”\n\nRegency characters are 'fun'\n\n“Sharpe’s Assassins” continues the story in chronological order, and while not all of Cornwell’s Sharpe novels have done that in succession, the timing made sense to him for Sharpe’s return.\n\n“I wanted to sort of keep the story going. Following up Waterloo seemed an obvious thing to do. Again, it's a period when people don't really know that much about what went on. There's a sort of feeling that you know, OK, Waterloo and then a few days later, the French surrender, but it wasn't quite as easy as that.”\n\nWhen asked why this period in history is something he’s particularly interested in, Cornwell says, “I love the Regency period as it is, but I suppose it's because it was always the Hornblower books that got me going. And if you’re going to write about the Napoleonic Wars, you end up writing about the Regency.”\n\nThat period was also “before Britain became respectable, which makes (it) a lot more fun to write. Victorians became incredibly respectable. They actually bore me. I’m not saying they all were, there were some splendid people there. … (But in the Regency period), there were people who break rules. They’re fun.”\n\nWhile Cornwell has a vast knowledge of British history, including what is the background for Sharpe’s adventures, he says he has no aim to teach readers history through his novels.\n\n“Oh no, that would be terribly pompous of me. I just want to write a story,” he says. “I think it helps if people feel that the story is authentic. It’s as simple as that. I never set out to educate.”\n\nThe goal is just to have an adventure then? “Yes, absolutely.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/11/10/childrens-author-david-harrison-pens-this-life-autobiography/69613581007/", "title": "Noted children's author David Harrison pens 'This Life' autobiography", "text": "David Harrison has written about a boy with a drum, bullfrogs who sing, and a little turtle looking for a new home.\n\nBut in the autobiographical \"This Life,\" available now for pre-ordering, the Ozarks native and biologist examines his journey to become an award-winning poet and children's author.\n\nHe explores how a love of reading and nature and an enduring fascination with anything that slithers, buzzes or barks resulted in more than 100 published books — all for children or classroom teachers.\n\n\"I have spent a lifetime as a writer pulling from knowledge of and love for living things, animals in particular, but all living things, plants too,\" Harrison said Monday in his southeast Springfield home. \"To me, that is where some of that began. It had something to do with shaping me.\"\n\nHarrison's picture books, poems and guided readers have sold more than 10 million copies and been translated into a dozen languages. His stack of book medals started with the Christopher Award in 1972. The most recent was the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award in 2020.\n\nHis name appears on a Springfield elementary school and a conference room at The Library Center. He remains an in-demand public speaker on writing and literacy, giving talks from Washington D.C. to Malaysia.\n\nAt 85, Harrison is still a prolific book writer. \"There are five others in the pipeline that will be out between this year and 2024.\"\n\nHe did not set out to write an autobiography. His intent, one year ago, was to draw on life experiences to craft his first \"one-man dramatic reading\" for the stage.\n\n\"Once I got into it, I thought I'm not famous enough to be doing this. I need to be a Brad Pitt,\" he joked, noting his wife worked with the future actor during her years as a Springfield counselor. \"But I just felt the need to finish it once I got started. It seemed like the reasonable thing to do.\"\n\nWhat he ended up with was, in part, a love letter to his family, to Springfield, and to the joy of writing.\n\n\"I hope that those who might have an interest in writing for young people will see something about my own journey that might give them some guidelines, some ideas about their own,\" Harrison said. \"I hope that librarians, teachers, others who are interested in children's literature will find in it something of value in getting better acquainted with one of the writers who've had some success over half a century in the field.\"\n\n'He's a major figure in the Ozarks'\n\n\"This Life\" was published by the Ozarks Studies Institute, an initiative of the Missouri State University Libraries, seeking to preserve Ozarks history and culture.\n\nOther books in the series focused on Horton Smith, the Civil War in Missouri and Arkansas, and springs in the Ozarks and beyond.\n\nTom Peters, dean of library services at MSU, said publishing Harrison's autobiography made sense. \"He's a major figure in the Ozarks.\"\n\n\"His life and his writings somehow, in some way ... reflect the Ozarks. He's like one of us,\" Peters said.\n\n\"Here's this person who 'done good' and he arose from the Ozarks and that is worth celebrating and documenting and preserving.\"\n\nThe autobiography includes personal photos, poems and excerpts from his other published works.\n\nHarrison's story starts in Springfield. His father's work briefly took the family to Arizona but they returned. He attended Oak Grove Elementary, Jarrett Junior High School and Central High School.\n\nHe served as student body president while studying biology and geology at Drury University. He earned a scholarship to Emory University in Atlanta for his master's degree.\n\nHarrison has been married for 63 years to Sandy, his high school and college sweetheart. They have two children, Jeff and Robin, and two grandchildren, Kris and Tyler.\n\n'Some things happened along the way'\n\nIn the book, Harrison explains how boundless curiosity, hard work and calculated risks led to his decades-long career with words.\n\n\"Some things happened along the way that directed me to where I wound up,\" he said, offering a few examples.\n\nAt age 3, after watching a dog tussle with a black snake, he picked the snake up and tossed it.\n\n\"That stuck in my head as an early memory where I had an interest, and little fear, toward something living, something biological,\" he said. \"That snake thing stuck with me all through college.\"\n\nIn third grade, for a 4H project, he started collecting and cataloging insects. That later led to a summer internship at the University of Missouri in Columbia.\n\n\"All these pieces fed into my growing interest in and appreciation for nature,\" he said.\n\nHarrison had scribbled out a few poems, sketched cartoons and written book reports but when he was forced to take a creative writing course his final year at Drury, he was petrified.\n\nThat class, he said, changed his life. A professor explained to him that even scientists and researchers ought to know how to write.\n\nIn one story, he wrote about a spider and a wasp getting into a fight and was told, much to his astonishment, that he had \"the makings of a writer.\"\n\n'I made all the mistakes you can probably make'\n\nDespite being bitten by the writing bug in college, Harrison stayed the course. He pursued a career in science, started a family and worked demanding jobs.\n\nHe wrote, often at night, while employed at a pharmaceutical company in Indiana, editing greeting cards for Hallmark in Kansas City, and running the Glenstone Block Company in Springfield that his father started, along with partners, after World War II.\n\n\"I ran it for 35 years but I wrote at night until I eventually sold the company in 2008, and then I could write full-time,\" he said. \"It took me from 1959 to 2008 to become a full-time writer and (then) I wrote from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. five days a week and I've never been happier.\"\n\nIn recent years, after his wife retired, he scaled back to seven-hour days, only writing from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. so they can spend more time together.\n\nSuccess did not come quickly. Harrison admits his dream was to be the next great American novelist, a John Updike or Ernest Hemingway. \"Either one would be fine,\" he joked.\n\n\"But that didn't work. They had those markets cornered,\" he recalled realizing early on. \"So I wrote short stories. I got pretty good at it but it wasn't going to be a career anytime soon.\"\n\nWith no formal training or background in marketing his work, Harrison floundered until the late 1960s. \"At that point, I'd been rejected 67 times.\"\n\n\"I made all the mistakes you can probably make and then invented a few,\" he recalled.\n\nHe achieved only marginal success until \"The Boy with a Drum\" — a Little Golden Book published in 1969 — and, soon after, \"Little Turtle's Big Adventures.\"\n\n\"When I discovered that I had written a picture book, that was quite a revelation. And it sold 2 million copies,\" he said. \"I thought 'Forget Updike, maybe I'm a children's writer, who knows?' So I tried another book and that one was read on Captain Kangaroo and hailed as a good book for ecology. Of course, it was about animals.\"\n\nHe earned his first national book award for \"The Book of Giant Stories\" in the early 1970s.\n\n\"I didn't know what that meant,\" he said. \"I just knew that I was happy and I was doing what I wanted to do.\"\n\nMany awards and much success followed. He later worked with the Scholastic Book Club to write four books in the Clifford the Big Red Dog series.\n\nOne of Harrison's poems is sandblasted into a library sidewalk in Arizona. Another is on a bookmobile in Colorado.\n\n'Something that amuses me or catches my interest'\n\nAs the love for Harrison's books grew, he spent more time in elementary schools. Most of his books are targeted for grades 3-6.\n\n\"I've been in schools all over the country, visiting students, answering their questions, telling them about writing and talking to the teachers, asking them what I can do to help reinforce what they are doing,\" he said.\n\n\"Over the years, I got involved in education and it just reinforced my appreciation for the classroom, what goes on there, and it just seems natural.\"\n\nHarrison said when he writes for adults it is almost always for teachers.\n\nIn Springfield, visits to public schools spurred Harrison to get more hands-on. He helped establish the Foundation for Springfield Public Schools, which raises private money to support student learning, and the annual banquet celebrating teachers.\n\nHe produced a book of local student and teacher quotes in response to the prompt \"What I've learned so far ...\" in an effort to inspire young writers and raise awareness of the foundation.\n\nIn the 1980s, Harrison was elected to the Springfield school board, serving six years. As part of the state accreditation process, the district's book collections were found lacking.\n\n\"We raised money to put elementary school libraries all over town,\" he said. \"I was enormously pleased about that.\"\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Harrison led a campaign to raise money to replenish school libraries. His initiatives \"Reading Roundup\" and \"Sky High on Reading,\" encouraged reading and collected donations of money and library books.\n\nHe later started \"Ozarks Family Voices,\" a free program for families with young children that recorded parents and others reading beloved books.\n\nHarrison started a blog and has posted more than 4,000 times. The site has been visited more than 370,000 times by individuals across the U.S. and in other countries.\n\nHe visits the David Harrison Elementary, opened in 2009, at least twice a year. He is often asked to talk to children who want to write or to aspiring children's authors.\n\n\"My advice to people beginning is do write all kinds of things until you finally figure out which one fits best because until you do, you can be close and not get there,\" Harrison said. \"Even now I like to occasionally write something that has no place to go, it's just something that amuses me or catches my interest.\"\n\nWant to buy the book?\n\n\"This Life\" is available for pre-order now through the Ozarks Studies Institute, an initiative of Missouri State University. The website is: ozarksstudies.missouristate.edu.\n\nThe local printing will be in time for the gift-buying season in December.

It’s about a favorite Crichton subject — dinosaurs — only this time it’s historical fiction set during the 1870s and the “Bone Wars” between two real-life paleontologists in the American West.\n\nCrichton, author of such mega-selling thrillers as Jurassic Park, Rising Sun and The Andromeda Strain, died in 2008 at age 66.

Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nDragon Teeth revolves around the rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh as they search for fossils. The young, fictional hero of the novel is William Johnson, who alternately apprentices to both men and then makes historic discoveries of his own. In the excerpt from the fourth chapter, \"Philadelphia,\" that follows, we see Johnson at home in 1876, before he heads out West with Professor March.\n\nRead an excerpt below:\n\nPhiladelphia was the busiest city in America that May, nearly bursting with the vast crowds that flocked to attend the Centennial Exposition of 1876. The excitement that surrounded this celebration of the nation's hundredth anniversary was nearly palpable. Wandering the soaring exhibition halls, Johnson saw the wonders that astonished all the world — the great Corliss steam engine, the exhibits of plant and agriculture from the states and territories of America, and the new inventions that were all the rage.\n\nThe prospect of harnessing the power of electricity was the newest subject: there was even talk of making electrical light, to illuminate city streets at night; everyone said Edison would have a solution within a year. Meanwhile there were other electrical wonders to puzzle over, particularly the curious device of the tele-phone.\n\nEveryone who attended the exposition saw this oddity, although few considered it of any value. Johnson was among the majority when he noted in his journal, \"We already have the telegraph, providing communications for all who desire it. The added virtues of voice communication at a distance are unclear. Perhaps in the future, some people will wish to hear the voice of another far away, but there cannot be many. For myself, I think Mr. Bell's tele-phone is a doomed curiosity with no real purpose.\"\n\nDespite the splendid buildings and enormous crowds, all was not entirely well in the nation. This was an election year, with much talk of politics. President Ulysses S. Grant had opened the Centennial Exposition, but the little general was no longer popular; scandal and corruption characterized his administration, and the excesses of financial speculators had finally plunged the nation into one of the most severe depressions in its history. Thousands of investors had been ruined on Wall Street; Western farmers were destroyed by the sharp decline in prices, as well as by harsh winters and plagues of grasshoppers; the resurgent Indian Wars in the Montana, Dakota, and Wyoming Territories provided an unsavory aspect, at least to the Eastern press, and both Democratic and Republican parties promised in this year's campaign to focus on reform.\n\nBut to a young man, particularly a rich one, all this news — both good and bad — merely formed an exciting backdrop on the eve of his great adventure. \"I relished the wonders of this Exhibition,\" Johnson wrote, \"but in truth I found it wearingly civilized. My eyes looked to the future, and to the Great Plains that would soon be my destination. If my family agreed to let me go.\"\n\nThe Johnsons resided in one of the ornate mansions that fronted Philadelphia’s Rittenhouse Square. It was the only home William had ever known — lavish furnishings, mannered elegance, and servants behind every door. He decided to tell his family one morning at breakfast. In retrospect, he found their reactions absolutely predictable.\n\n\"Oh darling! Why ever would you want to go out there?\" asked his mother, buttering her toast.\n\n\"I think it's a capital idea,\" said his father. \"Excellent.\"\n\n\"But do you think it's wise, William?\" asked his mother. \"There's all that trouble with the Indians, you know.\"\n\n\"It's good that he's going, maybe they'll scalp him,\" announced his younger brother Edward, who was fourteen. He said things like that all the time and no one paid any attention.\n\n\"I don't understand the appeal,\" his mother said again, an edge of worry in her voice. \"Why do you want to go? It doesn't make any sense. Why not go to Europe instead? Someplace culturally stimulating and safe.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he'll be safe,\" his father said. \"Only today the Inquirer reports on the Sioux uprising in the Dakotas. They've sent Custer himself to put it down. He'll make short work of them.\"\n\n\"I hate to think of you eaten,\" said his mother.\n\n\"Scalped, Mother,\" Edward corrected her. \"They cut off all the hair right around the head, after they club you to death, of course. Except sometimes you're not completely dead and you can feel the knife cutting off the skin and hair right down to the eyebrows — \"\n\n\"Not at breakfast, Edward.\"\n\n\"You're disgusting, Edward,\" said his sister Eliza, who was ten. \"You make me puke.\"\n\n\"Eliza!\"\n\n\"Well, he does, Mother. He is a revolting creature.\"\n\n\"Where exactly will you go with Professor Marsh, son?\" his father asked.\n\n\"To Colorado.\"\n\n\"Isn't that near the Dakotas?\" asked his mother.\n\n\"Not very.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mother, don't you know anything?\" said Edward.\n\n\"Are there Indians in Colorado?\"\n\n\"There are Indians everywhere, Mother.\"\n\n\"I wasn't asking you, Edward.\"\n\n\"I believe no hostile Indians reside in Colorado,\" his father said. \"They say it's a lovely place. Very dry.\"\n\n\"They say it's a desert,\" said his mother. \"And dreadfully inhospitable. What sort of hotel will you stay in?\"\n\n\"We'll be camping, mostly.\"\n\n\"Good,\" his father said. \"Plenty of fresh air and exertion. Invigorating.\"\n\n\"You sleep on the ground with all the snakes and animals and insects? It sounds horrific,\" his mother said.\n\n\"Summer in the out-of-doors, good for a young man,\" his father said. \"After all, many sickly boys go for the 'camp cure' nowadays.\"\n\n\"I suppose . . .\" said his mother. \"But William isn't sickly. Why do you want to go, William?\"\n\n\"I think it's time I made something of myself,\" William told her, surprised by his own honesty.\n\n\"Well said!\" said his father, pounding the table.\n\nIn the end his mother gave her consent, although she continued to look genuinely worried. He thought she was being maternal and foolish; the fears she expressed only made him feel all the more puffed-up, brave, and determined to go.\n\nHe might have felt differently, had he known that by mid-summer, she would be informed that her eldest son was dead.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2016/01/24/top-selling-books-2015-usa-today-the-girl-on-the-train-grey-go-set-a-watchman/78810430/", "title": "'Train,' 'Grey,' 'Watchman' top book sales", "text": "Jocelyn McClurg\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAn unlikely triumvirate of women writers — Paula Hawkins, E.L. James and Harper Lee — led the literary charge in 2015, as USA TODAY’s Best-Selling Books list shows. USA TODAY’s Jocelyn McClurg looks back at the year’s hottest publishing trends.\n\n1. ‘The Girl on the Train’ fast-tracks to No. 1\n\nRiverhead Books had its fingers crossed last January, believing it had a hit on its hands with Paula Hawkins’ addictive psychological thriller The Girl on the Train. But who could have predicted that the voyeuristic murder mystery by an unknown British writer would steamroll the competition to become the top-selling book of the year? Advance buzz that this new Girl was the next Gone Girl helped Hawkins burst out of the gate to land at No. 2 on USA TODAY’s weekly list on Jan. 22, 2015. By Feb. 12, Train had hit No. 1, and it held the top spot for 10 more weeks (including five in a row). A year after publication, sales continue to barrel along; Riverhead reports 4 million copies sold (print and digital), phenomenal for a book that had a first hardcover printing of 40,000 copies. And Train is keeping pace with Gone Girl in another way; a DreamWorks movie adaptation — which will sell even more books — is due this fall, starring Emily Blunt as alcoholic narrator Rachel and Justin Theroux as her creepily charismatic ex-husband Tom.\n\nAuthor of the Year: Paula Hawkins of 'Train' fame\n\n2. More hot stuff from E.L. James — and a guy named ‘Grey’\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nBack in 2012, E.L. James set a USA TODAY record for the most consecutive weeks at No. 1 — 20, with Fifty Shades of Grey. Not surprisingly, Fifty Shades was the No. 1 book of that year. Fast-forward to 2015. With the February release of the steamy, now Razzie-nominated movie version starring Jamie Dornan (as bad-boy billionaire Christian Grey) and Dakota Johnson (as his naive S&M partner Anastasia Steele), the erotic romance returned to No. 1 for one week, on Feb. 19. (Fifty Shades, the novel, was the No. 14 overall top seller of 2015; the sequels, Darker and Freed, were No. 22 and No. 37.) But James wasn’t done with the Red Room of Pain or Christian Grey: in June, she made a surprise announcement on Instagram that she would celebrate Christian’s “birthday,” June 18, by releasing a new novel told from his point of view. Fans — James said they had begged for Christian’s story — responded by going ga-ga for Grey, which is the No. 2 book for 2015.\n\n3. The return of the reclusive Harper Lee\n\nSure, E.L. James’ birthday surprise may have given Fifty Shades fans a jolt of excitement, but the real literary shocker of the year — of the 21st century so far — belonged to Harper Lee. HarperCollins stunned the world in February when it announced it would publish Go Set a Watchman, a “newly discovered” novel Lee wrote in the 1950s and only the second book ever from the writer. That was just the beginning of controversy. How involved was the elderly Lee in the decision to publish what appeared to be an early draft of To Kill a Mockingbird? (Completely, said the publisher.) And when the book arrived in July, the shocks just kept coming. Atticus Finch, the hero of Mockingbird, was revealed as a racist. Despite many negative reviews, curious readers couldn’t stay away; Watchman landed at No. 1 on the weekly list on July 23 and sold enough copies to clock in at No. 3 overall for the year. Meanwhile, Mockingbird, the perennial Southern classic, found new and returning readers. It’s No. 9 for the year.\n\nUSA TODAY's top 100 books of 2015\n\n4. American readers binge on fiction, again\n\nCan’t a non-fiction writer get some love? Seventy-seven of the top 100 books of the year are fiction titles. That reflects an ongoing trend of readers seeking escapism, even if 2015 fiction sales were down a tick from 2014, when a record-setting 81 of the top 100 books were fiction. (USA TODAY’s best-seller list began in 1993.) The top-100 trend is echoed in the top 10 books for the year; only two — American Sniper by Chris Kyle at No. 6 and The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo at No. 8 — were non-fiction. Sniper saw strong sales thanks to the movie adaptation starring Bradley Cooper (the movie propelled the book to No. 1 on the weekly list for three straight weeks, Jan. 22-Feb. 5). Life-Changing Magic, a Japanese guide to de-cluttering, was the breakout hit no one saw coming. And Kondo’s Magic touch has extended into the new year, as Tidying Up reached No. 1 on the weekly list for the first time ever on Jan. 14, 2016.\n\nPure 'Magic': Marie Kondo finally hits No. 1\n\n5. Youth movement has a timeout in 2015\n\n2014 was a huge year for young readers. Six out of the top 10 titles were young-adult, with John Green nabbing the No. 1 overall spot with The Fault in Our Stars and Veronica Roth grabbing Nos. 3, 4 and 5 with her Divergent series. Adults were back in charge in 2015, but Green made the top 10 again with Paper Towns at No. 7, as another movie adaptation drove book sales. And the ever-popular Jeff Kinney lands at No. 10 for the year with the latest in his middle-school series, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Old School.\n\nKristin Hannah takes on the Nazis in 'Nightingale'\n\n6. A Pulitzer provides a second push for a popular book\n\nAnthony Doerr’s World War II-novel All the Light We Cannot See was already a Top 10 USA TODAY best-seller when it won the Pulitzer in April. The prestigious prize kept the momentum going, making Light the No. 5 overall book for 2015 (last year, it was No. 22). First published in May 2014, it’s the story of a blind French girl and a Nazi youth. Another World War II novel, Kristin Hannah’s The Nightingale, also captivated audiences with its tale of two sisters in Nazi-occupied France. It’s No. 11 for the year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2024/09/22/griffon-shipwreck-great-lakes-lake-michigan-steve-kathie-libert/74956091007/", "title": "Michigan couple still trying to prove they found Griffin shipwreck", "text": "In four decades of news work, I'd never reported from underwater.\n\nLast month, I donned a wetsuit and dived under Lake Michigan, a few miles off the Upper Peninsula. My guides took me to within inches of what they claim is the Great Lakes' oldest shipwreck. I shared the scene with fish and two experienced divers.\n\nSkeptics beg to differ. They say what I saw can't be the French-built Griffon, the first actual sailing ship ever to ply the Great Lakes. But the skeptics haven’t gone down to look. I have. Now I'm a believer. And not just because I was close enough to touch the wreckage ...\n\nA lifelong quest\n\nSteve and Kathie Libert, of Charlevoix, have devoted their lives to seeking the Griffin; or, as the French named it, Le Griffon. During careers near Washington, D.C., they used every vacation day and traveled each summer to northern Michigan. Kathie studied centuries-old documents. Steve led dive teams for more than four decades in search of the long-lost ship. They say they expect no riches, just the satisfaction of seeing the wreckage identified and protected, so that these remnants of history won't be lost.\n\nYears in court\n\nAfter years diving around tiny islands where Le Griffon was last seen, the Liberts and their lifelong dive pals from Ohio found wreckage, then repeatedly went to court seeking permits to salvage artifacts. They won just one lawsuit. That let them, in 2013, pull up what they think was Le Griffon's front-mounted spar, called a bowsprit. After seeing the spar, state officials said it was just an old stake used to secure a fish net. The Liberts, and the French divers who helped retrieve the piece, beg to differ.\n\nTime growing short\n\nRetired in Charlevoix, and fighting ailments of aging, the Liberts in 2021 published a 160-page book, documenting why they think they've found the holy grail of Great Lakes shipwrecks. Bringing up artifacts could form a museum to celebrate the Midwest's early history, when French explorers were the first white people on the Great Lakes. A state lawmaker from the U.P. this month asked state officials who regulate shipwreck salvage to review the Liberts' claim. Last month, unsure about how many more years he can dive, Steve Libert invited the Free Press to dive with him, to see what he and Kathie Libert think is the wreck of Le Griffon.\n\nMuch about the ship and its demise are unclear, “lost in the deep echoes of time,” author Richard Gebhart writes in “Ships and Shipwrecks: Stories from the Great Lakes,” a recent book from Michigan State University Press. What’s known is that Le Griffon was the Great Lakes' first big sailing ship. It was commissioned by explorer Robert La Salle, built in the woods above the falls at Niagara, and from there yanked down a creek to Lake Erie. Less than six weeks after launch, disaster struck. As the French explorers said in their journals, preserved all these centuries, the ship went down loaded with furs and with all hands. That was in 1679, so long ago that it’s tempting to believe the skeptics.\n\nAs a swimmer who’d never been diving, I considered the risk of drowning. As a reporter, I considered the risk of accepting first-person glimpses as reality. In 2022, from dry land, I wrote a standard news story, as impartial as I could make it, about Steve and Kathie Libert’s lifelong quest. This time, I’ll tell a story in first-person. The Liberts can’t prove they’ve found the Griffin — in French, spelled “Le Griffon.” But after reading their book, hearing their reasoning, and seeing up close what they've seen and photographed — the algae-covered beams and ribs of an ancient wooden vessel — I’m a believer.\n\nThe ship disappeared so long ago, so many winter storms and giant waves ago, it’s tempting to dismiss the Liberts’ claims. Doubters insist that wreckage that old had to be swept to oblivion. Others say the Liberts must’ve found some other wreck, or more than one wreck, when two decades ago they first located the wooden remains of a very old ship, embedded in sand at several sites, near uninhabited islands off tiny Fairport, Michigan, south of Manistique.\n\nStill others accuse the Liberts of treasure hunting. But Le Griffon wasn't known to contain any treasure. Its load of furs, its wood furnishings, its sails and rigging have long since disintegrated. Le Griffon is no treasure ship, “unless you consider history a treasure, which I do,” Steve Libert said on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” in 2008. The Liberts say the best treasure they could find would be what historians call “an artifact,” some piece of this ancient vessel that would prove them right — confirming their having found what some call “the holy grail\" of Great Lakes shipwrecks.\n\nThe Liberts have no children. As Kathie Libert once quipped to me, “Finding the Griffon is our baby.”\n\nNor are they well to do, although both worked steadily until retirement — Steve as a Navy intelligence analyst, Kathie as the owner of a marketing communications firm. Early on, their quest was literally a murky project, clouded by Lake Michigan’s characteristic silt. It darkened underwater viewing when Steve and his friends began diving in the 1980s. Then, by the 2000s, invasive zebra mussels followed by smaller quagga mussels filtered Lake Michigan to crystal-clarity. Steve and his crew of dive pals, all from Dayton, Ohio, began revisiting wreck sites they’d found years earlier, shooting increasingly sharp underwater photos of what they, more and more, began to believe was Le Griffon.\n\nMy first dive\n\nSunshine shimmered on Lake Michigan last month on the day of my first dive. We motored out of Fairport on Steve’s aging pontoon boat with a crew of Steve's longtime dive pals. It took only 90 minutes of bouncing over low swells to reach an uninhabited island a few miles south of the Upper Peninsula's coast. Scanning the shoreline of Big Summer Island (shown as just \"Summer Island\" on some maps), Steve spotted a landmark and brought his boat right over a key site of wreckage.\n\n“Kathie was always saying, ‘Steve, look in the shallow water,’ and here it is,” he announced, idling his outboard. We peered down at the sandy bottom, making out dark-brown shapes that Steve said had once been a ship, just 10 feet down. Minutes later, I was swimming over it, and then down to it.\n\nA heavy beam ran straight and visible for 50 feet. That was the keelson, a 12-by-12-inch timber that shipwrights placed atop the keel to secure long rows of curving ribs running up the interior sides of the ship. Parts of the ribs were there too, one after another. To the ribs, also called frames, had been fastened the hull’s planking, although it was long since fallen away. Clearly visible were smooth wrought-iron bolts, driven through planks as fasteners. They lacked the threading of bolts used in ship-building a century later, according to nautical historians. To the Liberts, finding non-threaded iron fasteners signaled the remains of a truly aged ship, built in the 1600s.\n\nSharing the scene with fish and fellow diver Tom Kucharsky, a production worker at Crown Cork & Seal in Dayton, I got within inches of what once had been tall North American trees, shaped by axes centuries ago, now partly buried in sand. I didn’t wear an air tank. The setting was so shallow, I could grab air topside, then swim easily down for viewing, pulled down by a weight belt that Steve lent me. I was warm inside my own wet suit. When I ran short of air at the wreck, Tom would swim over and hold out his backup breathing line, known to divers as a \"reserve regulator.\" I'd catch a breath to stay down longer. We swam within inches of the wreckages but didn’t touch any part of this algae-covered history tableaux. Steve had given strict orders.\n\n“We don’t bring anything up. We’re doing everything legally,” he advised, before my dives. Without a government salvage permit, nothing should be taken from a shipwreck, he said.\n\nKeeping watch from a seat in the pontoon boat was Tom's brother, Jim Kucharsky, retired from Delco and Delphi in Dayton. The brothers said they’d been diving with Steve for more than four decades. Not diving but assisting us was Sam Kingrey, also of Dayton, where the Liberts lived early in their marriage. Kingrey, who owns SK Mold & Tool in two factories near Dayton, designed and built an aluminum lift and fitted it to Steve's boat, letting divers easily exit the water.\n\nAlso there was Brian Abbott, an underwater acoustics specialist from Haslett, near Lansing. Abbott said he’d accompanied the Libert expeditions for years, juggling his schedule of paying clients so he could aid the quest for Le Griffon. In previous years, Abbott trained his sonar equipment on the wreckage. Several of his “sub-bottom” images appear in the Liberts’ book, showing suggestive shapes that may be parts of Le Griffon, or something else, actually under Lake Michigan’s sandy bottom. The Great Lakes are dotted with shipwrecks. It’s possible that other wrecks are scattered near the remains of Le Griffon, Abbott said, as we motored to the second day’s dive.\n\n“I hear everything from 7,000 to 14,000 shipwrecks in the Great Lakes. What I learned from Steve is, any good expedition starts in the library,” he said. By that he includes the Liberts’ big collection of books and research material, which fills many shelves at their condominium in Charlevoix.\n\n“This area is full of legends and history. It’s just not obvious,” Abbott said. Scanning the horizon, he said, “Al Capone had a hideout over at Rock Island, right over there.” He pointed southwest. In that direction lay several islands. Their only residents these days? Shorebirds.\n\nJust then, we were 200 yards off Big Summer Island — population: zero — where Steve and his crew said they’d camped many times, always with the permission of the landowner, he was quick to say. For decades, they explored the geography around Big Summer Island, underwater, finding multiple sites of wreckage that Steve believes to be Le Griffon. On Day One, we dived on the mid and aft sections of keel, which Steve said he’d found by studying satellite images of Lake Michigan. On Day Two, we swam down to the bow of what seemed to be more of the same shipwreck, a quarter-mile away.\n\n“I found that by swimming around the island,” Steve told me, hinting at the relentless spirit of his search. He and the others also found yet more wreckage they think is from the Griffon, in deeper water, 50 feet down. That's where Steve thinks there might be a cannon, sure to be a breakthrough for confirming that what they've found is, finally, what they've all sought for so long. While camping near the wreck sites many times over their 43-year quest, Steve and the others spent time on nearby Poverty Island, also uninhabited. There they found what could be more clues to the mystery of Le Griffon: remnants of ancient Native American villages.\n\nAs we approached, Steve told why these long-abandoned sites are a link in his chain of evidence. These sites put Native Americans close to where the Liberts think Le Griffon met its storm-tossed fate, close enough that the inhabitants could’ve heard what they later reported to La Salle, as recorded in his journal. They heard it after dark, during heavy winds — three cannon shots, likely a distress signal. Le Griffon’s last moments could well have been just out of sight of these encampments, not far from where we dived on the wreckage.\n\nAccording to the journal of Father Hennepin, a Franciscan Recollect friar who accompanied La Salle, the two explorers bid farewell to Le Griffon on Sept. 18, 1679. The ship was to return to Niagara without them, bearing a summer’s load of furs. The two leaders would go on exploring with their band of followers, paddling large canoes.\n\nHennepin’s journal, as recapped in the Liberts’ book, tells that the ship set sail from the harbor of what’s now called Washington Island, a resort area on the Wisconsin side of Lake Michigan, at the entrance to Green Bay. It’s an area so treacherous for shipping that the French named it Porte des Morts — Death’s Door.\n\nThe next day, on Sept. 19, a tremendous storm struck the area, according to the journals of both Hennepin and La Salle. The Liberts think Le Griffon’s end was fated by that storm — not by a mutiny of the crew nor by an attack of Native Americans, two opposing theories for which there is no evidence. The storm could’ve shoved the ship onto a sandy shoal, broken it into pieces, drowned the crew of just six sailors, and washed the wreckage into the shallow water where, the Liberts believe, it sat untouched for 3½ centuries, awaiting their discovery.\n\nA believer\n\nAnother believer is Greg McMaster, the former state representative for the Liberts’ district, now running Eagle Eye Drone Services with a dozen employees based in Traverse City, Florida and other sites. McMaster recalled the many years that the Liberts struggled, in negotiations and costly court fights, trying to get permission from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, or DNR, to bring up artifacts that would prove they'd found La Salle's ship. He also recalled diving with them and, one time, supervising a special day of diving.\n\n“Probably the most important dive I was on was when the only permit allowed by the DNR let Steve salvage the bowsprit. So I stepped out of my role as a friend and I acted as the state’s watchdog on that. Being a state representative back then, I had to put the interests of the state first,” McMaster said.\n\nHe said: “I can tell you, everything was done properly” to preserve the bowsprit, an old sailing ship’s unique spar, which sticks out and up from the bow. It was a crucial 20-foot piece of wreckage that the Liberts thought would show it came from Le Griffon. To get it, the DNR relented after years of denials.\n\n“This was the first and only permit for salvage that was ever approved for them,\" McMaster said. The bowsprit, or what believers say is the bowsprit, was brought up from Lake Michigan’s bottom in 2013 in a joint effort of the Liberts’ team of divers — which they call the Great Lakes Exploration Group — together with divers and archeologists from DRASSM, the French acronym for Department of Underwater Archeological Research. This happened only after Steve met with French officials in Washington, and after his group won their request to explore the wreck in federal appeals court, overruling state officials, and after McMaster did what he could on the Liberts' behalf as a member of the Michigan Underwater Salvage and Preserve Committee, a branch of the DNR-controlled Michigan History Center.\n\nDuring that salvage dive, three French maritime archeologists — the Liberts’ book says — examined the bowsprit “before it was completely wrapped in a water-permeable fabric to assist in slowing down the decaying process once at the surface” and then “rushed off in a refrigerated truck to a climate-controlled storage facility,” to be viewed later by a state of Michigan archeologist. The French experts wrote a report, saying they thought this spar was, indeed, a bowsprit such as those affixed to French ships in the 1600s. A state archeologist pooh-poohed that, saying the 20-foot length of waterlogged wood was a stake used by fishermen to secure their nets in the 1800s.\n\nThe Liberts devote Chapter 3 in their book, and Steve can talk endlessly, about why the French are right and why the state’s expert isn’t. McMaster sides with the Liberts, he said.\n\n“The evidence they presented in that book really convinced me. They’ve got measurements. They’ve got historical documents. Every piece that they add is just filling in the argument,” McMaster said.\n\n“The bowsprit, to me, was conclusive. When the French came over and looked at it, they felt very confident that this is the Griffon,” he said.\n\n'Something good'\n\nMcMaster served in the state House from 2009 through 2015. While there, he explained the Liberts’ quest to Ed McBroom, also a House member back then. McBroom is now a state senator, representing most of the U.P. He owns a farm not far from where the Liberts moor their dive boat.\n\nWhen I called McBroom, he said he was glad that I liked his southwest part of the U.P., studded with tidy farms and dune-side views of Lake Michigan. He sounded hopeful that the wreckage I’d viewed through a dive mask could someday, somehow, become the basis for a local museum, a spot as interesting to tourists and historians as the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum on Whitefish Point, at the opposite end of the U.P. A museum that showcased Le Griffon would be unlike any other, partly because France says the wreckage is its property, according to previous news reports. McBroom knows that.\n\n“I’m not sure the state has any legs to stand on when it comes to salvaging this, but they think they do, and they like to bully people. They need to get over it,” McBroom said. I called him when I was a day out of the water, having left the isolated dive spot and regained a cellphone signal. McBroom said he’d contact the DNR’s director, someone known to be sensible and nonpartisan, he said.\n\n“He’s new, and I hear he's a very practical man. I'm really hoping we can get something going for these people,\" McBroom said. I said I’d check back soon. In the interim, I sent McBroom a copy of the Liberts' 2021 book (\"Le Griffon and the Huron Islands: Our story of exploration and discovery\" by Steve and Kathie Libert: Mission Point Press, Traverse City; $26.95 softcover, $34.95 hardcover). The senator received it at his dairy farm, where he keeps 125 cows. When I called him back two weeks later, McBroom said he thought the book was impressive. And he had some news about hearing from the DNR:\n\n\"I chatted with the director about this. He was very interested. I put him in touch with Greg McMaster. I'm hoping that something good finally comes of this.\"\n\nThat \"something good\" needs to happen soon. The Liberts said they're feeling their age. His dive pals are, too. They can’t keep diving. And the couple can't afford more court battles for salvage rights, they said. They said they expect no treasure, no material benefits at all from their find. They just want, in their lifetimes, to see the wreckage identified and protected.\n\nThey’d like to be assured that this exciting and very early slice of Michigan history doesn’t stay lost in the sand under Lake Michigan. I’m on board with that.\n\nContact Bill Laytner: blaitner@freepress.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2016/02/19/mockingbird-author-harper-lee-dies-age-89-beloved-alabama-hometown/80605260/", "title": "'Mockingbird' author Harper Lee dies, age 89", "text": "Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCorrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Harper Lee's publisher. Her publisher is HarperCollins.\n\nHarper Lee, the little girl named Nelle who grew up to write one of the 20th century's most culture-changing novels, has died in her beloved hometown of Monroeville, Ala. She was 89.\n\nHer death Friday was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office in Monroeville who would not provide a name, and was first reported by an Alabama local news website.\n\nHer current publisher, HarperCollins, issued a statement Friday from Michael Morrison, president and publisher in the USA and Canada: \"We are deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved author, Harper Lee. She died peacefully in the early hours of this morning at the age of 89.\" (HarperCollins initially said her death was Thursday night but issued a corrected statement later.)\n\nLee remained, to the end, immune to the blandishments of worldwide fame, which enveloped her in 1960 with the publication of her first novel, To Kill a Mockingbird. It won the Pulitzer Prize, has sold more than 30 million copies in English, remains in print (selling more than a million copies a year) and in every school in America, and, until last year, was her only book.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nAfter Mockingbird was published, after the Oscar-winning movie starring Gregory Peck came out in 1962, Lee stopped talking to the press, went home to Monroeville and closed her door. She kept it closed for decades, emerging only occasionally to write something for Lee-loving Oprah Winfrey's magazine, or to receive the 2007 Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bush in the White House.\n\nEven then, she didn't say much.\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of Mockingbird's publication in 2010, Lee remained elusive.\n\n“I am still alive, although very quiet,\" she once wrote to her book agent, three decades after the novel was published. And she stayed that way, even as the anniversary celebrations noisily proceeded throughout the nation.\n\nAppreciation: Why Harper Lee's 'Mockingbird' will endure\n\nNow Aaron Sorkin is bringing a stage adaption to Broadway; he joined the scores of people, famous and not, issuing condolences.\n\n\"Like millions of others, I was saddened to learn this morning of the passing of Harper Lee, one of America's most beloved authors. I'm honored to have the opportunity to adapt her seminal novel for the stage,\" Sorkin said in a statement.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird was the Huckleberry Finn of the 20th century,\" said Charles J. Shields, author of a 2006 biography, Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee. \"It redirected American’s gaze after WWII and the excitement of the 1950s back to the enduring problems of racism and injustice in this country.\"\n\nPresident Obama, who presented her with the National Medal of the Arts in 2011, issued a statement on the White House Facebook page.\n\n\"What that one story did, more powerfully than one hundred speeches possibly could, was change the way we saw each other, and then the way we saw ourselves. Through the uncorrupted eyes of a child, she showed us the beautiful complexity of our common humanity, and the importance of striving for justice in our own lives, our communities, and our country.\n\n\"Ms. Lee changed America for the better. And there is no higher tribute we can offer her than to keep telling this timeless American story — to our students, to our neighbors, and to our children — and to constantly try, in our own lives, to finally see each other.\"\n\nIn 2012, after Obama recorded a new introduction to the 1962 Mockingbird film, Lee issued one of her rare public statements, saying she was \"deeply honored.\"\n\nFans, celebrities, authors remember Harper Lee\n\nHer endearing and enduring novel, set in 1930s Maycomb, Ala. (the stand-in for Monroeville), is the story of upstanding lawyer Atticus Finch, who defends a black man falsely accused of rape in a time and place when that could get a man killed.\n\nThe story is told through the eyes of Atticus’ small tomboy daughter, Scout, and features, among many memorable characters, her neighbor pal, Dill, a stand-in for Lee’s childhood friend, the writer Truman Capote, who spent his early years in Monroeville, prompting the town to refer to itself today as the “Literary Capital of Alabama.”\n\nAfter years of being left alone, Lee was catapulted back into the public eye last year with the release of Go Set a Watchman, a “newly discovered” novel she wrote in the 1950s and only the second book from her.\n\nWatchman essentially is an early draft of Mockingbird; most shockingly, it revealed Atticus Finch to be a racist. The controversy over the novel, and worldwide publicity over the reemergence of the elderly writer, made Watchman an instant best seller. It also increased sales for Mockingbird, the perennial classroom classic.\n\nWhatever the merits of Watchman, Mockingbird will be Lee's legacy and it is enough.\n\n“The one book that millions of us have in common,” said Mary McDonagh Murphy, author of a book of interviews of famous folk talking about how Mockingbird changed them, changed the country.\n\n“It’s our national novel,” Oprah told Murphy.\n\nHarperCollins publisher Morrison said in a statement that, “The world knows Harper Lee was a brilliant writer but what many don’t know is that she was an extraordinary woman of great joyfulness, humility and kindness. She lived her life the way she wanted to — in private — surrounded by books and the people who loved her.\"\n\nHer agent, Andrew Nurnberg, says knowing Lee was \"not just an utter delight but an extraordinary privilege.\n\n\"When I saw her just six weeks ago, she was full of life, her mind and mischievous wit as sharp as ever,\" Nurnberg said in a statement. \"She was quoting Thomas More and setting me straight on Tudor history. We have lost a great writer, a great friend and a beacon of integrity.”\n\nLee was born Nelle Harper Lee on April 28, 1926, in Monroeville, the youngest of four children of lawyer Amasa Coleman Lee and Frances Cunningham Finch Lee.\n\nShe didn’t use the name Nelle — Ellen spelled backwards — for her book because she didn’t want to be called Nellie. But her friends and family always called her Nelle, pronounced Nell.\n\nA look at Harper Lee and 'To Kill A Mockingbird' in pop culture\n\nIn addition to being a lawyer, Lee’s father was also a newspaperman and state legislator. (Lee’s oldest sister Alice, who often acted as Lee's spokeswoman until she died in 2014, became a prominent Alabama lawyer.) Lee’s mother, Frances, was by the time of Lee’s birth showing signs of mental illness, probably bipolar disorder. But Alice angrily denied Capote’s claims that her mother had tried to drown Harper at age 2.\n\nNever close to her mother, the tomboyish Lee enjoyed a relationship with her father that resembled the one between Scout and Atticus. And her father encouraged her reading and writing.\n\nAlthough Mockingbird may read as if it just spooled out of the storyteller, Lee actually struggled with the novel for years in the 1950s while working at menial jobs (airline reservation clerk) in New York. Then some Alabama friends in town gave her a Christmas gift of enough money to quit her job and work full time on the book for a year.\n\nA skilled editor helped her turn a series of stories and vignettes into a seamless whole, encompassing themes such as coming of age, tolerance and empathy, fatherhood and hero worship, and the eccentricities of small-town people. It’s also about racism and incest, murder and injustice, fear and ignorance, and the possibility of redemption.\n\nTwain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ranks higher in the esteem of the academics who control the literary canon, and J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye was held up as hipper. Other novels have sold more books. But Mockingbird is about something more substantial than wizards and vampires.\n\nCatcher reflected the social change of the 1960s but Mockingbird helped bring about some of those changes, especially in civil rights. What other book has done the same?\n\nFew other authors could say the same, even if Harper Lee recoiled at saying it publicly herself.\n\nContributing: Deirdre Donahue", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/19"}]}
