You can lose and actually be a loser because you lost, but still also be a winner.\n\n“It’s just what you do on a daily basis. Some days you lose and some days you win, and you can go through all of that and have the most turbulent times and still rise again tomorrow.\n\n“It’s not so scary to fail, especially because I failed because I was trying so hard – maybe too hard.\n\n“And maybe after 12 years in a ski career, I should have known how hard to push and not go over that limit, but I pushed harder because I wanted it and that’s not really an excuse.\n\n“I’m going to go out again and try next time, but fewer people will be watching,” she laughs.\n\nAfter she crashed out of the slalom, the sight of Shiffrin sitting at the side of the slope, her arms on her knees and her head bowed, became one of the enduring images of Beijing 2022.\n\nAs one of the greatest to ever put on a pair of skis, Shiffrin has become accustomed to success throughout her career, which includes gold medals from Sochi and Pyeongchang.\n\nHowever, after suffering her second DNF in the space of three days in Beijing, Shiffrin says she just needed a moment with her thoughts on the hill.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin sits on the side of the course after skiing out in the first run of the women's slalom.

Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, she’s going to see me, she’s going to freak out. I just need to get over here and then I need to be still as a stone.’”\n\nIn the days that followed her third DNF, Shiffrin posted some of the abusive messages she had received on social media during her time in Beijing.\n\n“Got what you deserved,” “dumb blonde” and “dumb b*tch” were among some of the messages, with others telling her to retire from the sport.\n\nShiffrin admitted in her Instagram post that she had started to question why she keeps coming back to skiing, but now says the thought of being back atop the podium is driving her to get back out onto the slopes.\n\n“It’s actually a lot of the things I fear the most about myself,” she says. “That I have lost my touch in the sport, that I should give it up … they’re the worst things you think about yourself, yet somebody else just finds a way to push those buttons.\n\n“And you’re like: ‘I want to argue with you, but I just don’t even know what to say.’ I saw one comment today [that said], ‘You’re just a loser and you didn’t contribute anything.’ I’m like: ‘I know!’” Shiffrin laughs.\n\n“I realize that and I am a loser, but I’ve also been a winner and I think I can win again.”", "authors": ["Coy Wire Matias Grez", "Coy Wire", "Matias Grez"], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/china/chinese-tycoon-xiao-jianhua-sentenced-intl-hnk", "title": "Chinese-Canadian tycoon Xiao Jianhua sentenced to 13 years in ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nChinese-Canadian tycoon Xiao Jianhua was sentenced Friday to 13 years in prison, more than five years after the billionaire was abducted from a hotel room in Hong Kong and taken to mainland China.\n\nXiao and his company Tomorrow Holdings were convicted of crimes involving tens of billions of dollars, including illegally absorbing public deposits, betraying the use of entrusted property, illegal use of funds and bribery, the Shanghai First Intermediate Court said in a statement.\n\nThe court also fined Xiao 6.5 million yuan ($950,000) and Tomorrow Holdings 55 billion yuan ($8.1 billion).\n\n“The criminal acts of Tomorrow Holdings and Xiao Jianhua seriously damaged the financial management order, seriously endangered the country’s financial security, seriously infringed on the integrity of the state staff, and should be severely punished according to law,” the court said.\n\nBut it added that Xiao and Tomorrow Holdings have “turned themselves in, confessed their crimes and helped with the recovery of assets,” and thus can receive a more lenient punishment.\n\nXiao was one of China’s richest men and controlled the Tomorrow Group, a massive holding company with stakes in banks, insurers and property developers. According to Hurun, which analyzes Chinese wealth, Xiao had a net worth of $6 billion and ranked 32nd on its 2016 rich list, a league table equivalent to the Forbes list.\n\nThe court said Xiao and Tomorrow Holdings gave shares, real estate, cash and other assets to government officials worth around $100 million over 20 years to 2021.\n\nXiao, known for his close connections to some of China’s most powerful political families, was seized in 2017 by Chinese security agents from his room at the Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong and taken to mainland China.\n\nA person familiar with the abduction told CNN there was a small scuffle at the hotel between two dozen Chinese security officials and Xiao’s own security detail, which typically numbered about eight bodyguards per shift.

He said the military convoy had been closely observed since crossing the border from Russia.\n\nUkrainian Defense Ministry spokesman Leonid Matyukhin told Bloomberg News that the vehicles had been painted white to camouflage the operation as a peacekeeping mission.\n\nA reporter for The Guardian said he saw a column of 23 armored personnel carriers, supported by fuel trucks and other logistics vehicles with official Russian military plates, crossing into Ukraine \"through a gap in a barbed wire fence that demarcates the border.\"\n\nNATO leader Anders Fogh Rasmussen said earlier Friday that \"a Russian incursion\" over the Ukrainian border had been observed during the night. \"It is a clear demonstration of continued Russian involvement in the destabilization of eastern Ukraine,\" Rasmussen said at a news conference in Denmark.\n\nThe British foreign office summoned Russian Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko \"to clarify reports of Russian military incursion,\" the BBC reported.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said such reports were false. \"No Russian military column that allegedly crossed the Russian-Ukrainian border at night or during the day ever existed,\" said Major General Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, RT.com reports.\n\nRussia's Security Service, which oversees border guards, said its military mobile teams operate \"strictly within the territory of the Russian Federation,\" a spokesperson for the FSB in the Rostov region told RT.com.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry, meanwhile, said only that Ukrainian forces are engaging in \"intense fighting\" in Eastern Ukraine to stop humanitarian aid to the region and charged that the Ukrainians were planning to mine the roads ahead of the Russian humanitarian convoy, according to RT.com.\n\nUkraine had insisted that the Russian relief goods -- food, generators and medical supplies -- be inspected and reloaded before being allowed to proceed to hard-hit areas of eastern Ukraine, particularly the besieged city of Luhansk.\n\nFor several days, as the trucks wound their way from Moscow, Ukrainian officials expressed concern that the trucks might contain military equipment as a cover for a military invasion.\n\nThe BBC reports that many the trucks in the aid convoy were almost empty. It quoted on driver as saying those trucks were to be used to pick up the cargo from any trucks that might break down on the journey.\n\nUkrainian officials initially said the inspection was underway, but said later that it had been delayed until customs officials received relevant paperwork from the International Committee of the Red Cross, which will distribute the goods, according to Interfax Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. State Department also weighed in, saying that the U.S. had warned Russia that it \"as no right to send vehicles or persons or cargo of any kind into Ukraine without the government's explicit permission,\" according to U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf.\n\nUnder the deal finalized Friday morning, 41 Ukrainian border guards and 18 customs officials were tasked with inspecting the trucks, Ukrinform reports. Only one driver per truck, not a full crew, was being permitted to take the goods into Ukraine.\n\nIn line with Red Cross policy, there will be no military escort. The Red Cross will also exclusively carry out the final distribution of the goods.\n\nThe Russian white-tarped trucks had been parked since Thursday near Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, about 17 miles from the border. Much of the border in this part of eastern Ukraine has been under the control of the pro-Russia separatists\n\nRussia sent the convoy south to the rebel-held crossing after deciding not to abide by an earlier tentative agreement to deliver the aid through a government-controlled border crossing in the Kharkiv region.\n\nLaurent Corbaz, the International Committee of the Red Cross' director of operations in Europe, said the plan foresees the aid being delivered to a central point in rebel-held territory, then distributed through the region. It was unclear how long the operation might last, but \"it's not going to be solved in one week,\" he said.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis emerged during four months of fighting in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian troops and rebels, who had declared the region independent.

Earlier Monday, regional police Chief Andrii Niebytov said more than 1,200 bodies of Ukrainian civilians killed by Russian troops have been found in the Kyiv region.\n\n►A Russian missile strike caused deaths and injuries on Monday in Odesa, the governor of the southwestern region, Maksym Marchenko, said on social media. He didn't specify how many were killed or injured. Ukrainian authorities previously said Russian forces destroyed a strategic bridge in Odesa, cutting access to shipments of weapons and other cargo from neighboring Romania.\n\n►Russia's women's soccer teams have been banned from this summer's European championship and from qualifying for the 2023 World Cup because of the country's invasion of Ukraine. In addition, the Russian men's soccer clubs were barred from the 2022-23 Champions League.\n\n►The Ukraine Finance Ministry says the country has received grant assistance of over $500 million from the World Bank’s Donor Trust Fund to spend on social, humanitarian, and health care needs.\n\n►Kristina Kvien, U.S. Embassy charge d’affaires, attended a news conference Monday in Lviv to highlight the return of U.S. diplomats to Ukraine. The U.S. pulled out of its Kyiv embassy for Lviv before the war, then left Ukraine entirely after the February invasion. Denmark and South Korea resumed limited embassy operations in Kyiv on Monday.\n\nUS official: Russia may try to abduct local mayors in Ukraine’s eastern region\n\nRussia may try to abduct local mayors in Ukraine’s eastern region and install Kremlin “puppets” in the latest phase of the war, a top State Department official said Monday.\n\nMichael Carpenter, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, told reporters the U.S. has seen “highly credible” reports of planned “abductions of mayors and other local officials” in Ukraine’s southern and eastern regions.\n\nThe strategy would be part of a push toward annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine and to “engineer a referendum” about having those areas join Russia, Carpenter said. He declined to disclose the source of that information but said Russia may make this move in mid-May, adding that Moscow appears to have a similar plan for the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine.\n\nCarpenter said the U.S. also has evidence of plans for forced “disappearances” of local officials, such as school directors, journalists and local activists, along with plans to impose a Russian school curricula on Ukrainian children.\n\nHe said it’s not clear whether Moscow will be able to execute this playbook, noting that the Kremlin’s plans to depose Ukraine’s democratically elected government in Kyiv failed.\n\n-- Deirdre Shesgreen\n\n'We could see the rockets flying': Some civilians flee from steel plant area\n\nMariupol's pre-war population of more than 400,000 had shriveled to an estimated 100,000 who had to endure two months of Russian bombardment with little access to food, water and utilities by the time Monday's evacuation began.\n\nSeveral hundred civilians remained at a sprawling steel plant that is the last major holdout in the Russian-occupied city – along with nearly 500 wounded soldiers and an unknown number of dead bodies.\n\nMore than 100 women, children and elderly people were evacuated from the Azovstal plant Sunday. The Russian military said 69 chose to be evacuated to Ukraine-controlled territories, while 57 others asked to stay in the areas under Russian control.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Greek state television that civilians remaining in the plant were afraid to board buses because they believed they would be taken to Russia or elsewhere against their will, adding that half a million Ukrainians have met a similar fate. Zelenskyy said he had U.N. assurances they would go to Ukraine-controlled areas.\n\nThe Russians' resumed shelling of the steelworks forced a halt to the evacuation effort Sunday, and Ukrainian authorities said the assault continued Monday.\n\nAnastasiia Dembytska, who fled with her daughter, nephew and dog, said her family survived by cooking on a makeshift stove and drinking well water. Dembytska said she could see the steel plant from her window, when she dared to look out. “We could see the rockets flying” and clouds of smoke over the plant, she said.\n\nWeapons transfers to Ukraine diminishes some U.S. stockpiles\n\nWhen President Joe Biden said last week that the American involvement in the war in Ukraine would be costly, he likely had more than dollars and cents in mind.\n\nIn supplying Ukraine a large chunk of the weaponry it has used to try to repel the Russian invasion, the U.S. has diminished some of its own arsenal.\n\nThe U.S. already has provided Ukraine with about 7,000 Javelin anti-tank systems -- including some delivered during the Trump administration -- about one-third of the American stockpile, according to an analysis by Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies international security program.\n\nAnalysts also estimate the U.S. has sent about one-quarter of its stockpile of shoulder-fired Stinger missiles to Ukraine. Production of both weapons has been limited in recent years, and their makers face the same supply chain and labor shortage challenges that other manufacturers do.\n\nThe White House said military readiness has not been impacted. Still, “Could this be a problem? The short answer is, ‘Probably, yes,’” said Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and former government specialist on Pentagon budget strategy, war funding and procurement.\n\nDoes Putin have an endgame?\n\nAs the U.S. and its allies rush more cannons, tanks and ammunition to Ukraine, Russia’s already diminished military is still looking for victories to justify the huge cost of President Vladimir Putin’s invasion.\n\nPutin is hoping to grab those gains in eastern Ukraine and parts of the Black Sea coastline. If successful, he could claim he’s met an initial objective of securing the Donbas, an area that has been contested by Ukrainians and Russian-backed separatists since 2014.\n\nRead more on how the war in Ukraine could end here.\n\nResolution would authorize military intervention if Russia uses chemical, biological or nuclear weapons\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger is introducing a joint resolution that would authorize President Joe Biden to use U.S. military force in Ukraine if Russia uses chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. The legislation authorizes the use of force, if necessary, to \"protect the national security interests of the United States with respect to Ukraine and assist in defending and restoring the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\" The authority would terminate when \"the territorial integrity of Ukraine has been restored,\" according to the resolution.\n\n“Putin must be stopped,\" said the Illinois Republican, an Air Force veteran. \"Accordingly, the commander in chief to the world’s greatest military should have the authority and means to take the necessary actions to do so.\"\n\nBritain: Most elite of Russian forces suffering highest casualties\n\nRussia committed over 120 battalion tactical groups, about 65% of its entire ground combat strength, to the war when it began in February – and more than a quarter of these units have been rendered \"combat ineffective,\" the British Defense Ministry said in an assessment Monday.\n\n\"Some of Russia’s most elite units, including the VDV Airborne Forces, have suffered the highest levels of attrition,\" the assessment says. \"It will probably take years for Russia to reconstitute these forces.\"\n\nPrevious assessments have highlighted chronic shortcomings in Russian tactical coordination and issues with troop morale. But they also have noted modest gains by the Russian military.\n\nPoland urges EU to halt use of Russian energy, gets mixed reception\n\nPoland urged the European Union to impose restrictive sanctions on Russia’s oil and natural gas sectors and to refuse Russian demands to pay for gas in rubles. EU ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss how to lessen dependence on Russian energy following Russia’s decision last week to cut gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland. Energy giant Gazprom says the two countries failed to pay their bills in April.\n\nAn embargo, however, could damage European economies already made fragile by the war. Hungary opposes the ban, and Germany’s Economy Minister Robert Habeck has acknowledged that not all other member states were on board. Polish Climate and Environment Minister Anna Moskwa was unyielding.\n\n“We will call for immediate sanctions on Russian oil and gas,\" she said. \"This is the next, and urgent, and absolute step.\"\n\nIsrael demands apology from Lavrov over 'unforgivable' Jewish comments\n\nIsrael's Foreign Affairs Ministry on Monday demanded an apology and summoned the Russian ambassador for a \"clarification meeting\" after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made inflammatory statements about Nazis and the Jewish people.\n\nRussia has claimed one reason for its invasion was to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine. A reporter on Italian TV asked Lavrov how Russia could need to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine when its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is Jewish.\n\n\"Well I think that Hitler also had Jewish origins, so it means nothing,\" Lavrov said. \"For a long time now we've been hearing the wise Jewish people say that the biggest anti-Semites are the Jews themselves.\"\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Yair Lapid described Lavrov’s remark as \"both an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error. Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust. The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of antisemitism.”\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden to visit Romania, Slovakia\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden will leave for Romania and Slovakia on Thursday for a five-day trip to meet with U.S. service members, embassy personnel, displaced Ukrainians, humanitarian aid workers and educators, the White House announced. On Mother’s Day, she will meet with Ukrainian mothers and children who have been forced to flee their home country.\n\nThe trip will begin with a visit to Mihail Kogalniceau Airbase in Romania, where she will meet with United States military service members. On Sunday she will meet with refugees and humanitarian aid workers in Slovakia. On May 9, Biden will meet with Slovakia government officials before returning to the United States.\n\nKremlin says no rush to end war by Victory Day next week\n\nMoscow won’t set artificial timeframes to complete its military operation in Ukraine by the Victory Day holiday next Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Italy’s Mediaset TV. The Ukraine military claimed last month that Russian soldiers were being told that the war must end by that date.\n\nVictory Day marks Germany's formal surrender to Russia in 1945 and is celebrated with parades and other events paying homage to those who died and to the war's survivors and veterans.\n\n\"Our troops won’t artificially base their activities on a specific date, including Victory Day,\" Lavrov said. \"We will solemnly celebrate May 9 the way we always do.\"\n\nPelosi thanks Poland for heroic efforts to support Ukrainians\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed gratitude to the Polish people Monday for their humanitarian aid and other support for Ukraine. Pelosi and a half dozen U.S. lawmakers met with Poland’s President Andrzej Duda and Polish lawmakers in Warsaw on Monday. The visit followed a weekend visit to Kyiv where they met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, pledging support until Russia is defeated. Pelosi called Duda “a valued partner.\"\n\n“Further informed and deeply moved by our experiences throughout our engagements in Poland, our delegation will return to Washington ready to continue our work until victory is won, and Ukraine has defended Democracy for their nation and the world,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nUkraine admits ‘Ghost of Kyiv’ fighter pilot is a myth\n\nUkrainian authorities over the weekend admitted that the fighter pilot dubbed the “Ghost of Kyiv,” whose single-handed conquests against Russian forces made the then-unnamed pilot the stuff of legends, is a myth.\n\n“The Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!” Ukraine’s air force said on Facebook.\n\nThe statement came after published reports identified Maj. Stepan Tarabalka as the man behind the moniker.

White’s death is a shock because she was so incredibly alive, from her start as a TV ingénue to her reign as America’s favorite senior citizen. Surely we can be forgiven for thinking she was always with us, and always would be.\n\nWhite died \"peacefully in her sleep\" from natural causes in Brentwood, California on Friday, her agent and friend Jeff Witjas confirmed to USA TODAY. She was 99.\n\n\"Betty has had a fantastic life and career and she was one of the most positive people I know.

The issue featuring White hit newsstands on Wednesday.\n\nBetty White's 99th birthday: Her top tips for living a long and healthy life\n\nHas any TV star ever had a better run? Her 21 Primetime Emmy nominations, stretching over seven decades from 1951 to 2014, and five wins – with a Daytime Emmy thrown in – only begin to tell the story.\n\nFrom her very first television series, \"Life With Elizabeth,\" there has hardly been a time when she has not been a regular presence in our homes: From \"Date With the Angels\" through \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" \"The Betty White Show,\" \"Mama’s Family,\" \"The Golden Girls,\" \"Boston Legal,\" \"Hot in Cleveland\" and \"Betty White’s Off Their Rockers.\"\n\nAnd that’s not to mention the years of afternoons we spent watching her on game-show panels, including \"To Tell the Truth,\" \"What’s My Line,\" \"Girl Talk,\" \"The Match Game,\" \"You Don’t Say!,\" \"Just Men!,\" \"The Hollywood Squares,\" \"The $25,000 Pyramid\" – and of course \"Password,\" the show where she met her third husband, Allen Ludden.\n\nAs \"Hot in Cleveland\" reached its finale in 2015, White, a spry 93, told USA TODAY she was open to more acting work.\n\n\"That's one of the things I appreciate the most, that I'm still invited to work. Usually, you get to a given age – and that's a couple of decades ago for me – and (work) dries up, but, oh, I've been so lucky,\" said White, who followed \"Cleveland\" with guest appearances on \"Bones\" and a few other acting projects. \"Work is just a joy. I know it can't go on forever, but I'm making the most of whatever comes along.\"\n\nWhite received a standing ovation during an appearance at the 2018 Primetime Emmy Awards as she joked about her longevity.\n\n\"Somebody said something the other day about the 'first lady of television,' and I took it as a big compliment,\" she told fellow stars and millions of TV viewers. \"Then I heard her talking to her daughter a little later, and she said ... 'She's that old – she was the first one, way, way back.'\"\n\nEven at 97, White remained an active force in show business, lending her voice to 2019's \"Toy Story 4\" as the teething toy \"Bitey White\" and 2019's \"Trouble,\" as the wealthy dog owner Sarah Vanderwhoozie. That year, she also embraced her \"B-Dawg\" alter ego for an NBC \"Sunday Night Football\" promo.\n\nNot only was it a long and great career, it was a career that inspired an almost unprecedented level of affection from all age groups. In her late 80s, she won a Teen Choice Award for the 2009 Sandra Bullock-Ryan Reynolds film \"The Proposal\" and became the beneficiary of a youth-driven internet campaign that made her, at 88, the oldest host of \"Saturday Night Live.\" Her longtime advocacy for animals only made her more beloved by fans.\n\nThe secret of White's appeal lay in her ability to convey an incredible, but never cloying, sweetness while also being able to project an equally incredible level of sexual voraciousness. For most of her career she bounced between the two extremes, but sometimes she combined them – and every time, in every role, there was something knowing behind the eyes that belied the innocence of the smile.\n\nWe saw the sweetness first, as she played a young wife in the now largely forgotten 1953 sitcom \"Life With Elizabeth\" and the 1957 ABC series \"Date With the Angels.\" They won her a 20-year stint as host of the Tournament of Roses Parade, but neither made her a star.\n\nThat process began, oddly enough, with her 1960s stint on \"Password,\" the show that introduced her to Ludden, the man she called her great love. Apparently, he saw what we did: Lurking behind that gentle exterior was a smart, accomplished woman with a quick wit and a talent for putting across a racy double entendre without allowing the slightest hint of smut to ruin the fun.\n\nWithout \"Password\" and her other amusing game show appearances, she may never have been cast against type in her first great TV role: Sue Ann Nivens in \"Mary Tyler Moore.\"\n\nJoining the show in 1973 as WJM’s “Happy Homemaker,” White seemed to delight in tweaking her own image – switching effortlessly from the saccharine on-air Homemaker to the viperish Sue Ann – and filling a supporting-character void vacated after the spinoff departure of Valerie Harper's iconic Rhoda, a task that would have intimidated a lesser performer.\n\nSue Ann leered after producer Lou Grant, insulted news writer Murray and treated poor Mary as if she were a lamb she couldn’t be bothered to slaughter. Has any actor ever been better at hiding a dig behind a mirthless smile – and has any show ever pulled off a better set piece than the gang’s first visit to Sue Ann’s mirrored love nest?\n\nHaving embodied that character so well, most actors would have been content with – or doomed to – variations on it for the rest of their careers. Instead, for her next hit series, White went in the opposite direction. Rather than playing the sex-crazed Blanche, the role that was first offered to her on \"The Golden Girls,\" White traded with Rue McClanahan and took the part of TV’s queen of naiveté, Rose Nylund.\n\nFor seven years on \"Girls\" and another on spinoff \"Golden Palace,\" she redefined the limits of playing dumb while proving older women could be as big a TV draw as their younger sisters – a lesson that, sadly, the industry quickly forgot.\n\nShe was in her 70s when her run as Rose ended, an age when many actors find work opportunities scarce. But White had one more great role in her, a role that would carry her to the end of her life, and it was – to put it broadly – Betty White, Dirty Old Broad.\n\nThe part was created for her by David E. Kelley in his big-screen horror spoof \"Lake Placid,\" in which every inappropriate word White uttered drew a shocked laugh. He did a variation on it for her in lawyer dramas \"The Practice\" and \"Boston Legal,\" and she basically ran with it from there in her TV appearances and in her final sitcom, \"Hot in Cleveland.\" She got old, which happens. The act didn’t, which almost never does.\n\nBut of course, people get only so old, and then they leave us. We always knew she would. But White left us with Sue Ann and Rose and a thousand happy memories. How many people can say the same?\n\nSo maybe she will be with us forever after all.\n\nContributing: Bill Keveney, Charlie Trepany, Amy Haneline", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/world/royal-family-line-of-succession", "title": "The British royal family line of succession explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nCharles has become Britain’s new King following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, at the age of 96.\n\nThe Queen became the sixth female to ascend to the British throne in February 1952, after the death of her father, King George VI.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhat does Chapter 11 bankruptcy mean for Rite Aid?\n\nThe company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New Jersey.\n\nThe Chapter 11 filing means Rite Aid plans to stay in business while restructuring its debts through a court-controlled process. Rite Aid even said in a Sunday statement that it has raised $3.45 billion in financing from lenders as it continues to operate its stores while in bankruptcy.\n\nWhen the company last filed a financial report in June, it had $3.3 billion in debt, compared to the $135.5 million in cash it had on hand.\n\nIn the statement about Chapter 11 filing, Rite Aid laid out a restructuring plan that includes closing underperforming stores.\n\nWhat do we know about store closures?\n\nFounded in 1962, Philadelphia-based Rite Aid is one of the largest pharmacy chains in the nation with more than 2,000 stores in 17 states.\n\nMost customers won’t have to worry about the bankruptcy filing disrupting their ability to shop or fill prescriptions at their local stores — unless, of course, that store is now slated to close. Rite Aid, which has closed several stores in recent months, said in its media release that it's preparing to close more.\n\n\"Rite Aid regularly evaluates its store portfolio to ensure it is operating efficiently while meeting the needs of its customers, communities and associates,\" the company said in a statement. \"These efforts will further reduce the company’s rent expense and are expected to strengthen its overall financial performance.\"\n\nJoy Errico, a spokesperson for Rite Aid, declined to release further information about how many stores were slated to close or what the timeline for closures would be when reached Monday morning by USA TODAY.\n\nRite Aid said in the statement that it will communicate with customers of stores that will be closing and ensure they are able to get access to the services they need at other nearby locations. Employees at closing stores will also be transferred \"where possible,\" Rite Aid said.\n\nWhat other plans does Rite Aid have?\n\nRite Aid plans to use the bankruptcy to resolve its legal disputes and also sell some of its businesses, including prescription benefit manager Elixir Solutions that it bought in 2015 for $2 billion.\n\nAs part of the bankruptcy plan, Rite Aid appointed on Sunday a new CEO to lead restructuring, Jeff Stein, who will also serve as a member of its board. Elizabeth Burr had been serving as interim CEO since January and will remain on the company’s board, Rite Aid said.\n\nStein, the founder of financial advisory firm Stein Advisors, said in a statement the company plans to remain in business for the long term.\n\n“My priorities will include overseeing the actions now underway to strengthen the company’s financial position and further advance its journey to reach its full potential as a modern neighborhood pharmacy,” Stein said in the statement. “I have tremendous confidence in this business and the turnaround strategy that has been developed in recent months.”\n\nWhy is Rite Aid facing opioid lawsuits?\n\nRite Aid's legal troubles related to its alleged role in the nationwide deadly abuse of opioids only further contributed to its mounting debt.\n\nThe many lawsuits filed against Rite Aid accuse the company of knowingly filling prescriptions for the addictive painkillers that did not meet legal requirements. In March, the Justice Department filed a complaint against Rite Aid asserting that it violated the Controlled Substances Act by filling prescriptions for excessive quantities of prescription pain killers that had “obvious red flags.”\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the rise in U.S. opioid overdose deaths can be tied to the uptick in opioid prescriptions starting in the 1990s. Drug overdose deaths from prescription opioids jumped from 3,442 in 1999 to 16,706 in 2021, according to data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nContributing: Bailey Schulz\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

In a statement, Wentworth reiterated the company's commitment to focusing on improving its core business: retail pharmacy.\n\n\"This turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term,\" Wentworth said in the statement.\n\nThe announcement comes amid an improving – but still challenging – fiscal year 2024.\n\nWhile Walgreens exceeded its target of slashing $1 billion in costs in the last fiscal year, the chain reported a $3 billion loss last quarter. Still the chain's revenue in the last fiscal year rose more than 6% from a year ago, according to the company's earnings report.\n\nFourth-quarter sales in the retail pharmacy sector reached $29.5 billion, an increase of 6.5% from the same quarter a year ago.\n\nWalgreens has not announced which stores will close. As of Aug. 31 last year, the drugstore chain had more than 8,700 stores in America.\n\nHow many Walgreens are in California?\n\nWalgreens did not respond to The Desert Sun’s inquiry regarding how many Walgreens are in California and if any locations would be affected by the closures. However, data company ScrapeHero reports there are 540 Walgreens stores in California. An incomplete count of Walgreens in California, based on an online directory that doesn’t immediately indicate the total number of locations in the state, shows more than 100 stores.\n\nOther states Walgreens has a significant presence in are Florida, Texas and Illinois, according to ScrapeHero.\n\nWhat other businesses are closing locations in California?\n\nThe news comes as several other companies shutter their stores in California. Big Lots will close nearly 100 stores across the state following the retailer’s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year. LL Flooring, formerly Lumber Liquidators, announced it’d close 11 stores in California as it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August. And 99 Cents Only Stores, originating in Los Angeles, closed all 371 locations, including California stores.\n\nParis Barraza is a trending reporter covering California news at The Desert Sun.

The retail industry suffered a string of high-profile bankruptcies in 2023, as stores still struggling to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic had to contend with inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nMany long-cherished household names weren’t protected. Bankruptcies made national headlines and shocked many of us, shutting down companies or locations for good. Despite a generally solid U.S. economy, other businesses face an uncertain fate in 2024, with more closings expected across the state and nation.\n\nHere are some bankruptcies and closings that hit hard across New Jersey in 2023.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond\n\nBed Bath & Beyond — known for being the go-to spot for shoppers looking to outfit dorm rooms and starter homes, and for keeping them coming back with its iconic big, blue 20% off coupons — announced in April that it was filing for Chapter 11 and would close hundreds of stores across the United States. That included 13 in New Jersey.\n\nAnalysts say the chain failed to adapt to the COVID-induced shift to online shopping and therefore couldn't take advantage of the home decorating boom during the pandemic’s early days. Over the summer, Overstock.com bought the bankrupt retailer’s assets, relaunching BB&B as an online-only presence at bedbathandbeyond.com.\n\nKmart\n\nThe last New Jersey location for the long-struggling department store chain — this one in Westwood — closed in September. It was the lone Garden State survivor for a business that at one time had more than 2,000 stores around the country.\n\nRite Aid\n\nThe fate of this pharmacy retail chain is still uncertain. The embattled company, which had 102 stores in New Jersey, declared bankruptcy in October, listing nearly $8.6 billion in debts and $7.6 billion in assets, court filings show. Rite Aid has received a commitment for $3.45 billion in new financing from some of its lenders to stay afloat. But plans still call for closing 400 to 500 stores nationwide, including 12 in New Jersey.\n\nAccording to the website, there are 1,818 Rite Aid stores across the United States.\n\nThe pharmacy chain said its filing would help it resolve hundreds of lawsuits it faced for allegedly contributing to the U.S. opioid epidemic.\n\nTuesday Morning\n\nThe off-price home goods retailer filed for bankruptcy in February in a Texas court and closed 264 locations, citing poor retail sales. Among the casualties was a store in Midland Park.\n\nChristmas Tree Shops\n\nThe home goods retailer was known for selling everything from bedding sets to seasonal decor and outdoor furniture. But Christmas Tree Shops filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May amid struggling sales and worsening finances, liquidating more than 70 stores, including 10 in New Jersey.\n\nCenter Cinemas, Rutherford\n\nCenter Cinemas, in the Williams Center for the Arts, showed its last movie in February. Owner Shawn Stutler said he wouldn’t renew the lease due to an increase in rent. Stutler opened the theater in December 2016, while the arts center was owned by Bergen County and run by a nonprofit group that has since disbanded.\n\nThe property was sold to Rutherford for $1 in 2020. The borough then sold it to Chuck Olivo, a redeveloper and longtime Rutherford resident, in 2021, also for $1. Shortly after that, Olivo spoke of his intentions to save the theater, including plans for a residential component and possibly a restaurant, but no formal plans were laid out.\n\nAbbot's Drug Store, Belleville\n\nAbbot's Drug Store, which also went by Novellinos Drug Store Inc., permanently closed in January after 50 years in business when the owner retired.\n\nMandee, Wayne\n\nThis low-priced retail chain store at the Preakness Shopping Center in Wayne carried trendy apparel, shoes and accessories, but the store closed earlier this year. New Jersey-based Big M Inc., which owns Mandee, as well as Annie Sez and Afaze, filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, after years of financial struggles.\n\nSome other Mandee stores in New Jersey remain open.\n\nCorrado's Market, Wayne\n\nThe family-owned grocery store that was operating at the Point View shopping center in Wayne since 2008 closed in July after 15 years in service. That followed almost a year and a half of gossip about its imminent closing. There are two other Corrado’s in New Jersey: Clifton and Fairfield.\n\n“If the pandemic didn’t happen,” said James Corrado, a co-owner of the chain, “we’d still be open. We’d still own the shopping center. That’s the long and the short of it.”\n\nDaniel Munoz covers business, consumer affairs, labor and the economy for NorthJersey.com and The Record.\n\nEmail: munozd@northjersey.com; Twitter:@danielmunoz100", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/healthcare/2023/09/25/erie-pa-rite-aid-pharmacies-to-close-early-october-as-part-of-bankruptcy-plans/70960577007/", "title": "Rite Aid pharmacies in Erie to close as part of bankruptcy plans", "text": "Rite Aid is closing at least two inner-city Erie pharmacies as the drug store chain negotiates with creditors over a bankruptcy plan.\n\nEmployees at both Erie pharmacies, 2715 Parade St. and 1709 Liberty St., have posted yellow discount signs throughout the store, and begun removing items from store shelves and placing them into plastic containers.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/08/06/walgreens-store-closings-drugstore-chain-plans-close-200-stores/1937722001/", "title": "Walgreens store closings: Drugstore chain plans to close 200 stores", "text": "Walgreens plans to close approximately 200 U.S. stores, the company announced Tuesday in an SEC filing.\n\nAccording to the document posted Tuesday on the Securities and Exchange Commission website, the move to close stores follows “a review of the real estate footprint in the United States.”\n\nThe closing stores represent less than 3% of Walgreens nearly 9,600 U.S. stores, Phil Caruso, a Walgreens spokesman, said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\n\"As previously announced, we are undertaking a transformational cost management program to accelerate the ongoing transformation of our business, enable investments in key areas and to become a more efficient enterprise,\" Caruso said. \"As part of this effort, we plan to close approximately 200 stores in the U.S.\"\n\nMore store closings coming: An estimated 12,000 shops could close by the end of 2019\n\nNeed a break?

Servants roam the halls while a cadre of cooks and other lackeys shine their shoes and whip up fancy meals.\n\nThen there is the Royal Train. Yes, the queen and other members of the Royal Family have their own railroad cars to whisk them around the realm. And the Queen's Flight, aka the Royal Squadron – a collection of executive-type jets – is on hand should they wish to move farther and faster.\n\nOK, so Prince William and Duchess Catherine flew – shock! – on a commercial airliner Sunday to start a three-day trip to New York City (with a quick side trip by Will to see President Obama at that cute little White House in D.C.) but you can bet they weren't ensconced in the knee-bending confines of coach.\n\nWork? Well, they don't really seem to do much except turn up at ritzy parties, cut ribbons, make small talk and try to look interested as they visit orphans and colorfully dressed former British soldiers.\n\nNice job if you can get it.\n\nBut we don't hate them. In fact, we love them. In Britain, a poll conducted by the national Daily Telegraph newspaper found that 53% of Britons think that the U.K. would be worse off without the royals while only 14% thought it would be better off (33% either thought it would make no difference or had no opinion).\n\nAnd in the U.S., according to a CNN poll, fully 82% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Queen Elizabeth. Prince William and Duchess Kate are only a few points behind. (Somewhat naughty Prince Harry even merits a 70% positive rating). And get this: The same poll found that 13% of Americans would like its own royal family. (In 1950, a survey counted only 3% in favor).\n\nSo, what's going on here? Why do Britons and Americans alike adore a bunch of unelected and seemingly talent-free people who got their cushy jobs only because they happen to be descended from people who pretty much did the same job before them?\n\nAnd why were hundreds of people hanging out for hours in freezing weather around New York's exclusive-but-discreet Carlyle Hotel to wait for Will and Kate to arrive?\n\nTwo words: Continuity and comfort. To Britons – and I am one of them, though I have lived more than half my life, very happily, in the United States – the Royal Family represents a virtually unbroken thread into the country's past. In the turbulence of modern times, they are always there, mostly unchanging and unflappable. Their quirks and foibles, such as Prince Charles' allegedly talking to his plants, only reinforce England's self-image as a land of enthusiastic amateurs who somehow stood up to Hitler while led by an overweight, bald alcoholic (otherwise known as Winston Churchill).\n\nAnother thing that puts them on the most-popular list: Rather like the coolest kid at school, they don't have to try. They just are. Unlike politicians, they don't have to sell their souls (in other words, beg for money) to get elected. And unlike movie and music stars, they don't have to strive, be talented or particularly good-looking (though as Princess Diana and, now, Kate Middleton have proved, it helps).\n\nMany Britons, including myself, like to pretend that we are being logical and rational when we say such things as, \"We may as well stick with them – they bring in more tourist dollars than they cost to keep.\" But in truth, even if that were not true, I would still want a royal family at the top of the heap that is Britain.\n\nLike a friend you only swap holiday cards with or a museum that you never visit, it's just nice to know they are there.\n\nDiebel is USA TODAY's senior headlines editor.

Britain elects a party, not a specific leader, to rule the country − of the past five Conservative prime ministers, only three were directly elected.\n\n\"Change begins now,\" Starmer said in an address early Friday after Sunak conceded defeat.\n\nResults were still trickling in, but Labour passed the threshold to secure a majority and an exit poll projected that Labour will win 410 seats to the Conservatives' 131 in Britain's 650-seat Parliament, a majority of 170. The exit poll was carried out by the polling company Ipsos, jointly for British broadcasters BBC News, ITV News and Sky News.\n\nSunak described the outcome as a \"sobering verdict.\" Announcing he would resign as prime minister outside No. 10 Downing St., he said, \"I have heard your anger, disappointment and I take responsibility for this loss.\"\n\nStarmer formally became prime minister Friday after being invited to form a government by King Charles in a ceremony known as the \"kissing of the hands.\"\n\nLabour will replace a Conservative government whose reputation was deeply marred by Britain's exit from the European Union, known as Brexit, and its failure to reduce record immigration levels and repair the nation's aging infrastructure and beleaguered public services.\n\nVoters rejected the Conservatives after 14 years of rule, experts said, because the party could not come to grips with a cost-of-living crisis that bruised the party's reputation for financial competence.\n\nBritons feel dissatisfied. They are worse off economically in recent years, and poverty has gone up.

After adjusting for inflation, salaries have barely risen.\n\n\"We've just had enough of them,\" said Tom Giles, 32, an office worker, shortly after emerging Friday from a voting station in central London, referring to the Conservatives.\n\nTim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said the Conservatives had been in power \"for too long for people to forgive.\" He said this was evident in everything from stagnant salaries to roads full of potholes, from long waiting lists at public hospitals to schools without enough teachers.\n\nConservative rule expected to end after 14 years\n\nSunak, 44, was Britain's first Hindu leader. He's extremely wealthy. His wife is an heiress to an Indian tech firm fortune. He rose to the job after his predecessor, Liz Truss, lasted just 44 days as prime minister. She resigned after unveiling a tax-cutting agenda that deeply spooked financial markets.\n\nTruss had taken over from Boris Johnson, who stepped down amid revelations that he ignored his own COVID-19 lockdown rules to attend parties and social gatherings.\n\nBefore that, Theresa May won the prime minister role in a national vote after David Cameron's resignation in 2016 when he held, and lost, a referendum on Britain's EU membership.\n\nThe Labour Party last won a general election in Britain in 2005. Former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair won a record majority for his party in 1997, when he secured a 179-seat majority in Parliament.\n\nStarmer has vowed he'll try to tackle the sluggish economy and underfunded public services without raising taxes.\n\n\"Today Britain can begin a new chapter,” Starmer said Thursday in a statement. \"A new age of hope and opportunity after 14 years of chaos and decline.\"\n\nLabour says it will find the money it needs to fix Britain by closing tax loopholes used by the wealthy, ending tax breaks for those who pay for private schools, and being a more prudent and responsible steward of the economy. It's a growth strategy that has raised eyebrows among some economists.\n\n\"It isn’t yet clear from their speeches, pamphlets and interviews exactly what they believe will drive growth and how they will achieve it,\" a group of economists who reviewed Labour's economic policies wrote in an essay collection published by the Social Market Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank.\n\n\"Overall, we find no ‘grand theory’ of growth but a series of pragmatic, often technocratic, interventions which might drive growth,\" they wrote.\n\nIn a bid to limit a historic defeat for the Conservatives, Sunak had warned Britons of giving Labour a \"supermajority\" in Parliament, saying his party could at least provide an effective opposition.\n\nThe outcome of Britain’s vote is not expected to substantially change its close relationship with the U.S. on defense, intelligence-sharing and trade because most issues of foreign affairs are viewed as nonpartisan. However, Labour would be more comfortable with President Joe Biden or another Democratic president than former President Donald Trump, according to Bale. Trump was more unpredictable on issues like trade during his term in office.\n\nOver the past 100 years, the Conservatives have been the most electorally successful British political party. In that time, there have been 17 Conservative-led British governments, compared with eight led by Labour.\n\nOne important impact of the vote on British politics is that Nigel Farage, a close ally of Trump's who leads the right-wing Reform UK party, was for the first time elected to Britain's Parliament.\n\nFarage is an anti-immigration, EU-sceptic political rabble-rouser who campaigned for Brexit. He told USA TODAY in an interview before the election that he intended to mount a long-term challenge to the Conservatives and ultimately replace the party as an opposition force to Labour at the next general election, expected in 2029.\n\nReform UK lawmakers won four seats.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/04"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/959171/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-9-january-2023", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 9 January 2023 | The Week", "text": "1. ‘Neo-fascists’ Brazil protest\n\nBrazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has pledged to punish “neo-fascists” after supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro stormed Congress and the Supreme Court.

Opinium, which surveyed 2,000 representative voters, found some 33% of those planning to vote Conservative at the next election believed Brexit had created more problems than it solved. The top worry for Tory voters currently sceptical about Brexit is problems around the Northern Ireland border, cited by 39% of respondents. The second most common concern was regarding red tape affecting trade with other countries, mentioned by 36%.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

UK crisis ‘halfway through’\n\nThe average household in Britain is only halfway through a two-year cost of living crisis that will leave families £2,100 worse off, according to the Resolution Foundation. The analysis found that disposable income will drop by 3% during this financial year and by 4% in the next one, leaving an average family £2,100 worse off. In April, the government is planning to cut its support for energy bills, causing a typical bill to rise from £2,000 to £2,850.\n\nWhen will the cost-of-living crisis end?\n\n4. Harry: ‘royals not racist’\n\nPrince Harry has admitted Meghan Markle did not get on with William and Kate “from the get-go”. In an interview with ITV, the Duke of Sussex also denied that accusations of racism were made towards the royals when he and Meghan were interviewed by US TV host Oprah Winfrey. However, said The Sun, the latter remark was “bizarre” and a U-turn from “previous incendiary claims”. Separately, speaking to US show 60 Minutes, Harry said he once viewed his stepmother Camilla, the Queen Consort, as “the villain”.\n\nMAR 21: The most explosive claims from Harry and Meghan’s Oprah interview\n\n5. China begins to open borders\n\nTens of thousands of people travelled in and out of China yesterday as the authorities relaxed quarantine regulations, after three years of pandemic isolation. However, according to CNN, China “isn’t rolling out the red carpet for international leisure tourists looking to experience the country’s many attractions just yet” and “borders remain largely closed to foreigners, apart from business or family visits”. Cases of Covid-19 skyrocketed in recent weeks as various restrictions were relaxed.\n\nWill new Covid testing rules for China prevent the spread of new variants?\n\n6. Government confirms plastic ban\n\nMinisters have confirmed that single-use items such as plastic cutlery, plates and trays will be banned in England. According to government data, 1.1 billion single-use plates and more than four billion pieces of plastic cutlery are used in England every year, and each person in England uses an average of 18 single-use plastic plates and 37 items of plastic cutlery every year. “A plastic fork can take 200 years to decompose, that is two centuries in landfill or polluting our oceans,” said the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey.\n\nThe climate crisis in 2023\n\n7. Sunak under fire on healthcare\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing told Rishi Sunak to “come clean” today after he refused three times to say whether he has private healthcare. During an interview with the BBC, the prime minister insisted the matter was “not really relevant” and insisted that his healthcare arrangements were “a personal choice”. The Mirror said Sunak is “out of touch” and The Telegraph said Sunak has “faced criticism from political opponents on the issue as he is thought to be the wealthiest prime minister in history”.\n\nThe boom in private healthcare: a two-tier system?\n\n8. Boris return would be ‘kamikaze’\n\nAllies of Boris Johnson have given up hope of him returning to Downing Street. One supportive MP, who served in Johnson’s cabinet, told The Times that the only way Johnson would become leader before the next election was through another “kamikaze attack on the leader” that would “lose us the election”. However, Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, claimed in the Mail on Sunday that the Conservatives would “die” if Johnson did not lead the party into the next election.\n\nWhat is Boris Johnson doing now?\n\n9. Labour mull cigarette ban\n\nThe shadow health secretary has said a Labour government could ban the sale of cigarettes in order to stamp out smoking by 2030. Wes Streeting said the party would consult on banning the sale and purchase of cigarettes as part of a “radical” drive to eradicate smoking. Last month, New Zealand passed laws aimed at preventing children from becoming smokers, including a lifetime prohibition on cigarette sales to everyone born after 2008. Smoking rates in the UK have fallen from about half of the population in the 1970s to around 15% now, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nNew Zealand’s new smoking ban\n\n10. Clarkson waves white flag\n\nJeremy Clarkson has abandoned plans to open a restaurant at his Diddly Squat farm. The controversial broadcaster’s battle with the local council over the issue has “at times, gone with a bang”, said The Times, recalling how he described his adversaries as “swivel-eyed communists, drippy hippies and Liberal Democrats”. He also once bragged that he could defeat planning objections to his farm restaurant through a “delightful little loophole”. However, he has now written to Oxfordshire council saying he “no longer wished” to proceed.\n\nJeremy Clarkson ordered to shut his farm’s dining areas", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/07/sport/mlb-opening-day-baseball-popularity-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "MLB Opening Day: Why is baseball no longer America's Game? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nMajor League Baseball is finally back. Despite a lockout and delay in Opening Day, the players are actually going to take the field. When my father, born in 1927, was my age, Opening Day was one of the biggest events on the sports calendar.\n\nFor his son, it’s just another day. It’s not that I don’t like baseball – I do. It’s that baseball is not the sport that stands out above all others in my mind.\n\nMy family’s story is part of a larger one about America’s declining interest in baseball and generational replacement.\n\nThe sport, which was once the most popular in the country, has a bevy of problems that has landed it, at best, a distant second place in America’s hearts. This is especially true among America’s youth.\n\nJust 11% of adults listed baseball as their favorite sport to watch in a 2021 Washington Post poll. That put it well behind football (34%) and tied with basketball for the second favorite sport. Soccer and “something else” (e.g. esports/competitive video gaming) were closely behind at 7%.\n\nWhen examining the poll more in-depth, the problem baseball has becomes both more apparent – and even scarier. A mere 7% of those under the age of 30 say baseball is their favorite sport. This ranked fifth behind football (24%), basketball (17%), “something else” (12%) and soccer (10%).\n\nWhile these fans are overjoyed to be at the ballpark, only 11% of total adults and 7% of people aged under 30 in the US list baseball as their favorite sport. Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n\nTo put baseball’s overall 11% in perspective, there were many more fans of baseball the last time there was a work stoppage in 1994. In an average of Gallup polls that year, 19% of Americans said baseball was their favorite sport.\n\nWhile the 1994 baseball strike may have hurt the sport’s popularity, the truth is baseball had been on the decline for a while. Baseball hadn’t ranked as America’s favorite sport to watch since 1960, when 34% said it was. Soccer that year came in at less than 0.5%, while football picked up 21% support. By the next poll Gallup did on the subject in 1972, baseball was second to football.\n\nThe rise of TV\n\nThe fact that 1960 is the last time baseball reigned supreme is notable. The sports landscape has changed dramatically from 62 years ago.\n\nOne big reason baseball no longer finds itself the darling of American sports is competition and the dawn of the television age.\n\nThe NFL didn’t sign its first league-wide TV contract until 1962; it led to every game being on television and each team receiving a share of the revenue pie. This came around the same time that the AFL – a rival league which would eventually merge with the NFL – started play and signed its own league-wide TV deal.\n\nAfter this point, this meant that over 20 teams had their contests televised, and the country had universal access to the pro game. Additionally, the Super Bowl would begin in 1967. The NFL, of course, is a sport that benefits tremendously from being seen. Baseball, on the other hand, doesn’t gain as much going from radio to television.\n\nAn NBC camera at Yankee Stadium circa 1950 in the Bronx, New York City. MLB/Getty Images\n\nAnother sport which is better visually than audibly is basketball. The NBA was less than 15 years old in 1960. There were just eight NBA teams at that point – half the size of either professional baseball or football. The NBA Finals wouldn’t be aired in their entirety nationally until 1970.\n\nThe country was years away from a successful professional soccer league in 1960 – let alone the incarnation of the MLS. Now, a soccer fan can watch games from here and those across the Atlantic Ocean – the English Premier League and the UEFA Champions League, for example – with ease.\n\nAs for other sports, there were only six NHL teams compared to the 32 today. And the idea of competitive video gaming was a science fiction fantasy and not at all conceivable.\n\nThe increased competition and the use of screens to watch sports came at an inopportune time for baseball.\n\nIf bored, Americans can change the channel very quickly. On social media platforms like TikTok, things go by faster than a bullet train. Baseball is anything but fast as far as Americans are concerned.\n\nCheck out this 2007 Gallup poll when people who weren’t pro baseball fans were asked why they didn’t like the sport. The two top reasons given were boring/uninteresting (31%) and games being too slow/too long (21%).\n\nBaseball boredom?\n\nThe Atlanta Braves' Truist Park during the national anthem prior to Game Four of the 2021 World Series against the Houston Astros. Michael Zarrilli/Getty Images\n\nWhen you look at the data from actual games, you get why people might think the sport is either too boring or too slow.\n\nBalls being put into play have shrunk dramatically, and the strikeout rate has skyrocketed. About 100 years ago, there were well more than twice as many hits than strikeouts in baseball. In 1960, there were 1.7 times as many hits than strikeouts. Last year, there were nearly 3,000 more strikeouts than hits.\n\nIn most sports besides baseball or football, the game is constantly in action. Unlike in baseball, there’s a real rhythm to when each football play starts up with a moving game and play clock.\n\nIncreasingly too, baseball fans need to sit through a game which is taking longer and longer to finish. The length of the average a nine-inning game has gone from two hours and 33 minutes in 1960 to three hours and 10 minutes in 2021. Compare this with a soccer match, which has 90 minutes of play, a 15-minute halftime and some stoppage time – usually two to four minutes.\n\nAdditionally, there simply isn’t a sport that requires someone to sit through more minutes with so little action – so often. While NFL game lengths are similar, remember that an MLB team has 162 regular season games per year. The NFL has just 17.\n\nPerhaps, people might be more willing to sit through long games if they cared about the players. Many people have pointed out the fact that baseball doesn’t have any “stars” as a reason why the sport has struggled.\n\nIn an era in which fans are increasingly rooting for players over teams, this could be a big problem.\n\nOne way we can look at this is through the number of Instagram followers the top athletes in baseball, basketball and football have.\n\nArguably the best MLB player of the last 50 years, Mike Trout still lags far behind his sport competitors on social media. Billie Weiss/Boston Red Sox/Getty Images\n\nMike Trout – arguably the best MLB player of the last 50 years alone – has only about two million followers. This trails NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. and his more than 15 million followers. It’s well behind NBA great LeBron James, who has over 100 million followers. International soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo has over 420 million followers, though many of those are outside the United States.\n\nThe inability to be big on social media is just one reason that baseball is likely struggling with today’s youth.\n\nBeyond social media, there was a time when the greatest baseball stars were household names. Consider a 1945 poll from Gallup asking Americans whether they knew who different stars across various industries were.\n\nMore than 90% said they knew who former baseball star Babe Ruth was. The vast majority – 90% of all Americans – not only knew who he was but were able to give a description of what he was famous for. Keep in mind, this poll was taken 10 years after Ruth last suited up to play professional baseball.\n\nRuth was better known at the time than World War II General George Patton. The same percentage of Americans knew who Ruth was as they did future president and five-star General Dwight Eisenhower, who had just helped lead the Americans to victory in Europe.\n\nModern polling indicates that there isn’t any modern baseball player who is anywhere near the level of recognition of Ruth. In fact, some data indicates that less than half of Americans even know who Trout is.\n\nThe lack of star power just isn’t the case in basketball or football. You have stars like James and the recently retired Tom Brady, who have Ruth-level name identification among the American public. Both sports, not surprisingly, have many more athletes known by at least 50% of the public than baseball.\n\nIs there anything baseball can do to reverse the tide? I don’t know.\n\nPerhaps the better question to ask at this point is whether baseball is merely trading on its legacy. As the Greatest Generation – i.e. my father’s – fades into the memory books, it seems quite plausible that baseball’s spot in the top 2 or 3 favorite sports in America may fade along with it.", "authors": ["Harry Enten"], "publish_date": "2022/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/uk/new-british-prime-minister-liz-truss-intl-gbr", "title": "Britain's new prime minister: Liz Truss wins Conservative Party ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss will be the next prime minister of the United Kingdom after winning most votes in the Conservative Party leadership contest, succeeding Boris Johnson who resigned in July after a series of scandals.\n\nTruss defeated rival Rishi Sunak with 81,326 votes to 60,399 among party members and will take over as leader on Tuesday, as Britons face mounting economic and social crisis.\n\nShe pledged action to tackle the crisis in a short victory speech at a conference center in London on Monday. Without offering details, Truss promised a “bold plan” to cut taxes and build economic growth, and “deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply.”\n\nMonday’s announcement ends weeks of bitter campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax cuts.\n\nOnce Johnson formally resigns his post to the Queen on Tuesday, Truss will also visit the monarch at her Scottish residence Balmoral, where, as leader of the largest party in parliament, she will be invited to form a government.\n\nTruss had been the frontrunner for weeks, and the 47-year-old will now follow Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May to become Britain’s third female premier. Despite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, she has found herself to be the preferred candidate of the vast majority of Brexiteers in her party.\n\nHer victory was smaller than expected, Conservatives who supported both candidates are privately admitting. It had been predicted by many that her margin of victory would be larger than the 18 percentage points announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nIn terms of her premiership, this could mean that she cannot run roughshod over her MPs, who voted in greater numbers for Sunak than Truss in the parliamentary part of this leadership contest.\n\nAnd Truss could find that she has to accommodate a wider range of views from her party, which could mean embracing Sunak’s ideas for helping Britons with the cost-of-living crisis and a less aggressive approach to tax cuts – especially corporation tax.\n\nMany Conservative MPs are privately worried that Truss’s modern-day Thatcherism could cost them the next election and will be leaping on the surprisingly low margin of victory to encourage the next PM to soften her economic stance.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party immediately dismissed her arguments, saying in a statement, “after years serving in Tory cabinets, nodding through the decisions that got us into this mess, Liz Truss simply doesn’t have the answers to this crisis.”\n\nLong political journey\n\nIn the leadership campaign, Truss’s platform had featured plenty of red meat for the Conservative membership, from a hard line against the EU on Brexit to tax cuts as her main solution to the cost-of-living crisis. This tactic clearly proved decisive in winning over ordinary members, who had the final say in electing the leader of the ruling party, who consequently becomes prime minister.\n\nBut critics have accused her new-found hardline Brexit stance of being a cynical ploy. They have pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life Truss has evolved, from being an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in favor of legalizing drugs in her youth to the embodiment of the Conservative right today.\n\nThroughout her political career, especially during the leadership contest, Truss has been compared to Thatcher, who, for many on the right, remains the benchmark for Conservative leaders. She was a tax-cutting, hard-nosed leader who took on the unions and played a large role in ending the Cold War. Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nSince becoming an MP, Truss has gone from being the darling of the liberal Conservative leader David Cameron, who took a personal interest in her career, to the Euroskeptic right’s figurehead.\n\nBefore the Brexit referendum, Truss said that she was “backing remain as I believe it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nCabinet colleagues at the time say that she never voiced any issue about supporting staying in the EU, despite having ample opportunities to express her own Euroskepticism.\n\nThese days, Truss is more than happy to pick fights with Brussels and to claim that it was the EU all along that held the British economy back.\n\nA country in turmoil\n\nTruss will take over a Conservative government that is facing multiple crises in the country. With steep rises in energy and food prices, long waiting lists for hospital treatment, and public sector workers, dock workers and even lawyers going on strike, making the case that the party deserves to win a historic fifth term at the next general election – due to be called by December 2024 at the latest – will be an uphill battle.\n\nInflation rose above 10% in July for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to a forecast by the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK would enter into recession before the end of the year. And on Monday, in a signal of these serious challenges ahead, the British pound dropped 0.3% to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’s tax-cutting policies will do much help citizens, especially after a decade of austerity policies. The Institute for Fiscal studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and smaller government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThe specter of Johnson\n\nLooming over Truss’s new government will be the long shadow of Johnson, whose time in office saw approval ratings and voter intentions plummet for the Conservative Party. He leaves office a deeply unpopular prime minister less than three years after romping home to an enormous landslide election victory in 2019.\n\nJohnson was forced to resign from office on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable. His downfall followed months of revelations over parties held in 10 Downing Street while the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nHowever, Johnson rode out the “Partygate” scandal. It was only when Chris Pincher, his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party, and Johnson delayed in acting over the matter, that his own party finally turned on him.\n\nIt is not yet known whether Johnson will remain in politics. He may still be forced to resign as a Member of Parliament after a House of Commons committee gives its verdict on whether or not Johnson knowingly misled Parliament when he claimed no rules were broken in Downing Street.\n\nRegardless, Johnson is likely to remain a high-profile figure. There is a good chance he will return to his former media career as a columnist and broadcaster, though the damage to his reputation in office might mean his appeal is limited compared to where it stood before he entered Downing Street.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Truss has been seen by most as the Johnson continuity candidate and enjoyed the backing of many of his loyalists.\n\nWhile this support has helped Truss during the leadership contest with Conservative members who saw her rival Sunak as a traitor, and who value tribal loyalty, it means she will be forever tied to the Johnson legacy.\n\nThat could ultimately become a weight around her neck, as the specter of Johnson risks overshadowing anything Truss might do to tackle the misery that many Britons are set to face this winter.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee Peter Wilkinson", "Luke Mcgee", "Peter Wilkinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/03/uk/royal-news-newsletter-06-03-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl", "title": "Analysis: When Harry and Meghan reunited with the Windsors | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nAs the bells of St Paul’s tolled for the monarch resting out of town in Windsor, a moment unfolded during arrivals that royal watchers had been holding out for – the return of the Sussexes.\n\nIt couldn’t have been easy. Outside they were greeted by cheers from the crowd that well outweighed the boos. That would have been heartening for the couple, in light of so much bad press about them. Even critics of the Sussexes in the crowd that CNN spoke to gave the couple credit for being there and showing their respect for the Queen.\n\nThis wasn’t just their first public appearance as a couple at a royal event in more than two years, it was a major state event – a thanksgiving for the Queen’s unprecedented reign in the hallowed surroundings of St Paul’s Cathedral.\n\nInside, they made their way down the long aisle, heads turning as they went along and the television cameras locked in on them to an almost uncomfortable extent.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, arrive for a service of thanksgiving for the reign of Queen Elizabeth II at St Paul's Cathedral in London on Friday. Alberto Pezzali/AP\n\nAnyone hoping to see rifts from the past couple of years healed in front of the cameras were left disappointed as Harry and Meghan took their seats amongst junior royals (including Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, and their husbands, with whom the Sussexes have no beef).\n\nWhat we don’t know yet is whether the couple had any private meetings with Prince Charles and Prince William to resolve outstanding differences.\n\nAhead of the event, there had been plenty of speculation in the British press over how the couple would be received. But they’ve taken a low-key approach to their jubilee attendance which may play in their favor.\n\nOn Thursday they didn’t appear in front of the cameras at all. They watched the Trooping the Colour military display from a window overlooking Horse Guards Parade. Were it not for confirmation of the pair’s attendance and eagle-eyed photographers with their long-lens cameras capturing grainy snaps, they might have slipped completely under the radar.\n\nThis was clearly a visit rooted in reverence for the Queen and her historic reign. If their strategy was to avoid overshadowing the 96-year-old’s milestone moment, it worked and may have gone some way to start healing that rift.\n\n“There was this huge roar when the Sussexes arrived, real popularity. People were really thrilled to see them. There was this real closeness – the family was together,” CNN royal historian Kate Williams said. “There’s been a lot of negative press about Meghan and Harry and it’s time to look past that and see that they were there to support the Queen.”\n\nShe continued: “As the Queen said in her statement when Meghan and Harry left the royal family, left as full-time royals, she said they are ‘much loved’ members of our family and that was very clear today.”\n\nThe couple take their seats within St Paul's. Dan Kitwood/AP\n\nEmily Nash, CNN royal contributor and royal editor for Hello! magazine, said it was “huge” to see the Sussexes back in the royal fold.\n\n“Not least because it sends out a signal that the family is united behind the Queen and they are prepared to put whatever has happened behind the scenes behind them,” she explained. “Whether by accident or by design, chances are relationships are going to thaw. They’re going to be able to spend some time together. Hopefully, that is going to build bridges again.”\n\n“But there is a lot contingent on this. We have Harry’s book coming out at some point, we have the Netflix documentary – there are all things that are going to cause concern to the royal family,” she added. “Whether or not, behind the scenes, these are things that are being discussed remains to be seen. But I think the very fact that they are here obviously is a cause of great pleasure for the Queen.”\n\nIt’s unclear at this point if we’ll see the Sussexes again over the weekend. We’re finding out day-to-day about their presence at the celebrations. But so far it looks like there has been some healing. Such a rebalance in the public face of the family would have been welcomed as a gift by the Queen on her landmark weekend.\n\nWHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE QUEEN’S HEALTH\n\nThe Queen’s absence at her own service of thanksgiving has inevitably sparked questions about the 96-year-old’s health again.\n\nIn years past, the monarch rarely scrapped engagements at the last minute. But her advanced age has made it difficult to work the jam-packed schedule, filled with official commitments and appointments, that has defined the majority of her reign.\n\nThe Queen and Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Trooping the Colour parade. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nAs she gets older, the Queen has reduced her number of events to focus on core constitutional duties but she’s even being forced to reduce that. Prince Charles had to represent her at the State Opening of Parliament this year.\n\nThe palace has given no reason to think the Queen is in poor health. However, her age and the fact that she is the world’s most recognizable woman often fuel speculation when something is amiss with the British sovereign. The palace has tried to strike a balance between being truthful while preventing people from becoming overly concerned.

The first day of jubilee celebrations appeared to be a soaring success, capped with a fabulous flypast over Buckingham Palace.

The Gold State Coach, which first transported a young Queen Elizabeth II from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey on her coronation day in 1953, will lead a spectacular procession on the streets of London as part of the pageant. Adorned with ornate sculptures of cherubs and tritons as a show of national unity and strength, and featuring panel paintings, the eye-catching coach is a moving work of art. Inside, it’s equally detailed and upholstered with velvet and satin. The Queen herself will not be on board during the pageant. But archival footage of her waving from the carriage on the day she was crowned will be projected onto its windows.

Designed by British “starchitect” Thomas Heatherwick as the principal Platinum Jubilee beacon, “Tree of Trees” is made of hundreds of indigenous British species ranging from hazel to field maple trees – each planted in aluminum pots decorated with the Queen’s cypher. But the sculpture has been divisive on social media since its unveiling last week. One user wrote that the design was “absolutely beautiful,” while another likened it to resembling a “cell phone tower.” Read more on this story.\n\nTRIBUTES AROUND THE WORLD\n\nThe Queen’s historic reign is also being commemorated in countries around the world, with Britain’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) spearheading a host of international events.\n\nFrance’s President Emmanuel Macron led a ceremony of thanksgiving and recognition for the Queen at the Arc de Triomphe on Thursday, supported by a band from the Royal Regiment of Scotland.\n\nOn Saturday, the Red Arrows will stage a flypast at Le Touquet-Paris-Plage on the northern coast at the English Channel, while the British Embassy in Paris is exhibiting a collection of portraits measuring almost 10 feet tall of the Queen at the ambassador’s residence, including a 1953 Cecil Beaton Coronation portrait and a David Bailey portrait from 2014.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Countries around the world light up to celebrate UK's Platinum Jubilee 01:31 - Source: CNN Countries around the world light up to celebrate UK's Platinum Jubilee 01:31\n\nBritish Embassy staff in Switzerland have been working with famous light artist Gerry Hofstetter to project a Platinum Jubilee display onto four Bernese Alps mountains, including the 13,015 feet high Eiger.\n\nBeacons have also been lit in the Commonwealth capital cities – 54 in total.\n\nFCDO staff based in the US are hosting a series of celebratory events in Washington, New York, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco, Boston, Miami, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Minneapolis.\n\n(CNN’s Lianne Kolirin contributed to this section.)\n\nDON’T MISS\n\nThe Queen’s been photographed, painted and graffitied.

She told Royal News: “My team woke up early Thursday to be on site by before 5 a.m. We had about eight super heavy, large hard cases of cameras, lenses, cables, tripods, step ladders, laptops and sandbags … The entire setup took about an hour and a half, but the waiting was for another five hours.”\n\nOn photographing the Queen on the balcony, she added: “I was able to just observe her body language very closely. She looked at the crowd, then Prince Charles would whisper something to her and she would nod. Then she would interact with the kids, and I could see she was trying to point the planes to them.”\n\nThe Queen walks out onto the Buckingham Palace balcony during the Trooping the Colour parade.

Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nAnother week, another set of firsts for the new King. This time round, Charles III hosted the first state visit of his reign and welcomed South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to the UK.\n\nIt was a short two-day visit but that didn’t stop the monarch from pulling out the stops for a diplomatic tour de force designed to reinforce the relationship between the two nations.\n\nThe trip had been in the works before Queen Elizabeth II’s death and while state visits generally stick to a time-honored program of events, King Charles still managed to put his own stamp on the occasion.\n\nHe kicked things off with a grand processional welcome teeming with British pomp and pageantry. Charles wasn’t alone as he warmly welcomed Ramaphosa at the Royal Pavilion at Horse Guards Parade in central London. Also in attendance were the Queen Consort and the Prince and Princess of Wales – the couple having been dispatched to Ramaphosa’s hotel to greet the head of state earlier in the day.\n\nMore than 1,000 soldiers and 200 horses participated in the ceremonial military spectacle. The South African President looked delighted as he inspected a guard of honor and received a royal salute in the crisp winter sunshine from Number 7 Company Coldstream Guards.\n\nLt Col James Shaw, who oversees major ceremonial events in his role as Brigade Major of the Household Division, said preparations for Tuesday’s welcome had taken “a huge amount of work,” before revealing that those involved were “very proud to support such an important national occasion.”\n\n“The state visit is a historic first: our first state visit for His Majesty the King and the President of South Africa, the first state visit in London since 2019, the first processional state visit on Horse Guards since 2018, and the first for almost everyone on parade,” the military organizer said, according to the UK’s PA Media news agency.\n\nFollowing the official welcome, the party took a carriage ride back to Buckingham Palace where Ramaphosa was greeted with a second honor guard. A tour of Royal Collection items themed around South Africa followed a private lunch put on by the King, before an elaborate white-tie state banquet in the evening.\n\nRamaphosa received a ceremonial welcome at Horse Guards Parade in London. Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP/Getty Images\n\nCustomarily held on the first night of a state visit, Buckingham Palace banquets are held in the ballroom, with around 160 invitations extended to individuals with “cultural, diplomatic or economic links to the country being hosted.”\n\nBefore everyone tucks into the lavish feast (a starter of grilled brill with wild mushrooms and truffles with a sorrel sauce, followed by Windsor pheasant filled with artichokes, quince compote and a port sauce for the main, in case you were wondering), the monarch traditionally says a few words and raises a glass to the guest of honor.\n\nCharles wowed Ramaphosa by opening his speech with the word “welcome” in several different languages used in South Africa. After cracking a few jokes, the King praised the economic, scientific and cultural ties between the countries. All standard remarks for a banquet speech, but Charles also didn’t shy away from more challenging subjects, broaching the UK’s troubled legacy of colonialism.\n\n“While there are elements of that history which provoke profound sorrow, it is essential that we seek to understand them,” he said. “We must acknowledge the wrongs which have shaped our past if we are to unlock the power of our common future.”\n\nCharles’s comments were seen by many as part of a continued effort to unify the Commonwealth realms, some of which have in recent years expressed intentions to sever ties with London.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales look set to play a more active role during Charles' reign. Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe monarch also chose the occasion to call for future cooperation on finding “practical solutions to the twin existential threats of climate change and biodiversity loss.”\n\nWith this first visit from a foreign leader coming just two months into his reign, the King was also keen to reflect on his late mother’s relationship with South Africa, recalling her visits to the country, the times she hosted Ramaphosa’s predecessors in London and the friendship she shared with revered statesman Nelson Mandela.\n\nOther royals were also keen to make Elizabeth II’s presence felt, with Camilla donning the late Queen’s dazzling sapphire and diamond tiara with matching necklace and bracelet, and Kate wearing a bracelet that belonged to the family matriarch.\n\nThe South African state visit was Charles’s first big diplomatic test. He revealed that while he’ll lean on templates established by his mother, he also wants to shake things up and tackle issues that matter to him and his subjects head on.\n\nTellingly, he’s also planning on doing it with Camilla, William and Kate firmly at his side, and with other members of the House of Windsor backing up their plays. It became commonplace to see Charles support and sometimes stand in for his mother in the twilight of her reign. But this week, the prominence of the Prince and Princess of Wales during the state visit indicated that the couple have been elevated into crucial central roles. All four will work together, front and center, sharing duties as they seek to secure the future of the dynasty.\n\nPHOTOS OF THE WEEK\n\nHere’s a few of our favorite shots from the first state visit King Charles hosted as monarch.\n\nKirsty Wigglesworth/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSouth Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa departs Horse Guards Parade with King Charles III and Camilla, Queen Consort in the Irish State Coach, en route to Buckingham Palace at the start of the President’s two-day state visit.\n\nDan Kitwood/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter sharing a private lunch, the King and President headed to Buckingham Palace’s Picture Gallery where they viewed items from the Royal Collection connected to South Africa.

Later, the pair visited the Francis Crick Institute, a research center that collaborates with the University of KwaZulu-Natal. During the stop they learned about technology being used across the African continent to diagnose infections and met with South African scientists and students.\n\nStefan Rousseau/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe state visit also allowed UK PM Rishi Sunak the opportunity to welcome Ramaphosa to 10 Downing Street for a bilateral meeting.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nCharles’ day of engagements in the capital.\n\nThe King was a man about town on Wednesday, as he visited three of the institutions that are home to many of the country’s leading lawyers, doctors and jewelers. First, the King visited Gray’s Inn, one of London’s four Inns of Court where barristers have cut their teeth for more than six centuries. Charles met with many of the trainees hoping soon to be called to the Bar, before touring that Inn’s pristine grounds in central London. From there, the King made the short journey to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital – the oldest hospital in the UK – where a restoration project is set to begin in 2023, the building’s 900th anniversary year. Specialist craftspeople are rejuvenating the historic North Wing of the facility – a Grade I listed piece of architecture adorned with a medieval grand staircase and paintings by William Hogarth. The King met with those working to restore the building, as well as frontline hospital staff. To round off the day, the King visited the Goldsmith’s Centre, the UK’s leading educational charity for training jewelers and silversmiths. Aware of the King’s longstanding commitments to environmental causes, the Goldsmiths’ Company gifted him a cross created from recycled silver. The day showed how Britain’s historic institutions continue to fizz with new talent.\n\nKing Charles met jewelers and silversmiths at The Goldsmiths' Center Wednesday.

The unlikely duo so touched the country that, after the monarch’s death, mourners had to be asked by the Palace if they would kindly stop leaving his trademark marmalade sandwiches among the floral tributes. Mourners went on to leave more than 1,000 Paddington Bear toys outside royal residences. Not wanting them to go to waste, the toys were collected, cleaned, and this week donated to the Barnardos children’s charity by the Queen Consort. A fleet of taxis delivered the bears in style, along with Camilla herself, to Barnardo’s nursery in Bow, east London on Thursday. After a very special teddy bears’ picnic, some of the cuddly toys were gifted to children there; others will be distributed to kids around the country supported by the charity.\n\nCamilla personally delivered some of the thousands of Paddington Bears left in the Queen's memory. Arthur Edwards/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nDavid Hockney adds a splash of color to Palace proceedings.\n\nBritish artist David Hockney has made a career out of his extravagant uses of color – and his recent appearance at Buckingham Palace showed this is clearly not confined to just the canvas. It’s not every day that Britons get invited to lunch at Buckingham Palace. Even fewer get invited on account of being members of the Order of Merit. That prestigious award is reserved for only the most talented individuals in the Commonwealth – there can only be 24 living members at one time. For those invited to Buckingham Palace to celebrate this achievement, the expectation is that they will come wearing better than their Sunday best. But David Hockney has always been one to flout expectations. The 85-year-old came to the Palace wearing not brogues or Oxford shoes – but yellow Crocs. The jaunty fashion choice added some extra cheer to the occasion.\n\nDavid Hockney's shoes were as colorful as his paintings.

I must admit, the Queen is quite an accomplished horsewoman. We will always remember our visit to Windsor Castle because of the Queen's and Prince Philip's warmth and welcoming hospitality -- they could not have been more gracious.\" Diana Walker/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images George H.W. Bush: Bush visited the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 1989, and in May 1991, she was guest of honor at a state dinner in the White House. The pair exchanged toasts about the legacy of human rights and the rule of law bequeathed upon the United States by Great Britain. Meanwhile, the Queen spoke about her previous visits to the White House and the history of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Bush said during his welcome address: \"We have got a lot of things in common. Americans share the Queen's love for horses. ... Most of all what links our countries is less a place than an idea. The idea that for nearly 400 years has been America's inheritance and England's bequest: the legacy of democracy, the rule of law and basic human rights.\" Jerome Delay/AFP/Getty Images Bill Clinton: Clinton met the Queen more than once during his tenure. He said: \"She's a highly intelligent woman who knows a lot about the world. ... I always marvel when we meet at what a keen judge she is of human events. I think she's a very impressive person. I like her very much.\" During a trip to Europe in 2000, Clinton said he noticed that although the Queen's hair had turned gray, she had what he described as \"youthful eyes.\" He added: \"She has these baby blue eyes, just piercing.\" Paul J.

Later Bush said she gave him \"a look that only a mother could give a child.\" Here they are pictured in June 2004 watching a flyover in Arromanches, France.

I think in the imagination of people throughout America, I think what the Queen stands for and her decency and her civility, what she represents, that's very important.\" Later, during a reception for G-20 leaders, Michelle Obama was seen to take the unusual step of putting her hand briefly on the back of the Queen. This was against protocol, but the monarch seemed to have reached out her hand first and didn't appear bothered by the first lady's gesture.

In a Fox News interview just after the trip to London, Trump called the Queen an \"incredible lady\" and said they had a lot of fun together. Some members of the British public and press were not amused, however, when Trump briefly walked in front of the Queen during a ceremonial inspection of the troops at Windsor Castle. The monarch had to do an awkward sidestep around him. Matt Dunham/AFP/Getty Images Joe Biden: Biden first met the Queen as a young senator in 1982. He returned nearly 40 years later, after his first G7 summit as President. They held private talks inside Windsor Castle, and Biden later said he wished he could have spoken to her longer. \"She was very generous,\" Biden said. He said he did not think she'd be insulted if he said she \"reminded me of my mother in terms of the look of her and the generosity.\" Chris Jackson/Getty Images All the Queen's presidents: From Truman to Biden Prev Next\n\nIt was the first time Elizabeth would encounter a sitting American president. Over her reign, she would meet 12 more, each man paying a degree of homage to the duty-bound woman whose very life charted a century of history.\n\nPerhaps no other person had met personally with so many American leaders or had witnessed at close range the upheavals of war, technology and politics that have defined the “special relationship” between the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nRemoved from the politics of transatlantic relations, yet still at the very center of British identity, the Queen provided American presidents a connection to their predecessors, a reminder of what a life devoted to public service looks like and a bit of uniquely royal glitz.\n\nMany emerged enchanted, spellbound or starstruck.\n\n“Whenever anyone becomes acquainted with you,” Truman told Elizabeth that day in 1951, “they immediately fall in love.”\n\nIt was a sentiment that would be repeated, in so many words, for the next 70 years, as American leaders visited her at her palaces in the United Kingdom or when she traveled to the White House.\n\n“She is truly one of my favorite people,” then-President Barack Obama said during a visit to London in 2016, after the Queen and her husband drove in their Land Rover to pick him up at Windsor Castle. “She’s an astonishing person, and a real jewel to the world and not just to the United Kingdom.”\n\nSome presidents, like Ronald Reagan, bonded with the Queen over horses and country life. Others, like Bill Clinton, found themselves impressed by her political aptitude.\n\nIn recent years, as she aged, presidents saw in her their own pasts. President Donald Trump said after meeting her, his Scottish-born mother would be proud. When he visited the Queen at Windsor last year, President Joe Biden said she reminded him of his own mother.\n\nQueen Elizabeth’s first state visit to Washington came in 1957, hosted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, at an important moment for the new sovereign to represent her country with its most important ally.\n\nYet even Eisenhower, the commanding general of US forces in Europe during World War II, found himself humbled in the presence of the Queen.\n\n“There have been a few times in my life when I have wished that the gift of eloquence might have been conferred upon me,” he said during his toast at the state dinner. “This evening is one of those times.”\n\nAs it turned out, the Queen had a penchant for bringing out the relaxed side of the American leaders she encountered. After inviting Eisenhower to Balmoral, her estate in the Scottish Highlands where she died on Thursday, the Queen promised to provide him her recipe for scones. She followed up in a letter several months later.\n\n“Dear Mr. President,” she wrote in her scrawling, distinct hand. “Seeing a picture of you in today’s newspaper, standing in front of a barbecue grilling quail, reminded me that I had never sent you the recipe of the drop scones which I promised you at Balmoral.”\n\nWhen President John F. Kennedy arrived in London for a state visit in 1961, he and his glamorous wife Jacqueline were met with crowds of Britons lining the streets. The dinner was described as “pleasant,” though later there were rumors of tensions between the Queen and first lady over the guest list.\n\nKennedy, who was assassinated two years later, did not meet the Queen again. But when Britain dedicated a memorial to Kennedy in Surrey, around 20 miles outside London, the Queen paid tribute alongside Mrs. Kennedy and the slain President’s children.\n\nShe never met President Lyndon B. Johnson as his presidency became consumed by the war in Vietnam; he remained the only president she did not meet during her reign.\n\nThe Queen had already met Richard Nixon when he was serving as vice president, but met him again as president in 1969, when he paid a visit to the United Kingdom. Later, when the Queen’s children – Prince Charles and Princess Anne – visited the Nixon White House, observers thought the President seemed unusually interested, hiring bands and arranging a special ceremony.\n\nThere was even a hint of potential romance – though it didn’t pan out.\n\n“That was the time when they were trying to marry me off to Tricia Nixon,” Charles recounted in an interview with CNN in 2021.\n\nPresident Gerald Ford was serving in office as the United States marked the 200th anniversary of American independence, a bicentennial that also marked its severance from Britain. Perhaps in a show of enduring US-UK ties, Ford hosted the Queen for a state dinner underneath a tent in the Rose Garden.\n\nIn a yellow chiffon gown and diamond tiara, the Queen was whisked around the dance floor by the President.\n\n“The Queen was easy to deal with,” then-first lady Betty Ford recounted in her memoir. “She was very definite about what she wanted and what she didn’t want. She loves Bob Hope and Telly Savalas, so we invited Bob Hope and Telly Savalas.”\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter had a somewhat more mortifying experience during his visit to Buckingham Palace in 1977: He kissed the Queen Mother on her lips.\n\n“Nobody has done that since my husband died,” she exclaimed. Her husband, King George VI, died in 1952.\n\nNo president appeared more comfortable with the Queen than Ronald Reagan, who became the first American leader to spend the night at Windsor Castle in 1982. A shared love of horses – she the English rider; he the Western cowboy (at least in movies) – seemed to cement their relationship.\n\n“I must admit, the Queen is quite an accomplished horsewoman,” Reagan wrote in his memoir. He invited her the following year to his Rancho Del Cielo property in California, initially making plans for her to sail into Santa Barbara harbor on the royal yacht.\n\nA severe storm scuttled the maritime plans, forcing the Queen to arrive by airplane. At the ranch, Reagan wore a jean jacket and bolo tie to serve her and her husband a Tex-Mex lunch: enchiladas, chiles rellenos, refried beans, tacos, rice and guacamole.\n\nTheir friendship would stretch beyond Reagan’s presidency. In 1989, she granted Reagan honorary knighthood to recognize the US assistance during the Falkland Wars.\n\nWhen she came to Washington a few years later, President George H.W. Bush brought her to a Baltimore Orioles game and hosted her at the White House – where she ended up encountering another, future president.\n\nSpeaking with George W. Bush in 1991 about the new pair of boots he was wearing for her visit, the younger Bush revealed they’d been stamped with the words “God save the Queen.” That prompted her to ask if he was the black sheep of the family.\n\n“I guess so,” he acknowledged.\n\n“All families have them,” she replied.\n\nDuring President Bill Clinton’s presidency, he met with the Queen during a tour of her palace and at the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings. But during a visit to London in 1997, he and his wife Hillary turned down the Queen’s invitation to tea, preferring instead to “be a tourist,” according to documents released by the UK’s National Archives last year.\n\n“The Americans said that the President and Mrs. Clinton were very grateful for HM The Queen’s invitation to tea at the Palace, but would wish to decline politely,” a note from Blair’s private secretary, Phillip Barton, revealed.\n\nStill, Clinton was impressed by the Queen’s unique abilities.\n\n“Her Majesty impressed me as someone who but for the circumstance of her birth, might have become a successful politician or diplomat. As it was, she had to be both, without quite seeming to be either,” he wrote in his memoir.\n\nMore than a decade after their chance initial meeting in his father’s White House, George W. Bush meet the queen several times, including when he became the first US president to be received with a state visit to Britain in 2003.\n\nHe would host Queen Elizabeth’s final visit to the White House in 2007; it was a symbolic nod to her first State Visit as queen 50 years earlier and marked the 400th anniversary of the English settlement of Jamestown, Virginia.\n\nDuring his welcoming remarks, he inadvertently suggested the Queen had also visited the White House in 1776 – adding 200 years to her age.\n\n“She gave me a look that only a mother could give a child,” he said after winking in the monarch’s direction.\n\nThe aging queen would not return to the White House again but continued receiving American presidents in Britain. When Obama and his wife arrived in London in 2009, they came bearing an iPod loaded with footage of her previous visits to Washington, along with recordings of some of Obama’s speeches.\n\nEtiquette hawks were aghast when Michelle Obama placed her hand on the Queen, but the Queen herself did not seem to care. Speaking with aides after a dinner at Buckingham Palace, Obama remarked she reminded him of his own grandmother.\n\n“She’s just like Toot, my grandmother. Courteous. Straightforward. All about what she thinks. She doesn’t suffer fools,” he said, according to a memoir by one of his aides.\n\nHis two predecessors also felt pangs of maternal memory when they encountered the queen in the final years of her life.\n\n“I was walking up and I was saying (to wife Melania): ‘Can you imagine my mother seeing this scene? Windsor. Windsor Castle,’” Donald Trump told an interviewer afterward.\n\nTrump’s mother, born on the Outer Hebrides islands of Scotland, was enraptured by the Queen; Trump recalled her watching Elizabeth’s coronation on television. While his own visit to Windsor had awkward moments, like when he walked in front of the Queen as they were reviewing an honor guard, the Queen herself evinced no displeasure.\n\nWhen Biden visited the United Kingdom for a Group of 7 summit in 2021, the Queen made a surprise decision to travel to the Cornish coast to meet world leaders, a signal of her desire to remain engaged in global affairs.\n\nWhen she hosted Biden later at Windsor Castle, she asked him about two authoritarian leaders, Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia.\n\nUnlike Trump or Obama, Biden is not an Anglophile. He’s a proud Irish American who has – sometimes jokingly – made references to the long British rule over his ancestors’ island.\n\nLast year also wasn’t his first time meeting the Queen; as a young senator, he’d received advice from his mother – an Irish American born with the surname Finnegan – ahead of a planned engagement with the monarch.\n\n“Don’t you bow down to her,” she told him in 1982, according to a memoir Biden published several years ago.\n\nWhen he met her last year, he did not bow. But he did remark on a familiar resemblance.\n\n“I don’t think she’ll be insulted,” he said, “but she reminded me of my mother.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/957038/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-12-june-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 12 June 2022 | The Week", "text": "1. Public ‘prefers Johnson to Starmer’\n\nKeir Starmer would be a worse choice for prime minister than Boris Johnson, according the to a new poll. The study shows that the PM has a two-point lead over his opponent, despite Partygate, the cost of living crisis and the confidence vote in Johnson held by his own MPs. While 28% think Johnson would make the best prime minister, 26% opted for Starmer. Labour’s lead over the Tories has also narrowed to two points, compared with a three-point lead in the last poll a fortnight ago.\n\n2. Meddling Charles ‘won’t be charming’\n\nThe Prince of Wales won’t be Prince Charming if he keeps on meddling, according to government ministers. After reports that the royal had branded the government’s policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda “appalling,” a senior cabinet minister told The Sunday Times that Charles is “an adornment to our public life,” but “will cease to be charming if he attempts to behave the same way when he is king”. Clarence House issued a statement yesterday insisting Prince Charles would remain “politically neutral” as monarch.\n\n3. Hunt woos Leave MPs\n\nJeremy Hunt has been “wooing Brexiteer MPs” with a pledge that he would remove the Irish Sea border created by the Northern Ireland Protocol, reported The Telegraph. The Tory MP, who campaigned for Remain in the 2016 referendum, has been privately recruiting supporters for a potential leadership campaign. He has approached include members of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tories after working out “what side his bread is buttered,” said one MP. The news comes after Hunt called on MPs to unseat Boris Johnson in last week’s confidence vote.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Forecourt thefts are rising\n\nSoaring fuel prices have led to an increase in fuel thefts from petrol station forecourts, according to new industry data. Forecourt Eye, which works with 1,000 garages in the UK, said there was a 39% increase in non-payments since January. The incidents included motorists driving off without paying or claiming to have forgotten their wallet. A spokesman said: “This is not a good thing for anyone.” Petrol prices hit record highs last week, with the cost of filling a typical family car passing £100.\n\n5. Iran ‘close’ to nuclear bomb\n\nIran is “dangerously” close to completing its nuclear weapons programme Israel’s prime minister has claimed. “Iran is enriching uranium at an unprecedented rate and moving dangerously close to getting their hands on nuclear weapons,” Naftali Bennett told The Telegraph. A report in Israeli media citing anonymous Israeli government sources claimed that Iran already had enough fissile material to make nuclear bombs, but a source familiar with the Iranian nuclear programme said this was likely to be an exaggeration.\n\n6. PM retreats from green plans\n\nBoris Johnson has scaled back plans to rewild the country as he retreats from the green agenda to focus on the cost of living crisis. The government announced last year that a post-Brexit scheme that would pay farmers up to £800m a year to transform agricultural land into nature-rich forests, coastal wetlands, peatlands and wildflower meadows. However, said The Sunday Times, the fund has been “quietly slashed” to just £50m over three years, less than 1% of the budget. Conservation groups described the U-turn as a “massive betrayal”.\n\n7. China ‘will fight for Taiwan’\n\nChina will “fight to the very end” to stop Taiwan from declaring independence, the country’s defence minister has vowed, a day after the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, accused Beijing of “provocative, destabilising” military activity close to the island. “We will fight at all cost and we will fight to the very end. This is the only choice for China,” Wei Fenghe told the Shangri-La Dialogue security summit, where he described the contested island as “first and foremost China’s Taiwan”. Beijing has long viewed Taiwan as a breakaway province.\n\n8. Man dies rescuing children\n\nA man has died after rescuing two children from the sea off the coast of Wales. Police were called to Poppit Sands, near St Dogmaels in Pembrokeshire on Friday evening after a number of people got into difficulty. Officers said Hywel Morgan, 47, died after being recovered from the sea. The two children, who he had helped rescue from a rip current, were taken to hospital as a precaution. Morgan’s family said he was a “hero” and a “devoted and loving father”.\n\n9. UK could swelter next week\n\nForecasters say that temperatures could rise above 30C in parts of the UK next week. Temperatures in the south could peak into the low 30s, but parts of the north could experience gusts in excess of 55mph, alongside frequent showers and possible thunder. The remnants of Tropical Storm Alex will bring a low-pressure system to our shores, meaning the country is going to be graced with a “mixed bag” of weather, said Sky News.\n\n10. Judge throws out Ronaldo case\n\nThe federal civil case alleging that Cristiano Ronaldo raped a woman in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009 has been dismissed. A US district judge threw the case out of court, accusing the woman’s attorney, Leslie Mark Stovall, of “bad-faith conduct” and the use of leaked and stolen documents detailing discussions between Ronaldo and his lawyers.

An influential Meadows aide, Hutchinson was a firsthand witness to key conversations inside the White House.\n\nHere’s a timeline of some of the most important moments from January 6, based on CNN and others’ reporting, Congressional testimony, court filings from the Justice Department, and more. The times are approximate and these events only capture a portion of what happened that day.\n\nJanuary 6, 2021\n\n7:30 a.m.\n\nMeadows texts Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who backed Trump’s efforts to overturn the election, according to texts obtained by CNN. Meadows tells Jordan “I have pushed for this,” responding to a text that Jordan sent the night before, which advocated for Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election while presiding over Congress’ certification of the Electoral College results. Meadows also tells Jordan he’s “not sure it is going to happen.”\n\n9:24 a.m.\n\nTrump talks on the phone with Jordan for approximately 10 minutes, according to White House records that were obtained by the committee and released at a public hearing. After Trump’s conversation with Miller, Trump adjusts a draft of his upcoming speech to add more lines about Pence and the joint session of Congress, according to the committee, which reviewed the drafts.\n\n9:52 a.m.\n\nTrump talks to senior adviser and lead speechwriter Stephen Miller for 26 minutes, according to White House records that were obtained by the committee and released at a public hearing. After Trump’s conversation with Miller, Trump adjusts a draft of his upcoming speech to add more lines about Pence and the joint session of Congress, according to the committee, which reviewed the drafts.\n\nBefore 10 a.m.\n\nWhite House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato informs Trump that authorities at the Ellipse, where Trump was going to hold a rally, encountered attendees with weapons, including pistols, rifles, bear spray and spears, according to Hutchinson’s testimony.\n\nAround 10:15 a.m.\n\nHutchinson and Ornato inform Meadows about the armed members of the crowd forming at the Ellipse, according to Hutchinson’s testimony. Hutchinson told lawmakers that Meadows had little reaction when she told him about reports about weapons in the crowd.\n\n10:47 a.m.\n\nTrump lawyer Rudy Giuliani begins his speech at the Ellipse rally, urges lawmakers to overturn the election, and tells the crowd, “let’s have trial by combat.” Giuliani shares the podium with another right-wing lawyer, John Eastman, the architect of a Trump-backed plan for Pence to overturn the results while presiding over that day’s joint session of Congress, where lawmakers certify the Electoral College winner.\n\n11:20 a.m.\n\nTrump speaks on the phone with Pence. White House aides told the committee that the call was tense and heated, and that Pence reiterated that he wasn’t going to change the outcome of the election during the joint session of Congress. Trump responded by calling Pence a “wimp,” according to witness testimony.\n\nBefore 12 p.m.\n\nTrump tells his staff to “take the f**king mags away,” referring to the metal detectors at the security line for his Ellipse rally, because the rallygoers were “not here to hurt me,” according to Hutchinson’s testimony. Trump wanted to increase the size of the crowd, Hutchinson said.\n\n12 p.m.\n\nTrump begins his speech at the Ellipse, where he repeats many of his election lies and publicly pressures Pence to go along with Eastman’s legally dubious scheme.\n\nAround 1 p.m.\n\nPro-Trump rioters – including members of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group – overrun the first set of barriers outside the Capitol and start rushing toward the building. Top White House staffers, including Meadows, are quickly alerted by the US Secret Service that the police lines are collapsing at the Capitol, according to Hutchinson’s testimony.\n\n1:10 p.m.\n\nAs he ends his speech at the Ellipse, Trump calls for supporters to “walk down Pennsylvania Avenue” and march to the Capitol. He also tells the crowd that he will be marching with them. Around the same time, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican and Trump ally, calls Hutchinson and angrily tells her not to let Trump go to the Capitol, according to Hutchinson’s testimony.\n\n1:19 p.m.\n\nTrump arrives back at the White House. During the short drive back from the Ellipse, Trump becomes irate and demands to be driven to the Capitol, but members of his security team refuse to take him there, according to Hutchinson, who testified that she was told about the exchange by Ornato and another member of Trump’s security detail.\n\n1:25 p.m.\n\nTrump goes into the private dining room near the Oval Office, where he stays until 4 p.m., according to the committee which cited testimony from White House aides. Witnesses told the committee that Trump spent the afternoon watching Fox News’ coverage of his supporters attacking the Capitol. The chief White House photographer was told not to take pictures of Trump during this period, according to the committee.\n\n1:39 p.m.\n\nTrump calls Giuliani, according to phone records obtained by the January 6 committee. It is unclear what they discussed.\n\nAround 2 p.m.\n\nThe Capitol goes on lockdown as some of the first rioters breach the building. Back at the White House, the White House Counsel Cipollone tells Meadows that Trump needs to take action to stop the riot, and that “something needs to be done or people are going to die,” according to Hutchinson’s testimony.\n\n2:03 p.m.\n\nTrump calls Giuliani again, and the call lasts for approximately eight minutes, according to phone records obtained by the January 6 committee. It is unclear what they discussed.\n\n2:13 p.m.\n\nThe Senate abruptly adjourns, amid a debate over a GOP objection to Biden’s electoral votes from Arizona. Senators are evacuated from the chamber. Around this time, Trump speaks on the phone with Sen. Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican, who tells Trump about the frantic evacuation of senators.\n\n2:14 p.m.\n\nIn one of the most infamous scenes of the insurrection, QAnon supporter Doug Jensen menaces US Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, who shrewdly steers Jensen away from the nearby Senate floor.\n\nAround 2:15 p.m.\n\nAt the White House, Cipollone again tells Meadows that Trump should intervene. Meadows responds by saying Trump “doesn’t want to do anything” about the riot and that Trump agrees with the rioters who were calling for Pence to be hanged, according to Hutchinson’s testimony.\n\n2:24 p.m.\n\nTrump criticizes Pence in a tweet, slamming Pence for refusing to implement his illegal scheme to overturn the election while presiding over the joint session of Congress.\n\n2:26 p.m.\n\nThe Secret Service evacuates Pence from his office across from the Senate chamber, and he was eventually whisked away to a loading dock under the Capitol. The January 6 committee has said Pence came within 40 feet of the approaching rioters.\n\n2:28 p.m.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican and pro-Trump conspiracy theorist, tells Meadows via text that he should “tell the President to calm people,” according to messages obtained by CNN.\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nThe House goes into recess. Lawmakers evacuate the area, and some take refuge inside the chamber, donning gas masks.\n\n2:32 p.m.\n\nFox News host Laura Ingraham, who promoted many of Trump’s election lies, texts Meadows that “the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home,” according to messages obtained by CNN.\n\n2:35 p.m.\n\nTrump’s former acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney texts Meadows saying that Trump “needs to stop this, now,” and offers to help, according to messages obtained by CNN.\n\n2:38 p.m.\n\nTrump tweets that the rioters should “stay peaceful,” but doesn’t tell them to leave the Capitol.\n\n2:39 p.m.\n\nSome of the first Capitol windows are smashed by Dominic Pezzola, an alleged Proud Boy who has been charged with seditious conspiracy. (He pleaded not guilty to charges related to the attack.) More pro-Trump rioters flood into the Capitol building after overrunning barricades, fighting past police officers, and climbing up the inauguration scaffolding.\n\nAround 2:40 p.m.\n\nA group of Oath Keepers – a far-right extremist group – weave through throngs of rioters in a military-style formation and enter the Capitol building. Several members of the group have been charged with seditious conspiracy.\n\n2:44 p.m.\n\nPro-Trump rioter Ashli Babbitt is fatally shot by a police officer while trying to break into the Speaker’s Lobby, which is adjacent to the House floor, while lawmakers were evacuating. At the same time, Rep. Barry Loudermilk, a Georgia Republican who supported nullifying Biden’s victory in his state, texts Meadows that “It’s really bad up here on the hill,” according to messages obtained by CNN.\n\nAround 2:45 p.m.\n\nPro-Trump rioters invade the Senate floor and break into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office.\n\n2:53 p.m.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. texts Meadows, “He’s got to condem (sic) this shit. Asap. The captiol (sic) police tweet is not enough,” according to messages obtained by CNN. Meadows replies, “I am pushing it hard. I agree.”\n\nSometime before 3 p.m.\n\nTrump speaks on the phone with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who pleads with Trump to call off the mob, but Trump takes the side of the rioters, telling McCarthy that they seem to care more about the election results than he does, according to CNN reporting.\n\nAround 3 p.m.\n\nWhite House aides draft a statement for Trump to release, which would’ve condemned the violence and the “illegal” actions of the rioters, according to Hutchinson’s testimony. The statement was never released.\n\n3:09 p.m.\n\nFormer Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus texts Meadows, “TELL THEM TO GO HOME !!!,” according to messages obtained by CNN.\n\n3:13 p.m.\n\nTrump tweets that his supporters at the Capitol should “remain peaceful,” but again doesn’t tell them to leave the premises. At the same time, Trump’s former Health Secretary Tom Price texts Meadows saying, “POTUS should go on air and defuse this,” according to messages obtained by CNN.\n\n3:15 p.m.\n\nIvanka Trump, the President’s daughter and senior adviser, calls the rioters “patriots” in a tweet, and tells them that “the violence must stop,” but does not say that they should leave the Capitol.\n\n3:31 p.m.\n\nFox News host Sean Hannity, who promoted many of Trump’s election lies, texts Meadows, “Can he make a statement. I saw the tweet. Ask people to peacefully leave the capital,” according to messages obtained by CNN. Meadows replies, “on it.”\n\n4:03 p.m.\n\nTrump heads to the Rose Garden to film a recorded message. His staff prepared a script for him to read, which said, “no one should be using violence or threats. … Let’s respect our institutions, let’s all do better.” But Trump goes off-script and improvises most of his remarks, according to a witness, who later testified to the January 6 committee.\n\n4:05 p.m.\n\nTrump Jr. texts Meadows, “We need an oval address. He has to lead now. It’s gone too far and gotten out of hand,” according to messages obtained by CNN. A few minutes later, Trump Jr. sends another message saying, “Now Biden beating us to the punch.”\n\n4:15 p.m.\n\nBiden delivers a televised address, saying Capitol attack “borders on sedition,” and calling on Trump to tell his supporters to put “an end to this siege.”\n\n4:17 p.m.\n\nTrump tweets out a video, where he tells the rioters that “you have to go home now,” but he also praises them and repeats the lie that fueled the attack itself – that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n4:45 p.m.\n\nA bipartisan group of congressional leaders – including then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi – speak on the phone with then-acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, according to footage shown by the January 6 committee. The lawmakers sought assurances from Miller that the National Guard would restore order so they could resume the Electoral College proceedings.\n\n6:00 p.m.\n\nA curfew goes into effect in Washington, DC, after an order from Mayor Muriel Bowser. Law enforcement continues clearing the rioters from Capitol grounds, with many rioters still milling around the complex after the curfew.\n\n6:01 p.m.\n\nTrump tweets that “these are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots.”\n\n6:27 p.m.\n\nTrump retires for the night to the White House residence. As Trump gathered his things to relocate to his residence, he tells a White House employee that “Mike Pence let me down,” according to the committee. (The panel did not identify the employee.)\n\n7:02 p.m.\n\nGiuliani leaves a voicemail for Tuberville, the GOP senator. Giuliani asks him to “slow it down,” referring to the Electoral College proceedings, that would be restarted soon. Giuliani says he wants the delay “so we can get these legislators to get more information to you,” referring to the Trump-backed effort to have GOP state lawmakers appoint Republican electors who could potentially supplant Biden’s legitimate electors.\n\n7:14 p.m.\n\nTrump’s former campaign manager Brad Parscale texts campaign adviser Katrina Pierson, expressing his view that Trump was “asking for civil war” and that “I feel guilty for helping him win,” according to messages released by the committee. He tells Pierson that Trump’s rhetoric “killed someone” that day, presumably referring to Babbitt. Pierson replies that “it wasn’t the rhetoric,” and Parscale responds, “Katrina. Yes it was.”\n\nAround 8 p.m.\n\nUS Capitol Police announces that the Capitol building is secure. the Senate reconvenes, and Pence returns to the dais, saying, “To those who wreaked havoc in our capitol today, you did not win.” Sen. Mitch McConnell, the chamber’s top Republican, calls the events of the day a “failed insurrection.”\n\n8:39 p.m.\n\nTrump speaks on the phone with Giuliani for nine minutes, according to White House call logs that were obtained by the Washington Post.\n\n9:02 p.m.\n\nThe House reconvenes.\n\n9:23 p.m.\n\nMiller, the Trump campaign spokesman, calls Trump to propose releasing a statement about the transfer of power once the joint session of Congress wraps up. Miller told the January 6 committee that, “Trump wanted to say ‘peaceful transition,’ and I said, ‘that ship’s kind of already sailed, so we’re going to say ‘orderly transition.’”\n\n10:11 p.m.\n\nThe Senate votes to reject the objection raised by GOP lawmakers to counting Arizona’s electoral votes, which were awarded to Biden because he won the popular vote in that state.\n\n10:19 p.m.\n\nTrump speaks with former White House strategist Steve Bannon for seven minutes, according to White House call logs that were obtained by the Washington Post.\n\n11:08 p.m.\n\nTrump talks to Hannity for eight minutes, according to White House call logs that were obtained by the Washington Post.\n\n11:10 p.m.\n\nThe House votes to reject the objection raised by GOP lawmakers to counting Arizona’s electoral votes, which were awarded to Biden because he won the popular vote in that state.\n\nJanuary 7, 2021\n\n12:40 a.m.\n\nThe Senate votes to reject the objection raised by GOP lawmakers to counting Pennsylvania’s electoral votes, which were awarded to Biden because he won the popular vote in that state.\n\n3:10 a.m.\n\nThe House votes to reject the objection raised by GOP lawmakers to counting Pennsylvania’s electoral votes, which were awarded to Biden because he won the popular vote in that state.\n\n3:42 a.m.\n\nPence officially certifies Biden’s victory, and the joint session of Congress comes to a close.\n\n3:49 a.m.\n\nTrump releases a statement, repeating his lies about the election but also publicly acknowledging for the first time that would soon be leaving the White House.

Leo, who became the church's 267th pope, also spoke in Spanish, but not English, in his brief address.\n\nLeo thanked Pope Francis and repeated his predecessor's call for a church that is engaged with the modern world and \"is always looking for peace, charity and being close to people, especially those who are suffering.\"\n\nPope Leo XIV is a man of many firsts; apart from being the first American-born pope, he is also the first pope to be an Augustinian.

Before being elected pope, Leo XIV reposted a message on X criticizing President Donald Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele during their Oval Office meeting amid debate about a wrongfully deported man. In February, he posted two op-ed columns critical of Vice President JD Vance, a practicing Catholic, and the administration's stance on immigration.\n\nBut while have latched onto the voting records as a sign of the new pontiff's politics, Illinois officials are quick to point out that Prairie State voters are not required to register as members of a political party.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhat will the new pope do in his first few days?\n\nAfter celebrating his first Mass as pope, Leo XIV is slated to have a full schedule in the coming days. His next engagement is expected to be a May 10 meeting with cardinals. He'll then have midday prayers on May 11 from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica.\n\nIn his first full week as pope, he has a meeting with journalists on May 12 and another with diplomats on May 16. He'll be inaugurated in a Mass on May 18 and have his first general audience on the 21st.\n\nLeo has also inherited religious services, diplomatic meetings and Holy Year events from his predecessor. He'll have to decide whether to carry out a planned trip to Turkey by Francis later in the month, which would include a meeting with Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nPope Leo XIV celebrates his first Mass in English and Italian\n\nLeo celebrated his first Mass as pope in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel on May 9. The multilingual service began as Leo processed in and sang in Latin along with the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel Choir, one of the oldest and most prestigious in the world.\n\nThe first two readings were delivered in English and Spanish. Leo began his homily by addressing the cardinals in English.\n\nStories of identity across the country: Sign up for USA TODAY's This is America newsletter.\n\n\"You have called me to carry the cross and to be blessed with that mission,\" he said. “And I know I can rely on each and every one of you to walk with me.\"\n\nLeo delivered the rest of the homily in Italian. He invoked his predecessor saying Pope Francis often taught that Catholics \"are called to bear witness to our joyful faith in Christ the Saviour,\" the Vatican News reported. Leo said this \"missionary outreach is desperately needed\" in the many places where Christians “are mocked, opposed, despised or at best tolerated and pitied.\"\n\nWorld faith leaders embrace Pope Leo XIV\n\nThe Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, wrote a letter to Pope Leo XIV on May 9 with his greetings to the new pope, his office said.\n\n\"I am very happy to have met several of your predecessors and enjoyed friendly conversations with them,” the Dalai Lama wrote. “Over more than four decades, I have also participated in meaningful exchanges with representatives of different religious traditions, my Christian brothers and sisters among them.\"\n\n“In a period when the world is witnessing so many challenges, your election brings new hope not just to the Catholic community, but to people everywhere who are seeking a happier life in a more compassionate, peaceful world.”\n\nThe leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon church, also sent a message of welcome to Leo.\n\n\"On behalf of the leaders and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we extend heartfelt prayers and greetings to Pope Leo XIV. This significant moment in time for the Catholic Church is a reminder of the enduring importance of faith to people everywhere,\" the First Presidency of the church said in a statement. \"As fellow followers of Jesus Christ, we look forward to continued opportunities to work together to bless the lives of God’s children everywhere.\"\n\nNew pope from US reportedly has New Orleans, Creole roots\n\nMore of Leo XIV's roots in the United States are being unearthed, with a New Orleans-based genealogist discovering his maternal grandparents were people of color with Creole ties, according to news reports.\n\nJari C. Honora, a family historian at the Historic New Orleans Collection, told CNN and the New York Times that Leo's grandparents, Joseph Martinez and Louise (Baquié) Martinez, were identified in genealogical records as people of color. They lived in New Orleans before moving to Chicago, where they had Mildred Martinez, the pope's mother, in 1912.\n\nBoth grandparents were listed as Black in a 1900 Census record. Different records list Joseph Martinez's place of birth as Louisiana, Haiti (spelled Hayti in the Census record) and the Dominican Republic, which Honora told the New York Times isn't uncommon in records. He was described as a cigar maker in the Census record.\n\nHonora unearthed the records and posted about them on Facebook, saying he hopes Leo will pay a visit to New Orleans.\n\n\"I am truly excited that our city and our Creole community have this wonderful close connection to the Holy Father,\" Honora said in a post.\n\nJohn Prevost, the pope's brother, confirmed the ancestry to the Times but said the family does not identify as Black and did not discuss the Creole roots.\n\n“It was never an issue,” John Prevost said.\n\nWho is Pope Leo XIV's family?\n\nPope Leo XIV's father, Louis Marius Prevost, was of French and Italian descent, according to Vatican News. His mother, Mildred Martínez, was of Spanish descent. The Chicago Sun-Times has reported that his father was an educator and his mother a librarian.\n\nHe has two brothers, Louis Martín Prevost and John Joseph Prevost.\n\n\"We've kind of known he was special, and we used to tease him about being pope when he was 6 years old,\" Louis Prevost, who lives in Port Charlotte, Florida, told NBC News.\n\nLouis Prevost told NBC affiliate WBBH that when he heard his brother named, “ I just freaked out and said ‘It’s Rob, OMG.’ I was up, dressed, out, just going nuts.”\n\nIn an interview with FOX4, the Pope's sister-in-law, Deborah Prevost, said she and her husband were surprised by the news, and a little saddened that it meant they wouldn't be able to spend as much time with Robert.\n\nJohn Prevost, who lives in Illinois, told NBC he spoke to his brother just before the conclave to select the new pope began. They played Wordle and Words with Friends together to \"keep his mind off life in the real world,\" John Prevost said.\n\n\"I said, 'well are you ready for this?' I said, 'did you watch the movie \"Conclave\" so you know how to behave?'\" And he had just finished watching the movie 'Conclave,' so he knew how to behave,\" John Prevost told NBC, chuckling.\n\n-Kathryn Palmer, USA TODAY; the Sarasota Herald Tribune\n\nChicago brings home the papacy\n\nChicagoans celebrated the city's native son Pope Leo XIV, not only the first U.S.-born pope but now the pride and joy of the Windy City. He's apparently not a Cubs fan; he's from the South Side and that is squarely in Chicago White Sox territory. But the town doesn't seem to mind.\n\nThe Wieners Circle, a famous Chicago hot dog stand, celebrated with a sign which read \"CANES NOSTROS IPSE COMEDIT\" – Latin for \"He has eaten our dogs.\"\n\n“Everything dope, including the Pope, comes from Chicago!” Mayor Brandon Johnson posted on X. “We hope to welcome you back home soon.”\n\nChicagoans are fiercely proud of their city's working-class reputation and Pope Leo has a reputation in the Catholic Church for sticking up for worker's rights and the disenfranchised, something highly valued here. Prevost was born in 1955 at Mercy Hospital, about three miles south of the city’s iconic downtown Loop area.\n\n“In this time when Chicago has been demonized, when workers' rights and immigrants' rights have been attacked and people feel in fear, it’s symbolic we have a pope from Chicago, who is actually also a dual citizen. It shows solidarity among countries and workers,” said Alderman Byron Sigcho-Lopez, a South Side city council member.

Msgr. W. Ronald Jameson, the director of St. Matthew’s Cathedral. “Today is an extremely joyful day.”\n\nLeo's ascension to the top of the Catholic Church was a surprise, Jameson said, because being a U.S. citizen was long considered a barrier to the papacy.\n\nEconomist Lucero Rossi, 36, said Leo was the kind of pope she has been praying for since Francis' death.\n\n“He seems to have a very pro-immigrant agenda,” she said, “so I am very happy about that.”\n\nRossi watched as he made his first public appearance at St. Peter’s Basilica, opening in Italian with “Peace be with you all.” But what stuck out most of all was the moment he greeted his diocese in Chicago and Peru in Spanish – not English.\n\n“I really loved that,” said Rossi, born in Mexico. “That was an embrace of the Latin American world.”\n\n-Christopher Cann, USA TODAY\n\nWhat languages does Pope Leo XIV speak?\n\nLeo XIV speaks English, Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese, and can read Latin and German, according to the National Catholic Reporter.\n\nAfter he was announced the new pope, Leo addressed a massive crowd at St. Peter's Square on May 8 in Spanish and Italian, but not English. He delivered his first Mass the next day in English, Spanish and Italian.\n\nWhy does the pope change his name?\n\nPopes aren’t required to choose a new name, according to the National Catholic Register. But for those that do, the new moniker is a symbol of their new stage in life, their entry into a new community and their new way of serving God and other people.\n\nA new pope may take the name of a predecessor or saint “out of respect, admiration, or recognition,” the Vatican News reported. Some names, like Leo, have been used more than a dozen times while others, like Peter, have been used only once. Taking a unique papal name may signal forthcoming changes in church doctrine.\n\nWhere did Pope Leo XIV grow up?\n\nLeo was born in Chicago as Robert Francis Prevost and went on to attend the now-closed St. Augustine Catholic Seminary, a boarding school in west Michigan for boys in grades 9-12, the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nCubs or White Sox? Pope's allegiance revealed\n\nIs Pope Leo XIV, a Chicago native, a Cubs or White Sox fan?\n\nThe pope hails from the South Side of the city − White Sox territory − but the Cubs are a major brand that easily could have swooped him up. There have been some reports of which side Leo leans, but a family member has given sports fans the answer they've been seeking.\n\nAccording to his brother, Pope Leo is loyal to the South Side. John Prevost revealed his brother is a White Sox fan in an interview with WGN TV.\n\n“He was never, ever a Cubs fan. So I don’t know where that came from. He was always a Sox fan,” John Prevost said.\n\nHis mother was a Cubs fan and his father was a fan of the St. Louis Cardinals, John Prevost said.\n\n-Jordan Mendoza\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/14/kathy-hochul-drone-sightings-congress/76998031007/", "title": "Drones temporarily closed runways at NY airport, governor says", "text": "New York Gov.

Conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who is regularly in President Donald Trump’s ear, posted of the new pontiff: “WOKE MARXIST POPE.”\n\nHardcore Trump supporter Ryan Selkis, a former crypto CEO, shared past social media posts believed to be from the new pope. They included things like support for George Floyd and criticism of Trump’s family separation policy. Selkis wrote: “A new woke pope. BLM. Kids in cages. Suicidal empathy. American who mostly posts en espanol.”\n\n'Woke pope,' screams the MAGA crowd. Apparently, Jesus' own teachings go too far.\n\nI’m not familiar with the “empathy is bad” portion of the Bible. But it seems the MAGA crowd is generally upset at the new pope, who took the name Leo XIV, because he believes in the things Jesus taught. The fact that those things – loving others, embracing peace, welcoming immigrants – are deemed “woke” and thus intolerable by parishioners of the Church of Trump tells you all you need to know about the congregation.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWho knows, maybe they’re just upset other places keep choosing leaders who stand against much of what Trump stands for.\n\nConservatives in Canada and Australia took a beating in recent elections thanks to widespread dislike of Trump, and now the Vatican gets a U.S. pope who: believes climate change is an urgent crisis; hails from Chicago, a city Trump has routinely derided as a liberal sanctuary city; preaches love for immigrants; and, like his papal predecessor and most humans, doesn’t seem to like Vice President JD Vance.\n\nOn his verified X account, then-Cardinal Prevost shared a column about Vance that included the headline, “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.”\n\nThat’s a double sad trombone for Vance, a fairly recent convert to Catholicism who has now taken heat from two popes.\n\nRabid Trump supporters see new pope as threat to MAGA cruelty\n\nIn 2015, Prevost shared a Washington Post opinion column written by Cardinal Timothy Dolan with the headline: “Why Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric is so problematic.”\n\nSuch horrible wrongs led Loomer to sum up the new pope like this: “He is anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis.”\n\nSomebody get these folks a Bible or a hobby, or both.\n\nYou might remember back when Trump was inaugurated for the second time, an Episcopal bishop had the gall to ask the new president and vice president to \"have mercy upon the people in our country,\" saying: \"The people who pick our crops and clean our office buildings, who labor in poultry farms and meatpacking plants, who wash the dishes after we eat in restaurants and work the night shifts in hospitals. They may not be citizens or have the proper documentation, but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals.\"\n\nTrump himself and the MAGA-verse erupted in outrage, as if those were the cruelest, most outrageous words ever spoken. That set the stage for the May 8 reaction to Pope Leo XIV.\n\nSo Pope Leo XIV is a 'globalist'? Why must everything be a conspiracy?\n\nSean Feucht, a wildly pro-Trump Christian nationalist singer and pastor, posted of the new pope: “This is all a very calculated move people. IT IS TIME TO WAKE UP! They chose a globalist and woke Pope from the West ON PURPOSE to stand up and criticize the leaders of the Free World.”\n\nAnd right-wing conspiracy nutter Mike Cernovich posted: “Sorry, Catholics. This new Pope is an open borders globalist. He will be pushing for abortion soon.\n\nOh no, the new pope is a Catholic. It's a true nightmare for MAGA.\n\nHey, it wouldn’t be MAGA without 24/7 victimhood. The Catholic Church got a new pope from Chicago who seems to be … you know … Catholic.\n\nAnd apparently that makes him a regular Pope Woke Marxist II.

What Robert Prevost's social media posts tell us\n\nShortly he appeared as the new pope on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, social media went digging and found some posts from the former Cardinal that suggest he could be critical of the Trump administration's policies.\n\nThe new pope, on April 14, reposted criticism of Trump and President of El Salvador Nayib Bukele's response to the wrongful deportation of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n\nOn Feb. 3, Leo XIV reposted an article from the National Catholic Reporter titled, \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.\"\n\nVance had justified the administration's immigration policy using a medieval-era Catholic teaching, though Francis had called the immigration policies a \"major crisis\" in an open letter to U.S. Bishops.\n\nVance and Trump have not yet commented on the criticism, USA TODAY reported.\n\nIs Donald Trump Catholic?\n\nNo.\n\nTrump once identified as a Presbyterian, but in 2020 he told Religion News Service he began considering himself a non-denominational Christian.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump, however, made news in 2017 when she met the late Pope Francis and revealed she is Catholic when asking the pontiff to bless her rosary beads. She attended Francis' funeral with the president on her 55th birthday on April 26, wearing a traditional black lace veil.\n\nOn May 8, the day the papal conclave ended, Trump congratulated the new pope on Truth Social, saying, \"It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope ... I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!\"\n\nIs Vice President JD Vance Catholic?\n\nYes. JD Vance converted to the Catholic recently and was baptized in 2019. He is the country's second Catholic vice president after former President Joe Biden, who served as vice president in the Obama administration.\n\nIn a blog post in The Lamp, a Catholic journal, Vance said he was raised Christian and then identified as an atheist in college.\n\nA series of teachings and encounters, including with entrepreneur Peter Thiel, led him back to being a person of faith and specifically Catholic, the blog post describes.\n\nVance met Francis on Easter Sunday, the day before his death.\n\nIs Usha Vance Catholic? No, she is the first Hindu second lady\n\nUsha Vance is not Catholic. Usha Vance comes from a deeply religious Hindu family, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer, and she is the first Hindu second lady.\n\nStill, JD Vance in The Lamp blog post said Usha Vance supported his conversion to Catholicism.\n\nDonald Trump AI Pope picture after joking he wanted to be the next pope\n\nTrump appears to have had some fun with the papal shakeup. After attending Francis' funeral, Trump was asked by reporters who he would like to see be the next pope.\n\n\"I would like to be pope. That would be my No. 1 choice,\" Trump said jokingly on April 29, according to a White House pool report.\n\nThe Trump administration later stoked controversy by posting an apparent artificial intelligence-created image of Trump dressed as the pope. The president denied having anything to do with its creation, but claimed the Catholics loved it.\n\nHowever, at least some New York Bishops said it was neither \"clever or funny.”\n\nIs Barron Trump Catholic? What religion is Barron, son of Donald and Melania Trump?\n\nBarron Trump largely stays out of the public eye, and the Office of the First Lady did not immediately respond to questions about whether Barron follows her faith.\n\nHowever, we do know he was baptized at Bethesda-By-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida, the same place his parents were married.\n\n(This story was updated with new information.)\n\nContributing: Sarah D.

Settings where other securities are preferred, like technology, money, success, power, or pleasure.\"\n\nAfter the Mass, Leo will have lunch with the cardinals who elected him and they will then be free to leave the Vatican and return to their homes around the world.\n\nAlso on the pope's schedule, Leo plans to lead the Regina Coeli prayer from the central balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica at 12 p.m. local time on Sunday, May 11, according to Vatican News. On Monday, May 12, he will meet with journalists in the Vatican.\n\nHistory made with new Pope Leo XIV\n\nThe first Mass comes less than a day after 133 cardinal electors selected Leo, formerly Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, as the 267th pope of the Catholic Church in a historic first. The 69-year-old Chicago native is the first pontiff born in the United States.\n\nThroughout his career, Leo was primarily a missionary in Peru before receiving dual Peruvian nationality and serving as a bishop in Chiclayo from 2015 to 2023. He became a cardinal only in 2023.\n\nFollowing a two-day papal conclave, Leo was elected as the successor to Pope Francis — who was the first pope from Latin America and died on April 21 at the age of 88. The selection surprised the Roman Catholic world as Leo was not viewed a frontrunner for the papacy.\n\nAfter white smoke emerged from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel on May 8, there was a brief moment of uncertainty when the new pope's name was announced to a huge crowd in St. Peter's Square before people erupted in cheers.\n\n\"Peace be with you all,\" he told the crowd in fluent Italian. Leo also spoke in Spanish but not English in his address.\n\nHow a Chicago native became pope: See Robert Francis Prevost's path to making history\n\nPrevost was ordained in 1981 as a member of the Order of Saint Augustine. He then became a pastor of vocations and director of missions for the Augustinian order in Chicago and worked in Peru for several years teaching canon law.\n\nPrevost also served as a parish pastor, diocesan official, seminary teacher and vicar. He served two terms as the head of the Augustinian order, until 2013.\n\nIn 2014, Francis appointed him to an administrative posts in Peru, and became bishop here, as well vice president of the Peruvian Bishops Conference until 2023.\n\nHis most recent position, prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, was a powerful one: He was responsible for selecting many of the world's bishops. He was elevated by Francis to the rank of Cardinal in September 2023.\n\nPrevost succeeds a groundbreaking, pioneering pope whose progressive positions, emphasis on inclusivity and ability to connect with people all over the world, from all backgrounds and across different faiths, made him a beloved religious figure, even in secular realms.\n\nPrevost has attracted interest from his peers because of his quiet style and support for Francis, especially his commitment to social justice issues.\n\nThe name Leo\n\nPrevost chose a name used by 13 others before him.\n\n“Leo is a powerful choice,\" said Margaret Thompson, an associate professor of history at Syracuse University. \"Leo XIII is considered the father of Catholic social teaching. This signals a potential emphasis on justice, labor, and the church’s role in the modern world.”\n\nThe last pope to take the name Leo led the Church from 1878 to 1903. Leo XIII was known for his devoted focus to social justice issues, and is often credited with laying the foundation for modern Catholic social teaching.\n\nBruce Morrill, a distinguished professor of theology and Roman Catholic studies at Vanderbilt University, called Prevost's name choice \"highly significant\" and likely a signal of his support for social justice.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/04/21/black-white-smoke-meaning-pope/79068920007/", "title": "What does black or white smoke mean during conclave to elect new ...", "text": "With Pope Francis' passing, crowds will soon gather in Vatican City to honor and celebrate the traditions of selecting his successor.

He was 88 years old.\n\nFollowing Francis' funeral, the Catholic Church's most senior officials will meet to discuss his successor. While these meetings are held in secrecy, the rest of the world is notified of the group's daily decisions by white or black-colored smoke funneled from the top of the Sistine Chapel. Black smoke indicates a non-conclusive answer, and white smoke indicates that a new pope has been selected. This process is part of a papal conclave.\n\nHere's what to know about the tradition of black and white smoke in conjunction with the selection of a new pope.\n\nWhat is a papal conclave?\n\nA papal conclave is an election to choose a new pope, held by the College of Cardinals − bishops and Vatican officials chosen by the pope. As of April 21, the College of Cardinals is made up of 252 individuals, including 136 who can vote in a conclave, according to The Holy See's College of Cardinals Dashboard.\n\nDuring a conclave, the College of Cardinals discuss the needs and challenges facing the Catholic Church. They then gather in St. Peter's Basilica to invoke the guidance of the Holy Spirit on who should be the successor, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nBefore the election begins, the cardinal electors enter the Sistine Chapel, take an oath of secrecy and seal the church's doors. As for the election, each cardinal votes by secret ballot. He says a prayer and then drops his twice-folded ballot in a large chalice, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nFour rounds of voting are conducted each day until one candidate receives two-thirds of the vote.\n\nStart your day informed: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.\n\nWhat does the black and white smoke mean?\n\nThe black and white smoke that bellows from the Sistine Chapel during a conclave represents the cardinals' decision for the day.\n\nIf one candidate didn't receive the necessary two-thirds vote for the day, the ballots are burned in a stove with a mixture of chemicals to produce black smoke. The black smoke indicates another day of voting is ahead.\n\nIf a candidate is selected, the final round of ballots are burned with chemicals to produce white smoke.\n\nWhat chemicals are mixed with the ballots to produce black and white smoke?\n\nDuring the 2013 conclave that led to the election of Pope Francis, the black smoke was produced using a mixture of potassium perchlorate, anthracene (a component of coal tar) and sulfur. The conclave used a combination of potassium chlorate, lactose, and chloroform resin to create the white smoke.\n\nWhere does the smoke come from?\n\nThe black and white smoke comes from a cast-iron stove inside the Sistine Chapel. One of the stoves is used to burn the cardinals' ballots and the other is to send puffs of black or white smoke up above.\n\nWhat happens once a candidate is selected?\n\nOnce a candidate has received two-thirds of the cardinals' votes, the senior cardinal deacon announces him from the balcony of St. Peter's balcony before the new pope steps out to face a welcoming crowd.\n\nWhen is a conclave held?\n\nIn the past, a conclave has been held 15-20 days after a papal vacancy, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nWhen was the first conclave held?\n\nThe first papal was held in 1492, according to the Sistine Chapel website.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

Political dialogue and action usually is dominated by sound bites, debating points and parochial partisanship.\n\nIt is thus inspiring to recognize two contemporary political leaders who displayed the sort of courage celebrated by John F. Kennedy in his prize-winning book, Profiles in Courage: George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States, and Paul Bridges, the former mayor of Uvalda, Georgia, population 592.\n\nFor all the differences between these two politicians, they share a courage to risk their political future for the greater good. Politicians in Washington today would do well to emulate their examples.\n\nIn 1988 Americans read George Bush's lips and elected him president with the expectation of no new taxes.\n\nIn office he was confronted with two realities: deadlock with a Democratic Congress and a budget deficit spiraling out of control, both threatening the economy.\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations, Bush and congressional Democrats reached a budget deal that rattled the political base of both parties. It set limits on discretionary spending, implemented \"pay as you go\" rules for entitlement programs and raised taxes.\n\nThe ramifications were profound: the 1990 budget agreement was a first step in the economic surge occurring during the Bill Clinton Presidency. \"Without President Bush' s decision to support some tax increases along with spending cuts in the 1990 legislation, the economic boom of the 1990s would have been significantly diminished,\" says Mark Zandi chief economist of Moody's Analytics. And it enraged some of Bush's fellow Republicans, contributed to a sharp decline in his approval ratings and may well have cost him reelection in 1992. He put the public good ahead of his own political calculation.\n\nFor all the distinct differences, Paul Bridges, on a much smaller stage, showed the same sort of courage and willingness to risk his political future.\n\nIn 2011, tiny Uvalda, Georgia became an unlikely battleground in the fight over immigration. Bridges, the town's mayor and a Republican, was the only politician to join a federal lawsuit to stop a state law designed to drive illegal immigrants out Georgia.\n\nTo the dismay of his party and most of his constituents, Bridges opposed the law that would have authorized the police to demand documentation of immigration status during traffic stops, criminalized housing or transporting undocumented immigrants and greatly hindered access to state services and facilities.\n\nBridges knew the law would disrupt the local economy and devastate families. The mayor himself knew he would be a law-breaker when he drove undocumented workers and their families to the doctor or the supermarket or to church.\n\nHe was vilified by many in the town and suffered scathing criticism from anti-immigration partisans around the country. He became so unpopular that he had to abandon running for reelection. He sacrificed his career for principle.\n\nBoth men are reminders of an enduring truth that Kennedy recognized in Profiles in Courage: \"The true democracy, living and growing and inspiring, puts its faith in the people -- faith that the people will not simply elect men who will represent their views ably and faithfully, but also elect men who will exercise their conscientious judgment.\"\n\nFor putting their country and their community ahead of their political self-interest, George H.W. Bush and Paul Bridges will be honored this Sunday with John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award.\n\nOnly when more politicians find the courage to emulate Bush and Bridges will the nation's most intractable problems – from taxes to health care – be solved.\n\nJack Schlossberg is President John F.

Because the justices appointed have met rigorous scholarly and ethical standards, it is intended they will be retained barring explicit violation of prescribed responsibilities. That is why the November ballot deliberately requests a retention vote, not a recall vote.\n\nThe distinction is critical. Voter affirmation is the final guarantee that judges can weigh evidence and reach constitutionally sound decisions without threat of retaliation. We ask you to consider two examples, set many years apart.\n\nBeginning with its very first decision, the Iowa Supreme Court broke new ground throughout the 1800s, delivering rulings against slavery, school segregation, and discrimination well before the public mood shifted toward racial equality. How fortunate that those early justices did not allow political pressure to overpower the Constitution; how fortunate that Iowa’s political leaders did not confuse public opinion with the rule of law.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIn 2009, justices reinforced the court’s commitment to upholding both the U.S. and Iowa constitutions when they ruled unanimously that marriage between same-sex couples was a right (Varnum v. Brien). Once again, Iowa led the way in support of civil rights, but this time groups opposed to same-sex marriage organized (with heavy out-of-state support) to take revenge. The result? On Nov. 2, 2010, voters ousted three justices — all of whom participated in that unanimous vote — marking the first time an Iowa Supreme Court justice was not retained since the Iowa’s merit-based system was adopted in 1962.\n\nIn 2012, Chief Justice Marsha Ternus, Justice David Baker, and Justice Michael Streit, who had been voted out of office, received Profile In Courage Awards from the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. Caroline Kennedy presented the award with these words: “The three judges are interesting and courageous on many levels. Like many of the people who get this award, they don't consider that they are doing anything particularly courageous, they just feel they're doing what's right, they're doing their job.” In this case, doing what was right cost them their jobs.\n\nWe strongly believe the judiciary should be beyond the reach of special interests and shielded from political pressure so it can uphold constitutional rights and the rule of law without fear of attack. This is a message that can be sent only by Iowa’s voters — the two of us and all of you.\n\nIf you want Iowa’s judges to continue making rulings based on law rather than political pressure, please join us in voting yes to retain Iowa Supreme Court Justices Mark S.

Trump: A First Historical Assessment.” Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThat Donald Trump acknowledged some responsibility for the January 6, 2021, insurrection, according to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, pulls back the curtain on a former president who has publicly downplayed the actions of his supporters at the US Capitol that day and shown little remorse for pushing the lie that the 2020 election was “stolen.”\n\nAnd to get insight into the way Republican leaders like McCarthy and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were privately angry with Trump in the immediate aftermath of the insurrection – only to publicly gloss over the incident in the following weeks – shows just how dire the state of politics is today.\n\nAccording to audio recordings obtained by two New York Times reporters, McCarthy told House Republicans on January 11, 2021, “I asked him personally today, does he hold responsibility for what happened? Does he feel bad about what happened? He told me he does have some responsibility for what happened. And he needs to acknowledge that.”\n\nIn the days after the insurrection, McCarthy privately slammed Trump’s conduct on January 6, calling it “atrocious and totally wrong,” according to the New York Times. In another call with fellow Republicans, he went so far as to say, “I’ve had it with this guy.” He also told Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming he would advise the former president to resign, a move his spokesperson denied on Thursday evening before the New York Times released audio recordings of his statements.\n\nSimilarly, McConnell predicted Republicans would break from Trump and asked a reporter in the Capitol about the possibility of the cabinet invoking the 25th Amendment. And over lunch with two advisers, McConnell turned to the possibility of impeachment, saying, “The Democrats are going to take care of the son of a bitch for us.” There was even speculation among Republican colleagues McConnell would vote to convict Trump. “If this isn’t impeachable, I don’t know what is,” McConnell had said, according to the New York Times report.\n\nBoth McCarthy and McConnell, of course, voted to acquit Trump of inciting an insurrection when the former President was impeached for the second time.\n\nDespite their initial responses, both Republican leaders ended up backing away from the issue, fearing the political repercussions of taking on Trump. As Rep. Bill Johnson of Ohio put it in January 2021 during a call with other Republican lawmakers, conservative voters would “go ballistic” if they criticized Trump. He advised members of the party to redirect their ire at Democratic bogeymen like Hunter Biden and Hillary Clinton instead.\n\nMcCarthy went on to visit the former President at Mar-a-Lago in late January 2021, and McConnell, unwilling to stick his neck out, told a friend, “I didn’t get to be a leader by voting with five people in the conference.” By late February 2021, when asked on Fox News whether he would support Trump as the Republican presidential nominee in 2024, McConnell replied, “Absolutely.”\n\nThis refusal to hold Trump accountable, and the pressure both McCarthy and McConnell felt to take this stance, reveals just how far most of the Republican Party has shifted in recent decades. Even something as dramatic as a full-scale attack on a presidential election, coupled with a violent attack on Congress, is not enough to break the rank partisanship we’ve seen from Republicans. It’s clear from their actions that maintaining political power supersedes all else, even the health of our democratic institutions.\n\nMcCarthy and McConnell aren’t the only ones to blame. Most Republicans continue to stand by the former President after downplaying the significance of January 6. Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia tried to gaslight the country by casting the violent mob violence as a “normal tourist visit.” And there was little pushback when Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida falsely claimed members of Antifa were to blame, citing an article from the Washington Times later removed from its website and saying he didn’t “know if the reports (were) true.”\n\nIn fact, the Republican Party has made investigations into January 6 extraordinarily difficult, placing the burden on Democrats, rather than working in bipartisan fashion. The few Republicans who have joined Democrats on this issue, such as Cheney, who was recently awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, have been punished by their party.\n\nThe new heroes of the party have included extremists like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who is currently the focus of a legal hearing in Atlanta which could disqualify her from running for reelection. The case centers on a provision in the Fourteenth Amendment prohibiting officials who take an oath to uphold the Constitution from holding future office if they “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” (Green denies allegations she encouraged the violence on January 6)\n\nThe suit was launched by several of her constituents, with the backing of constitutional scholars and liberal activists, and Greene was publicly questioned under oath about her role in the attack on Friday. Although the odds of success in this case are slim, it could provide insight into the potential connections between elected officials and the mob at the Capitol. It will also give Republicans in Washington yet another chance to take a more forceful stand against the “big lie,” although it’s safe to say no one will be holding their breaths at this point.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nHow politicians deal with January 6 should be a litmus test for voters to think about the fundamental values of each political party.

They've declared \"not in our town\" to hate groups and weathered the condemnation of the mob.\n\nWe've picked five courageous stands that helped shape Montana and American history.\n\n'Like asking the Statue of Civic Virtue for a chew of tobacco'\n\nPolitics in Montana's early days were marked, and marred, by corruption. Yet from Montana came two senators who took down a corrupt presidential administration in the Roaring '20s.\n\nSen. Thomas Walsh took on the powerful secretary of the interior, and Sen. Burton Wheeler tackled corruption in the justice department and a crooked attorney general.\n\n\"They worked together,\" said Bradley Snow, an adjunct history professor at Montana State University and Wheeler's great-grandson.\n\nThe New York Times called the Montana senators \"assassins of character\" on a partisan vendetta.\n\n\"A number of conservative publications really went after Wheeler and Walsh — before they proved their cases,\" Snow said. \"The fact is Wheeler and Walsh uncovered substantial corruption that vindicated what they were doing.\"\n\nWalsh, a Democrat who took office in 1913, supported women's suffrage, opposed child labor, promoted the League of Nations and backed Prohibition. He was one of the most important politicians in the 1920s and catapulted to prominence during the investigation of the Teapot Dome scandal.\n\nWalsh found little support for the investigation, even a \"decidedly hostile attitude\" from previous chairmen of the investigation because their \"political friends were under fire,\" according to James Bates' biography of Walsh.\n\n\"The work of ferreting out the facts and assembling the witnesses to establish them was all mine,\" he said.\n\nWalsh's investigation found that businessmen offered bribes to high-ranking Harding Administration officials and sent Interior Secretary Albert Fall to prison, the first time a cabinet member had ever been sent to jail for a felony.\n\nThe New York Sun reported, \"No wise Democratic politician is likely to go to Walsh in his new job looking for special favors. It would be like asking the Statue of Civic Virtue for a chew of tobacco.\" The press called him \"the first man in history who is worth a billion dollars to his own government in his own lifetime,\" according to \"The Montana Medicine Show's Genuine Montana History\" by B. Derek Strahn.\n\nAs a state legislator, Wheeler fought for labor against the Anaconda Co. While a U.S. attorney, he refused to issue a sedition indictment for those who insulted the flag, the government, the military or agitated for labor in industries vital to the war effort (which was, yes, most everything).\n\nIn the U.S. Congress, where he served from 1923 to 1947, Wheeler made a quick impact.\n\nWheeler's trials on corruption garnered significant publicity, and Attorney General Harry Daugherty struck back at him, accusing him of corruption. Wheeler went on trial in Great Falls in 1925 and was unanimously acquitted.\n\n\"Daugherty turned out to be a really bad guy and did have to resign from office. He used the predecessor to the FBI to try to dig up dirt on Wheeler. They couldn't find much so they trumped up this charge,\" Snow said. \"He was a freshman senator who stood up to a powerful attorney general who was close friends with the president and willing to use the justice department.\"\n\nWalsh was on a train on his way to take the oath of office to become attorney general in 1933 when he died, a death his family called suspicious and perhaps the result of poison.\n\n\"I don't know. He was an older guy, 73, and he had a new, younger bride. My family thought it was the honeymoon that killed him,\" Snow said. \"It's interesting how different American history could have been. Everyone said he was incorruptible, brilliant and hardworking. I've always thought it was a tragedy he didn't get to serve, and it would have been a great feather in Montana's cap.\"\n\nWhen a train brought Walsh's body back to Montana, crowds paid homage at every station across Montana.\n\nWheeler fell out with President Franklin Roosevelt about the issue of court packing, adding justices to the Supreme Court so he could have more who agreed with his New Deal programs. He was an isolationist as Roosevelt made his case for war.\n\n\"He led the fight on the liberal side against court packing and a lot of New Dealers never forgave him,\" Snow said. \"He was a true maverick. He was his own guy.\"\n\nThe likes of Wheeler, Walsh — and Gov. Joseph Dixon elected in the same era — were a \"natural reaction\" against Montana's early political corruption, Snow said.\n\n\"They both smelled a rat,\" he said. \"They wanted to go after that corruption. I can't think of another example of two senators from the same state both holding big hearings and uncovering corruption in the same administration.\"\n\nA Blackfeet warrior\n\nAs settlement checks arrived across Indian County and the University of Montana dedicated the new Elouise Cobell Land and Culture Institute in Missoula this fall, Montanans have been reminded again of the legacy of Elouise Cobell and her unyielding pursuit of justice.\n\nCobell, who died in Great Falls in 2011, filed with four others a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. government in 1996 that claimed the Interior Department misspent, lost or stole billions of dollars received for oil and gas leases and other uses of individual Indian lands held in trust by the United States and meant for Native American land trust account holders dating back to the 1880s.\n\nThe government amassed attorneys in \"Cobell War Rooms.\" Meanwhile, Cobell became the face of 500,000 Indians the suit represented, whom she railed to the cause. She lobbied Congress.\n\nCobell was \"a significant force for change. She is a hero in all senses of the word,\" Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said.\n\nCobell was born on the Blackfeet Reservation to a family of eight children.\n\nOn the reservation, she assisted small business owners and helped open the Blackfeet National Bank in Browning, the first tribally owned bank in the United States.\n\nAfter a hard-fought 15 years, the lawsuit reached a $3.4 billion settlement, the largest class-action award in American history.\n\nThe settlement included payments to hundreds of thousands of individuals and a $1.9 billion land buy-back program, which will put land back into tribal hands.\n\nA voice in the darkness\n\nThe Jewish people found an unlikely ally in Sen. James Murray during the 1940s, a Democratic senator whose constituency was barely one-third of 1 percent Jewish.\n\n\"Defying all political logic,\" Murray condemned Hitler as a \"ruthless, dangerous maniac,\" an inflammatory comment at a time when most Montanans were isolationists and the state's senior senator, Wheeler, campaigned against involvement in World War II before the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\nPresident F.D. Roosevelt said winning the war would save the Jewish people so the United States should focus on that. But Murray \"demanded saving 'the helpless Jews of Europe, who are facing a purposeful annihilation on the scale the world has never seen,\" Strahn wrote in \"The Montana Medicine Show's Genuine Montana History\" by B. Derek.\n\n\"We dare not wait any longer ... for every day of postponement means death to thousands of innocent victims,\" Murray said. \"If we wait until the war is won, there may be only corpses left to enjoy victory.\"\n\nThough Murray had \"little to gain and much to lose,\" he helped convince Roosevelt to establish the War Refuge Board, which rescued 200,000 Jews. He then began his advocacy of the Jewish state in Palestine.\n\n'I cannot vote for war'\n\nFrom the first moment of her election as the first woman to serve in the U.S. Congress, friends, family and fellow suffragettes began working on Jeannette Rankin to \"vote like a man\" and vote for war.\n\nOnly four days after taking her seat in Congress, Rankin had to vote on whether the United States should join World War I.\n\nNot yet 40, Rankin had been a social worker and a prominent suffragette through her winding career, in an era when suffragettes were spit on and jailed.\n\nIn 1910, she became the first woman to speak before the Montana Legislature. By 1914, she could say she'd help bring the vote to Montana women, and in their first chance to vote for a candidate for federal office, Montana women helped her win the second of Montana's at-large Congressional seats.\n\nRankin, with the financial and moral support of her brother Wellington, campaigned on the Republican ticket advocating for social welfare issues.\n\nWith Germans attacking Atlantic shipping — including American vessels — President Woodrow Wilson addressed a joint session of Congress and said the United States needed to \"make the world safe for democracy.\"\n\nRankin sat out the ensuing debate, which she later regretted, according to her Congressional biography.\n\nBut when she did vote, Rankin cast one of only 56 no votes in Congress, saying \"I want to stand by my country, but I cannot vote for war.\"\n\nShe was \"a dagger in the hands of the German propagandists, a dupe of the Kaiser, a member of the Hun army in the United States, and a crying schoolgirl,\" according to the Helena Independent. Even many suffragettes quickly distanced themselves.\n\nDuring the rest of her term, Rankin worked for expanded civil liberties, child welfare and women's health. When she introduced a constitutional amendment to give women the vote nationwide, Rankin said, \"How shall we explain to them the meaning of democracy if the same Congress that voted to make the world safe for democracy refuses to give this small measure of democracy to the women of our country?\"\n\nRankin wasn't elected to Congress again until 1941, as another world war loomed. This time she was one of eight congresswomen (compared with 99 now).\n\nAfter the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Rankin cast the lone vote against a war resolution and said on the floor of Congress, \"As a woman, I can't go to war, and I refuse to send anyone else.\"\n\nThe vote was hugely unpopular, and she had to flee an angry mob, according to her Congressional biography. Whether her vote was right or not, it was brave.\n\n\"We don't realize the pioneers that went before us that did things that were so outrageously uncommon and seen to be unacceptable,\" said Mary Jane Bradbury, a living history performer who portrays Rankin. She told the Tribune she finds the first Congresswoman \"singular in terms of her courage and her willingness to stand by her beliefs.\"\n\nA profile in courage\n\n\"Not in our county.\"\n\nThat was the message Garfield County Attorney Nick Murnion had for the Montana Freemen, an anti-government separatist group that held the FBI at bay in eastern Montana for 81 days in 1996.\n\nBefore Montana was even made a territory 150 years ago, the wide open spaces drew the anti-social. Outside Jordan, which numbers fewer than 350 people, the Freemen barricaded themselves in a 960-acre ranch compound they called Justus Township.\n\nTheir anti-government rhetoric turned dangerous as they issued death threats, brandished weapons at law enforcement, instituted quick-money scams that stole thousands of dollars from people across the country and dodged taxes.\n\n\"I don't want people to downplay the hatred and bitterness, because that was the part that scared everybody,\" Murnion told the AP.\n\nMurnion received the 1998 John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award after he prosecuted the militia group for impersonating public officials, solicitation of kidnapping and criminal syndicalism.\n\nThe Freeman posted a $1 million bounty on Murnion, along with the judge and sheriff. The Freemen filed a notice lien against Murnion demanding $500 million payable in silver, seized the courthouse and issued writs of attachments against his property and threatened to hang him and other elected and bank officials from a bridge outside Jordan, as well as threatening bombings and sniping against elected officials in Jordan, according to the Kennedy Library.\n\nWhen Murnion accepted his award, he said until he had to fight for our democratic form of government for five years he'd taken it for granted.\n\n\"Our people had to make a decision to take a stand against 30 armed insurrectionists, even though it put their own lives and property at risk. Even with the knowledge of the risks, 80 people signed up to assist law enforcement in whatever was needed to be done to deal with a situation which was rapidly escalating into an armed confrontation,\" he said. \"In accepting this award I wish to acknowledge the courage of those 80 people and of the rest of the community, which overwhelmingly condemned this movement.\"\n\nTo white supremacists, Murnion's message was: \"We will expose the truth about you and the truth will defeat you. To the rest of America, let Montana be an example of how hate can be conquered.\"\n\nReach Tribune Staff Writer Kristen Inbody at 791-1490 or by email at kinbody@greatfallstribune.com.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nA new map signed into law last week by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis will eliminate two Black-led congressional districts in Florida.\n\nOn the chopping block: Florida’s 5th Congressional District, currently represented by Democrat Al Lawson, which connects Black communities from Tallahassee to Jacksonville. Under the new map, Jacksonville, the city with the largest Black population in the state, is divided into two Republican-leaning districts.\n\nAlso skewered: the 10th Congressional District, currently represented by Rep. Val Demings, a Black Democrat. The new map reduces Black voters in the Orlando-area district. Demings is currently running for the US Senate.\n\nThe map is expected to expand Republicans’ current 16-11 seat advantage in congressional districts to as many as 20 out of 28 districts – and possibly help Republicans flip control of the US House of Representatives this November.\n\nMany Democrats and voting rights advocates denounced the move and even attempted to stop the passage of the new maps with a protest on the state House floor.\n\nState Rep. Angie Nixon, one of the Democrats who protested loudly on the House floor, has called the map “an attack on democracy” and DeSantis “a bully.”\n\nShe told Politico that Republican leaders were “willing to lie, cheat and steal to maintain their stranglehold of power on the state of Florida.”\n\nThe map was pushed by DeSantis himself. The GOP governor and likely 2024 presidential contender bucked tradition this year by injecting himself into the decennial redistricting process.\n\nHe first created his own map earlier this year. The governor then vetoed a previous version passed by the GOP-led legislature that maintained the current level of Black districts. DeSantis argued that the current congressional districts were racially gerrymandered and has suggested they are unconstitutional.\n\nThe map he signed into law this past week, he says, is “race neutral.”\n\nVoting rights groups challenge map\n\nLess than 24 hours after the GOP-supported maps were passed, the first legal challenge was filed. The lawsuit was filed by a coalition of civil rights groups, including Black Voters Matter and the League of Women Voters of Florida.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the new maps violate a 2010 state constitutional amendment, Fair Districts, that requires lawmakers to give minority communities an opportunity to “elect representatives of their choice.”\n\nThe move in Florida comes against the backdrop of growing political power for people of color – and fears that redistricting maneuvers will muffle their voices.\n\nWhen the current session of Congress convened in January 2021, it set a high watermark for minority representation: Nearly one-quarter of voting members of the US House and Senate of the 117th Congress were racial or ethnic minorities, according to the Pew Research Center. A record 59 lawmakers were African American.\n\nDemocrats made up 83% of the members of color, while 17% of the non-White members were Republican.\n\nElection force bill signed into law\n\nThe new map is just one of the attention-getting laws enacted in Florida in recent days.\n\nOn Monday, DeSantis signed a sweeping voting law that establishes a new elections police force – making Florida one of the first states in the country with a unit focused on election fraud, an exceedingly rare problem that has become a rallying issue for some GOP voters.\n\nVoting rights groups have raised alarms that an election police unit under the purview of a partisan governor could turn into a political weapon.\n\nDuring a news conference, DeSantis said local election supervisors and prosecutors don’t necessarily have the expertise to investigate voting-related complaints and the new officers will.\n\n“We just want to make sure whatever laws are on the books that those laws are enforced,” the governor added.\n\nJFK group profiles courage\n\nIn an earlier newsletter, we highlighted the legislative maneuvers of Arizona state Rep. Rusty Bowers. The Arizona House Speaker is perhaps best known in the state for not caving under pressure from Donald Trump’s allies to somehow overturn the former President’s 2020 loss in the state.\n\nNow, the Mesa-area Republican is a recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award – one of five people recognized by the late President’s library foundation for defending democracy at home and abroad.\n\nThe foundation’s honorees also include another little-known figure, whose life was disrupted for simply doing her job: Fulton County, Georgia, election worker Wandrea “Shaye” Moss. She had become the target of false accusations that she had processed fraudulent ballots for President Joe Biden in the last presidential election.\n\nShe and Ruby Freeman – her mother who served as a temporary Fulton County election worker during the 2020 election – had faced racist taunts and death threats in the aftermath of those accusations.\n\n(The women recently reached a settlement with One America News Network in their defamation suit against the outlet, according to a status report filed with the US District Court in Washington late last week. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.)\n\nIn its praise for Moss, the JFK foundation said that: “Despite the onslaught of random, undeserved, and malicious attacks, Moss continues to serve in the Fulton County Department of Registration & Elections doing the hard and unseen work to run our democracy.”\n\nYou should read", "authors": ["Kelly Mena Fredreka Schouten", "Kelly Mena", "Fredreka Schouten"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/06/19/student-achiever-news-somerset-hunterdon-union/10573813/", "title": "Student achiever news from Somerset, Hunterdon, Union", "text": "MyCentralJersey\n\nPingry junior Hunter Stires of Bedminster earned honors in three recent history contests: the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum’s “Profile in Courage Essay Contest,” the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) “Christopher Columbus Essay Contest,” and the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) “Voice of Democracy Audio Essay Competition.”\n\n“Studying our past is critical to understanding both our present and our future. History is the chronicle of the human experience, with stories of honor, courage, excellence, and greatness. The history we study helps us understand who we were, shapes who we are, and informs who we strive to be,” Stires said in a news release.\n\nIn the spirit of President Kennedy’s 1956 book “Profiles in Courage,” high school students profile an elected official after 1956 who displayed political courage on the local, state, or national level. Hunter interviewed, researched, and wrote about former New Jersey Governor Thomas H. Kean who, as a freshman state assemblyman, fought to save an obscure glacial lake from industrial development. Hunter wrote, “By putting his political future on the line for a 44-acre glacial pond, young Assemblyman Kean opened the door for New Jersey to claim its rightful destiny as the Garden State.” Hunter’s essay placed second in the country out of 1,951 entries.\n\nFor the DAR competition, high school students compared George Washington and Christopher Columbus. “As leaders, Columbus and Washington were each remarkable in their ability to inspire others to follow and join their endeavors…Columbus connected a hemisphere to the burgeoning global network, and Washington transformed Columbus’s discovery into the nation that would come to define the world as we know it,” Hunter wrote. He won for the state of New Jersey for the third consecutive year.\n\nVFW sponsors the audio essay scholarship competition for high school students, who write and record a three- to five-minute essay on a patriotic theme. This year’s theme was “Why I’m Optimistic about Our Nation’s Future,” and Hunter won at the Post level (Basking Ridge/Bernardsville) and placed third in Somerset County. His entry evolved into a winning speech in Pingry’s Robert H. LeBow ’58 Memorial Oratorical Competition, when he argued that political discord in Washington, D.C., is necessary for our nation’s progress.\n\nPingry is a private school in Bernards.\n\nBeloit College\n\nJulia Piffer of Middlesex was named to the spring semester dean’s list at Beloit College in Beloit, Wisconsin.

Recently, they’ve been relying mostly on one income. Their reduced earnings, coupled with inflation, have dealt a blow to their finances.\n\nAnd that has changed, radically, the way they eat. Altman is not alone in making big changes.\n\nWe asked CNN readers how inflation has impacted their eating habits, and many mentioned dining out less often, buying less meat and giving up splurges. Some said they are very worried about the future.\n\nFood prices have spiked 11.4% over the past year, the largest annual increase since May 1979, according to data released in mid-September by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Grocery prices jumped 13.5% and restaurant menu prices increased 8% in that period.\n\nWith food prices soaring, people are changing how they shop and eat. Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nConsumers are responding by looking for deals and switching to generic brands, according to July data from the market research firm IRI. Companies like Tyson (TSN) have noticed customers are switching from beef to chicken, and Applebee’s and IHOP have reported an uptick in higher-income customers who are likely trading down from pricier restaurants. Some people may be dining out less often, or avoiding restaurants altogether.\n\nFor those who struggled to buy food even before prices shot up, rising costs could mean falling into food insecurity, a state of unreliable access to affordable food.\n\n“If food prices continue to increase at a rate that outpaces increases in wages, that is the inevitable consequence,” said Jayson Lusk, head of the agricultural economics department at Purdue University. “The last time we had a big run up in food insecurity rates was in the wake of the Great Recession.” Last year, about 10.2% of US households were food insecure, according to the USDA, slightly below the 10.5% rate in 2020 and 2019.\n\nEven for those not at risk of hunger, the surges in food prices are jarring.\n\nFood “matters a lot to our self esteem, our mood,” said William Masters, a professor at Tufts University’ school of nutrition science and policy who is also a member of the economics department faculty. “Not being able to buy the foods that people are used to — that your children are asking for, that your family wants — that’s a really hard thing,” he said. “Any disruption of habit is very, very hard.”\n\nGiving up on simple pleasures\n\nCarol Ehrman taking a Thai cooking class over Zoom during the pandemic. Courtesy Carol and Tommy Ehrman\n\nFor Carol Ehrman, cooking is a joyful experience.\n\n“I love to cook, it’s my favorite thing to do,” she said. She especially likes to cook Indian and Thai food, but stocking the spices and ingredients she needs for those dishes is no longer feasible. “When every ingredient has gone up, that adds up on the total bill,” she said.\n\n“What used to cost us $250 to $300 … is now $400.” Ehrman, 60, and her husband, 65, rely on his social security income, and the increase was stretching their budget. “We just couldn’t do that.”\n\nAbout six months ago, she realized she had to change the way she shops for groceries.\n\nIn an effort to bring their immediate costs down, Ehrman stopped shopping in bulk as often as she used to. Now, she hunts for sales, avoids buying beef, and opts for boxed wine instead of nice bottles when she buys wine at all. She’s also cooking simpler meals, and saying goodbye to dinner parties.\n\nEhrman haș even given up preparing basic items, like tomato sauce, because of the expense, opting instead for a pre-packaged version.\n\n“I know that I can make it much healthier,” she said. And “it always tastes so much better.” Those fresh ingredients are just too pricey now.\n\nEhrman’s husband is retired due to chronic health problems, and it’s been difficult for her to work because of her own health issues — she recently had pacemaker and heart catheterization procedures. The couple, who live in Billings, Montana, were frugal before the current spike in prices, enjoying simple pleasures. But now, even those are out of reach.\n\n“Before, we at least found joy in being home and having friends over and family over, cooking and sitting around the table and just being content,” she said. Now, “I’m not entertaining at all. It’s really sad.”\n\nFrom Coke to Pepsi\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Local markets, generic brands help family save money on groceries 01:25 - Source: CNN Business Local markets, generic brands help family save money on groceries 01:25 • CNN Business\n\nRick Wichmann, 64, and his wife have been dining out less often in recent years, due to the pandemic and in an effort to eat healthier. With menu prices rising because of inflation, they see no reason to change their habits.\n\n“Eating out is expensive,” he said, noting that he’s often happier with home-cooked meals than restaurant food anyway.\n\nBut grocery shopping is also more expensive. Over the past year, Wichmann noticed that he had been spending about 25% more shopping for groceries for himself, his wife and their son than he used to.\n\nTo help mitigate those costs, Wichmann, who lives in Brookline, Massachusetts, started going to different grocers. He avoids Whole Foods and Stop & Shop, opting instead for Costco and the local chain Market Basket.\n\nHe’s also switched to store brands, if he feels the quality is the same, and will sometimes choose products based on price rather than brand loyalty — like, for example, buying Pepsi when it’s cheaper, when he’d otherwise choose Coke.\n\nWichmann also pays attention to events like weather, and how they might affect prices. When he saw reports of a possible tomato shortage due to droughts in California, he took notice. The next time he saw tomato sauce on sale he stocked up on enough to last for months.\n\nA vegetable garden in the front lawn\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Turning to gardening to save money on food 01:33 - Source: CNN Business Turning to gardening to save money on food 01:33 • CNN Business\n\nLike Wichmann, Jenni Wells, 38, pays attention to weather patterns and food systems. A former chef and rancher, she noticed price increases well before the current bout of inflation.\n\n“My alarm bells started going off for prices going up in 2019,” she said, when devastating floods in the midwest drowned livestock and destroyed grain stocks. Wells decided back then that she’d like to be more self sufficient.\n\n“I saw the food prices going up, and I realized that it was going to quickly overwhelm our budget,” she said. So in February, she ripped up the grass in the front lawn of her home in Fort Worth, Texas, which she shares with her husband and best friend, and planted a vegetable garden.\n\n“I just wanted to see what I could grow for myself,” she said. This year, she’s managed to grow broccoli, cauliflower, okra, tomatoes, peppers, squashes and more in her garden.\n\nThere are upfront and maintenance costs for the garden, of course. And it’s not easy to grow vegetables. But the household’s weekly grocery spending, excluding meat, has fallen from about $200 to $50, she said.\n\nWith the money left over, Wells and her household have been able to eat at restaurants, something that would have been “too much of a luxury” had they still been spending $200 a week on groceries. And there’s the satisfaction of growing your own food.\n\n“There’s a huge sense of reward,” she said. “I feel pride in every meal that I make with it.”\n\nChanging for good\n\nA recent weekly grocery haul for Lisa Altman. Courtesy Lisa Altman\n\nSome consumers have made changes because of current circumstances that they plan to hold onto.\n\nNow, Altman, the Austin parent of three, aims to keep her grocery bill to about $100 to $125 per week by buying store brands, lots of pasta and a limited amount of protein each week.\n\nInstead of ordering in or grilling steaks or ribs, Altman’s family eats more basic meals with smaller portions. “Now our meals consist of one primary dish, and that’s it, maybe some bread on the side, or a salad.” If they go out to eat, they’ll pick up a fast food meal with a few sides, like one burger and two fries, split the items and have beverages at home.\n\nWhen Altman is able to afford it, she’ll go back to buying more fruits and veggies. But she’s hoping some habits, like encouraging her children to avoid mindless eating and reducing food waste, will stick.\n\n“I’m not going to be spending $1,200 a month on groceries,” she said. “This has taught us that that’s not necessary.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/05/business/costco-kirkland-signature", "title": "How Costco invented Kirkland Signature | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nCostco’s Kirkland Signature brand is perhaps America’s weirdest private label. You can put Kirkland Signature AA batteries alongside Kirkland Signature cashews in your shopping cart.\n\nIt’s also shockingly successful.\n\nKirkland raked in $58 billion in sales during Costco’s latest fiscal year, making up around a quarter of the company’s total revenue. Kirkland is America’s biggest consumer packaged goods’ brand measured by sales. It’s larger than Hershey (HSY), Campbell Soup (CPB) or Kellogg (K).\n\nBut it wasn’t always this way. It took Costco a couple decades to get its Kirkland strategy right.\n\nIf you shopped at Costco in the United States three decades ago, you’d find about 30 different Costco private-label brands alongside the big-name food and household staples’ lines.\n\nThere was Simply Soda. Chelsea toilet paper. Ballantrae wine. Clout detergent. Nutra Nuggets dog food. These brands were sold only at Costco, which was called PriceCostco at the time after Price Club and Costco merged in 1993 (Costco dropped ‘Price’ from its name four years later).\n\nCostco introduced the Kirkland Signature brand in 1995. Courtesy Costco\n\nBut Jim Sinegal, Costco’s co-founder and CEO at the time, decided these brand names were forgettable. He sensed a major opportunity to overhaul the company’s private-label strategy.\n\nSinegal was inspired by a 1991 article in Forbes about rising profit margins for leading consumer goods’ companies at the time like General Foods, H.J. Heinz and Nabisco and the emerging growth of private-label brands. Consumers are “starting to switch to house brands…The trend so far is only a trickle but it shows signs of growing fairly rapidly,” the article said. Sinegal underlined key passages from the article and sent it around to Costco’s top merchants.\n\nCostco at the time was also expanding internationally, including in the United Kingdom and Canada, where stores’ private-label brands were better quality and more popular with shoppers than in the United States. Most US chains’ private brands had been boring, knockoff brands with white labels.\n\n“We found that there was a resurgence of private-label product, and that was driven an awful lot by the fact that the prices of brand-name products were growing so rapidly,” Sinegal said at a talk in 2019 at Georgetown University. Rising prices for big-name brands “created an umbrella” for Costco to develop its own brands at 15% to 20% below branded alternatives, he said.\n\nSinegal told Costco’s merchants that he wanted the quality of Costco’s private labels to replicate those found overseas. And he had an unusual request — one name for all of them.\n\n“The conventional wisdom said that you had to have a different name for every class of product that you had — a la Sears Roebuck with the Kenmore appliances and the DieHard batteries and the Craftsman tools,” Sinegal said in 2019. “We looked at it and we said, you know, we’re in so many countries and we have such a wide array of products we’ll have a room full of attorneys that are doing nothing but trying to clear these names.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback In 2019, a Costco opened in Shanghai, China. See the chaos that ensued 01:43 - Source: CNN Business In 2019, a Costco opened in Shanghai, China. See the chaos that ensued CNN Business 01:43\n\nSinegal asked staff for suggestions for a name and someone floated Kirkland Signature, a spin on the location of the company’s Washington State headquarters, and came to executives with a design. (“Seattle Signature” was also considered, but Costco couldn’t trademark the name.)\n\n“We liked it,” Sinegal said. “We cleared it for every country and every product category that we would have. That made it simple.”\n\nSo in 1995, all those private brand names disappeared at Costco and were replaced by a new logo with a simple black, white and red design reading Kirkland Signature.\n\nAlthough Costco soon moved its headquarters to nearby Issaquah, the Kirkland name stuck: “Nobody could spell Issaquah, so we kept it.”\n\n‘KS’\n\nKirkland Signature, known as “KS” at Costco, would soon be slapped on everything from diapers to tires to golf clubs.\n\nLast year, Costco introduced a 24-pack of 12oz Kirkland hard seltzer and a 750ml Prosecco rosé. This year, Costco is adding Kirkland cauliflower pizza, furnace filters and a set of saute pans, among other items.\n\nThe sole private-label brand at Costco is an essential part of the retailer’s positioning with customers and a way for Costco to stand out against competitors.\n\nKirkland, which is exclusive to Costco, draws members into warehouses and leads them to renew their $60 and $120 annual memberships every year. Perhaps more important to the company, Kirkland helps Costco solidify its image as a value store with quality products, say analysts.\n\n“Kirkland is a proxy brand for Costco. It really means Costco,” said Christopher Durham, president of Retail Brands Institute, a trade group representing the private brand industry. Kirkland is designed to appeal across demographic groups, he said, unlike many other retailers’ array of private labels that are each targeted at a specific segment of shoppers.\n\nHaving one name signals consistency to shoppers — exactly Costco’s goal — and also creates cost efficiencies for the no-frills retailer. Costco doesn’t have to pay for different packaging and can put all of its buying power with suppliers behind Kirkland. A single private brand is emblematic of Costco’s broader approach to merchandise at warehouses: Less choice is better.\n\n“Kirkland has a one-note strategy and it’s really good at that one note,” Durham said. “It creates a reason and a point of differentiation for people to shop there.”\n\n‘Don’t get it wrong’\n\nMany retailers have made developing their own brands a priority in recent years. Store products carry higher profit margins than national brand products and don’t incur the same advertising costs.\n\nBut Costco’s approach is novel. It’s still one of the only large retail chains to carry all of its private brands under a single banner. Costco rival Sam’s Club in 2017 streamlined its 21 private brands into its Member’s Mark brand.\n\nKroger (KR) says in filings that it produces and sells its private brands in three “tiers” — premium mainly under the Private Selection label, a middle brand called Kroger (KR), and value brands such as Big K and Heritage Farm. Kroger (KR) also produces a natural and organic brand called Simple Truth.\n\nCostco is unusual in its approach to developing private-label brands. Kirby Lee/AP\n\nMost supermarkets take a similar tiered strategy, known as “good, better, best,” said Scott Mushkin, a retail analyst at R5 Capital. But Costco has “positioned Kirkland as a premium brand at value prices.”\n\nOther retailers also sell a wider variety of labels in an effort to target different types of consumers for various products.\n\nWalmart (WMT) has more than a dozen private brands, such as Great Value household staples and George men’s clothing. Target (TGT) has dozens like Cat & Jack kids’ clothing and Good & Gather food. Amazon (AMZN) has more than 400 different private brands, according to estimates.\n\nGoing all in on the Kirkland label remains a risk for Costco.\n\n“Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability” of Kirkland products is “essential” to keeping members loyal to Costco, the company says in its annual filings. If Kirkland “experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence,” sales and profit margins may suffer.\n\n“If you get 99 things right and one thing wrong, people are going to remember the one thing. So you don’t get it wrong,” said Costco finance chief Richard Galanti. “From an opportunity standpoint, Kirkland is known. It’s a brand.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/02/05"}]}

They also estimate that more than 165,000 autoworkers could be laid off if tariffs remain in place for any considerable time.\n\nIf Trump enacts tariffs, the timeline for price hikes and job cuts could vary to within a few weeks or months, depending on the vehicle and the inventory that is in stock, said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of Market Research at Telemetry Insights.\n\nThat's because tariffs — the taxes on goods that cross international borders — do not get applied until the products actually cross the border.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"Anything that is in inventory as of today isn’t affected. Everything that crosses the border from tomorrow on gets a tariff,\" Abuelsamid said. \"Price changes will vary based on the models, with more popular models that have lower inventories being hit the soonest.\"\n\nFor example, Toyota has tight inventory of the Rav4 SUV and Honda has short supply of CR-Vs and Civics, he said. All three vehicles are assembled in Canada and they probably would see an impact from tariffs within a few weeks. The Jeep Compass, made by Stellantis, is built in Mexico. It might take a bit longer for it to be impacted because Stellantis has a good supply of inventory on the Compass, Abuesamid said.\n\n\"Prices will likely remain elevated for a similar period after tariffs are removed until that inventory is depleted,\" Abuelsamid said. \"But parts going through the supply chain might add several weeks or months before you see adjustments.\"\n\nPut simply by economist Michael Hicks, who spoke to the Free Press on Monday before Trump agreed to the pause, \"This is the one-time biggest tax increase on America in history. So it predictably has the effect of dampening economic activity. The people affected most will be the people who are renting, people who need to buy cars, people who need to buy computers.”\n\nHicks, a professor at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, estimates the proposed tariffs would amount to a $2,000 tax on average household spending, hitting lower-income people the hardest.\n\nWhere it stands at the moment\n\nTrump has said the new tax is needed to mitigate an influx of immigration and fentanyl trafficking over the U.S. borders. Canada moved to retaliate by imposing its own tariffs on U.S. imports, and China and Mexico have said they also would respond. Both Canada and Mexico agreed to new border security and anti-fentanyl measures in calls with Trump on Monday.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau each agreed to deploy 10,000 troops to their U.S. borders to fight illegal immigration and drugs.\n\nAround 90% of auto exports from both Mexico and Canada go to the U.S., according to the Mexican Automotive Manufacturers' Association and the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association. Detroit, of course, is at the epicenter of domestic impact.\n\nAs of Monday morning, Ford Motor Co., General Motors and Stellantis did not provide new comments about the pending tariff plans. All had said previously, in some fashion, that they believed Trump shares their goal of a strong U.S. auto industry and could make some adjustments to their manufacturing.\n\nStellantis deferred its comment to the American Automotive Policy Council. Former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, president of the council, said last month that cars and parts that meet the USMCA’s rules of origin should be exempt from any new tariffs.\n\n“If these tariffs are imposed, all vehicles and parts that comply with current USMCA trade agreement rules should be exempt, as they meet the strict standards originally negotiated by President Trump to support jobs and investment in the United States,” Blunt said.\n\nThe industry's lobby group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, had this to say on Saturday from CEO John Bozzella: “Seamless automotive trade in North America accounts for $300 billion in economic value. It not only keeps us globally competitive, it supports auto industry jobs, vehicle choice and vehicle affordability in America. We look forward to working with the administration on solutions that achieve the president’s goals and preserve a healthy, competitive auto industry in America.”\n\nBut the impact from tariffs, if imposed, could be quick, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions LLC.\n\n\"Just-in-time supply of parts could hamper production quickly,\" Fiorani told the Free Press on Monday. \"Tariffs applied to high-value parts such as engines and transmissions sourced from Canada will add dramatically to the cost of vehicles produced in the U.S. Where that cost rises too much, as in engines for the Ford F-150 and SuperDuty trucks and transmissions for the Chevrolet Corvette, production could come to a halt very quickly.\"\n\nNearly all automakers will have to raise prices\n\nAbuelsamid told the Free Press on Monday that if tariffs are imposed and stay in place for the entire year, he projects a loss of 2 million vehicle sales in North America for 2025, with the exact impact varying based on model and inventory. About 200,000 of those sales will be lost in Canada, the rest in the States. He said even shorter-term tariffs would have an impact on the economy that will persist for some time after they are lifted.\n\n“That’s in large part going to be due to higher prices. The automakers do not have the profit margins to absorb a 10% to 25% tariff. That will be passed on to consumers,” Abuelsamid said, adding that vehicles are “already too expensive” for many car buyers to afford.\n\nAccording to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for a new car in December was $49,740. Abuelsamid predicts the tariff increases would impact the wholesale price on a vehicle by 18% to 20%, which then will translate to a \"20-ish-%\" increase in the price to a consumer. That means on a $49,000 car today, the price could go up by $9,800 or more, he said.\n\n\"Actually, it’ll probably be worse than that,\" Abuelsamid said. \"Supply chains are complicated and there are a number of components that cross borders a number of times.”\n\nEach time a part crosses a border, it will be taxed, he said. An example Abuelsamid gave is an automaker that he declined to name told him it gets the materials to make wire harnesses from Japan. Those materials go to Mexico to be made into the wiring harness, then those harnesses are shipped to Texas to be attached to an air bag. Those are then shipped back to the automaker's plant in Mexico to be installed into a car seat. Then the vehicle is shipped back into the United States.\n\n\"So you’re going to pay tariffs the two times it comes into the U.S. and potentially the two times it goes into Mexico,\" Abuelsamid said. \"Another example is the Ford F-Series pickups with the V8. Those V8 engines are built in Windsor, so Ford is going to pay a 25% tariff for every engine they bring into Dearborn and pay tariffs for other components that come into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico. Even if the vehicle is built here, they will have a tariff impact.\"\n\nHe said nearly all vehicles would see some tariff impact. To shift production of all parts and vehicles to the United States, Abuelsamid said takes years to do, \"which means consumers will pay for many years.\"\n\nSoft impact on prices, for now\n\nOthers see a lesser impact. Dan Ives, global head of Technology Research and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities said in a Monday research note, \"While GM, Ford and Stellantis are heavily tied to much production in these countries, we believe the supply chain can adjust to a near-term shock and weather the storm.\"\n\nIves said if tariffs stay in place for 30 to 60 days, it should have minimal impact on GM and Ford. But if tariffs last longer than 90 days, Ives forecasts the average transaction price on a new vehicle could rise by $1,000 to $2,000.\n\nFiorani of AutoForecast Solutions added that key models likely to be impacted the most by tariffs include the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Chrysler Pacifica, Ram 2500/3500 pickup, Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Blazer, Ford Maverick and Ford Bronco Sport.\n\n\"Other models are important, especially the EVs, but these models make up significant revenue and profits,\" Fiorani said. \"Among the most profitable vehicles from these regions are the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, which have redundant production facilities in the U.S. Production of these two trucks will continue, despite parts coming from Canada, to maintain a level of inventory, but that, too, will begin to slide.\"\n\nHe said in the short term, sticker prices won’t change in the hope that the trade issues will be brief, but as supplies of these models slip, transaction prices will rise.\n\n\"Large enough inventories of most vehicles will keep consumers and dealers happy for a few weeks, but before the end of February, should the issue remain, we will see shortages of popular models,\" Fiorani said. \"Canada’s largest U.S. trading partners include Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky, and those states make up more than 50% of U.S. vehicle production.\"\n\nPrepare for significant layoffs\n\nIn the United States, 15.9 new vehicles were sold in 2024. If tariffs erode those sales by about 2 million vehicles, Abuelsamid would expect to see 15% to 20% of all U.S. autoworkers to be laid off. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were about 1.1 million motor vehicle and parts manufacturing jobs as of December. That means 165,000 or more people could lose their jobs.\n\n“It’s going to mean significant layoffs,\" Abuelsamid said. \"And, for every automaker job, there are seven other jobs that depend on those.\"\n\nIn addition, many of the smaller suppliers that make parts for bigger suppliers are already under pressure to lower costs.\n\n\"A lot of these are smaller companies. They cannot afford to absorb these extra costs,\" Abuelsamid said. \"So you will see a lot of them go out of business.\"\n\nA big blow to Michigan\n\nIf there's any doubt to that, Hicks has studied the impact from Trump's 10% tariff he put on China during his first term in office, which President Joe Biden left in place. It took about six months before the United States saw the first impacts on costs rising on goods from China and a loss of jobs across all types of U.S. manufacturing and agriculture.\n\nHis data showed that in January 2017, Michigan had 617,000 manufacturing jobs. By the time the tariffs hit in March 2018, there were 627,000 manufacturing jobs with employment hitting a peak in December of that year at 633,900. But that would be the last time Michigan saw that level of employment in manufacturing.\n\n\"In January 2020, the last month before the COVID pandemic hit, there were 619,000 manufacturing jobs in Michigan,\" Hicks said. \"So the Trump administration had effectively killed off all the manufacturing job growth by the month before COVID and that was due to tariffs.”\n\nAuto industry sales had slowed substantially and the Midwest was at the cusp of a recession, but COVID-19 masked the impact of the tariffs, and Hicks said, \"That tariff was nothing compared to what we are seeing being proposed.”\n\nHe said Michigan imports some $300 billion worth of goods between Canada and Mexico each year. so tariffs that run from one to six months would result in the loss of many jobs. It will also cause people to put off buying cars, homes or doing home improvement since a lot of lumber comes from Canada. All of it impacts Michigan's economy.\n\n“Last time (in 2018), you lost 15,000 manufacturing jobs, and that was just with tariffs of 10% on China. So you would expect this to be much worse. China is a far-off trading partner. Now you’re talking about your most profitable trading partners who are buying a ton of stuff,\" Hicks said. \"This isn’t going to do anything to make Michigan great again.”\n\nHeaded for a major recession\n\nU.S. Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Birmingham, said on MSNBC on Monday morning that the \"draconian tariffs\" Trump threatened to impose on Canada feel more like a tax on Michiganders and the fallout will be severe.\n\n\"We’re looking at increased cost to consumers,\" Stevens said. \"I have spent the weekend ... talking about what is going to happen to plants, Michigan automotive plants. I’ll tell ya, I’m hearing some are going to shut down. This is a tough moment for us. Sometimes tariffs can be used in a strategic and coordinated way, but on our best trading partner, that is going to hurt us here in Michigan.\"\n\nStevens, who worked on former President Barack Obama's auto task force in 2009 that helped guide General Motors and then-Chrysler Corp. through bankruptcy, said she knows the auto industry well and it does not need any disruptions right now.\n\n\"People are working so darn hard, they’re putting the world on wheels,\" Stevens said. \"Now, all of sudden, we’re going to say, 'Hey we have to stop manufacturing for today because we don’t have trade at the level we used to with Canada.' They buy Michigan goods. We sell into Canada.\"\n\nStevens said the Democrats are prepared to fight, accusing the Trump administration of acting unilaterally without the consent of Congress.\n\nIf Trump does enact the tariffs, the economic impact will resonate from the auto industry across the economy to grocery prices and even housing prices given much of the softwood lumber used in framing new houses comes from Canada, said Abuelsamid.\n\n\"It’s going to be really, really bad for the U.S. economy,\" Abuelsamid said. \"We’re going to have a major recession here in the United States if this continues.”\n\nJamie L.

As part of the news, Trump announced a 26% tariff on imports from India and a 34% tariff on imports from China and a 20% tariff on imports from the European Union.\n\nJust how high sticker prices will go on new cars and trucks is anybody's best guess once the auto industry adjusts to the steep tariffs that the president put into place starting April 3. Tariffs on auto parts will hit no later than May 3.\n\nIt's important to note that estimates are just that, estimates. We don't know what we don't know just yet as this whole tariff saga unfolds.\n\nWide range of price hikes likely on cars, SUVs and trucks\n\nThe East Lansing-based Anderson Economic Group released a revised estimate last week, which spells out a wide range of potential tariff-related costs for some cars, SUVs and trucks.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe extra tariff-related cost is estimated to range from $2,500 to $4,000 for some small crossovers, sedans, and one midsize SUV assembled in the United States, according to the report. The Honda Civic and Honda Odyssey had high U.S. content and one of the lowest tariff costs in the group. The Chevy Malibu, VW Jetta and Ford Explorer are also in this group, but the Anderson report said those vehicles were less impacted by tariffs.\n\nYet we could see a $5,000 to $8,500 jump in costs due to tariffs, the report noted, when it comes to many midsize vehicles, including a passenger van, an SUV, and some pickup trucks. Some Jeep, Ram and Toyota truck models are in this category, as are the Chrysler Pacifica van and the Ford Bronco Sport.\n\nThe tariff impact would climb to $10,000 to $12,000 per vehicle for the expensive, large SUVs that include models assembled in the United States with parts from Canada, Mexico and Europe. Some electric vehicles could see an impact of $15,000 or more. Models in this group include the Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon, Cadillac Escalade and BMW X5, as well as the Ford Mach-e.\n\nTrump tariffs are here: Why these people are buying new cars now\n\nThe Anderson Economic Group pointed out that list prices and content on vehicles in the large SUV category vary considerably, as will the tariff impact on specific models.\n\nPatrick Anderson, CEO of the Anderson Economic Group consulting firm in East Lansing, Michigan, told the Detroit Free Press that the cost of tariffs will be a bad story from the consumer's perspective.\n\n\"It's a huge amount of money that gets imposed on consumers and producers in one year.\"\n\nThe group says that the U.S. consumer impact is estimated at $30 billion for first full year. And Anderson said the cost could even be as high as $70 billion if you factor in the added costs that manufacturers, dealers and others will take on due to auto-related tariffs.\n\nAnderson said manufacturers are going to be doing their best to insulate consumers as much as possible, and not just raise prices based on the full cost increase due to tariffs.\n\nBut he said he'd expect that prices will go up soon. Higher prices could hit in-demand models within a month, according to the report. When dealers have a substantial inventory of a given model, though, cost increases could be delayed by two months or more.\n\nLuxury will mean an even more luxurious price tag, as high-end sedans, SUVs and sports vehicles could face a potential tariff exceeding $20,000 based on this report. The group includes vehicles manufactured by Audi, BMW, Jaguar-Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Genesis and Lexus.\n\nAnderson said he'd expect automakers to pass most, if not all, the higher tariff costs onto well-off consumers who are already willing to spend more than $150,000 on some premium brands. Many of those consumers know what they want, he said, and they could very well be willing to pay more.\n\nManufacturers can be expected to absorb some, but not all, of the tariff costs in the first year, Anderson said. But eventually, he said, manufacturers will adjust production and shift nearly the entire costs of the tariffs onto consumers.\n\nAll isn't certain, though, as to what happens next when it comes to pricing and production.\n\nUncertainty remains on some specifics relating to auto parts\n\nGabriel Ehrlich, director of the University of Michigan's Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics, said that many unknowns remain relating to auto tariffs, even though Trump's March 26 proclamation calls for a 25% tariff on imported autos that were applied on April 3.\n\nWhat remains unclear is what specific parts and components now built outside of the United States might end up being exempt from tariffs, Ehrlich said. Trump's 25% tariffs on automobile parts are due to take effect no later than May 3, according to the president's proclamation.\n\nEhrlich said it also remains unclear how much negotiation will be involved in the days ahead to avoid or deal with retaliatory tariffs from other countries.\n\nSome automobile parts could qualify for special tariff treatment if they qualify for preferential treatment under the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, will need to establish a process to apply the tariff exclusively to the value of the non-U.S. content of such automobile parts, according to the president's proclamation.\n\nMichigan's economy likely to feel the squeeze\n\nMichigan's manufacturing base, Ehrlich said, could benefit over time as some automobile assembly and the production of auto parts return to the United States. But that rebuilding would take time.\n\nEven so, he said, the net effect for Michigan's economy is likely to be negative as producers and consumers take on added costs, and other countries retaliate with their own higher tariffs on U.S. goods. Short-run disruptions could also be particularly difficult as supply chains take time to adjust, he said.\n\nWhile some scenarios exist where the net effect for Michigan could be positive, Ehrlich said, the realistic possibility of trade retaliation from other countries would be damaging and contribute significantly to a net negative for Michigan.\n\nAuto suppliers unlikely to make big moves back to United States\n\nDan Sharkey, a local attorney whose firm represents roughly 90 auto suppliers from multinational suppliers to small shops, said he would not expect any auto suppliers with plants in Mexico or Canada to simply decide to close huge facilities and build factories in Kentucky, Michigan or elsewhere in the country.\n\nSharkey, a co-founder of the Brooks Wilkins Sharkey & Turco law firm in Birmingham, said auto suppliers must factor in that it can take two or three years to realistically move operations to a new factory in the United States.\n\nBy then, he said, those business owners would have about a year left under the Trump administration. Trump cannot run for a third term under the limits set in the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"And who knows what the new rules are going to be?\" he said.\n\n\"This is the environment we're in,\" he said, \"where things change by the hour.\"\n\nWhat some companies might do, he said, is take a tool from a Mexico plant now and send that work back to their factory that already exists in the United States. \"Just put it on a truck, transport it, and in a couple weeks, you get approved, and you're making parts,\" Sharkey said.\n\nIt's a much smaller economic impact than moving entire operations from one country back to the United States.\n\n\"I've not heard of a single supplier who said 'Yeah, I'm gonna pick up this entire plant or this entire facility, shut it down and rebuild a new one in the U.S. because I've got to jump because President Trump said I've got to jump,’ \" Sharkey said.\n\nWhat auto suppliers are more likely to do, he said, is max out their U.S. production. And they're going to pass along those costs to manufacturers, who will pass along costs to consumers.\n\n\"I don't know of a single supplier who says 'I can pay a 25% tariff. No problem,'\" Sharkey said.\n\nNo doubt, consumers will pay more as the tariffs continue. Exactly how much more for each vehicle we will find out over time. But the early reviews aren't looking good.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

Key automobile parts, like engines, transmissions, powertrain parts and electrical components also fall under the tariff.\n\nImporters protected by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement will only be subject to the tariff for the foreign parts that make up their vehicles. Signed in 2020, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement replaced the North America Free Trade Agreement, more commonly known as NAFTA. The agreement, like NAFTA, supports mutually-beneficial trade among the three countries.\n\nWhich automakers will be affected the most?\n\nAutomakers that import a higher percentage of vehicles and auto parts will be affected the most.\n\nToyota, Hyundai and Nissan import more than 50% of their vehicles and General Motors imports about 49%, Bank of America research analyst John Murphy shared in a note last week.\n\nFord will fare a bit better, as the automaker imports about 20% of its vehicles, Murphy added. As for Tesla, which manufactures its cars in the U.S. and is run by Trump's right-hand man Elon Musk, the company is also expected to be affected less.\n\nHow will auto tariffs affect consumers?\n\nMassive tariff increases could be \"highly disruptive\" to North American vehicle production, Cox Automobile Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke said during a sales forecast call last week. He added that consumers may feel a disruption by mid-April, as some companies may hike up their prices.\n\nAs for where consumers may feel the effects, prices are expected to increase \"across the board,\" Ivan Drury, director of insights at automobile research site Edmunds. This includes new and used cars, maintenance costs and insurance premiums, as accidents involving new parts would be more costly.\n\nAs of February, a new car was estimated to cost about about $48,000, Kelley Blue Book reported. Murphy said car prices could go up as much as $10,000 but around $4,500 is more likely.\n\nContributing: Bailey Schulz, Bart Jansen and Joey Garrison, USA TODAY\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

Five of the top 10 players have had significant stints at the game’s highest level already, only to return to the minor leagues for a little more shine.\n\nThis year, they should be ready to sparkle on the diamond.\n\nThe list is topped by Tampa Bay Rays infielder Junior Caminero, who received big league looks each of the past two seasons yet remains eligible under our criteria – that he received more minor league plate appearances or innings pitched last year than his major league career total.\n\nThat’s why this list isn’t necessarily the top 100 prospects in the game, although dozens are on here. Rather, it’s a combination of both current role in the organization and future impact on the game.\n\nThat’s why a top prospect buried deep on this list may be heading it up in 2026. They are ranked in order of anticipated impact this season:\n\nThe Rays have meticulously integrated Caminero, 21, into their lineup and this season, it’s all systems go. A seven-game 2023 debut and 43-game cameo in 2024 mixed with trips to finishing school in Class AAA created a ready-made star with a .921 career minor league OPS set to bat in the middle of Tampa Bay’s lineup.\n\nAfter a much-anticipated debut fizzled into a 2-for-34 showing with 18 strikeouts, Holliday showed much better in his second stint with Baltimore, hitting five homers in 172 plate appearances and making better contact. At 21, he’s now stronger and steadier and seems primed for the big season many anticipated for him one year ago.\n\n3. RHP Rōki Sasaki, Dodgers\n\nIt wasn’t a surprise that the Japanese phenom chose to sign with Los Angeles, but it’s left to be seen how the Dodgers will manage Sasaki’s workload in his first year stateside. ​​Sasaki, 23, had a 2.10 ERA with 505 strikeouts in 64 NPB games since 2021, making his debut as a 19-year-old for the Chiba Lotte Marines.\n\nThe minors’ fastest-rising prospect, Campbell began his first full season of pro ball in High-A and finished as USA TODAY Sports’ Minor League Player of the Year. Over 115 games at three minor league levels, Campbell, 22, hit a combined .330/.439/.558 with 20 homers and 24 stolen bases. He did all that while playing second base, shortstop, third base and all three outfield spots. Versatility could provide him a pathway the majors, perhaps for opening day. He’s split his time this spring between left field and second base, but he could easily force his way into everyday at-bats.\n\nAfter two seasons in the minors in which he played at every level, Crews, the second overall pick in 2023, looks ready to be a mainstay in the majors. He made his MLB debut last season and batted just .218 in 31 games, but the 23-year-old’s overall skill set is hard to match. Hitting the ball harder – he did so just 45% of the time last year – and in the air (56.4% groundball rate) would thrust him toward NL Rookie of the Year frontrunner status.\n\n“The sky’s the limit for him,’’ said captain Aaron Judge. We’ll get a chance to see him from opening day as the long-heralded Yankees prospect, 22, enters 2025 as the Yankees’ starting left fielder. The power and speed (.816 OPS, 102 steals in 353 minor league games) are apparent. He also has the plate discipline the Yankees covet.\n\nThe loss of outfielder Anthony Santander to free agency is a big win for Kjerstad's opportunity this season. He will compete for at-bats in the outfield and at DH and has a .351 OBP in 147 career major league plate appearances. Over his three seasons in the minors, over four levels, he hit .304 with 42 home runs, 153 RBI.\n\nJust 20, Anthony is knocking on the door to the majors and could begin the season in Boston if starting right fielder Wilyer Abreu isn’t 100% healthy. Anthony finished last season at Class AAA Worcester (Mass.), hitting .344/.463/.519 in 35 games and making a strong case that he’s ready for the next level.\n\nThe Cubs’ trade of Isaac Paredes created an opportunity for Shaw – the 13th overall pick in the 2023 draft – to be the Cubs’ opening day third baseman. He’s shown steady improvement throughout his rise through the minors, posting a .395 on-base percentage and .534 slugging in 35 games last season after being promoted to Class AAA.\n\n10. SS Jacob Wilson, Athletics\n\nThe sixth overall pick in 2023, Wilson, 22, hit .433 in 208 at-bats in the minors last season, flying through the minors to the Athletics lineup. He’s the opening day shortstop for the club’s first year in Sacramento.\n\nIncumbent Sean Murphy suffered a cracked rib on a hit-by-pitch last month, so Baldwin, barring any late-spring signing of a veteran, is projected to be Atlanta’s opening day catcher. The arrival might certainly be accelerated but the pedigree is there, as Baldwin is a consensus top-50 prospect. The 23-year-old is coming off a strong 2024 season where he batted .298 with 12 home runs and an .891 OPS in Class AAA.\n\nThe seventh overall pick in 2023 out of Wake Forest, the 22-year-old right-hander rode the fast track to the majors last season – starting at High-A and ending with six starts in the majors. Lowder posted a sparkling 1.17 ERA over his 30 ⅔ innings with the Reds and is a serious candidate for the opening day rotation, despite some elbow soreness he experienced this offseason.\n\nAcquired from the Orioles for Trevor Rogers, Norby hit seven homers with 17 RBI in 36 games for the Marlins and will be the team’s opening day third baseman. He’s got power (70 minor-league homers with an .860 OPS), will have a long leash and it wouldn’t be surprising to see him as Miami’s All-Star representative.\n\nSugano, 35, spent his entire 12-year career playing with the Yomiuri Giants in Japan before the Orioles signed him to a one-year, $13 million deal. He is a decorated pitcher from Japan: a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award - Japan’s Cy Young - a three-time Central League MVP and an eight-time All-Star. For now he has the inside track on a rotation slot after an impressive spring and an injury to right-hander Grayson Rodriguez.\n\nThe game’s consensus top pitching prospect finished 2024 in the Tigers’ playoff bullpen and will end spring training on the bubble for one of their rotation spots. But Jobe, 22, will start many games in Detroit this year, toting a career 10.1 strikeouts per nine innings and 1.14 WHIP.\n\nThe Jeff McNeil injury opens a path to regular playing time for Ronald’s brother, who had been competing for a bench role. The Mets weren't expecting much offensively of Acuña when he was promoted at age 22 last season, but the 5-foot-8 infielder hit .308 with three homers and a .966 OPS in 39 at-bats, going on to play in nine postseason games.\n\nBlessed with exceptional speed, Scott made his MLB debut last season, but was overmatched at the plate (.179/.219/.283 slash line in 155 plate appearances) and couldn’t get on base enough to utilize his greatest asset. The 24-year-old has been much more successful at the plate this spring, even showing a little extra-base pop. He’s looking like the favorite for the Cardinals’ starting job in center field.\n\nAfter a three-start glimpse to end 2024, Burke, 25, will be the White Sox’s opening-day starter. A third-round pick in 2021, Burke’s ceiling may be mid-rotation starter, particularly if he cleans up command issues that saw him walk 4.9 batters per nine innings over four minor league seasons.\n\nThe Pirates have the makings of an exciting young rotation if and when Chandler, 22, joins Paul Skenes and Jared Jones. It may not be long after he threw nearly 120 innings between Class AA and AAA last season. He can touch 100 mph with his fastball and is competing for a rotation spot this spring.\n\nThings could be lighting up for “Big Christmas.” After his 13-homer debut and postseason hero turn, the club dealt first baseman Josh Naylor to Arizona, and now Noel will share first base with Kyle Manzardo. He should get at-bats in the outfield, too, where his big arm plays well; cutting his 31.8% strikeout rate would let his elite exit velocity – he clocked 115.4 mph on his second major league home run – play even more.\n\nAcquired from the Yankees in the Devin Williams trade, the speedy Durbin, 25, set an Arizona Fall League record with 29 stolen bases. He’s among the favorites to be Milwaukee’s starting third baseman.\n\nThe eighth overall pick last year, Moore clubbed 34 homers in 72 games for Tennessee and then hit .347 in 20 minor-league games in his pro debut. Already knocking on the door to Anaheim, he needs to be added to the 40-man roster. If Moore isn’t in the majors on opening day, he won’t be down for long with the Angels in need of offense.\n\nHe’s touched Class AAA for just four games in 2023, but Williams, 21, may not need much more of an internship. Williams projects as a potential 20-20 guy in the major leagues and has a .353 OPB and .821 OPS marks in his minor league career.\n\nNo current vacancy at Target Field for Rodriguez, especially since the 22-year-old has never played more than 99 games in a minor league season due to various injuries. He should stick in center field and has a tantalizing combo of power and speed, and good health could get him to Minnesota sometime this season.\n\nA consensus top 15 prospect as recently as 2024, Montgomery, 23, saw his star dim a bit after batting .213 with a .381 OPS in a full year at Class AAA. But opportunity has arrived on the South Side and Montgomery should soon get a long runway to establish himself as the everyday shortstop.\n\nThe 33rd overall pick in 2021, Black, 24, appeared in 18 games last season for the Brewers, hitting just .204 with a .561 OPS. However, he has shown an excellent eye at the plate throughout his minor league career and he stole 47 bases at Class AA in 2023.\n\n27. INF Hyeseong Kim, Dodgers\n\nLos Angeles committed $12.5 million to the Korean import, but he’ll start the season in the minors. A left-handed hitter, the 26-year-old got some reps in center field before being optioned and should get called up early in the season if he can handle the bat at Class AAA.\n\nMatthews, 24, is the ultimate control artist, walking just 22 batters in 205 ⅓ minor league innings. He got roughed up – a 6.69 ERA in nine starts - in the Twins rotation at the end of last year, but was at a career high for innings and came into camp touching 97 mph. Matthews should start the year as the Twins’ sixth rotation option and will figure into it soon.\n\nWhat looked like a white flag trade – dealing veteran starter Jack Flaherty to the Dodgers – instead netted the Tigers their starting shortstop into the playoffs. And now Sweeney, 24, is ready to hold down the role full time. He didn’t hit much – four homers and a .642 OPS in a 36-game, 119-plate appearance debut – but has 20-steal potential and should catch the ball proficiently.\n\nTeam’s top pitching prospect, 24, moved through four minor-league levels last season, culminating with four starts at Class AAA. Will likely need more minor league experience and will need to be added to the 40-man roster before he gets the call to St. Louis.\n\nJung, who made his MLB debut last year, entered camp as the favorite to be the opening day third baseman but was optioned after going 4-for-33 in Grapefruit League play. The 24-year-old will get some more seasoning and be back in the majors soon, but will really need to make the most of an opportunity when it presents itself.\n\nEntering his ninth season with the organization, Ornelas, 24, is making a strong case to make the 26-man roster. A .297 hitter with 23 home runs last year in Class AAA El Paso, the hulking 6-foot-3 outfielder could be an early-season callup at the least.\n\n33. 2B Nick Yorke, Pirates\n\nOnce a highly regarded Red Sox prospect, the Pirates acquired Yorke, 22, last year and he saw action in 11 games split between second base and outfield. He might’ve been a candidate for the starting left field job if the Pirates hadn’t signed veteran Tommy Pham.\n\n34. SS Marcelo Mayer, Red Sox\n\nThe fourth overall pick in the 2021 draft, Mayer, 22, has battled injuries throughout his four seasons in the minors. As a result, his production has been uneven and his prospect status has dimmed somewhat. He’ll likely open the season at Class AAA Worcester, but be just a Trevor Story injury away from making his MLB debut.\n\n35. INF Thomas Saggese, Cardinals\n\nA fast-rising prospect who can play three infield positions, Saggese hit 20 homers at Class AAA Memphis last year and earned a late-season call-up. He raised his stock by putting up a 1.118 OPS over 82 plate appearances in the Arizona Fall League but will start the regular season at Class AAA Memphis.\n\nBeck, 23, has a chance to play right away and stick in the outfield at Coors Field on a team looking at a number of young players. His high strikeout rate (110 in 384 plate appearances in 2024 between the majors and minors) could hold him back from doing too much damage there.\n\nRight-hander was a first-round pick in 2021 (18th overall) who was outstanding in his four appearances for the Cardinals. In 23 major league innings, he posted a 1.96 ERA with an 18:2 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 23 innings. McGreevy, 24, made the Cardinals sweat their opening-day rotation with a strong spring, but will be, likely, the first man up from Class AAA.\n\nManzardo debuted May 6 but couldn’t make much impact in 156 plate appearances, with a .234/.282/.421 line with five homers. Like Noel, Josh Naylor’s trade to Arizona opens up at least a part-time role and the 24-year-old must seize it.\n\nMayo, at 6 feet 5, 230 pounds, is one of the best power hitting prospects in baseball. He dominated Class AAA to begin 2024 but went 0-for-15 with 10 strikeouts after a major league call-up, and with sporadic opportunities had four hits in 41 at-bats with 22 strikeouts overall. He may have little choice but to adjust to that pattern; his 54 minor-league homers the past two seasons leave little to prove at that level, but a loaded Orioles infield likely leaves only spot chances to shine in Baltimore.\n\nMartinez, 23, was suspended 80 games last June for violating MLB's performance-enhancing drug policy, just two days after his big league debut. The international free agent was one of the best power-hitting infield prospects in the minor leagues. He hit 16 home runs in 63 games at Class AAA. Over the three previous seasons, he hit 86 home runs.\n\nAn 11th-round pick in 2022, Dana reached the majors last season after dominating Class AAA with a 2.52 ERA in 23 starts. The 21-year-old’s fastball sits in the mid-90s and his slider has become a plus pitch in the minors. Dana got knocked around in his 2025 cup of coffee and will start the season in the minors, ultimately competing for a roster spot with with Sam Aldegheri\n\nThe Garrett Crochet trade ripped Teel from Boston’s Big Four prospects, making them a terrific troika and leaving Teel with opportunity, albeit in a moribund organization. The Top 50 prospect has hit at every minor league level, with a career .301/.404/.444 line. With just 28 games at Class AAA, all Teel needs is time, and a callup after midseason should be in the offing.\n\nWe saw what Rice, 26, could do in a three-homer, seven-RBI game against Boston last season. He leveled off but showed more of that power potential in spring training, which could land him an opening-day roster spot and at least a time share at DH and to give Paul Goldschmidt a rest at first base.\n\nAfter a strong season in Class AAA and a promising big league debut, Wagner should impact the Blue Jays. In 24 plate appearances in the majors, he hit .305 with six doubles and two home runs. A left knee injury ended his season in mid-September, but he was playing second base on a regular basis and batting in the middle of Toronto’s lineup at the time of the injury. Wagner is the son of recently elected Hall of Famer Billy Wagner.\n\nHe converted to relief work in August, touched Tampa Bay in September and now Montgomery, 24, is poised to become a significant piece of the Rays bullpen. The lefty now touches 98 mph with a wipeout slider and could quickly move up the pecking order in the Rays’ bullpen.\n\n46. RHP Jacob Misiorowski, Brewers\n\nA 6-foot-7 right-hander with a triple-digit fastball, Misiorowski can strike out batters in bunches. However, his control (5.5 BB/9 in 2024) leaves a little to be desired and is what may keep him from being a starter in the majors. Moving up to Class AAA midway through last season, he began pitching out of the bullpen, where his fastball and overpowering slider formed a deadly combination.\n\nA consensus top 15 prospect, Basallo’s bat could force the Orioles to get him to Baltimore soon. The 20-year-old has impressed manager Brandon Hyde with his prodigious power displays and makeup this spring, after a 2024 season where he hit 19 homers and 25 doubles as a 19-year-old in Class AA and AAA.\n\nThe two-time first-round pick from Vanderbilt made his long-awaited debut in September and appears on track to start the season in the rotation with injuries to Jon Gray and Cody Bradford. He has had two arm surgeries (shoulder and Tommy John) but dominated the minors last season (1.96 ERA, 55 strikeouts in 36 ⅔ innings) with a 99-mph fastball, hard curveball, slider and changeup. Rocker, 25, still needs to prove his stuff plays across the majors.\n\nPainter missed almost all of 2023 and 2024 due to Tommy John elbow surgery and since 2021 has thrown just 125 ⅓ innings. However, his return last year in the Arizona Fall League showed that he looked like his pre-injury dominant self, throwing between 97-100 mph. While the Phillies boast pitching depth now, he could certainly be a mid- to late-season callup to bolster their staff in any fashion.\n\nThere’s not nearly as much doubt Del Castillo, 25, will hit in the major leagues as he will be able to adequately play his position. While he had an .893 OPS in a 25-game big league sample size in 2024 and pounded Class AAA pitching, he only threw out 2 of 29 runners who attempted to steal against him for Arizona. He’ll start in Class AAA and has gone to work on his throwing, transfers and footwork. “If I was going to bet on somebody, I’d bet on him,” bench coach Jeff Banister told the Arizona Republic.\n\nRodriguez has hit 40 home runs over 165 games at Class AAA Columbus, so there’s clearly little to prove at that level. Rodriguez, 25, did reach Cleveland for 13 games early last season but for the moment, there’s no role for him. That could change if any number of platoon guys struggle with the Guardians.\n\nHe received call-ups each of the past two seasons, but opportunity may never be better than now. With Spencer Strider still building back up from Tommy John surgery and expected No. 5 starter Ian Anderson struggling this spring, Smith-Shawver’s capable but not dominant Grapefruit League showing has kept the 22-year-old in the mix for a rotation spot. He’s struck out 12.1 batters per nine innings in 57 minor league starts.\n\n53. OF Kevin Alcántara, Cubs\n\nNicknamed “The Jaguar,” the 6-foot-6 outfielder made it to the majors last September. While Alcántara’s power is still developing and the addition of Kyle Tucker boxed him out of a potential everyday role for now, the 22-year-old could become a valuable bench option and part-timer in 2025.\n\n54. C/OF, Dalton Rushing, Dodgers\n\nHit 26 homers with 85 RBI in Classes AA and AAA last season and spent time in left field with his pathway behind the plate to Los Angeles obviously blocked by Will Smith. The Dodgers’ outfield alignment could be fluid this year and his ability to fill in at catcher and first base will work to the 24-year-old’s advantage.\n\nInjuries to Parker Meadows and Matt Vierling likely won’t nudge Malloy, 25, to Detroit for Opening Day, but he’s for now the lone minor league outfielder on the 40-man roster and got a 230-plate appearance look last year, during which he hit eight homers but struck out 37% of the time. Will be up at points this season.\n\nLawlar, the sixth overall pick in the 2021 draft, should have a spot in the team’s future if he proves himself over more than a handful of games in Class AAA. The question is where he will play this season, with Geraldo Perdomo established at his primary position (shortstop) and Ketel Marte (second base) and Eugenio Suarez (third) manning the two other spots Lawlar has played in the minors. If Lawlar, 22, continues to hit (1.030 OPS in 12 Class AAA games during an injury-shortened season) he could force himself into at least a time share.\n\n57. RHP Thomas Harrington, Pirates\n\nAnother of Pittsburgh’s exciting young pitchers, Harrington, 23, made it all the way to Class AAA last season, pitching to a 3.33 ERA in eight starts. That’s where he’ll likely open 2025 since he hasn’t yet been added to the 40-man roster.\n\nNikhazy, 24, struck out a batter an inning in 24 starts at Class AA and AAA last season and nearly snagged a spot in Cleveland’s opening-day bullpen. But his present and future is as a starter, and after a stretch-out period in Columbus, will be poised should any openings arise in Cleveland.\n\n59. RHP Cade Horton, Cubs\n\nThe Cubs’ top pitching prospect was shut down last season due to a sprained shoulder but the seventh overall pick in 2022 has looked sharp this spring. Horton, 23, isn’t on the 40-man roster and is a bit further back in the queue itching to get to the majors, but he should be up at some point in 2025.\n\n60. OF Rece Hinds, Reds\n\nBig-time power prospect made an instant impact in his MLB debut last season, hitting five home runs in his first six games. However, Hinds, 24, has some gaping holes in his swing, with just a 58% contact rate at Class AAA Louisville last season.\n\nThe second-round pick in 2023 has made a speedy rise through Minnesota’s system, hardly slowed by August Tommy John surgery. Keaschall, 22, had 15 homers and 23 steals at high A and AA last year, and owns a .419 career OBP. A call-up this season is well within reach, particularly with any injury disruption on the Twins infield.\n\nOgasawara, 27, signed as an international free-agent in January. He had been pitching in Nippon Professional Baseball since 2016. The Nats were hoping he could be a ready-made starter coming from Japan, but he has had a tough spring and will likely need more time to develop. While the Nats signed him with the intent of him being a starter, he has a 50-50 shot, at best, to make the rotation and could convert to a reliever.\n\nBloss was traded with Will Wagner by the Astros as a part of the Yusei Kikuchi deal last July. He opened the season in High-A in 2024, but blew through three levels to reach the big leagues. In three MLB starts, he went 0-1 with a 6.94 ERA. He projects to be a quality No. 5 starter ready to contribute in 2025.\n\n64. C/1B Moisés Ballesteros, Cubs\n\nHit 19 homers between Class AA and AAA with an .826 OPS and while defensive limitations may force a move to first base, the 21-year-old’s bat will play in the majors.\n\nThe 24-year-old is said to have one of the best changeups in the minors. Was knocked around in Class AAA (5.93 ERA in 25 starts) last season and is somewhat buried in San Francisco's depth chart, but the lefty should make it to the majors at some point in 2025.\n\nAlvarez is a right-handed hitter that has well-above-average contact skills. But his first stint in the majors produced a 3-for-30 performance in eight games before returning to the minors. Alvarez will most likely begin at Class AAA, where he hit 10 homers with an .864 OPS in 64 games last season.\n\nThe Mets rotation has been dinged by injuries in spring training but the club's top prospect sitting in Class AAA is a big reason they're confident about pitching depth. “This is a guy that, stuff-wise, is right there with anybody,” manager Carlos Mendoza said of Sproat, who had a 3.40 ERA with 131 strikeouts across three levels last season.\n\nYesavage, 21, has yet to make his professional debut, but he should be quick to the majors. The 20th overall pick last season was a combined 18-2 his final two seasons at East Carolina, with a 2.61 ERA, 1.000 WHIP and 13.3 strikeouts per nine innings.\n\nAfter Andrés Giménez’s trade to Toronto, Brito, 23, had a path to the second base job in Cleveland, but got off to a 1-for-19 start in Cactus League play and has minor-league options, which others competing for the job do not. Still, the organization’s seventh-ranked prospect is coming off a breakout Class AAA performance, with 21 homers and an .807 OPS, and the long-term job is still very much in play.\n\nHe has just one career home run in 1,041 career minor league plate appearances – yet might be the fastest player in baseball. Simpson, 24, was clocked at 30.4 mph sprint speed this spring and stole 104 bases at Class AA and A in 2024, batting .355. Will his no-power game translate to the AL East? It will be fun to watch when the Rays decide to find out.\n\nThe Rockies are always looking for arms, and Blalock did enough this spring to warrant a hard look early this season after a six-start stint in Colorado last season. Blalock, 24, has cut down on his walk rate this spring after issuing 19 in 29 ⅔ innings for the Rockies last season. He’ll have to keep up his improved strikeout rate, too, to be effective at Coors Field.\n\n72. OF Denzel Clarke, Athletics\n\nClarke, who turns 25 in May, tore up the Arizona Fall League, hitting .382 with 30 hits, 13 RBI and nine steals in 19 games but is yet to play in Class AAA. Already on the 40-man roster and a stellar defender in center, Clarke should play his way to Sacramento.\n\nSmith, a first-round draft pick last season, came to Houston as a prized portion of the Kyle Tucker offseason trade. Smith, 22, was tearing it up at the plate in spring training and making a push to make the roster early in the season, if not by opening day. Over 32 minor league games last season, he has a 1.004 OPS with seven homers, 20 runs and 24 RBI.\n\nThe first-round pick in 2022 reached Class AA for 124 games last season, hitting .271 with a .759 OPS. He’ll start in Class AAA and look to get a call-up at some point. Young, 21, progressed most defensively last season, according to MLB Pipeline, though he won’t help Seattle much in the needed pop department.\n\nStill recovering from ACL surgery in January 2024, Mauricio has had some setbacks and is yet to appear in a spring training game. Assuming he gets back on the field, the 23-year-old could be a versatile bench option for the Mets down the stretch and into October.\n\nRoden, 25, a third-round pick in 2022, had a slash line of .293/.391/.475 with 16 home runs and 75 RBI in 126 games between Class AA and AAA in 2024. Roden has backed that up with a strong spring, with eight hits and two homers in his first 17 at-bats.\n\nThe White Sox have perhaps the two best lefty starter prospects in the game, and Schultz, 21, should be ready to roll by year’s end. Gotta love this combo – a 0.95 WHIP and 12 strikeouts per nine innings in his minor league career. Yet his season high in innings is just 88 1/3, and with Chicago in rebuild mode, Schultz figures to spend almost all of this season at Class AAA.\n\nThe 2022 first-round draft pick may not quite be ready for the Bronx, but he’s getting close. He has hit 20 homers with 88 RBI and .783 OPS over two stints in Class AA. The Yankees will see what the 6-foot-6 Jones can do in Class AAA. He could be a midseason injury to a regular away from making his debut.\n\nAfter a quick ascent through the minors, Waldrep struggled in both starts after a promotion to Atlanta. Yet he did post a 3.47 ERA across four levels in his first pro season. The 23-year-old is projected to be a big league starter, but could contribute more quickly as a mid-leverage reliever.\n\nJones, 27, will start the season in Class AAA. He has an .807 OPS in 137 games there and played right and center field and second base last season. He could get an extended big-league look if he continues to produce.\n\nQuero has played almost the same number of Class AAA games – 28 to 26 – as fellow top catching prospect Kyle Teel – and their journey to the South Side will be interesting to watch. Quero, who turns 22 next month, is a year younger than Teel yet beginning his fifth professional season, toting an .849 career OPS.\n\nMcDermott got a spot start in the majors last year, the culmination of two-plus years of progress after a 2022 trade from Minnesota. He struck out 144 in 100 innings at Class AAA last year but also walked 60. A lat injury at the start of spring training will delay his chance to impact the big league rotation.\n\nHas to make some major improvements defensively if he's going to stick behind the plate, but Ramirez had 25 homers with 93 RBI and 22 steals last season. His bat should earn him playing time in Miami, be at catcher, first base or designated hitter.\n\n84. RHP Gunnar Hoglund, Athletics\n\nAcquired in the 2022 Matt Chapman trade, Hoglund is now three years removed from Tommy John surgery. While his velocity may not get back to where it was, Hoglund, 25, has improved his secondary pitches and could be one of the Athletics’ first call-ups when the need for a starter arises.\n\nWhen healthy, Cavalli has one of the top fastballs in the organization. But injuries have plagued him. He had Tommy John surgery in 2023 and experienced a dead arm and made just three minor league starts in 2024. Cavalli, 26, won’t figure in the big league plans until he can string together good health and clean starts at Class AAA.\n\n86. INF Alex Freeland, Dodgers\n\nThe 23-year-old Freeland hit 18 homers with 31 steals and a .387 OBP across three levels last season but without a spot on the 40-man roster, finds himself behind Hyeseong Kim in line to get to Dodger Stadium.\n\nBastidas, 26, tied for the most home runs in the Astros organization last season (25) to go along with 89 RBI, 15 steals and a .784 OPS for Class AAA Sugar Land. The former Yankees prospect’s speed and positional versatility also could him a leg up within the organization and make him, along with his power, a good candidate for a call-up.\n\nAcquired from the Phillies last summer, the Italian-born 23-year-old has four pitches in his arsenal and played his way to the majors at the end of 2024, striking out 134 in 19 minor-league starts.\n\nAt 5-foot-6, the 24-year-old Vaz could be construed as a modern Jose Altuve, even if he doesn’t develop Hall of Fame hitting credentials. What he will do is hit the ball: Vaz struck out just 9.6% of the time at two levels last season and offers multi-position versatility. He’s in the right organization to value his skill set.\n\nThe team’s consensus top prospect and ninth overall pick in 2023 has reached as high as Class AA, where he made nine starts last season (2.63 ERA). His heavy strikeout stuff should play if he can duplicate it at Coors Field. He could get there by the early to mid-summer.\n\n91. RHP Grant Holman, Athletics\n\nThe former starter pitched his way to the majors in 2024 with a miniscule 0.55 ERA in 40 minor-league games. Holman, 24, is set to begin the campaign in the Athletics bullpen and could earn a higher-leverage role as the season goes on.\n\nWilliamson, 24, needs to produce over a larger sample size in the high minors to get to the majors. He has played his most minor league games at third base, but has also played shortstop and second base. He did well enough at spring training to warrant a big-league look this season when he proves himself in Class AAA.\n\nOriginally drafted by the Padres, Hassell was shipped to the Nats as part of the Juan Soto trade in August 2022. He reached Class AAA in 2024 but went 8-for-64 with 17 strikeouts at Rochester. But after a third stint in the Arizona Fall League, the 23-year-old appears to have regained his footing. He's on the 40-man roster and should get an opportunity if he can continue to hit in Class AAA.\n\nMelton, a second-round pick in 2022, has played all three outfield positions in the minors while hitting 42 homers, driving in 122 runs, scoring 153 runs and stealing 81 bases over 227 games. His production and outfield versatility make him an intriguing option for Houston at some point this season. If Melton, 24, plays well at Class AAA, he won’t have much left to prove in the minors.\n\nHow quickly will the reigning 1/1 reach the big leagues? Bazzana played in just 27 games after the July draft and didn’t do the Arizona Fall League, and his first full pro season will have a lot of boxes to check. But the career .360 hitter at Oregon State is advanced offensively, and the team that drafted him is certainly deficient in that area.\n\nThe first lefty taken in the July draft – fifth overall – may not be long for the minors. Both Smith and fellow top prospect Noah Schultz lasted deep into camp. Smith, the Arkansas product, made three Class A starts after the draft and will likely start at AA, one year after striking out 17.3 batters per nine innings as a Razorback.\n\nA third-round pick out of LSU in 2023, Morgan, 22, dominated at three levels in his first full pro season, with a .324/.408/.483 line from low A to Class AA and elite control of the strike zone. Power might be the last thing to develop, but Morgan is taking outfield reps to increase versatility and perhaps shorten his path to St. Petersburg.\n\nQuero, 22, missed all of last season after tearing his labrum in the opener and needing surgery to repair it. He’s still not all the way back to full health but should be able to DH for the Brewers’ Class AAA team in Nashville when the regular season begins. An excellent defender, Quero could be ready to replace Eric Haase as the backup to William Contreras by midseason.\n\nOrtiz, 23, has big power that he has shown across all levels of the minor leagues. He was challenged more last season in Class AA, with his OPS dropping more than 200 points from Class A. He still needs to play Class AAA ball, and he’ll start there and be in position for a call-up later in the season should a need for a left-handed bat arise.\n\nHouse, the No. 11 overall pick in 2021, might still be one year away from holding down the hot corner in Washington. The Nationals signed Paul DeJong to play third, but House could accelerate his case by improving his strikeout-to-walk ratio, which was nearly 5:1 in 2024.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.

Dak Prescott delivers in final minute", "text": "The Dallas Cowboys were unable to find red-zone success during most of their \"Sunday Night Football\" game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThey changed their luck just in time to pull out a 20-17 road win.\n\nDallas scored its lone red-zone touchdown of the game in four drives on their final offensive play. Dak Prescott found Jalen Tolbert breaking across the field on fourth-and-goal, as the second-year wide-out managed to create separation from Steelers safety DeShon Elliott.\n\nElliott got caught up in traffic in the middle of the field but did everything he could to make it back to Tolbert. He got to the receiver just as the ball did and tried to rip his arm down and force the ball out.\n\nTolbert held onto the ball, completing the catch and giving Dallas the lead back with 20 seconds left in regulation.\n\nThe throw was Prescott's finest in a game where the veteran signal-caller committed several uncharacteristic mistakes. That included two, first-half turnovers in the red zone, one of which prompted CeeDee Lamb to confront Prescott on the sidelines.\n\nDespite Prescott's inconsistencies, the Cowboys largely dominated the Steelers. Dallas outgained Pittsburgh, 445-226, and the Steelers were only really able to stay in the game because of Prescott's three turnovers.\n\nThe win may have been sloppy, but the Cowboys will certainly take it. They now sit at 3-2 on the season and are just one game back of the surprising Washington Commanders in the early season NFC East race.\n\nDO YOU LIKE FOOTBALL?

Pittsburgh followed that up by trying the lateral game to try to score with zeroes on the clock, but they couldn't generate any forward momentum.\n\nThe Cowboys take the win 20-17 and improve to 3-2 on the season.\n\nCowboys 20, Steelers 17: Jalen Tolbert catches 4-yard TD pass on fourth-and-goal\n\nThe game came down to a fourth-and-goal opportunity for the Cowboys. If they converted, they would likely win. Fail, and they would lose.\n\nDak Prescott hung in the pocket on fourth down and found Jalen Tolbert breaking toward the front pylon. Tolbert had just enough separation to make the catch and Prescott placed it on him perfectly.\n\nBrandon Aubrey's extra point is good, and the Steelers will have 20 seconds to get into field-goal range to tie it up.\n\nCowboys moving ball well at 2-minute warning\n\nThe Cowboys have gone 37 yards in seven plays as they look to answer the Steelers' touchdown. Dallas is at Pittsburgh's 33-yard line and still has three timeouts left as it looks to score a go-ahead touchdown, trailing by four.\n\nSteelers 17, Cowboys 13: Pat Freiermuth catches shovel-pass TD from Justin Fields\n\nThe Steelers turn Dak Prescott's interception into a touchdown. Arthur Smith dialed up a nice call that saw Justin Fields pitch a quick shovel pass to Pat Freiermuth after faking like he would run to the left. The tight end bulled into the end-zone to give Pittsburgh the lead.\n\nChris Boswell makes the extra point and the Steelers lead by four with 4:56 left in the fourth quarter. The Cowboys have that time, and three timeouts, to make a comeback.\n\nGeorge Pickens makes critical 22-yard catch, sets up goal-to-go opportunity\n\nThe Steelers converted a fourth-and-1 earlier on their drive and got down to the 7-yard line after a catch-and-run by George Pickens. Justin Fields found him after scanning the field and the veteran wide-out, who had just one catch for eight yards before his second catch, took it down to the 14-yard line.\n\nDonovan Wilson hit Pickens late out of bounds, so that set the Steelers up for first-and-goal at the 7.\n\nJoey Porter Jr. intercepts Dak Prescott on deep pass to Jalen Tolbert\n\nThe Cowboys were moving the ball well with Rico Dowdle on the ground, but Dak Prescott decided to take a downfield shot to Jalen Tolbert. The result? He overshot his receiver and Joey Porter Jr. was able to intercept it.\n\nPorter returned the ball 16 yards to set the Steelers up at their own 35-yard line. They need a field goal to tie and a touchdown to take the lead.\n\nSteelers go three-and-out after Cowboys TD\n\nPittsburgh couldn't get anything going on offense after Dallas' TD. The Steelers go three-and-out and punt the ball back to the Cowboys.\n\nThe Steelers' drive lasted just 57 seconds after the Cowboys' most recent drive spanned 8:32 of game time.\n\nCowboys 13, Steelers 10: Dak Prescott finds Rico Dowdle for 22-yard TD\n\nThe Cowboys have re-taken the lead. On the 16th play of their 90-yard drive, Dak Prescott scrambled out to his right and just when it looked like he was going to run into open space, he found Rico Dowdle wide open in the end zone.\n\nPrescott put the throw right on the money, and Dowdle brought it in for Dallas' first TD of the day. Brandon Aubrey knocked in the extra point to give the Cowboys a 13-10 lead.\n\nSteelers take 10-6 lead into fourth quarter\n\nConnor Heyward's touchdown is the only scoring done in the third quarter. That allows the Steelers to maintain a 4-point lead heading into the final 15 minutes of the lightning-delayed \"Sunday Night Football\" game.\n\nThat said, the Cowboys are driving once again and are in the middle of a 13-play, 66-yard drive as the quarter ends. Dallas had the ball the final 7:23 of the quarter and will look to get its first touchdown of the game in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhat did CeeDee Lamb say to Dak Prescott?\n\nAfter Dak Prescott's interception at the end of the first half, CeeDee Lamb jawed at Prescott on the Dallas bench, in video captured by the NBC broadcast.\n\nIt wasn't clear exactly what the veteran wide-out said, though some amateur lip-readers noted Lamb might have been telling Prescott to throw him a \"jump ball.\" The quarterback had failed to do that when he threw the interception.\n\nSteelers punt after Justin Fields slightly overthrows George Pickens\n\nThe Steelers weren't able to score after their blocked punt. They executed a nice, 19-yard screen pass to Najee Harris, but the drive stalled after that, with Fields throwing a pass slightly too high to an open Pickens just beyond the sticks.\n\nCorliss Waitman's punt goes for a touchback, but a holding penalty on the Cowboys gives Dallas the ball on its own 10-yard line, trailing by four halfway through the third quarter.\n\nSteelers block Brandon Aubrey field goal attempt\n\nThe Cowboys got into scoring range after a 34-yard connection between Dak Prescott and Kavonte Turpin, but a T.J. Watt sack derailed the drive.\n\nDallas settled for a 38-yard field goal, but Brandon Aubrey's attempt was blocked by Isaiahh Loudermilk. That allowed the Steelers to retain their four-point lead.\n\nSteelers 10, Cowboys 6: Justin Fields finds Connor Heyward for 16-yard TD\n\nThe Steelers scored the first touchdown of the game with 11:50 left in the third quarter. Justin Fields found Heyward, the team's fullback/tight end/H-back, wide open inside the 5-yard line. Connor Heyward managed to get into the end zone before Dallas could tackle him to give Pittsburgh its first lead of the day.\n\nChris Boswell makes the extra point to give the Cowboys a 10-6 lead.\n\nJustin Fields removed from game for medical evaluation\n\nThe Cowboys were flagged for roughing the passer on the first play of the second half after Tyrus Wheat hit Justin Fields hard a beat after the Steelers quarterback released the ball.\n\nReferee Shawn Hochuli then announced there was a \"timeout for medical\" purposes, and Fields was eventually removed from the game to be evaluated for a concussion.\n\nWho is the Steelers backup quarterback?\n\nThat would be Kyle Allen. Russell Wilson remains the team's emergency third-string quarterback, so Allen, a veteran backup with his fifth organization, took over for Fields.\n\nHowever, Fields returned to the game shortly after Allen converted his lone pass, so it appears the Steelers starting QB has dodged any major injury at this time.\n\nCowboys take slim lead into halftime\n\nThe Cowboys take a 6-3 lead into the locker room, but that may not fully reflect the way Dallas dominated in the first half.\n\nThe Cowboys outgained the Steelers, 202-89, and Dallas averaged a rock-solid 6.5 yards per play. The issue? Dak Prescott had two red-zone turnovers and the team went 0-for-3 trying to score touchdowns on red-zone drives.\n\nComparatively, the Steelers never made it to the red-zone. Their only points came on a 41-yard field goal by Chris Boswell. Justin Fields is just 4-of-9 for 35 yards while Pittsburgh has combined to run for 70 yards on 18 carries.\n\nEach team will have a clear goal after halftime. The Cowboys will look to avoid red-zone mistakes while the Steelers will look for Fields to provide more of a spark to their offense, whether on the ground or through the air.\n\nDonte Jackson intercepts Dak Prescott at 1-yard line\n\nJust when it looked like the Cowboys were going to score before the half, Dak Prescott turned it over in the red-zone for the second time of the game. This time, he tried to hit CeeDee Lamb in the end-zone, but Donte Jackson undercut the route.\n\nJackson made the catch going toward the sideline but got two feet down before falling out at his own 1-yard line. The Steelers will likely just try to avoid giving up a safety with 51 seconds left in the first half.\n\nDak Prescott hits Jalen Tolbert for a 48-yard completion\n\nJust before the two-minute warning, Dak Prescott found Jalen Tolbert wide open downfield for the biggest play of the game thus far. Minkah Fitzpatrick was late rotating over to help cover Tolbert, which allowed him to flip the field and put the Cowboys in scoring range again.\n\nSteelers punt despite converting fourth down earlier in drive\n\nPittsburgh crossed midfield trying to answer Brandon Aubrey's field goal, but they stalled out a few plays after converting a fourth-and-inches from the 50-yard line.\n\nThe Steelers ran a Tush Push-type play on fourth-and-inches from to keep their drive alive. Fields dove forward after Isaac Seumalo got a nice block on Mazi Smith, but that marked the final first down of the drive.\n\nCowboys 6, Steelers 3: Brandon Aubrey makes 33-yard field goal\n\nThe Cowboys re-take the lead after Brandon Aubrey makes a 33-yard chip shot. His kick came after a drive that saw Dallas go 51 yards over eight plays, highlighted by a 27-yard completion from Dak Prescott to Jake Ferguson.\n\nWhile the Cowboys are in front, they are now 0-for-2 in the red-zone today. They also lost their starting left tackle, rookie Tyler Guyton, to an injury. He is heading to the locker room to be further evaluated.\n\nSteelers go three-and-out after turnover\n\nThe Steelers couldn't capitalize on Dallas' turnover. They went three-and-out and didn't gain a yard thanks to a false start penalty and a Justin Fields sack on third down.\n\nPittsburgh punted the ball back to Kavontae Turpin, who fair caught it at his own 33-yard line.\n\nT.J. Watt gets 100th sack, forces Dak Prescott to fumble\n\nThe Cowboys were in scoring range and facing a third-and-6 when Dak Prescott was pressured by Steelers edge rusher T.J. Watt. The veteran pass rusher wrapped Prescott up and forced a fumble that his teammate Nick Herbig chased down and recovered.\n\nThat prevented the Cowboys from attempting what would have been a makeable Brandon Aubrey field goal.\n\nThat play also ended the first quarter with the two teams tied and both offenses showing an ability to move the ball down the field. Pittsburgh and Dallas seem evenly matched after 15 minutes.\n\nCowboys, Mike McCarthy burn challenge on Justin Fields fumble, recovery\n\nDallas inexplicably decided to challenge a play in the first quarter during which Justin Fields fumbled the ball and recovered it.\n\nFields was sacked by Cowboys defensive tackle Linval Joseph and put the ball on the ground. Dallas defensive end Carl Lawson had a legitimate chance to grab the ball and jumped on top of it, but Fields somehow wormed his way over toward the ball and brought it into his chest before Lawson could secure it.\n\nFields emerged from the pile holding the ball. He clearly recovered the ball, so it remains to be seen why Mike McCarthy challenged it, especially ahead of a third-and-24.\n\nWhat's on Dak Prescott's jersey?\n\nDak Prescott has a jersey patch in the shape of the Walter Payton Man of the Year trophy. The NFL instituted the uniform decal in 2017 to honor past winners of the award.\n\nPrescott won the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in 2022 and started wearing the patch during the 2023 NFL season.\n\nCowboys forced to punt after intentional grounding call\n\nThe Cowboys endured a difficult sequence to close their second drive. Jalen Brooks appeared to make a catch for a first down, but he was ruled short of the line. Rather than wait for a review or challenge the call, the Cowboys rushing to the line to try to convert the third-and-1.\n\nDak Prescott faded back to pass but was quickly swarmed by Steelers defenders. He threw the ball away and was flagged for intentional grounding. That forced Dallas to punt back to Pittsburgh, and the Steelers will now look to score on a second consecutive drive, starting at their own 26-yard line.\n\nCowboys 3, Steelers 3: Chris Boswell makes 41-yard field goal to tie game\n\nThe Steelers answered the Cowboys' field goal drive with one of their own. Chris Boswell was called upon to try a 41-yard field goal and he managed to tuck it just inside the right upright.\n\nJustin Fields had a solid showing on the drive, running for 13 yards on two attempts and completing 2-of-4 passes for 23 yards.\n\nMarshawn Kneeland injury update\n\nKneeland, a second-round rookie who started for the Cowboys on Sunday, suffered an apparent leg injury on Dallas' first defensive drive. He was treated by the medical staff on the field and was helped to the sidelined. He was later carted off because of the injury.\n\nKneeland started because Micah Parsons and DeMarcus Lawrence were ruled out for Week 5 because of injuries. Kneeland's injury may further deplete an already thin Dallas pass rush.\n\nCowboys 3, Steelers 0: Brandon Aubrey makes 55-yard field goal to open scoring\n\nThe Cowboys get the scoring started on \"Sunday Night Football.\" Dak Prescott completed 3 of 4 passes for 20 yards before Brandon Aubrey was called upon to attempt the 55-yard field goal.\n\nAubrey had no issues with the playing surface, splitting the uprights with the 55-yarder. He is now 17 of 18 on field goal attempts from 50-plus yards during his two-year career.\n\nCowboys win coin toss, will receive\n\nDallas won the coin toss and elected to start with the ball. After a 1 hour, 25 minute delay, \"Sunday Night Football\" will begin with a Chris Boswell kickoff.\n\nSteelers vs. Cowboys field conditions\n\nThe NBC broadcast is reporting that the field is \"soaked\" from the rain. That will make players more prone to slipping than they would be on a dry field, and it seems likely to benefit the team looking to run the ball more in this matchup.\n\nThat could give the Steelers a bit more than just a home-field advantage in this contest.\n\nCeline Dion opens 'Sunday Night Football'\n\nCeline Dion, one of the world’s most iconic and successful performers in pop music history, starred in a cinematic opening sequence for tonight’s game.\n\nIn an on-camera narration set to lyrics and music from “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now,” Dion looked ahead to tonight’s Cowboys-Steelers game on \"Sunday Night Football.\"\n\nDion also had a captivating performance that concluded the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nWhen will the Steelers vs. Cowboys game start?\n\nThe NBC broadcast just revealed that the NFL is hoping kickoff will occur at 9:45 p.m. ET. The plan is for players to return to the field at 9:25 p.m. ET to warm up.\n\nThe severe weather has passed over Acrisure Stadium, and fans are beginning to return to their seats.\n\nSteelers' last weather delay\n\nPittsburgh's most recent weather delay was much more recent than Dallas'. The Steelers' Week 13 game against the Arizona Cardinals in 2023 was delayed twice by lightning, once for 30 minutes and once for 53 minutes.\n\nThe Steelers lost the game, 24-10.\n\nCowboys' last weather delay\n\nThis is Dallas' first weather delay since their Week 2 game against the Denver Broncos during the 2017 NFL season. The game was stopped in the first quarter because of a lightning strike, and the delay lasted 1 hour, 2 minutes.\n\nThe Cowboys were crushed once the game resumed, losing 42-17. Ezekiel Elliott endured one of the worst performances of his career, totaling just 8 yards on 9 carries. That was the lowest single-game rushing total of his career until he ran for just 6 yards in Week 3 of the 2024 NFL season in a 28-25 loss to the Baltimore Ravens.\n\n'Sunday Night Football' delay: Rain falls at Acrisure Stadium\n\nThe downpour officially has reached Acrisure Stadium. The heavy rain is hitting the field while the players have ducked for cover in the locker room.\n\nThere is no update about a potential start time, as there continues to be lightning in the vicinity of the stadium. The game will not start until at least 30 minutes after the final lightning strike within a certain radius of the stadium.\n\nWhy is the Steelers vs. Cowboys game delayed?\n\nThe Steelers vs. Cowboys game is delayed because of thunderstorms in the area of Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh. Players from both teams were sent to the locker room because of a lightning strike several miles away from the stadium.\n\nFans were originally allowed to remain in their seats at Acrisure Stadium, but were eventually asked to take shelter in the stadium concourses and the FedEx Great Hall.\n\nFans will have to wait a bit longer than usual for \"Sunday Night Football\" to begin. The game is in a lightning delay because of a storm nearby Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh.\n\nThere is a severe thunderstorm warning in effect in Pittsburgh, per Weather.com. The chance for rain peaks at 9 p.m. ET (89 percent), according to the forecast, at which point there will be \"Heavy Thunderstorms\" in the area.\n\nThe NFL hasn't announced how long the start of \"SNF\" might be delayed because of the inclement weather. The teams and players returned to the locker room once the delay was announced.\n\nSnoop Dogg in attendance for SNF, clad in Steelers gear\n\nSnoop Dogg is among the celebrities on hand to take in the 34th game between the Steelers and Cowboys. Snoop is a big Steelers fan despite growing up in California, as he fell in love with Pittsburgh's running game and defense watching them in the 1970s.\n\nSnoop is a frequent collaborator with NBC, so it wasn't a big surprise to see him in attendance for the SNF clash. It will be interesting to see if the network has any plans to show him or include him in the broadcast, especially with the ongoing weather delay.\n\nIs Russell Wilson playing for the Steelers?\n\nRussell Wilson is not expected to play for the Steelers on \"Sunday Night Football.\" Justin Fields will make his fifth consecutive start to open the season, a job he earned on eve of the season after Wilson suffered a calf injury.\n\nKyle Allen is backing up Fields at quarterback, while Wilson was ruled inactive for the game. He is designated as the team's emergency third-string QB, meaning he can come into the game if both Fields and Allen suffer game-ending injuries.\n\nWhat time is Cowboys at Steelers?\n\nStart time: 8:20 p.m. ET (7:20 p.m. CT)\n\nWhere is the game being played?\n\nCowboys at Steelers will kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET from Acrisure Stadium (formerly Heinz Field) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Sunday night.\n\nNFL STADIUM RANKINGS: What we love (and hate) about league's venues\n\nHow to watch Steelers vs. Cowboys\n\nTV channel: NBC\n\nThe game will air on NBC and Peacock. The game is also available to stream on Fubo.\n\nMike Tirico (play-by-play) and Cris Collinsworth (analyst) will be on the call, with Melissa Stark adding reports from the field for NBC.\n\nSteelers vs. Cowboys predictions, picks\n\nHere's how the USA TODAY Sports staff feels the Steelers-Cowboys \"SNF\" matchup will shake out.\n\nLorenzo Reyes: Steelers 18, Cowboys 14\n\nSteelers 18, Cowboys 14 Tyler Dragon: Steelers 24, Cowboys 23\n\nSteelers 24, Cowboys 23 Jordan Mendoza: Steelers 20, Cowboys 17\n\nCowboys vs. Steelers inactives: Micah Parsons officially out\n\nCowboys' inactive players:\n\nLB Micah Parsons\n\nQB Trey Lance (third QB)\n\nCB Caelen Carson\n\nRB Deuce Vaughn\n\nDE K.J.

He has a sprained ankle and he was seen earlier this week in a boot and using a scooter to protect his ankle.\n\nDepending on the severity of the injury, it could take up to 6-8 weeks for a full recovery. Dallas has a bye in Week 7 before their next \"Sunday Night Football\" game against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 8.

That represented the smallest possible salary Wilson could take, as $1.21 million is the veteran minimum for the 2024 NFL season.\n\nWilson's deal with the Steelers was viewed as a bargain and with good reason. It made him one of the league's lowest-paid quarterbacks in the NFL and one of the lowest-paid projected starters.\n\nHow much is Russell Wilson making in 2024?\n\nRussell Wilson is making $39 million for the 2024 NFL season. The Broncos are responsible for most of that sum because of the $242.5 million contract they inked with him in 2022.\n\nWilson's contract contained $124 million in guarantees. Denver had already paid $85 million of it before the 2024 NFL season, but they still had to pay the 35-year-old the rest of the guarantees as part of his release.\n\nWho are the highest paid NFL players at each position?\n\nWe have a complete list at every position:\n\nCris Collinsworth staying at NBC, signs contract extension\n\nThe No. 1 team on NBC's \"Sunday Night Football\" will stay intact, at least for the foreseeable future.\n\nAccording to a report from The Athletic, NBC Sports is close to securing a new four-year contract extension with top analyst Cris Collinsworth. The extension will keep him with the network through the 2029-30 season. His current contract runs through the 2026 season.\n\nNBC is scheduled to broadcast two more Super Bowls in the next six years, including Super Bowl 60 in 2026 and Super Bowl 64 in 2030.\n\nCollinsworth, 65, who has won seven Emmy Awards for Outstanding Sports Studio Analyst, makes about $12.5 million a year and has teamed up with Mike Tirico to call games.\n\nDo you like football?

Where that falls that’s what we’re here to decide.”\n\nIn football, the number being bandied about is 85 which would jeopardize walk-on spots.\n\n“I don’t know anybody that wouldn’t defend walk-ons,” Smart said. “We’re talking about something that just makes sense. When you implement that known fact into some form of settlement that I don’t completely understand, I don’t know where that factors in.”\n\nHe mentioned Dabo Swinney, Will Muschamp, and Ladd McConkey “as guys that have come to schools as walk-ons and then gone to be successful football players, successful coaches, successful at everything they do.”\n\nMcConkey signed with Georgia, but received mostly smaller school offers.\n\nHow expanded playoff may impact UGA football making 12-team field\n\nSmart has taken Georgia to the College Football Playoff in three of his eight seasons and has come close in other seasons including last year where Georgia was 12-1 after an SEC Championship game loss to Alabama\n\n“There are probably three times that we were one of the best four teams but we didn’t earn it on the field,” said Smart who won national titles in 2021 and 2022.\n\nNow the playoff is expanding from four to 12 teams., but there will still be debate about those left out.\n\nJust like with college baseball bracket Monday and the college basketball March Madness bracket.\n\n“The same opportunity is going to present itself, it’s just going to be 13, 14, 15,” Smart said. “You guys are going to debate a lot about it. I’m going to try to make my team better so they’re not 13, 14, 15.”\n\nEight game schedule for next two seasons. What about 2026?\n\nThe SEC is sticking with an eight game schedule for 2024 and 2025 with the same opponents just flipping locations.\n\nThere will be discussion this week about 2026 and beyond but no decisions are expected.\n\n“It’s a hot button topic,” Smart said. “It’s on y’all’s little memo, it says ask the question about eight or nine games. I’m completely cool with that question. I don’t care about eight or nine. I don’t care one bit. If you tell me we’re going to get more teams in by playing nine, I vote for that. If we’re going to have a strength of schedule factor that says these teams that play really hard teams, they should be allowed to have two or three losses and get in then I’m for it. It doesn’t help us, then you can say why do it? The fan, the guy’s that pays the ticket price wants those games.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mens-basketball/2023/12/11/ndis-tom-noie-will-talk-notre-dame-mens-basketball-on-wednesday/71823135007/", "title": "Plenty to ponder throughout NDI's latest Notre Dame men's ...", "text": "Thomas Noie: And....we're off and running with another college basketball season. The games came quickly and not very easily for the Notre Dame men's basketball program the first five weeks. A lot of games away from home, a lot of losses, a lot of lessons learned as the Irish are 4-5 while working through finals week. There has to be plenty to discuss - so let's discuss. Include your name and hometown with your question or comment. And with that, let's light this chat candle...\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Biggest changes from Mike to Micah? 1. Accountability. At times, Brey threw it over the fence and said let the old guys figure it out. Not now. It begins with MS. It goes thru MS. It ends with MS. Period. Maybe as they mature, that will change. For now, Micah's way or the highway. 2. Hustle. No more winning 86-80 with this team. So, you rebound, you move the ball, you move yourself and you play defense. Failure to do so means a seat on the pines. 3. Recruiting. This guy is leaving no stone unturned. If you fit ND and MS, he's coming for you. Your thoughts?Thomas Noie: A few. The first of which is, let's not get THAT carried away with the changes. Brey decided in 2021-22 to coach the \"fabric\" of the program and let the heavy lifting to the assistants, but that also produced a 15-5 record in the Atlantic Coast Conference and a near-miss of another Sweet 16. It worked then, it just didn't work last year when he put it in the hands of the veterans who weren't able to handle the heavy lifting. Mike Brey had his faults, and plenty of them, but you don't win the way he won at Notre Dame with smoke and mirrors. Micah Shrewsberry is learning that the job at Notre Dame is HARD. On and off the floor, it's not going to be easy. That said, I love, love, love what I've seen from Shrewsberry. Sometimes, I find myself watching him more than the five guys on the floor. The energy, the emotions, it's exactly what this program needs. Now. We don't get 86-80 any more, but are you content with 65-53? You can hustle and defend and still score.Thomas Noie: Recruiting? This staff has been everywhere and looked at everyone it needs to look at it. That's the easy part. The hard part now is getting them to campus and getting them into the program. Remember, the class Notre Dame signed last month, each one of the prospects had previous relationships with either Shrewsberry or the staff. it was just a carry over from the groundwork he laid at Penn State. Now do it at Notre Dame. There's a lot to like about Micah Shrewsberry, but he'll be the first to admit there's a long way still to go. It's on the right track.\n\nDave Nation: The team seems to be underperforming even your tempered expectations. What aspect has disappointed you the most? Effort or execution?Thomas Noie: Dave: Disagree. This was going to be a really difficult season, for myriad reasons. Notre Dame lost to Western Carolina, but when you looked at Western Carolina and saw that it had three senior guards who were all preseason all-conference selections, your antennae should've rocketed up. The Irish were in trouble based on that fact alone. Notre Dame wasn't ready for Auburn, was a little more ready for South Carolina and had zero business playing Miami and Marquette at that point in the schedule. At 4-5, they're about right where they were expected to be. They're competing their #$%@ off, they're learning to play together. They just don't know how to win. That will come as we move deeper through this season. Maybe that translates to 6-14 or 7-13 in league play. Maybe it doesn't. As for biggest disappointment, it would be the lack of awareness of everything on offense. Shot-clock violations (four in the first 11 minutes against Marquette) are a result of guys just not knowing what to do and when to do it.\n\nGuest: How’s notre dame doing with Moreno the 25 big I think there missing a good post player who can defend block some shotsThomas Noie: That would be Malachi Moreno, a 6-foot-11, 210-pound consensus four-star/Top 100 prospect from Georgetown, Kentucky. The standard recruiting answer would be, yeah, they're good with him, but really, does anyone know about a prospect who has 23 schools (who all have offered) on his wish list? Short answer - no. Notre Dame did its work early with Moreno, but will that be enough for him to choose Notre Dame over Alabama, Baylor, Creighton, Indiana, Kentucky and Purdue among others? Micah Shrewsberry can sell immediate playing time, but that might not be enough. Notre Dame is in the mix with Moreno. That's all you can ask on Dec. 13.\n\nGuest: I can see the young talent I think the future is bright just need better post play and maybe another wing that can defend or big guardThomas Noie: The future is bright, but if given a choice, I'd say Micah Shrewsberry would add a proven post player and a another wing/big guard who can score. Defense has rarely been the issue. These guys guard. The issue has been that when Notre Dame needs a bucket, it doesn't have the luxury of throwing it into the post for someone to collapse the defense and/or get a bucket and get fouled. It doesn't have that one guy who just says, F this, and goes and drives the lane and finishes and is fouled and make a free throw. It really needed a veteran scorer on the perimeter with this group. I won't say they didn't try to get one - maybe admissions had other ideas. Dare I say it - this team needs a cocky/confident guy like Prentiss Hubb (ducks).\n\nMike from columbus: Love this team. Haven’t seen this much hustle for quite a while except for Njie. Is the hand holding him back or does he need a big dose of nasty.Thomas Noie: Mike: Agree 1000 percent on the hustle part. Like Micah Shrewsberry has often said, he's not going to coach effort. If you're going to play, you're going to play hard. The guys have shown it, but are still learning it. The effort wasn't anywhere where it needed to be in the first half against Marquette. The second half, though it was really just a scrimmage, the effort was better. Shrewsberry said afterward that the tape won't lie - he'll see how hard guys played in the second half. Now go play that way from the jump. As for Kebba Njie, it might be part hand, part head. It's been a struggle for him to get back into full go with the right hand injury, which has led to him overthinking everything. He just needs to settle in and get a few easy baskets. That can get him going. We also have to remember that he's only a sophomore. He played every game last year at Penn State, but wasn't one of the main guys. Rotating into that role is difficult as it is. Even more so coming back from injury/ineffectiveness.\n\nJohnny in NC: What number of wins would be considered a success this year?Johnny in NC: Can ND win four ACC games this year?Thomas Noie: Johnny: Two for one answer coming here. Notre Dame is 4-5 heading into Saturday's home game against Georgetown. That starts a season-high six-game homestand (three non-conference, three conference). Good teams, or OK teams learning to be good have, have, have to win at home. Notre Dame should win those three non-conference home games - Georgetown, The Citadel, Marist - which gets the Irish to 7-5 jumping back to league play. The Irish are 0-1 in the ACC. My projection at the start was this team could win six league games somewhere along the line. That would leave the Irish 13-19 heading to the league tournament. Think everyone would take that given what we've seen to date, right?\n\nAvila: Love the fresh start. It was past time. Will Shrew use the portal or develop young talent? Good luck….don’t let Duke intimidate you……Thomas Noie: Avila: It was time for a change. Mike Brey would be the first to admit that - he should've left after the 2022 NCAA tournament run, but was fooled into thinking that team last year could recreate what happened in 2021-22. Didn't have it in them. It happens. Reset button was pressed. Micah Shrewsberry will utilize the transfer portal to fit a specific need. A guy here, maybe two guys there, but it's never going to be a case like it is at Georgetown, which comes to town Saturday with 10 - TEN! - transfers on its roster. It will be recruiting, recruiting, recruiting, then player development, player development, player development. This staff is better set up to do that than the last one.\n\nChad from Toledo: Not to be rude or anything but you can practice defense all year round and no one is shutting teams out in Basketball correct?? Bottom line is to score more points than your opponent Yes?? The game has changed a lot since shot clock for sure!! Can you explain the process Coach Shrewsberry is trying to build when Offense wins games n defense is ND focal point? I do like this team so far but ND needs to score the ball more n hope to play defense well enough to win!Out rebounding teams is the best defense you can play!Markus Burton body will not hold up dribbling the entire possession to create offense! Your thoughts on ND best scoring option at 5’11”!! Luv the kids game but he needs help? Go IrishThomas Noie: Chad: Facts, which is why I've pushed back on this narrative from Notre Dame men's basketball \"fans\" who have holler \"Hallelujah!\" every time Micah Shrewsberry has mentioned defense. Like, be careful what you wish for in that regard. Yes, Notre Dame has and will continue to guard, but it also is offensively challenged. That's not coaching as much as it is personnel. Look at the grouping that are on the floor. Freshmen. Transfers. A junior (J.R. Knoieczny) who basically sat out for two years. It's an impossible ask to put any combination of five guys on the floor and have them figure it out against the teams it has had to figure it out against. There is ability there - we saw it when they scored a season high 86 points last week against Western Michigan. But when your best option is Markus Burton going and getting something, you're going to rank 335th in the country for scoring offense (64.2 ppg.). This program needs a walking bucket. It doesn't have one.\n\nPat H. Springfield Illinois: Who’s being recruited and for what positions? Thanks for hosting this and keep up your good workThomas Noie: Pat: Good question, but first a roster breakdown for 2024-25 - If, and that's always going to be a huge IF, nobody jumps to the transfer portal in the spring, Notre Dame will have a maximum 13 players on scholarship, which includes former walk-on Alex Wade and current seniors Tony Sanders and Matt Zona, who each have their COVID-19 bonus seasons remaining for 2024-25. So after 2024-25, if this roster stays together, Notre Dame will have four scholarships (Wade, Julian Roper, Zona, Sanders) to offer the 2025 class. That said, Notre Dame's future classes will look a lot like its first two - versatile guards/post players. Here's who visited this fall from the Class of 2025 and Class of 2026...Thomas Noie: 2025 prospects: Azavier Robinson (G), Colt Laydon (F), E.J. Walker (F), Dezmon Bruce (F), Christian Gurdak (C), Malachi Moreno (C), Braylon Mullins (G), Jalen Haralson (F), Niko Bundalo (F), Gregory Lawson (G). 2026 prospects: Taylen Kinney (G), Steven Reynolds (G), Jonathan Sanderson (G), T.J. Crumble (F).\n\nBilly Mac: Tom - During scoring droughts this year the only “go to” seems to be Marcus Burton’s pull-up mid range jumper that he seems to be able to get when he wants. Do you see a time when Coach Schrews puts the ball in someone else’s hand and lets Marcus hunt his shot a bit when needed? Thanks as always for the chat!Thomas Noie: How about a definite maybe? As in, maybe when these guys have a clearer idea of who can do what and when, Micah Shrewsberry will trust Markus Burton to move off the ball and Tae Davis to move on it. Given Burton's size, though, he's easy to guard off the ball. He's best with the ball in his hands, getting to the midrange them - boom! - he stops and sticks that mid-range pull-up while the defense still is retreating. That should be in his bag every single time. It's hard watching him struggle from 3 the way he has (7-of-33, .212 percent). He's not a 3-point shooter yet, and that's OK. That will come. Same with trusting someone else besides Burton to get into some semblance of offense. Burton leads the Irish with 33 assists. Logan Imes is the only other player in double figures for assists with 10. Keep the ball in Burton's hands and let him create. That works best for where the Irish are for now.\n\nP.Rose: What happened to Tony Sanders?Thomas Noie: P: Let me flip the question - why should Tony Sanders play more than the 6:47 he's logged in two games? If he could help in any way, don't you think he would've helped? Right now, there are guys Micah Shrewsberry trusts more (i.e. defends) better than Sanders. Just gotta keep working and maybe the rotation swings his way.\n\nGuest: Why does Shrewsberry stay in the game when he gets beat off the dribble from the wing for an easy lay up with barely a defensive effort to even attempt to stop the dribble drive penetration for the easy basket.Thomas Noie: For a team that ranks 335th in the country for scoring (64.2 ppg.) it's hard to take one of the few guys who can maybe make a shot off the floor. For the most part, Braeden Shrewsberry has defended and has competed. There are times when he looks overmatched/overwhelmed, but that's the case with just about everybody on the roster. It's not just a Shrewsberry thing.\n\nPatrick from NYC: Tom, now that we've gotten a good look at a pretty big rotation (a little delayed on Kebba Njie) who has been the most pleasant surprise? I'm going with JR followed closely by Tae DavisThomas Noie: Patrick: Good call, but after the Western Michigan game, I wrote that Tae Davis has been a revelation, so my pick to date would be Davis, second on the squad in scoring (9.4) and first in rebounding (5.8). He's also been asked to do the most, and it's not even close. He's guarded guards. He's guarded forwards. He's been a secondary handler to Markus Burton. J.R. Konieczny would be No. 2 in terms of pleasant surprises. Both are solid pieces as this moves forward.\n\nAlex: The team plays hard there is no doubt about that. Through 9 games are they better/worse/or about where you expected them to be with such a roster turnaround? This schedule has been a gauntlet for such a brand new/inexperienced group. More difficult than I remember any schedule being under the previous regime.Thomas Noie: Alex: Not going to sit here and say, called this and called that and knew this and knew that, but nine games in, Notre Dame is about where it's supposed to be. The Irish have competed and shown signs here and there that they MIGHT be good, but they just haven't sustained it. There has reached a point in every loss to a Power Six team (Auburn, South Carolina, Miami, Marquette) where the other team can and has hit another gear and the Irish are seemingly stuck in neutral. Happened right from the start against Marquette, but I agree with Micah Shrewsberry - Notre Dame had ZERO business playing that game. Not at this time. Not with that team. Not against that team. What happened last weekend in Milwaukee was expected. Shrewsberry was right when he said earlier this month that this Notre Dame is one that should've been at home for the entire months of November and December to get some wins and some confidence. The Irish weren't ready for the road, but maybe somewhere along the way, it will make them better.\n\nJack from Rye, NY: While I love the defensive effort-excluding first half at Marquette-it’s obvious we don’t have much talent and/or experience. Mike Brey was often criticized for being a lazy recruiter but compare his last 2 classes with Micah Shrewsberry. Sophomores JJ Starling and Ven Allen Lubin ( double double for Vandy last week) are certainly more productive than Kenna Njie ( 1-17!!! from inside 5 feet) and this year Burton, Parker Friedrichson (19 points for Wake last week) and Brady Dunlap ( little time at St Johns) are certainly more talented and productive than Braeden S, Imes, and Booth. Should we be concerned about recruiting the talent necessary to bring program to the heights that we all hope for? That being said, I do love 2024 class but let’s see what happensThomas Noie: Jack: Soapbox time. Look at my X (Twitter) mentions after almost every single Notre Dame loss this season, and you're bound to come across a thread (or two or three) about how all this is Mike Brey's fault, which I find hilarious. Like, fans.....really? Mike Brey had his faults, but he had a freshman class of Dom Campbell, Ven-Allen Lubin and J.J. Starling, a McDonald's All-American. He had an incoming class that included Markus Burton and Parker Friedrichsen and Brady Dunlap. When Brey left, he encouraged all six of those guys to see who Notre Dame hired before deciding their futures. Only Burton followed through. The other five all left for other schools. That's Brey's fault? Would Starling fit nicely with this team? Would Lubin be sorely needed? Yes, times 10.Thomas Noie: That Notre Dame is challenged in many areas right now is nobody's \"fault.\" The previous head coach had to go, the new head coach came in and guys decided to transfer. It's the way of the college basketball world. Booth is so young he should really be a high school senior right now. Imes is a program guy who fits best as a third or fourth guard. Shrewsberry would be the perfect sniper on a veteran/old/experienced team. All three HAVE to play now - there are no other options. That anyone would be \"concerned\" given what Micah Shrewsberry inherited/had to work with is laughable. Let's give this three years and see where it is. It's not going to happen any sooner.\n\nWoofCookie: I think they are trying hard on defense, but I've noticed that other teams can set up a pick and roll and get a pretty easy 8-10 foot shoot. Do you think that's just \"young\" and \"inexperience\" of the team / learning to play with each other, etc..?Thomas Noie: Woof: This group is still too young and inexperienced where they don't know what they don't know. Pick and roll is basic basketball, right Playing it, defending it. All of it. But it's also perfected by guys who know/sense/anticipate what the other guys is going to do. How they're going to guard it, how they're going to roll off it. It takes hundreds of hours in the gym. Sometimes thousands to make it look so smooth. This group, even nine days in, still resembles a noon-time pickup of five guys who don't know one another but are expected to compete at that level. That's a hard ask. Even as well as they've played on defense, there's been leakage. Why? The trust isn't there either. Time.\n\nMark from Rochester: I know this is year 1, but do you like the non conference scheduling change under Micah? Seems to be a lot harder than the cupcakes we’re used to seeing in November and December.Thomas Noie: Mark: Nope. Hate it. Hate it, hate it, hate it. So does Micah Shrewsberry because outside of Saturday's home game against Georgetown, Shrewsberry had very little say in this season's schedule. He's said it before, so I'll say it again. This is a Notre Dame program that should've been at home playing any directional school it could find for November and December. The Legends Classic? That was tied into the previous coaching regime. Notre Dame had no business playing at Barclays three games in. Same for the game at Marquette. That was a Mike Brey leftover. Shrewsberry really should've asked Shaka Smart to put it on pause for a year. The game at South Carolina was a directive by the league under the ACC/SEC Challenge. Shrewsberry said after that one that Notre Dame also will be on the road (team TBD) for next year's ACC/SEC Challenge. If there was ever a year and a team that needed to feast on those \"cupcakes\" it's this one. This schedule did this program a disservice in every conceivable way.\n\nMark from Rochester: What have you seen from Markus Burton over the past month? Started hot but then played better competition and dipped a bit. Excited to see his growth in the program!Thomas Noie: Mark: The ebbs and flows for a freshman guard. It was easy early because nobody knew about him. What could he do? How good could he be? There was no film, no scout, no nothing on him. He was a blank slate. As those color by number patterns started to be filled in, teams understood better what he could and what they could do to take him away. Especially against older guards who'd been there and done it at that level. SO Burton hits a rough patch. But good players figure it out. He's figured it out, though it would be nice to see him not hunt his 3-point shot as much (.212 percent). He's lethal in the mid-range. Get to those spots and be good. A lot there to build on.\n\nRyan mars pa: Tom what do you think About Both players from south bend area Jr and Burton are having a good year so farThomas Noie: Ryan: Good first steps both for Markus Burton and J.R. Konieczny. Point guard is the toughest position to learn/play/know/excel at in college. Burton's had his moments. So has Konieczny. Love how both compete. Konieczny has shown a toughness that we didn't know he had. They'll only get better in this program, which stresses player development way more than the previous staff.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, I've only seen vs. AUB and vs. MARQ. Both very bad matchups. That said, they are a step slow on both ends. Part of that is learning Micah's system, part is they were just not as athletic as those two schools. The offense, other than Marcus, maybe Davis a little, seems unable to create for themselves. Which makes ball movement and personnel movement paramount, two things I didn't see much of. MARQ picked them up at the 3 point line and ND was satisfied to run the Globetrotter weave and then force a three before the buzzer. They need to establish either Njie or Davis in the post. Maybe get 8 to 10 points to free up the perimeter. Like with Atkinson. Defense shows some hustle but they lack foot quickness and could really use an inside presence. Someone, who when he fouls you, you think twice about going in there again. Thoughts?Thomas Noie: Joe: Don't take it personally (I know you won't) but it's kind of asking Mrs. Lincoln that, well, other than the obvious, how did you enjoy the play?😃 Notre Dame shouldn't have played either of those teams for all the reasons outlined in your post. Maybe next year or the year after they'll have the pieces and the parts and poise to counter everything they saw against Auburn and Marquette. Maybe then, they'll have that inside presence and a guy like a Ben Hansbrough who can be like #$%$# this stuff, I'm going to get a bucket. There are so many missing pieces right now that asking about Auburn or Marquette or what's coming in the league (Duke, Virginia, Clemson) just sets it up for frustration.\n\nMark from Rochester: Tom is there going to be an emphasis on getting shooters in recruiting? Outside of Shrewsberry who needs time and confidence, there arent any threats on our perimeter. Teams seem to be ok with Davis and Roper taking those. Thank you!Thomas Noie: Mark: Notre Dame assistant coach Ryan Owens classified Cole Certa, who's signed to arrive next season, as the finest shooter in the country. So there's that. And Braeden Shrewsberry, Burton, Tae Davis, Logan Imes all can and should be better than what they've shown from distance to date.\n\nAndrew from Plymouth: How about Russell Carter instead of Prentis Hubb?Thomas Noie: Whoa....the Russell Carter we saw senior year, sure. But it took three years to get there. For him to get there. Hubb was a #$%#@ you guy from the start.\n\nClancy: Marquette made us look lost at times. Under Brey, I remember thinking how did he set up practice when there were so few quality players on the practice squad to mimic these tougher opponents. How do you think Micah’s approach to practice players is going?Thomas Noie: Clancy: Unbelievably different, in the best way possible. Well, from the little we could see. A little \"here's how the sausage is made\" sidebar. The plan for the fall was that we'd see a full practice at Rolfs Hall. That full practice was shaved to 20 minutes of basically just individual instruction. But if you paid attention, you knew this was not your Mike Brey Irish program any more. There were times last year when they couldn't even go five-on-five because of a lack of bodies. That's not an issue under Micah Shrewsberry, who carries five walk-ons. At one point during that preseason session, I counted 27 people on the court in some form of coaching, playing, managing, instructing manner. Not having enough players to practice never will be an issue with this staff.\n\nTyler from Granger: Tom, what makes moving the basketball the most difficult/challenging for a young team in college basketball? Not necessarily this team but your general opinion. Is it the speed of the college game? Emphasis on coaching philosophy? Chemistry? Individual talent? ThanksThomas Noie: Tyler: A little of everything, but especially trust. I have to trust that my teammate is going to be at a certain spot at a certain moment without wondering/worrying, which is what we've seen from the Irish. Too much wondering. Too much maybes and not enough certainty. That comes with practice reps and doing it again and again and again in games and on the practice court. Especially in the summers when that trust can be built. Notre Dame couldn't do any of that in June and July - it was too busy trying to figure out the new head coach and the new staff and the campus and the expectations. This is a group that needs to be locked in a gym for days so they can just play. Move and operate and think as one where they just know where the ball and the other guys are going next. Trust.\n\nIllinois Fool: Your comment on not having a walking bucket certainly shows up late in the shot clock. The players either don't recognize the clock is running down or are reluctant to put up a \"bad shot\". Do you see this as something that will improve with game experience or a year long problem?Thomas Noie: IF: Look at my answer (above or below or how this chat flows) for that. Trust is a big reason for the shot-clock issues. That and just having that clock in your head to know, OK, gotta go. These guys have so many other thoughts going on - shoot it, move it, dribble it, space it - that they really do forget about the shot clock. I believe that. They're so robotic in their movements, again, because they don't know yet how to just play. It will improve. It has to improve.\n\nClint from Winnipeg: Is this season more interesting than last simply because you see individual and collective improvement with each game, where last year the veteran group was what it was and the ceiling pretty much had been reached?Thomas Noie: Clint: Absolutely. Times 100. There's something new and different and intriguing to see every single time Notre Dame plays. Win or lose. Yes, Saturday sucked for so many reasons, but you know what, in a way it was needed. Like, this program had to see what big-time basketball looked and felt and sounded and smelled like. They'll be better for it. There's so much room to grow that it's ridiculous compared to last year. I'll always remember watching the Notre Dame game against St. Bonaventure on the plane ride to Los Angeles for the USC football game in November 22. It wasn't that the Irish lost (62-51) but it was the way they lost. Like, if that's what we were going to see from a supposed veteran team, it wasn't going to be any better in league play. It wasn't. Now, the ceiling is limitless. What's it all going to look like next year? The following year? Don't know, but can't wait to find out, right?\n\nClint from Winnipeg: I agree with you, Tae Davis has been the second-best player on the team after Markus Burton.Thomas Noie: Clint: And that's something that too few people understand. Like that's a massive jump for Tae Davis, doing what he's doing now compared to everything he did last year at Seton Hall. I know he's struggled from 3 (1-of-15), but I'll live with that given everything else he's been asked to do and has done. Lots of good stuff with Davis right now.\n\nJustin, Ft Wayne: Hey Tom! I think the biggest thing for me is the lack of execution on the offensive end. The amount of shot clock violations is frustrating. I wonder why they don’t speed it up just a bit and see if that works. You have any reason or know why they like to play so slow?Thomas Noie: Justin: Probably because they're thinking the game too much. The more you think, the slower you play. Micah Shrewsberry has said plenty of times that he wants to play fast, wants the ball to pop and move and get the defense scrambled. But that's for later on down the line when these guys know one another better and trust one another more to just play. Now, you can almost see them thinking the game - overthinking the game - with every possession. Basketball's free flowing. They're not flowing, because they don't know how to yet.\n\nTyler from Granger: Now that we are 5 weeks into the season, what is the updated ceiling for this years' team? ACC tournament quarterfinals and let's say 15 wins?Thomas Noie: Tyler: Too early still to tell. You say the ceiling would be the Atlantic Coast Conference quarterfinals. That would mean winning at least two tourney games. Some would argue that this team might not win two league games. Micah Shrewsberry has said that he wants his guys to be playing their best basketball by the end of February and early March. If that's the case, there will be some long nights in January and early February. Let's see how they handle the next month before planning an extended stay in DC!😃\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, If I recall correctly, Brey maintained a fairly \"bare bones\" staff. Under MS, the coaching staff has increased significantly. IYO, what benefits should ND realize from the new \"Org Chart\" and how much do you feel this improves ND's chances of success?Thomas Noie: Joe: Notre Dame won't lack from a player development standpoint. Brey's staffs (not always his choice) often rolled five deep. This one is eight. There's someone who knows the game at every turn. Micah Shrewsberry has been allowed more resources than Mike Brey ever had. That has to help. Kid wants someone to work him out late at night or early in the morning, someone on staff is there. Want to watch tape? Same thing. The extended staff guarantees nothing, but at least it puts it in the same ballpark as its conference peers.\n\nTyler from Granger: Tom, to play 6-7 home games during Christmas (out of their control, I get it) in the wintery snowy dark days of Michiana with a median town age population of what can feel like 72, why won't/doesn't the university try to reach out to our area high schools in filling up our student section with free tickets to create a better home advantage in our league games? I would take 1,000 16-18 year olds on their feet for those 6-7 games vs 400 (on a good day) sitting down only to sigh on a bad play & barely cheer for a good one. Not only that, as a season ticket holder, I would pay a little bit more annually to give those student tickets away during break to actually be used. I think about when I was in high school, all I wanted to do during hoops szn was get into that arena to watch our team play. There has to be hundreds of these kids in town now that were just like me then. These kids couldn't act/behave publicly any worse than these grown adults in SEC environments. I see no disadvantage. Thoughts?Thomas Noie: Tyler: Best idea I've heard in a while. You should be on the phone to the ticket office to give them some ideas. Some of the more surprising atmospheres over winter break has been when a local high school band is in the building. There's plenty of juice when there should be none. You're right on every aspect. Make it happen!\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Given the lack of experience with this group, wouldn't it be time for a European Tour in 2024?Thomas Noie: Joe: Preach. There is a plan in place for this group to go on a foreign tour. Last I heard it was going to be Spain, but those plans were still in its infant stages. If ever a team needs a foreign tour, it's Notre Dame next summer.\n\nClint from Winnipeg: Did J.R. Konieczny put on significant weight and muscle over the offseason? He looks much thicker than last year.Thomas Noie: Clint: He was listed as a true freshman in 2021-22 at 6-foot-6, 195 pounds. He's listed this year at 6-7, 204 pounds. He's not where he needs to be yet, but he's getting there. He can compete for longer stretches against bigger guys than he did his first two years. He plays hard, maybe as hard as anyone on the team. He's been better than anticipated.\n\nKurt in Ireland: Tom - I predicted JR would be one of, if not the most consistent player on the team in the last chat. He hasn’t quite met my expectations - and both Burton and Davis have exceeded my expectations, but I sensed a bit of Abro in JR from when I first saw him hit the floor as a freshman.Thomas Noie: Kurt: Man, people think I'M too critical of guys. J.R. Konieczny hasn't met your expectations? He's exceeded many with what he's done nine games in - two double doubles for points and rebounds to date (18 points, 11 rebounds against Auburn; 11-10 against Oklahoma State). Four games scoring double figures. The last seven games, he's played at least 23 minutes. He's averaging 9.0 points and 5.1 rebounds (second on the team) in 25.5 minutes. He's shooting .417 percent from the floor, .303 from 3 and .875 from the foul line. For someone who basically didn't play the last two years - since his freshman year of high school - what JRK has done to date has been solid. A great first step, with many more to come.\n\nKurt in Ireland: I wasn’t being critical - I was just saying that I’m not surprised how good he could be, as I saw that spark early on in his career. He just needed strength. It he where I had hoped? Not quite yet. He needs to hunt his shot a bit more and also cut more - though to be fair many times he’s been overlooked on cuts which is maybe why he’s been hanging in the perimeter more of late. That will come though, as you say, with trust.Thomas Noie: Understood, but nine games in after not playing for two years, JRK's been really good. Expectations don't kick in until January, especially for a program trying to tread water in the deep end. Gotta survive before you can swim! 😃\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Why did Brey take an assistant's job in the NBA? He is 64. He doesn't need the money. NBA players already know everything, so teaching them is out the window. He's a grandfather. I get Quin Snyder, but the rest doesn't add up. Please connect the dots.Thomas Noie: Joe: For the same reason that he was thisclose (OK, even closer than that) to taking the head coaching job at South Florida. Brey talked a good game about moving to Florida and being a grandfather and doing nothing but smoking cigars on the beach, but when the end came in Greensboro, North Carolina in March, and there was nothing next to do - no recruiting, no spring program, no nothing - that scared the $#%@$ out of him. Like, what now? He'd been a coach for so long that that was all he knew. He HAD to do something, so Quin Snyder, his old Duke buddy, offered the ultimate lifeline - come sit on the bench (really, the second row) in the NBA to keep yourself in the game. See if you like it. If you don't, the beach will always be there. And the money's not bad either. Brey's basically making $1.2 million to offer suggestions and be more of a sounding board than decision-maker. Every coach believes he can do it in the NBA. Brey gets the chance to scratch the itch. Pretty good soft landing, right?\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Agreed. But I think Brey fancied himself as more of a teacher/coach. If so, why not do what Rollie did? Go to FLA and take over a small school. That way you are in the game, you are teaching, and you are not dealing with 1 and done NBA wannabes.Thomas Noie: Joe: There likely was a provision/verbiage in his separation agreement with Notre Dame that said something to the affect of, if individual takes another college head coaching job before expiration of agreement (Brey was signed through 2024-25) then any future financial agreement would be nullified. That's probably one of the reasons he's not a head coach somewhere.\n\nKurt in Ireland: I wish Brey would go to booth for a while. I think he’d be a good commentator.Kurt in Ireland: Put him on a team with Bilas.Thomas Noie: Television wasn't an option for him. Seemed an easy one, yes, but it didn't do it for him. Maybe that changes.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Since it is at least one year, maybe two, until ND Men's BBL games become competitive again, how do you psyche yourself up for for a 9PM start, on a snow covered WED night, right after the holidays to watch ND -NCST? Especially with your history experiencing all the magical moments of decades past?Thomas Noie: Joe: Easier than you and everyone might think. Every season is a journey. A new one with its own storylines and twists and turns and wins and losses. I don't cover this team thinking about how great of a ride it was in 2003 or 2010 or 2015 and 2016. It's about here and now with this head coach and this roster and this season - the challenges, the highs and lows, the everything. The past is the past. What's the present hold? The future? This is as different a journey as I've ever been on in my 26 seasons on the beat. What are we going to see? Can't wait to be there to find out, to think about it, to write about it. A 9 p.m. start? Maybe that's the game that everything turns. Or the following week. Or the the next one. LFG! 😃\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, What gives you greater pleasure, watching a great ND BBL game (win or lose) or telling the fans about it in the SBT in your own inimitable style?Thomas Noie: Writing >>>>> everything else. Always.\n\nMatt from St. Louis: I'm always interested in the dynamic between a coach and their kid at this level. Anything interesting about how either Shrewsberry has handled it so far?Thomas Noie: Matt: We're not around to see the good stuff (the practice court, film study, etc.). On the floor during games, Braeden's just one of the guys, and treated as such by Micah. If anything, he's a bit tougher on him. That's a difficult dynamic. Talked a little with Braeden about it in the fall (he's not one for many words) and he said that he's the head coach around campus and he's dad when they're at home. They have a good balance between the two.\n\nMickey, NY: Always good to have your chat on the calendar. Work got in the way this morning.Thomas Noie: You here now...bring it my man! Whatcha got?😃\n\nJim Tal, Valley Center CA.: Hi Tom, please provide a few reasons why ND fans should be interested in and should take the time to follow the Irish this season. What can make this team a viable and worthwhile watch? Thanks.Thomas Noie: Jim: That somebody has to sell someone on why they should watch Notre Dame men's basketball says a lot, doesn't it? Really? If you're expecting more wins than losses, you're not going to watch. If you're expecting more good basketball than bad basketball, you're not going to watch. If you want to jump in on the ground floor as this program is built back up, then you'll watch. If you want to see Markus Burton and Carey Booth grow their games as they grow up, you'll watch. Pretty simple - this season is a I-was-there-when situation for you.\n\nMickey, NY: The effort has been one of the things that has stood out but even that seems uneven. Games where the energy/execution isn’t there from the jump seems odd since CMS and staff are emphasizing that so much. Other than maybe not having exposure to differ t game environments and the “trust” thing you have mentioned previously what is Shrew’s view on that? (See what I did there?)Thomas Noie: Mickey: Goes back to the fact that they don't know what they don't know. Playing Marquette on the heels of hanging 86 points on Western Michigan set this team up for a total flameout in Milwaukee. It wasn't going to be as easy as it was back home against the Broncos. They had to be 10 times better than they were at the smallest of details. Shrewsberry and his staff can preach that all day every day (and likely did) but until the players were on the court at Fiserv Forum and saw it for themselves, they didn't know, Now they do. It's all been uneven because everything about this program is uneven. They'll eventually find that balance.\n\nMickey, NY: Have You heard anything about the connection to “Brey’s guys” and the new staff? I see Phonz and Cornette continuing their connectivity with the program. But no mention on X about what other guys might be doing in either the NBA or overseas (it used to pop up every so often). Is that something or a nothingburger?Thomas Noie: Mickey: There have been other players besides the obvious ones - Phonz, Cornette - that have reached out to Micah Shrewsberry. Pat Connaughton is down with an ankle injury right now, but he still showed up to the Marquette game in Milwaukee. A lot of the most recent guys are too busy playing professionally to play too much attention. And Shrewsberry, to be fair, has to be more concerned about coaching this team than worrying/working with the former guys. That's something for the spring, when the staff finally gets a chance to breathe.\n\nTyler from Granger: Tom, another ceiling question (sorry), who on this team do you think has the highest athletic professional ceiling? I'd say Tae Davis just based on his \"point forward\" position w his size, length, ability to defend the perimeter etc.. I'd say the old Matt Ryan situation though pretty much makes a question like this a dart throw anyway as far as predictability lolThomas Noie: Tyler: I love Tae Davis and what he's done to date, but when the lightbulb comes on for Carey Booth, whoa, watch out. He's got the biggest upside, which probably includes NBA-potential upside. Remember, he should still be a high school senior right now. He's so raw and unpolished. Get him in the gym, get him stronger, get him older and he might be the prototypical stretch 4. You see snapshots here and there to where you're like, man, when he gets it, he's really going to get it.\n\nFrank from Mishawaka: I totally agree with one of your previous answers on the players Brey recruited and he told to wait out the hire. Those players could've helped the transition immensely. Last years team(upperclassmen) was very disappointing and something had to change. That being said, Shrewsbury has been given a larger support staff and even has 5 walk-ons. Was the larger support staff and walk-ons something Shrewsbury told his bosses had to happen for him to come here?Thomas Noie: Frank: I think it was more a case that the Notre Dame administration knew that if they were going to hire anybody who was serious about being a basketball coach that they had to get serious about the program. Mike Brey had lobbied to extend the staff for years, and was always told, yeah, no, make the best of what you have now. So he stopped asking. Shrewsberry's staff was extended at Penn State. If Jack Swarbrick came to him with an offer that didn't include a lot of what he already had, Shrewsberry would've been like, nah, I'm good. The staff, and the walk-ons, say that Notre Dame is serious about the program, more serious than they were when they were going to consecutive Elite Eights.\n\nMickey, NY: Your point about a guy who says “eff it, give me the ball and I’ll make it happen” has been the missing piece for a few years. Have you seen glimpses of anyone who might have it in them or is that person not on the roster yet?Thomas Noie: Nope. Nobody. The easy answer is Markus Burton because he's got the ball in his hands the most, but that #$%#@ guy might not be on the roster. Or the radar.\n\nTyler from Granger: Since covid, is your access to the team/program any different than before? As it relates to your day to day job, coverage, your travel to road games, accessibility to players and coaches, \"inside\" information, and all that? Or is/was it all about the head coach allowing it more than how times now, in general, are different?Thomas Noie: Tyler: Great question, and you're going to get an answer you probably weren't expecting. It wasn't so much COVID that changed how a beat writer does his job in covering Notre Dame men's basketball. You know what it was? Rolfs Hall, which changed the way we work, and a lot of it NOT for the better. Before Rolfs, we could/would talk with players before practice in the arena or the Pit. You could get a feel for them and them for you. You could talk with them as normal people, not writer/player. We've lost that at Rolfs, where pre-practice interviews with the last two head coaches are conducted in the lobby, one floor above the practice court. There are so few interactions now. The players are more insulated. That's not always the best way to go...Thomas Noie: Same for the post-game procedure. In the past, post-game interviews were held in the player lounge at Purcell Pavilion. We'd have three or four players scattered about - Ben Hansbtrough always sat in the same seat - and you could have a relaxed conversation with them. Now, players are brought to a dais in the conference room, where they say absolutely nothing. Or next to nothing. Getting away from that openess has closed down giving the coverage as much color as it deserves. Rant over.\n\nFrank from Mishawaka: More on that give me the &%^^$# ball could that be Nasir Mohammed next year?Thomas Noie: Frank: I'll say maybe until I can see him on a college court playing with and against college players. 😃\n\nTyler from Granger: Might have been asked but have you had the opportunity to converse yet with Pete Bevacqua and what do you think his relationship will be with Coach Shrews as it relates to his interest in the investment of this program as well as his overall interest as a hoops fan (if at all) compared to his predecessor?Thomas Noie: Tyler: Pete Bevacqua, the athletic director in waiting if you will, hasn't opened up the media interview door. That's coming. I look forward to getting to know how he views basketball. Jack Swarbrick swore by Mike Brey. Let's see how the new regime rolls.\n\nJim Tal, Valley Center CA.: Tom, can you provide some insight as to what is going on with Zona. There was genuine hope that this season he would step up, elevate his game and become a real cornerstone guy. Instead, he's having very little impact and has seen his playing time being significantly cut. In your opinion, can Zona still become a factor as the season proceeds or is his window of opportunity rapidly closing?Thomas Noie: Jim: It's not a Matt Zona thing. It's a college basketball thing. A Micah Shrewsberry thing. If college basketball, if this head coach, relied more on the traditional two-big lineup look, Matt Zona might be a main rotation guy. But Shrewsbery prefers the 4-around-1 look of four perimeter guys to one big. That big is usually Kebba Njie, a player that Shrewsberry knew, recruited and took with him from Penn State to play a major role in preaching the Book of Shrews. So Njie's going to play. Sometimes, based on matchups, etc., the second big has been Tae Davis. There often aren't enough minutes to go around to get to Zona. We're not even to January and Zona already has set a career high for starts and assists. He's on his way to setting career highs for points and minutes and rebounds. It wasn't suddenly going to click for him after three years of basically nothing. He's a serviceable backup big. Every program needs/has guys like Matt Zona and Tony Sanders, regardless of their roles.\n\nJustin, Ft Wayne: Any other away games that you’ll be at this year? How was your time at the away games this year?Thomas Noie: Justin: To be determined how often we'll travel this year. The more they win, that equation kind of works itself out. Travel never gets old, even after all these years. You don't like travel, you can't do this job.\n\nJustin, Ft Wayne: I believe Tony Sanders and Matt Zona could be done after this year but also have the chance to comeback. You have any read on either one and what their decision may be? Just wondering from a scholarship perspective.Thomas Noie: Justin: If either wants to play, like really play, they'll probably have to go into the portal and move down a level to get major minutes. If they're serious about their educations, maybe they come back. But it might be a mutual decision for both sides to go different directions. If they leave, they both will have their degrees. That matters most in the big picture.\n\nFrank from Mishawaka: Love your chats and wish more people would summit questions than bash the program(coaches, players, etc) on social media pages. People can get the insight that we the ordinary fan in the stands can't see everyday,Thomas Noie: Frank: Can't agree enough. Social media is a vital part of my job, but to look at my mentions on X (Twitter) at any point after any game last season (and some this year) is brutal. Sometimes, I think fan is short for idiot. Put an actual name to your thoughts and have an adult conversation about why something is the way it is about Notre Dame men's basketball. It's not hard. We're doing it just fine now. 😃\n\nJim Tal, Valley Center CA.: Tom, Swarbrick swore by Brey? I believe you because you would know but how come he didn't do more to get Brey some of the pivotal things he asked for and, in reality, truly needed?Thomas Noie: Jim: He did. Because it's Notre Dame, and they've done this or done that in a certain way for so many years, so they're going to still do it that way. Same reason why it took so long to get a stand-alone practice facility for hoops, and the Gug for football. They don't see the future very clearly over there. The past? They've got that part down! 😃\n\nMickey, NY: Given where the players are on the learning curve and where the team is, what games this season will be most useful to gauge growth, development and gaps? And don't say the last one or the penultimate one, please. I mean, what teams or environment will give us a view into this team?Thomas Noie: Mickey: Four come to mind between now and Jan 24. It's foolish to look any further ahead than that because, well, with this group, you just can't. The first one is the Virginia game at home on Dec. 30. Notre Dame will have three home games leading into that. Virginia is the first \"marquee\" home game - sorry Hoya Saxa. How will the Irish handle it? Next one is Duke on Jan. 6 - the third ACC home game. It's the fourth league game overall. Notre Dame will know the deal. Next after that is the road game vs. Georgia Tech on Jan. 9 - arguably the \"easiest\" road game to date. What has Notre Dame learned about playing on the road?Thomas Noie: Final one in this next long stretch is the rematch with Miami (Fla.) on Jan. 24 in South Bend. Notre Dame believes that it did a lot to really win that game on Dec. 2 in Coral Gables, but just didn't do enough. Now they get the Hurricanes in their gym. Will they do enough? If they do, that's another brick in the foundation they're building.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, John Brian Swarbrick was born in Yonkers, NY. His mother's maiden name was Comey. James Comey, former FBI Director, was also Irish Catholic and born in Yonkers, NY. Are they related? Always wondered about that.Thomas Noie: I'll save that for my Jack Swarbrick chat! 😃\n\nClint from Winnipeg: I can't believe how many people have seemed upset in the chat about how this season is going so far. I mean, we were last in the ACC last season and essentially half the rotation is true freshmen. (BTW, the prior complaint of a rotation comprised of 6-7 players now is a moot point with 9 guys regularly seeing action.) Let's enjoy the ride. It's going to be fun to watch this group grow up. I look forward to each game to see who looks improved from the last time out. It can only get better from last season, right?Thomas Noie: Clint: True. This was going to be a process. Maybe, a long one. But it was going to be trying and painful and frustrating. There would be times where everything everyone wants this program to be seemed so far away. Other times, it will feel like they're close. Really close. There was the low floor, then the bottom, then the basement, then something beyond that is where this program started when Micah Shrewsberry took over. It's not going to happen overnight or maybe even over two or three years. But you listen to Shrewsberry, you hear the resolve in his voice, in his actions when you watch him work and you think that maybe he's got the stones to actually pull this off. Let's see how it all unfolds. Still, 'fans\" will find reason to complain, and let further credence to the fact that for some - not all, but some - fan is short for idiot.\n\nFrank from Mishawaka: I agree with Clint, fans seem to always find something to harp on. The last few years it was the short bench, well Brey always had a short bench. Be happy with a new era with young players learning along the way. How can you complain when you see the effort and intensity these young men are playing with. They rebound with other teams and play defense. Hopefully the offense will come along.Mick: If Zona is going to get mostly garbage minutes, I'd prefer that Booth receive those minutes. This season is about taking their lumps and gaining game experience. You only become an in-game player by playing in-game minutes. I agree that Booth has the biggest upside on the roster by a fair margin. He's even been a surprisingly good rebounder in traffic when he's had extended minutes, which is surprising for someone with his skinny frame.Thomas Noie: In fairness, both Booth and Zona were in during garbage time the other night in Milwaukee. If Njie's game remains stuck in neutral, I'd ponder playing Zona a little more. Like Micah Shrewsberry has said, the bench can be a big motivator.Thomas Noie: That will do it for today - and for this month. Great run of questions and conversation. Best we've had in a while. Appreciate the effort from all. We'll roll this back around in January. Stay tuned for a specific time. In the meantime, Happy Holidays and Happy New Year. Talk to you again in 2024!🎅\n\nFollow South Bend Tribune and NDInsider columnist Tom Noie on X (formerly Twitter): @tnoieNDI.

Oddly enough, though, the Internal Revenue Service has received 7.7% fewer returns so far this year. The agency also has processed 7.6% fewer returns through Feb. 7, according to the latest data published Friday.\n\nWhy the delays?\n\nA variety of factors could be coming into play and keeping many people from filing their returns early in the game, including misleading online tax advice via social media, a flood of 1099-K forms, political rancor, some delayed deadlines in states hit by federal disasters, and the calendar itself.\n\nHow much money are people seeing in tax refunds?\n\nThe average federal income tax refund was $2,065 during this first two weeks of this year's tax season through Feb. 7, according to the IRS. That's up 18.6% from last year's tax season through Feb. 9, 2024.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nMany times, those filing tax returns in late January and early February want to receive their refund cash as early as possible.\n\nIf you file your federal income tax return on Feb. 17, for example, you might anticipate a tax refund by Feb. 28 if you e-file, request that the refund by directly deposited into a bank account and the IRS has no problems with the return.\n\nIf you e-file the return Feb. 17 but want a paper refund check mailed to you, you could have to wait until March 7, according to estimates by CPA Practice Advisor, a resource for tax professionals. The publication notes that filing during peak season, which runs from late March through April 15, can result in slightly longer waits.\n\nMany people who claim the earned income tax credit or the additional child tax credit need to anticipate delays. The IRS said taxpayers claiming those credits can expect to get refunds by March 3. That's if you file your return online, opt to get your refund by direct deposit, and have no issues with your tax return.\n\nSome taxpayers, the IRS said, may receive their income tax refunds a few days earlier. The IRS \"Where's My Refund?\" tool is expected to show an updated status by Feb. 22 for most early filers who claimed the earned income tax credit or the additional child tax credit.\n\nThe IRS expects filing season numbers to even out as more tax returns come in during the weeks ahead and as the April 15 filing deadline for most taxpayers approaches.\n\nHow change in Washington has some rethinking their taxes\n\nIt's hard to judge why people could be putting off filing their taxes. But one reason could be that the new Trump administration isn't like the first Trump administration. We're seeing a lot of swift moves and, in some cases, outright chaos as President Donald Trump attempts to cut spending, offers buyouts and takes other dramatic steps to downsize the federal government.\n\nAfter taking office Jan. 20, Trump issued a slew of executive orders. And some people wrongly might have thought that key tax breaks could hit their 2024 returns simply by executive order. It's not true.\n\nSome social media buzz even suggested that Trump's proposed \"External Revenue Agency\" would replace the IRS and eliminate income taxes. But Trump did not eliminate the IRS or put an end to income taxes.\n\nThe tax breaks proposed on the campaign trail, such as no taxes on tips, are highly unlikely to come into play on 2024 returns retroactively the closer we get to April.\n\nMark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, said some bad information is floating on social media suggesting that taxpayers \"wait and the IRS may go away.” Others suggest that changes will hit the IRS \"and you will not owe taxes.”\n\nSteber said that kind of silliness could have people delaying filing their tax returns for no good reason.\n\n\"I see virtually no chance of retroactive tax administration on political promises from the election,\" Steber said.\n\n\"If the changes happen at all, political statements rarely end up exactly as tax law changes and let alone retroactively,\" he said.\n\nIt's just hard to do, he added.\n\nTax law changes require a lot of agreement in Congress, where Republicans have slim majorities in both the House and Senate. There's much uncertainty about what will actually be proposed until Republicans in Congress get behind a particular tax plan.\n\nWhen is Tax Day 2025? All about deductions, income brackets, credits and deadlines\n\n\"I think the 2026 tax year be the first year of real substantive change,\" Steber said. If so, taxpayers could see those changes when they file 2026 returns in 2027.\n\nSeveral other factors, beyond potential tax cuts, could be contributing to a bit of a slowdown in the early tax season. They include:\n\nA change in the tax season kickoff date\n\nThe 2025 tax season started two days earlier in 2025 than 2024, which one might imagine would generate more filings by now. But it didn't. The IRS has an explanation for that one.\n\nThis year, the IRS began accepting and processing e-filed income tax returns for individuals starting Jan. 27. Last year's tax season started Jan. 29 and the initial week's data ran through Feb. 2.\n\nThe IRS reasoned initially that many people this year didn't file in the first week because they might have still been waiting for key paperwork. Theoretically, the Jan. 29 kickoff last year was closer to a Jan. 31 deadline for W-2 forms to be issued by employers. The W-2 is a key form that reports income and tax withholdings. It's possible people had more paperwork in hand at the start of the season last year.\n\nMany times, of course, tax filers now are able to get W-2 information online and avoid waiting for the documents to be sent in the mail.\n\nThe latest numbers do show improvements from the first week when the IRS processed 15.8% fewer returns than a year ago. During that week, the IRS reported that it received 14% fewer returns during the first week of the tax season compared with last year.\n\nAn expected flood of 1099-K forms\n\nMore gig workers are likely to receive a 1099-K this year that pinpoints how much money they made from these short-term jobs in 2024 — and some could be taking more time with their tax returns to figure out what to do.\n\nProfits on the sale of things, like concert tickets, and money earned working a side hustle, such as delivering food, were always taxable. This year, though, some changes in the reporting rules mean more more people are getting tax forms that track the money.\n\nSteber, at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, said the larger number of tax forms, such as 1099-K forms and other forms, could be creating a feeling among some people that it's better to \"wait until I have all my stuff.\"\n\nAnd that's a good idea because you want to file an accurate return.\n\nThe 1099-K will usually arrive in late January or early February.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if many people are holding back to see what they need to do with a 1099-K if they never had to deal with one in the past.\n\nThis year, taxpayers will receive a 1099-K from payment card companies, payment apps, and online marketplaces when the amount of their business transactions during 2024 was more than $5,000.\n\nUnder the old standard, the 1099-K was only sent to those who had received more than $20,000 and had more than 200 transactions on third-party payment processing platforms in 2023 and earlier years.\n\nThe IRS receives these documents, too, meaning that a lower threshold means a bigger paper trail for 2024 income.\n\nThis same $5,000 threshold could apply if you sold Taylor Swift or Detroit Lions tickets through an online marketplace, such as StubHub, in 2024. The profit you made on those tickets would be taxable.\n\nOverall confusion out of Washington\n\nThe IRS is dealing with its own disruptions this tax season, too. The White House initiated a hiring freeze at the IRS, which could be much longer than those hiring freezes facing other federal agencies.\n\nOperations at the IRS are reportedly under review by Elon Musk's cost-cutting group, according to reports in Reuters and elsewhere.\n\nTrump sent an email Saturday to supporters asking: \"Are you sick of being harassed by the IRS? Well, maybe it's time that somebody audited them for a change.\"\n\nThe headline on the email: \"Should I audit the IRS into oblivion?\"\n\nAt one point, buzz was building that a new free online IRS service called Direct File had been killed by Musk, whom Trump has given broad authority to run a new “Department of Government Efficiency.\"\n\nIRS Direct File was expanded to 25 states for 2024 tax returns. A post on X by Musk said: \"That group has been deleted,\" triggering rumors in early February that Direct File was no more.\n\nMany residents in these 25 states — but not all tax filers — are still able to use Direct File when they're filing their state and federal income taxes this year.\n\nMore than 30 million taxpayers in nearly half of the country can take advantage of the new, free program to prepare and file their federal income taxes online directly with the IRS.\n\nDisaster relief\n\nMillions of taxpayers can wait to file past the April 15 deadline based on federal disaster relief. While they might want to file earlier, they might also need to take their time.\n\nTaxpayers in the entire states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, and parts of Alaska, New Mexico, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia will have until May 1 to file their 2024 returns and pay any tax due. In addition, these taxpayers also would have until May 1 to file their 2023 returns.\n\nOn Jan. 10, the IRS announced an extension for victims of California wildfires. The tax relief applies to individuals and businesses in southern California affected by wildfires and straight-line winds that began Jan. 7.\n\nThese taxpayers in California now have until Oct. 15 to file their 2024 returns and pay their federal income taxes, based on disaster relief in any area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nMany times, people want to file early to obtain their refund money. But many will wait, nonetheless, if they're dealing with the aftermath of a disaster.\n\nMake no mistake, plenty of people have filed their tax returns early this year. The IRS data indicated that the agency received 23.58 million returns through Feb. 7. The IRS processed 23.5 million returns through the first two weeks.\n\nIt is key to note, though, that the IRS number for total tax returns processed includes tax returns received in the prior or current year and processed in 2025. The IRS hasn't processed nearly every 2024 tax return that it has received this year.\n\nMatt Hetherwick, chief program officer for the nonprofit Accounting Aid Society in Detroit, said overall the nonprofit is actually seeing an increase in the number of tax returns prepared during the first weeks of this year's tax season.\n\n\"Our appointment scheduling is also seeing an increase in demand when compared to the same time last year,\" Hetherwick said.\n\nMuch of the tax work, he said, seems to be on track at this point.\n\n\"It is still very early in the filing season, so the earliest of filers would typically just now be getting refunds back,\" Hetherwick said.\n\n\"We are busy, and we have not received any calls from clients concerned with the length of time it's taken to receive their tax refund.\"\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

Martin's \"Fire & Blood\" book, ended its second season on Sunday. The latest season, which premiered June 16, followed the ongoing fight for the Iron Throne of Westeros and was \"uneven but often rousing.\"\n\nSome fans were disappointed after what was seen as an abrupt and uneventful conclusion to the second season. But viewers should expect an action-packed third season, which is likely to kick off with a bang when it finally premieres.\n\nJoin our Watch Party!

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhat will the plot of 'House of the Dragon' Season 3 be?\n\nFans anxious to see what happens next in \"House of the Dragon\" can read Martin's \"Fire & Blood,\" which includes the entire storyline of the series.\n\nBut those let down by the lack of major battles in the Season 2 finale can take comfort in the fact that based on the book, a highly anticipated one should come early in Season 3, perhaps as soon as the first or second episode. Part of the reason some fans were disappointed by the finale is many expected this battle, plus one other major event from the book that's coming up soon, to occur in Season 2.\n\nDuring a featurette that aired after Sunday's finale, showrunner Ryan Condal teased that while Season 2 was about the \"fits and starts\" of war, Season 3 will be \"about total war.\"\n\n'Could've been an email': House of the Dragon finale leaves fans wanting more\n\n'House of the Dragon' renewed for Season 3\n\nDespite fan disappointment with the Season 2 finale, the series isn't going anywhere, as \"House of the Dragon\" was renewed for Season 3 ahead of the Season 2 premiere.\n\n\"George, Ryan, and the rest of our incredible executive producers, cast, and crew, have reached new heights with the phenomenal second season of 'House of the Dragon,'\" said HBO programming Executive Vice President Francesca Orsi in a statement. \"We are in awe of the dragon-sized effort the entire team has put into the creation of a spectacular season two, with a scope and scale that is only rivaled by its heart. We could not be more thrilled to continue the story of House Targaryen and watch this team burn bright again for season three.\"\n\nThe series is led by Martin as co-creator and executive producer with co-creator, showrunner and executive producer Ryan Condal.\n\nWhen does 'House of the Dragon' Season 3 premiere on HBO?\n\n\"House of the Dragon\" Season 3 has not yet received a premiere date on HBO.\n\nBut on Monday, according to Variety, Condal confirmed that the season will go into production in early 2025. After the long wait between Season 1 and Season 2, fans shouldn't expect to see Season 3 before 2026. Season 2 began production in April 2023 and premiered in June 2024, so based on that timeline, Season 3 could be eying a return around summer 2026.\n\nIn the meantime, another \"Game of Thrones\" prequel series, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\" will air on HBO in 2025. Based on Martin's \"Tales of Dunk and Egg,\" it follows the adventures of a knight named Ser Duncan the Tall and Prince Aegon Targaryen. A brief teaser for the show was released on Sunday.\n\nHow many seasons will 'House of the Dragon' last?\n\nIn a press conference on Monday, Condal addressed how many seasons \"House of the Dragon\" will last. \"I think it's four,\" he said, according to Entertainment Weekly.\n\nMartin previously said he expects \"House of the Dragon\" to last at least four seasons.\n\n\"It is going to take four full seasons of 10 episodes each to do justice to the Dance of the Dragons, from start to finish,\" the author wrote on his blog in 2022. In January, Martin also said he had been discussing the \"third and fourth seasons\" with Condal and the show's writers.\n\nIn a 2023 interview with Deadline, Orsi said the series will likely not have \"any less than four\" seasons and teased that there \"could be more.\"\n\n'Game of Thrones' star Kit Harington says Jon Snow spinoff is no longer in the works\n\nWill there be any new characters in 'House of the Dragon' Season 3?\n\nFor book readers, one of the biggest questions throughout Season 2 was when, or if, the show would introduce Nettles.\n\nIn \"Fire & Blood,\" Nettles is a major fan-favorite character who comes into play during the \"dragonseed\" storyline, in which numerous new dragonriders come forward. Described in the book as a \"small brown girl\" who grew up homeless, she was nowhere to be found in Season 2. The events of Sunday's finale strongly suggested that Nettles has been cut from the show, with aspects of her storyline given to Daemon's daughter Rhaena instead.\n\nOne character expected to be introduced in Season 3, though, is Alicent's other son Daeron. He has remained off screen for the entire series but was mentioned in Season 2, and his dragon Tessarion could be seen at the end of the finale, suggesting his proper introduction is imminent. No casting for Daeron has been announced.\n\nHow to watch 'House of the Dragon' Season 2 on HBO, Max\n\nThe Emmy-winning series airs on HBO. The show's first two seasons are also available to stream on Max, HBO's streaming platform, in full.\n\n'House of the Dragon' cast members: Matt Smith, Olivia Cooke, more\n\nRead on for the cast of \"House of the Dragon\" Season 2 and their characters:\n\nMatt Smith as Daemon Targaryen\n\nOlivia Cooke as adult Alicent Hightower\n\nEmma D’Arcy as adult Rhaenyra Targaryen\n\nEve Best as Rhaenys Targaryen\n\nSteve Toussaint as Corlys Velaryon\n\nFabien Frankel as Ser Criston Cole\n\nEwan Mitchell as Aemond Targaryen\n\nTom Glynn-Carney as Aegon Targaryen\n\nSonoya Mizuno as Mysaria\n\nRhys Ifans as Otto Hightower\n\nHarry Collett as Jacaerys Velaryon\n\nBethany Antonia as Baela Targaryen\n\nPhoebe Campbell as Rhaena Targaryen\n\nPhia Saban as Halaena Targaryen\n\nJefferson Hall as Tyland and Jason Lannister\n\nMatthew Needham as Larys Strong\n\nKurt Egyiawan as Grand Maester Orwyle\n\nElliott and Luke Tittensor as Erryk and Arryk Cargyll\n\nBobby the dog\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/fsu/football/2024/09/21/florida-state-california-game-score-live-updates-cal-fsu-football-highlights/75268266007/", "title": "Defense leads Florida State football to first victory: Final score ...", "text": "Today marks the first-ever meeting between Florida State football (0-3) and California (3-0) in program history.

Last season, FSU QB DJ Uiagalelei faced the Golden Bears when he played for Oregon State, completing 19 of his 25 passes for 275 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nCal is looking to continue its winning spree after beating San Diego State 31-10 last week.

Coe is 3 for 5 in field goal attempts.\n\nFlorida State football recaptures lead after touchdown pass by DJ Uiagalelei\n\nFSU QB DJ Uiagalelei throws an accurate 36-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ja'Khi Douglas.

After putting in 14 plays and 55 yards of offense, Cal ended up scoreless after Ryan Coe missed a 36-yard field goal.

The Seminoles take the first lead, 7-0, with 7:47 left in the first quarter.\n\nFSU's running back Kam Davis injured on the field\n\nInjuries are the last thing FSU needs on offense. Kam Davis was down on the field after a five-yard run, and trainers were looking at the true freshman.\n\nFortunately, he could get back up and walk back to the sidelines. Davis is starting his first career in place of Roydell Williams, who was ruled out before kickoff.\n\nJoshua Farmer sacks Cal QB Fernando Mendoza\n\nJoshua Farmer set the tone for FSU's defense, sacking Fernando Mendoza on second and long. It eventually led the Golden Bears to punt the ball.\n\nCal punted the ball after being called for illegal motion following a completed pass to Jaydn Ott. The Seminoles will get the back after going three and out on their opening series.\n\nFlorida State football announces starting lineup\n\nOffense\n\nQB: DJ Uiagalelei\n\nRB: Kam Davis, Lawrance Toafili\n\nWR: Malik Benson, Hakeem Williams, Ja'Khi Douglas\n\nTE: Kyle Morlock\n\nO-Line: Darius Washington, Richie Leonard IV, Maurice Smith, TJ Ferguson, Jaylen Early\n\nDefense\n\nD-Line: Patrick Payton, Marvin Jones Jr., Darrell Jackson, Joshua Farmer\n\nLBs: DJ Lundy, Black Nichelson\n\nDBs: Azareye'h Thomas, Fentrell Cypress, K.J.

Their starting quarterback is Fernando Mendoza.\n\nFSU vs Cal history\n\nThis is the first meeting between Florida State and California.\n\nFSU vs Cal predictions\n\nLiam Rooney, Tallahassee Democrat: Cal 23, FSU 17\n\n\"Cal leaves Tallahassee with the program's first-ever ACC victory, and first win over the Seminoles in program history. While FSU will show a continued improvement defensively, a returning Ott will power the Golden Bears to victory on the ground. While Uiagalelei won't have the five-touchdown performance he had for Oregon State vs. Cal last season, he'll lead a scoring drive and the defense will score on a pick-six. However, while it will be an improved offensive showing, it won't be enough as another slow start proves costly.\"\n\nPeter Holland Jr., Tallahassee Democrat: FSU 20, Cal 17\n\n\"I don't think Uiagalelei will have a five-touchdown performance like the last time he saw the Golden Bears and Cal's defense is better than last year. However, this could be the game where Uiagalelei turns on the switch and orchestrates enough plays at the end to finish drives. It could come down to the wire, and Ryan Fitzgerald will give FSU the game-winner. A desperate win will be earned at Doak Campbell Stadium.\"\n\nAustin Veazey, SI.com: Cal 23, FSU 15\n\n\"Picking Florida State is futile until they prove they're worth picking. I don't care if the water breaks have been better (if you know, you know). I'm assuming this will be similar to the Georgia Tech and Boston College games, with Cal controlling the ball on the ground with limited possessions.

Major movie releases will include a star-studded \"Superman,\" several offerings from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a third installment of the \"Avatar\" franchise at the end of the year.\n\nThe year will also see major criminal trials, including those of Diddy and Luigi Mangione, and a potential ban on one of the most popular social media apps in the country.\n\nHere's some of what you can expect in 2025.\n\nThe demure social media trends of 2024: 'Who TF Did I Marry,' brat summer and Moo Deng\n\nJimmy Carter's funeral\n\nOn Sunday, former president and Nobel Prize winner Jimmy Carter died at age 100 in Plains, Georgia, in the home he shared with his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn, who died in November 2023.\n\nFuneral services for the former president will be held in Georgia and Washington, D.C., from Saturday, Jan. 4, through Thursday, Jan. 9.\n\nIn Americus, Georgia, a motorcade will pick up Carter's casket and progress to Plains, then Atlanta, where Carter will lie in state for mourners to pay respects. He will eventually make his way to the U.S. Capitol and the Washington National Cathedral, where a national funeral service will be held.\n\nFlags will also remain at half-staff for 30 days after his death, a timeline that overlaps Trump's inauguration.\n\nTikTok ban?\n\nThis spring, President Joe Biden passed legislation that would ban the hugely popular social media app TikTok in January if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, does not sell it. The legislation has been in the works for several years because of fears that TikTok compromises national security.\n\nIf ByteDance does not sell TikTok by Jan. 19, the app will be illegal for distribution through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Internet service providers also will be required to make the app inaccessible on U.S. internet browsers.\n\nIn a last-minute decision, however, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments from TikTok and its parent company about why a ban could be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court is set to review TikTok's arguments on Jan. 10, just over a week before the ban could be put in place.\n\nThough China has been vocal about its opposition to selling TikTok, billionaire Frank McCourt has expressed his interest in purchasing the U.S. portion of the platform with a group of associates. McCourt, founder of Project Liberty and executive chairman of McCourt Global, said a consortium of associates has verbally pledged up to $20 billion for the purchase.\n\nBut if McCourt purchased TikTok, it would be only the U.S. portion and would not include TikTok's algorithm, which China sees as its intellectual property, McCourt told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" earlier this month.\n\nPresidential inauguration of Donald Trump\n\nIn January, Trump will begin his second, nonconsecutive term as the 47th president of the United States.\n\nTrump will officially take over executive control of the country amid highly choreographed ceremonies on Jan. 20, which coincides with Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nIt starts in the morning when Biden is expected to welcome Trump to the White House, as is custom. Around noon, the chief justice of the United States will administer the oath of office in a public ceremony at the U.S. Capitol. Trump will then deliver his inaugural address.\n\nAfter the swearing-in, a traditional parade moves along Pennsylvania Avenue, featuring military bands, civic organizations and representatives from across the nation.\n\nThe day ends with inaugural balls and receptions.\n\nCriminal trials: Diddy, Luigi Mangione\n\nAmerican rapper and superstar Sean \"Diddy\" Combs will face the start of his federal sex crimes trial on May 5. He was indicted on sex trafficking and racketeering charges and faces claims from more than 100 accusers.\n\nCombs was arrested at a Manhattan hotel Sept. 16 and arraigned the next day. He has maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty on all federal criminal charges, despite mounting civil lawsuits over the past year. He has been incarcerated in the Special Housing Unit at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center since his arrest.\n\nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the court the prosecution's case would last at least three weeks. The defense case is expected to take a week, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo said.\n\nLuigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson to death on Dec 4, also faces a criminal trial in 2025. Mangione has been charged in federal court, Pennsylvania state court and New York state court.\n\nIn the New York case, Mangione faces 11 charges, including first-degree murder in furtherance of terrorism, two counts of second-degree murder, including one as an act of terrorism, and a slew of weapons charges. In Pennsylvania, he was charged with forgery and illegally possessing an unlicensed gun, among others, while his federal charges include murder and interstate stalking.\n\nThe federal charges could bring a death sentence if Mangione is convicted.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty.\n\n'Wicked' Part 2\n\nThe second part of the two-act release, called “Wicked: For Good,” is set for release on Nov. 21 − one year (minus a day) after the first installment.\n\n\"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: Part 2\" were shot back-to-back from December 2022 to January 2024, according to Forbes, which means the second installment of \"Wicked\" has already been filmed.\n\nThe third Avatar installment\n\nThe third installment of the \"Avatar\" series, \"Avatar: Fire and Ash,\" hits theaters Dec. 19, three years after \"Way of Water\" was released and just about 15 years after the original 2009 film.\n\nLike \"Way of Water,\" \"Fire and Ash\" will introduce viewers to a whole new tribe of Na'vi called \"The Ash People,\" according to multiple outlets, including Parade and Variety. As the name suggests, this tribe has a culture that revolves around fire, a direct contrast to the water tribe of the previous film.\n\n“You’ll see a lot more Pandora that you never saw before,” director James Cameron told Variety.\n\nStars include Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Kate Winslet and Michelle Yeoh.\n\nMore movie and TV releases\n\nThere is no shortage of media releases to anticipate in 2025, from revamps of classic shows to long-awaited new seasons and big-screen premiers.\n\nDates TBD: “Stranger Things,\" \"You,\" “Squid Game\" Season 3 (Season 2 arrived in December), \"Wednesday,\" \"Monster,\" \"The Last of Us,\" “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” “Welcome to Derry,\" “The Handmaid’s Tale,\" “What Not to Wear” reunion, “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\" \"The Bear\" and “Welcome to Wrexham.\"\n\nJan. 2: A modern revamp of \"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\" will air on ABC.\n\nJan. 27: \"The Bachelor\" returns to ABC.\n\nFeb. 14: Season three of \"Yellowjackets\" comes to Parmount+ with Showtime.\n\nFeb 16: \"White Lotus\" returns to HBO.\n\nFeb 26: Season 48 of \"Survivor\" begins on CBS.\n\nApril 22: \"Andor\" Season 2 comes to Disney+.\n\nSpace exploration\n\nSpace agencies like NASA and SpaceX have some major missions planned for the upcoming year.\n\nElon Musk is pushing for SpaceX to significantly ramp up Starship test launches in 2025, a proposal that would quintuple the flight tests of the SpaceX megarocket from five demonstrations in 2024 to 25 next year. Musk's request would need approval from federal regulators.\n\nSpaceX envisions the powerful spacecraft being a fully reusable transportation system that can carry humans and cargo to Earth's orbit, the moon and even Mars. Though SpaceX is rapidly preparing for its flight test, the company has not yet announced a target date.\n\nAlso, a commercial lunar lander will soon be heading to the moon with a fleet of scientific instruments for a $93.3 million NASA mission to study the moon's environment before humans return.\n\nThe lander's instruments will examine the lunar subsurface and global navigation satellite abilities, among other questions. The data NASA hopes to collect also should provide insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect Earth.\n\nNASA's cutting-edge SPHEREx telescope is also on the cusp of launching on a mission to solve some of the universe's oldest mysteries – including how it came to be. The telescope, which has a $242 million price tag, was developed to survey more than 450 million galaxies and 100 million stars in our own Milky Way. Some galaxies it will observe are so distant that their light has taken 10 billion years to reach Earth.\n\nThe two-year mission will launch no earlier than late February.\n\nLikewise, the first step in establishing the world’s first commercial space station will come as early as August. Vast, a space company based in Long Beach, California, announced in 2023 that it plans to launch its space station, called Haven-1.\n\nThe mission will be quickly followed by Vast-1, the first human spaceflight mission to Haven-1. The four-person crew will ride a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft to dock with the station for up to 30 days while orbiting Earth, according to Vast.\n\nBoeing Starliner astronauts to return on SpaceX vehicle\n\nNASA's Starliner astronauts will make their long-awaited homecoming to Earth as early as the end of March.\n\nSuni Williams and Butch Wilmore weren't supposed to be at the International Space Station beyond a few days in June when they reached the orbital outpost on the inaugural flight test for Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. But their return was delayed multiple times until NASA finally decided in August that the safest route would be to send the pair back to Earth on a SpaceX Dragon vehicle.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner undocked in September without the astronauts and landed in the New Mexico desert.\n\nThe Starliner astronauts were set to return in February with two spacefarers who are part of a SpaceX mission called Crew-9. But earlier in December, NASA opted to delay that return until late March to give time to ready the Dragon vehicle that will ferry their replacements to the space station.\n\nNo historic eclipse, but more space events to come\n\nThe year will begin with a \"planet parade\" during which Venus, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars all shine brightly every night after sunset in January and February. In January and February, look for Venus and Saturn in the southwestern sky and Jupiter and Mars toward the southeast.\n\nOn Jan. 13, a lunar occultation of Mars will be visible in the U.S. A lunar occultation occurs when the moon passes in front of a star or planet and blocks its light for about an hour before moving on its way around the Earth.\n\nMarch 13-14 will see the only total lunar eclipse visible from the United States in 2025. A total lunar eclipse occurs when Earth comes directly between the sun and full moon and casts a shadow onto the lunar surface.\n\nOn April 22-23 and Oct. 21-22, the annual Lyrid and Orionid meteor showers will appear in the night sky.\n\nThe year's lunar events will wrap on Nov. 5 with a supermoon.\n\nAward shows\n\nOne consistent we know we can look forward to every year without fail: awards season. This year's shows will play out on the following schedule:\n\nSunday, Jan. 5: 82nd Annual Golden Globe Awards\n\nSunday, Feb. 2: 67th Grammy Awards\n\nSaturday, Feb. 8: Director and Producer Guild of America Awards\n\nSunday, Feb. 16: BAFTA Film Awards\n\nSunday, Feb. 23: 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards\n\nSunday, March 2: 97th Academy Awards\n\nSeptember (TBD): 77th Emmy Awards\n\nContributing: J.

The Democratic and Republican nominees also both held rallies in the same city, Milwaukee.\n\nU.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies announced Friday that a widely shared video purporting to show a Haitian man claiming he's illegally voted in Georgia is a piece of Russian disinformation − and they warned Americans to get ready for more as Nov. 5 draws closer.\n\nAnd Democrats piled onto Trump for comments he made about former Rep. Liz Cheney, using violent imagery to say she should personally face armed combat for supporting U.S. military interventions overseas.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage.\n\nHarris campaign claims late-deciding voters are breaking to VP\n\nThe Harris campaign touted momentum Friday among late-deciding voters who have made their decisions on who to support over the last week.\n\nA senior Harris campaign official cited internal data suggesting Harris is winning these voters over Trump by \"double digits.\" The official pointed to Trump's recent campaign rally at New York's Madison Square Garden, which included racist comments from some speakers, as a galvanizing moment that \"crystalized the choice\" for many voters.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, disputed the trend, accusing the Harris campaign of \"trying to change the narrative about their sinking ship.\"\n\n\"What part of the last week would encourage people to get out and vote for Kamala Harris?\" Leavitt said, singling out President Joe Biden's controversial \"garbage\" remark about Trump supporters. \"Kamala Harris has had bad news cycle after bad news cycle because she's a terrible candidate and no one has been inspired to vote for her.”\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nMajority of Pennsylvania Latino voters support Harris, said Trump comedian’s remarks were ‘racist,’ new poll says\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is leading with a majority of Latino voters in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, according to a new Noticias Univision/YouGov poll, as former President Donald Trump faces fallout from a racist joke about Puerto Ricans and Latinos made at his rally on Sunday.\n\nNearly two-thirds (65%) of Latino voters said they would vote for Harris if the election were held today, compared to the 30% who said they would support Trump, the poll of Hispanic voters said. More than half, 54%, of respondents described Trump as “very disrespectful.”\n\nTony Hinchliffe, a comedian who goes by the stage name Kill Tony, called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” and made other offensive jokes about Latinos and Black Americans at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday. Trump was met with backlash, including among Puerto Rican voters in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he held a rally two days later.\n\nThe poll found 70% of Latinos in the state thought the remark was more racist than humorous. Only 16% said they saw the comment intended as a joke rather than serious commentary. More than three in four (77%) of Puerto Ricans in Pennsylvania believe Trump is very disrespectful to Latinos.\n\nBoth Harris and Trump will be heading to the state in the closing days of the election. Harris will stop in Allentown, Pennsylvania, a city with a large Puerto Rican population, on Monday, her last day on the campaign trail.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nDon Jr. joins Vance on campaign trail\n\nDonald Trump Jr. made a surprise appearance at JD Vance’s rally Friday afternoon in Selma, N.C.\n\nGiving remarks on stage after Vance, the former president’s eldest son encouraged voters in the southern swing state to turn out in these final days of the election.\n\n“We got to vote, like you’re the third monkey in line for the arc and it’s starting to rain,” Trump Jr. told supporters in a reference to the biblical story of Noah's Arc.\n\n-Savannah Kuchar\n\nRapper Cardi B rips Trump for 'hustling women'\n\nRapper Cardi B said she wasn’t going to vote this year. But Harris joining the race changed her mind.\n\n“She’s passionate, she’s compassionate, she shows empathy, and most of all, she is not delusional,” the singer said Friday.\n\nAmong the problems she said she believed that Harris would tackle is the high cost of living. “It’s even high for me,” she said at a Milwaukee rally for Harris.\n\nHarris will ban price gouging on food and groceries, she told them. “And she told me that to my face. So she better not lie to my face,” she added.\n\nShe also hit Trump for saying he’d protect women whether they like it or not. “I don’t play that,” she said during extended remarks on the topic.\n\nIf his version of protecting women is not the freedom of choice, she said, “I don’t want it.”\n\n“We all knew Trump was a hustler – but hustling women – and I’m a hustler – but hustling women out of their rights to their body is nasty work,” she said.\n\nToday, he’s hustling sneakers, tomorrow it’s your healthcare rights, the rapper added. “He’s going to take it away from you. He’s going to snatch it,” she said. “America, the only concept of a plan he has, is a plan to hustle you.”\n\n“He’s selling more than watches. And sneakers. He’s selling us bigotry, misogyny, division, chaos and confusion,” she said.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nTech problems: Trump complains about mic in Milwaukee\n\nTrump referenced issues with his microphone throughout his Milwaukee speech Friday evening. Early on, Trump yanked the microphone from the stand, after some in the crowd shouted about not being able to hear him.\n\n“Yeah, I think the mic stinks,” Trump said.\n\n“And then we don’t pay the contractor,” he added. “I say don’t pay the contractor, then they write a story, ‘Trump doesn’t pay his bills. He’s a bad guy.’”\n\nTrump has a history of accusations, and lawsuits, against him, alleging that he’s failed to pay his bills. He made similar microphone complaints earlier Friday during his stop in Warren, Mich.\n\nLater in his remarks, Trump complained, “I’ve never held a microphone up so long in my damn life. It’s like I’m weightlifting. This sucker’s heavy.”\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nGeorgia county ordered to accept ballots after Election Day\n\nA Georgia judge ruled Friday that Cobb County, which is near Atlanta, must continue to accept absentee ballots that are postmarked by 7 p.m. EDT on Election Day, Nov. 5, and arrive before 5 p.m. EDT on Nov. 8 for voters who were sent their ballots late.\n\nThat matches the receipt deadline that is already in place for overseas and uniformed Georgia voters. Judge Robert E. Flournoy III also called for segregating the ballots at issue that arrive in the new window of permitted time, which could be a precaution in case there are further questions or litigation about them.\n\nThe order comes the same day the ACLU and Southern Poverty Law Center sued Cobb County election officials, who already admitted that, as of Wednesday, there were more than 3,000 requested ballots that hadn't been sent out. The officials said there was an equipment issue, but most of the ballots would be sent by express or overnight mail by Friday with prepaid express return envelopes.\n\nFlournoy required the officials to meet their pledge, and also ordered them to notify affected voters where possible that the ballots had been sent out and the voters could also vote in person on Election Day, Tuesday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPennsylvania court orders remedies for nearly 20,000 missing absentee ballots\n\nA Pennsylvania court ordered the Erie County Board of Elections on Friday to offer new absentee ballots to nearly 20,000 voters who didn’t receive them and stay open for longer office hours until Election Day to receive them.\n\nCourt of Common Pleas Judge David Ridge ordered the remedy after holding a hearing Thursday about problems the election office and its vendor, ElectionIQ, had in delivering ballots through the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nThe number of missing ballots in just one county of the key battleground state is potentially significant. Former President Donald Trump won the state by about 40,000 votes in 2016 and President Joe Biden won it by about 80,000 votes in 2020.\n\nThe vendor couldn’t confirm the status of 13,000 to 17,000 absentee ballots that were requested before the deadline, Ridge wrote.\n\nIn addition, 1,200 county residents who requested ballots from being temporarily out of state said they hadn’t received ballots, Ridge wrote.\n\nAnd 365 duplicate ballots were sent to voters with barcodes that matched different voters, Ridge wrote.\n\nTo remedy the problem, the Court of Common Pleas in Erie ordered the elections office in the county courthouse to:\n\n- Stay open longer on Friday and Monday, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\n- Provide the voters with missing ballots new ones that could be returned to the office or a drop box there.\n\n- Send new ballots to out-of-state voters by overnight mail.\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nPennsylvania holds firm on wrong date absentee ballots\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court reiterated its previously rulings Friday that county election officials not count absentee ballots that are undated or mistakenly dated, overturning a lower-court decision in Philadelphia that said the ballots should be counted.\n\nThe unsigned decision said courts shouldn’t change election rules so close to the Nov. 5 election. The state had 2.1 million absentee ballots approved and nearly 1.5 million returned by Wednesday, but it won’t be clear how many have mistaken dates until they are processed on Election Day on Tuesday.\n\nState law prohibits counting ballots with missing or mistaken dates. The state Supreme Court upheld the law in September and October.\n\nBut a Commonwealth Court decision found that ballots with date mistakes in a Philadelphia special election should be counted despite “meaningless dating provisions” in state law. The Supreme Court blocked that decision for the general election.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley called the decision “another big win for election integrity.”\n\n“The Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the law, and the dated ballot requirement will be in effect for this election,” Whatley said. “Democrats have repeatedly tried to eliminate this important ballot safeguard, and we have stopped them each time.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump makes direct appeal to Black voters in Michigan\n\nTrump repeated his criticized claims that migrants are taking jobs from African Americans, during a speech in Warren, Mich., Friday.\n\nAnd he touted his first administration’s record in a direct appeal to Black voters.\n\n“With the exception of, who? Abraham Lincoln. I did more as president for the Black population than any other president in the history of our country,” Trump told the crowd.\n\nThe former president has previously highlighted the historically low unemployment rate for Black Americans when he was in the White House. But the record for lowest unemployment rate for Black Americans in U.S. history now belongs to President Joe Biden.\n\n-Savannah Kuchar\n\nGeorgia county election board members sued for not sending 3,000 absentee ballots\n\nThe ACLU and Southern Poverty Law Center on Friday sued election board members for Georgia's Cobb County, which is near Atlanta, for failing to send out 3,000 absentee ballots that were requested on time.\n\nThe legal groups want a Georgia court to order the board members to send the ballots through overnight mail and to include overnight return mailing for voters. They also want the ballots accepted as long as they are postmarked by Election Day, Nov. 5, and received by Nov. 8 – Georgia's current deadline to receive ballots for overseas and uniformed voters. The current receipt deadline for the absentee ballots is Election Day.\n\nIn a Thursday press release, the elections board admitted to the mistake, faulting some of its equipment. It said more than 3,000 requested absentee ballots hadn't been mailed as of Wednesday, and it will send most of them through express or overnight mail by Friday morning with prepaid express return envelopes. It noted voters who haven't received their absentee ballots can still vote in person.\n\n“Our team has been working around the clock to get the ballots out,\" Cobb County Elections Director Tate Fall said in a statement included in the press release.\n\nThe legal groups said Friday that the board's proposed fixes for voters \"are not nearly enough to safeguard their right to vote.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nArizona attorney general to investigate Trump’s Cheney comments\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said Friday that her office will probe if remarks Trump made about former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney violates the law.\n\n“I have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona's laws,” Mayes, a Democrat, told NBC affiliate 12News.\n\nCheney, who was top Republian on the special House panel that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol and Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election, has campaigned for Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump made the remarks during an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson at a campaign stop in Glendale, Arizona, on Thursday.\n\n“She’s a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK?,” he said. “Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.”\n\nLater, Trump clarified: “All I’m saying about Liz Cheney is that she is a War Hawk, and a dumb one at that, but she wouldn’t have ‘the guts’ to fight herself,” he said on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n“There’s no true threat here. No call to commence imminent violence,” Anthony Kreis, a law professor at Georgia State University said in a social media post. “His statement was vile, repugnant, and corrosive to our politics, but it is protected speech.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi and Bart Jansen\n\nHarris: Trump’s violent rhetoric ‘must be disqualifying’\n\nHarris on Friday condemned Trump’s comments that former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney should face armed combat over her support for U.S. wars overseas, saying that it “must be disqualifying” for the presidency.\n\n“He has increased his violent rhetoric − Donald Trump has − about political opponents and in great detail, in great detail, suggested rifles should be trained on former Rep. Liz Cheney. This must be disqualifying,” she told reporters ahead of a rally in Wisconsin.\n\nHarris added that any candidate who uses that kind of “violent” rhetoric is “clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president.”\n\nTrump made his remarks in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson at a campaign event in Glendale, Arizona.\n\n“She’s a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK?,” he said. “Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.”\n\nThe White House on Friday also condemned Trump’s remarks, calling them unacceptable.\n\n“There is no place anywhere for any type of violence,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. “And this is a time we shouldn’t be using inflammatory language. We should be specifically focusing on bringing the country together, and that’s what the president wants to see.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi and Michael Collins\n\nTrump: Kennedy will have 'big role in healthcare'\n\nAt a campaign stop in Dearborn, Mich., Friday, Trump was fielding questions from the press when former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared beside him.\n\nGesturing to Kennedy, Trump told reporters, \"He's going to have a big role in healthcare.\"\n\nKennedy is perhaps best known for his anti-vaccine advocacy and conspiracy theories.\n\n]In 2023, the New York Post published a video of Kennedy, the son of slain Sen. Robert Kennedy and a nephew of the assassinated President John F. Kennedy, speculating that Covid-19 had been engineered to spare people of Jewish and Chinese heritage.\n\n“COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people,\" he said in the video. \"The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.”\n\nIn a call with supporters earlier this week, Kennedy said Trump had \"promised\" him control of public health agencies. But a Trump transition team co-chair walked that back days later, telling CNN that Kennedy would not be named to any such position.\n\nTrump on Friday said he agrees with many of Kennedy's ideas, without giving specifics.\n\nHarris criticized Trump over the potential decision, telling reporters in Wisconsin Friday that Kennedy is \"the exact last person in America who should be setting health care policy for America’s families and children.”\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\n'He's talking about sharks': Milwaukee mayor mocks Trump\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson made fun of former President Donald Trump on Friday night for his tendency to get off topic at his rallies.\n\nJohnson began the riff by slamming Trump for reportedly calling the city “horrible” in a closed-door meeting with Republican lawmakers earlier in the year.\n\n“He called us horrible,” Jones said. “This man… he’s out there, he’s rambling on and on, he’s talking about sharks and batteries, he’s talking about Hannibal Lecter.”\n\nHe continued, “He’s talking about immigrants who are, on the one hand, coming from insane asylums, and on the other hand, taking your jobs. Which that doesn’t really compute to me. How can somebody come from an insane asylum and also take a job? I don’t really get that.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\n'Please talk to your friends,' Harris tells voters in Wisconsin\n\nVice President Kamala Harris’ supporters in Little Chute, Wisconsin, are voting, at least according to a show of hands at her Friday evening rally in the town that’s close to Green Bay.\n\n“We’re four days out. Who here has already voted,” Harris asked.\n\nHands shot up in the crowd and Harris received loud cheers and applause. “Oh wow,” she said in response, laughing. “Oh my goodness, that’s great, thank you.”\n\n“I want to ask a little more of you. Please talk to your friends, family, and neighbors,” she said.\n\nHarris added, “For anyone who’s not yet voted, no judgment.”\n\nIt was Harris’ second rally of the day in Wisconsin, where more than 700,000 people had voted early as of Thursday morning. She had one earlier in Janesville and will speak in the evening in a suburb of Milwaukee.\n\n— Francesca Chambers\n\nWomen’s March to host events Saturday before election\n\nThousands are expected to attend a #WeWontGoBack march in the nation’s capital and at locations across the country Saturday.\n\nAttendees in Washington plan to march from Freedom Plaza to the White House beginning at 3 p.m. ET. The event will also feature mobile truck billboards reading, “We Won’t Back Down on Abortion,” according to organizers.\n\nThe march falls three days before the Nov. 5 election, capping a race that has been defined by a historic gender divide.\n\nThe Women’s March started as a worldwide protest on Jan. 21, 2017, the day after former President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Crowd scientists estimated the Washington march drew over 470,000 people and that millions participated in local marches nationwide.\n\n−Rachel Barber\n\nClimate change on voters’ minds after hurricanes, poll finds\n\nVoters in states affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton might be thinking more about climate change when they cast a ballot next Tuesday.\n\nIn North Carolina, Florida, and Georgia, 32% of voters said recent storms made climate a more important issue, according to a Climate Cabinet poll released Friday. That is 4% higher than the national average.\n\nAcross the country, 51% of respondents said they believed extreme weather events are becoming more frequent because of man-made climate change. Only 21% said an increase in extreme weather events is not caused by man-made climate change.\n\nThe poll of 1,000 voters in each state, totaling 3,000, had a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points. The national poll of 2,000 adults had a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points.\n\n−Rachel Barber\n\nRussian misinformation video gaining traction in Georgia, intelligence officials say\n\nA video claiming that Haitian nationals are voting illegally in multiple counties in Georgia is a work Russian misinformation, multiple intelligence agencies wrote in a joint statement Friday.\n\nThe statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Cyber Infrastructure and Security Agency, and the FBI came in addition to public comments from the Georgia Secretary of State’s office identifying the video as false.\n\n“This Russian activity is part of Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the US election and stoke divisions among Americans,” the statement said, warning that the coming days could see “additional media content that seeks to undermine trust in the integrity of the election and divide Americans.”\n\nGabriel Sterling, chief operations officer for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, also refuted the claims on X after it was shared to the account of Amy Kremer, a Georgia resident whose organization coordinated Donald Trump's Jan. 6, 2021, rally on the Ellipse.\n\n“No responsible person would retweet this ridiculously obvious lie and disinformation,” Sterling said. “Those doing so are acting to further the efforts of America’s enemies and undermine the security of our nation.”\n\n−Erin Mansfield\n\nSchumer predicts Dem Senate wins in Texas, Florida and... Nebraska?\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told supporters earlier this week that he thinks Democrats could flip three seats on Election Day, despite the party's steep odds to retain control of the chamber.\n\nDemocrats have \"decent changes\" of picking up Texas, Florida and Nebraska, Schumer said during a virtual rally Wednesday. The remarks were first reported by POLITICO.\n\nHowever, the candidate running against incumbent GOP Sen. Deb Fischer in Nebraska is a registered nonpartisan and has said he won't caucus with either party. Independent candidate Dan Osborn told POLITICO Friday that Schumer will get \"a rude awakening if he thinks I'm taking orders from him.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is running against Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, while Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., is up against former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. Both GOP candidates have a small advantage in the polls against their Democratic opponents.\n\n-- Riley Beggin\n\nVance opens Michigan rally with shot at Mark Cuban\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance opened his rally in Portage, Michigan, on Friday by taking on billionaire Mark Cuban’s comments that Trump doesn’t surround himself with “strong, intelligent women, ever.”\n\nThe vice presidential candidate called out his wife Usha Vance, who made an appearance with him.\n\n“I thought to myself, 'Well, Mark, you know my wife is way out of your league,'” said Vance, adding that he’s especially grateful that she’s with him at the rally.\n\n“So is Melania Trump, by the way. So is Susie Wiles, who's running the Trump campaign,” Vance said.\n\nCuban made his remarks on “The View” Thursday, and later apologized on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“When I said this during the interview, I didn't get it out exactly the way I thought I did,” he wrote.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nLegendary presidential forecaster has 'crows' in his stomach\n\nHistorian Allan Lichtman, who accurately predicted nine of the last 10 presidential elections, said he still thinks Kamala Harris will beat Donald Trump but that he feels particularly anxious this year.\n\n\"I've been doing this for 42 years and every four years I have butterflies in my stomach,\" he said in a video on his YouTube channel. \"This year, I think I have a flock of crows in my stomach.\"\n\nLichtman said the candidates' neck-and-neck polling in key swing states does not make him nervous but that he is worried about the fragility of the country's democracy.\n\nBoth presidential campaigns have cast their rival as a \"threat to democracy\" during the 2024 cycle. Trump has called Harris a \"communist\" and Harris has called Trump a \"fascist.\"\n\n-- Rachel Barber\n\nHarris narrowly leads Trump in three ‘blue wall’ states, Marist polls find\n\nVice President Kamala Harris holds narrow leads in Pennsylvania, Michigan in Wisconsin four days from the presidential election, according to new polls of the three \"blue wall\" states released Friday by Marist College that show the Democratic nominee gaining with independent voters.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Harris is ahead of Republican nominee Donald Trump 50%-48% among likely voters, Marist found, and leads Trump 51%-48% in Michigan and 50%-48% in Wisconsin.\n\nThe polls − some of the most encouraging surveys for Harris in recent days − were taken Oct. 27 to Oct. 30. Each result is within the polls' margins of errors of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points in Pennsylvania, 3.5 percentage points in Michigan and 3.4 percentage points in Wisconsin.\n\nHarris is buoyed in the polls by independent voters shifting her direction. In Pennsylvania, Harris leads 55%-40% with independents, Marist found, a turnaround after Trump had a 4-point advantage with Pennsylvania's independent voters in September. Harris leads among independent voters 52%-46% in Michigan and 51%-46% in Wisconsin.\n\n--Joey Garrison\n\nTrump and Harris are both in a tight race in Nevada\n\nA new Emerson College/RealClearWorld poll released Friday found that among 700 likely voters, 48% said they would back Harris and 47% said they would back Trump. Two percent said they support a third-party, two percent said they were undecided and one percent said they won’t vote for either candidate.\n\nThe poll also highlighted the notable gender gap between the campaigns.\n\n“Men and women in Nevada break in near opposite directions,” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said in a news release. “Men break for Trump by nine percentage points, 52% to 43%, while women break for Harris by eight points, 52 to 44%.”\n\nThe poll was conducted between Oct. 29 and Oct. 31. Both candidates are within the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell says 2024 election is the tightest she’s seen\n\nMichigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell said on CNN This Morning on Friday that she’s been through enough elections to say that she’s “never seen a tighter election.”\n\nDingell famously warned Democrats during the 2016 election that then candidate Hillary Clinton was in trouble with Michigan voters, and later wrote in an op-ed that the party didn’t listen.\n\nBoth Trump and Harris are deadlocked in the state, numerous polls show. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that Harris and Trump are tied, 47% to 47%, among 500 likely voters.\n\nDingell said that Trump is working the state “very hard” and said that it was Michigan that delivered his presidency in 2016. She praised Harris for making “significant progress” with different groups including union workers.\n\n“I think that the African American community is much more engaged than I saw them a month ago. The Hispanic community, which quite frankly, wasn't as energized has become energized this week, but there are other issues on the ground, so we just have a lot of work to do between now and Tuesday night when those polls close,” Dingell said.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBrad Raffensperger warns of foreign interference in election, debunks viral video\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger issued a statement on Thurday night addressing a viral video that he said purportedly featured a Haitan immigrant claiming to have voted multiple times.\n\n“This is false and is an example of targeted disinformation we’ve seen in this and other elections,” he said. “It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the 2024 Presidential election.”\n\nHe added that the Cybsecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is investigating the origin of the video, and said it is likely “a production of Russian troll farms.”\n\nRaffensperger also called on the leaders of social media platforms, including Elon Musk, to take the video down.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSenate poll roundup: Democrats have narrow edge in Rust Belt, Southwest\n\nDemocratic Senate candidates continue to poll ahead of their GOP opponents in tight races in the Rust Belt and Southwest.\n\nIncumbent Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., polled 3 points ahead of Republican Dave McCormick in a new poll from USA TODAY and Suffolk University conducted from Oct. 27 to 30 with a margin of error of +/- 5.65 percentage points.\n\nCasey also polled ahead of McCormick by 2 percentage points in a new poll from Marist conducted Oct. 27 to 30 with a margin of error of +/- 3.4 percentage points.\n\nBecause both poll results are within the margin of error, it means the candidates could also reasonably be tied or McCormick could be slightly ahead.\n\nTwo other new polls from Marist conducted over the same time frame in Michigan and Wisconsin show Democratic candidates there -- Rep. Elissa Slotkin in Michigan and Sen. Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin -- beating their GOP opponents former Rep. Mike Rogers and businessman Eric Hovde by 6 and 3 percentage points respectively.\n\nThe Michigan poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points and the Wisconsin poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.4 percentage points.\n\nAnd incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is polling ahead of Republican nominee Sam Brown by 4 percentage points in Nevada, according to a new Emerson College poll with a margin of error of +/- 3.6 percentage points. That poll was conducted Oct. 29 to 31.\n\n-- Riley Beggin\n\nJennifer Lopez says ‘every Latino in this country’ offended by Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally\n\nActress and singer Jennifer Lopez said at Harris’ rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Thursday that Trump has “consistently worked to divide us.”\n\nShe referenced Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally, during which comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.” Lopez’s parents are both from Puerto Rico.\n\n“At Madison Square Garden, he reminded us who he really is and how he really feels,” Lopez said, referring to Trump. “It wasn’t just Puerto Ricans who were offended that day, OK? It was every Latino in this country, it was humanity and anyone of decent character.”\n\nShe then urged the crowd to get out to vote.\n\n“You know what? We should be emotional. We should be upset. We should be scared and outraged. We should. Our pain matters. We matter,” Lopez said. “Your voice and your vote matters.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nLiz Cheney blasts Trump on X for ‘war hawk’ comment\n\nFormer Republican Rep. Liz Cheney criticized Trump on X, formerly Twitter, after he called her a “war hawk” and said that guns should be “trained on her face.”\n\n“This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant,” Cheney wrote on X with the hashtags #Womenwillnotbesilenced and #VoteKamala.\n\nTrump made the comments during an interview with former Fox host Tucker Carlson at an event in Glendale, Arizona. He claimed that she wanted to keep American troops in Syria and Iraq.\n\n“She’s a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK?,” he said. “Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.”\n\nTrump’s disparaging rhetoric about his political opponents has increased with the Nov. 5 general election approaching - with the Cheney comments being the latest. He’s previously labeled his opponents “garbage” and “human scum.”\n\nCheney, one of Trump’s most vocal critics, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris and has been campaigning with her in recent weeks. She was previously the vice chair of the now-dissolved House select committee investigating the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, and has condemned the former president’s actions on that day.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow will election affect Trump's legal fate?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is involved in four criminal cases, but the most important verdict in his legal future may be delivered on Election Day on Tuesday. If he wins, all his charges could be dropped or postponed for at least four years. If he loses, he potentially faces swift sentencing in one case and trials in the other three.\n\nIf Trump were not a candidate for president, his legal trouble would be unavoidable. He is currently scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 26 on 34 felony counts in his New York hush money case. Two trials loom − one in federal court in Washington, D.C., and one in Georgia state court − on charges he tried to steal the 2020 election. In Florida, a Trump-appointed federal judge dismissed charges that Trump mishandled classified documents after leaving the White House. But that reprieve could be temporary, as prosecutors appealed the decision.\n\n-Bart Jansen and Aysha Bagchi\n\nHarris and Trump neck and neck in Pennsylvania\n\nWith days before Tuesday's Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are neck-and-neck in Pennsylvania, one of several key swing states that could determine the winner, a new exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk poll shows.\n\nHarris and Trump are tied with 49% of the vote each, according to a statewide poll of 500 likely voters conducted from Oct. 27 to 30 with a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.\n\nA poll of 300 likely voters in Erie County, which could indicate which way the state trends, was also tied 48% to 48%. Northampton County, another Pennsylvania bellwether, leaned slightly towards Trump, with 50% saying they supported him, to Harris' 48%. The results of the county polls are within the margin of error of 5.65 percentage points.\n\n--Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Karissa Waddick\n\nWhere do Trump and Harris stand in the polls?\n\nThe 2024 race for the White House is set to be neck-and-neck until Election Day. In Real Clear Politics' average of national polls, Donald Trump leads Kamala Harris by just 0.5 percentage points, well within the margin of error for each of the surveys included.\n\nIt's even closer in some of the crucial battleground states. For example, Harris leads Trump by 0.2 percentage points in Real Clear Politics' average of Wisconsin polls.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nGot election questions?

Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent Cornel West each received support from 1% of likely voters.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Harris and Trump are tied at 48%, according to a separate Quinnipiac poll of 1,108 likely Wisconsin voters taken during the same time frame.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nHarris' closing argument will be at National Mall\n\nKamala Harris will deliver a \"closing argument\" for why she believes she should be voters' choice in the 2024 election on the National Mall next Tuesday, according to a senior campaign official.\n\nHarris, a former prosecutor, will make the case for the country to turn the page away from former President Donald Trump at the Ellipse, which is the same place he delivered a fiery speech nearly four years ago before a crowd of his supporters stormed the Capital on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe VP is using the symbolic venue to make a call for voters to end Trump’s \"era of chaos and division,\" and talk about how she will pursue a new way forward, the Harris campaign official said.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nTrump: Biden's 'stupid statement' is proof of persecution\n\nPresident Biden Tuesday said, “We’ve got to lock him up,” in regards to Trump. The former president jumped on the statement at a rally in Georgia Wednesday evening, claiming Biden’s comment proves political persecution.\n\n“As I’ve said these lawsuits are being run by the Department of Justice, the FBI, Biden is behind it all, believe it or not, and he proved that yesterday with his stupid statement,” said Trump, who was convicted in May on 34 felony counts by a New York jury.\n\nTrump also faces multiple counts in three other cases involving his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents after he left office. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nBiden and Democrats have been careful to avoid commenting on Trump’s legal woes.\n\nAfter his initial comment to campaign workers in New Hampshire yesterday, Biden quickly clarified, “Politically lock him up. Lock him out. That’s what we have to do.”\n\n- Savannah Kuchar and Michael Collins\n\nHarris agrees with ex-chief of staff who says Trump is a 'fascist'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said Wednesday that she believes that former President Donald Trump is a fascist, and his ex-chief of staff is \"putting out a 9-1-1 call\" to the American people to consider the implications of his potential return to the White House.\n\nAppearing at a CNN town hall in a Delaware County in Pennsylvania, Harris invoked former White House chief of staff John Kelly's claim that Trump made positive comments about Hitler. And she agreed with Kelly's assessment that Trump is a \"fascist.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" she said. \"And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.\"\n\nHarris was responding to a question from Anderson Cooper, who asked her how she plans to convince millions of Americans that Trump made the comments.\n\nTrump's campaign has denied Kelly's account, and the former president assailed him on social media.\n\n\"I don't necessarily think that everyone has heard what you and I have heard repeatedly, which is, the people who know Donald Trump best . . . have all called him unfit and dangerous,\" Harris said.\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nColorado man pleads guilty for threatening election officials, judge\n\nA Colorado man pleaded guilty Wednesday to threatening Colorado and Arizona election officials as well as a Colorado state judge from 2021 to 2022.\n\nIt marks the latest in a string of convictions secured by the Justice Department's election threats task force against threats to election personnel that cross state lines. Teak Brockbank, who also admitted he illegally possessed multiple firearms, posted on social media in 2021 that a Colorado election official \"has to Hang by the neck till she is Dead Dead Dead.\"\n\nIn the same post, Brockbank pledged there would be accountability \"for these peoples actions,\" saying it would come from him or from others who \"understand that there life does not matter anymore with the future our country has laid out before it.\"\n\nThe election threats task force also brought charges against two other men on Monday, one for allegedly threatening an election official in Florida and the other for allegedly threatening a Pennsylvania political party representative who was recruiting poll watchers.

Kennedy, Jr., is talking about Kelly.\n\nThe former presidential candidate called Kelly a “liar” and said the former Marine Corps general “invented” stories about Trump, while on stage in Duluth, Georgia, ahead of Trump’s appearance there this evening.\n\nKennedy also criticized Harris for “repeating these irresponsible stories.” The vice president earlier today gave a brief address from Washington regarding Kelly’s statements.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nJason Aldean introduces Trump at Georgia rally\n\nCountry singer Jason Aldean took the stage to introduce Trump at a rally in Duluth, Ga., on Wednesday night.\n\nAldean, a Georgia native who was also spotted sitting next to Trump at the Republican National Convention in July, touted his friendship with the former president.\n\n“He’s a president who when knocked down, gets back up, raises his fist in the air and says ‘fight,’” Aldean said, referring to a now infamous photo of Trump surviving the first assassination attempt against him. “And to me that’s a warrior, that’s who we need running this country right now.”\n\nThe singer emphasized Georgia’s swing state status, telling the crowd that “every vote is necessary, so do not sit this one out.”\n\nAldean and his wife have long ties with Trump.

Former WWE wrestler Mick Foley, also known as Mankind, on Wednesday endorsed Kamala Harris after WWE legend The Undertaker endorsed Donald Trump over the weekend.\n\n“I think it's important for everyone to have a moment where enough is enough,” Foley said in a roughly 4-minute long video posted on YouTube. “For me, enough was enough eight years ago.”\n\nTrump appeared on The Undertaker’s podcast, “Six Feet Under,” where the two spoke about realities of professional wrestling. The Undertaker, whose real name is Mark Calloway then endorsed Trump in a TikTok video on Sunday, alongside other former WWE wrestler Glen Jacobs, who played “Kane,” The Undertaker’s on-screen brother.\n\nFormer professional wrestling stars have played a role in Trump’s reelection campaign. WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan endorsed Trump and spoke at the Republican National Convention over the summer.\n\nTrump, who is a member of WWE’s Hall of Fame, has long been associated with the professional wrestling company – even making his way into the ring in 2007 to feud with Vince McMahon, the former CEO of the company. McMahon is currently facing a federal investigation after a sex trafficking and sexual misconduct lawsuit was filed against him earlier this year. Linda McMahon, wife of Vince McMahon, served in the Trump administration as head of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump courts Christian voters at Georgia 'Believers' town hall\n\nTrump used a town hall focused on faith in Georgia to make a special request to Christian Americans: Vote.\n\n\"Christians are not tremendous voters,\" Trump said during a \"Believers and Ballots Faith Town Hall\" in Zebulon, Georgia.\n\nTurnout could make all the difference in Georgia, a major battleground state. Neither candidate currently holds a clear advantage in the Peach State; Trump led Harris by seven percentage points in a Quinnipiac poll last week, while Harris was up by four points in a Washington Post-Schar School survey released Monday.\n\nTrump on Wednesday also made an appeal by talking about his own beliefs.\n\n“When you have faith, when you believe in God, it’s a big advantage over people that don’t have that,” he said.\n\n− David Jackson and Savannah Kuchar\n\nAsk us anything!

They can return the ballot by mail or put in a ballot drop box.\n\nUnregistered voters in Nevada can register the same day, however since it's after Oct. 22, they must vote in-person at a polling place and show their valid Nevada driver’s license, Nevada ID card, or tribal ID to vote.\n\n− Mike Snider\n\nRussian smear of Tim Walz hits internet ahead of US election\n\nU.S. intelligence officials say Russia is behind a fake video smearing Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz with false sexual abuse allegations as part of an election interference effort favoring Donald Trump that will continue after Nov. 5.\n\nThe content, including baseless allegations from the Minnesota governor’s time as a high school teacher, was fabricated and then boosted online and across social media by operatives working for the Kremlin, said an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n\"The intelligence community assesses that Russian influence actors created and amplified content alleging inappropriate activity committed by the Democratic vice presidential candidate during his earlier career,\" the ODNI official told reporters Tuesday.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\n‘It’s not that hard to vote’: Barack Obama appeals to young voters in NBA podcast\n\nDuring an appearance on “The Young Man & the Three” basketball podcast, former President Barack Obama urged young people — specifically addressing young, male voters — to vote in the upcoming election.\n\n“I think that’s the main message that I have for folks,” Obama said during the episode, “it’s not that hard to vote.”\n\nObama has been on the campaign trail, stumping for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee opposing former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. With the general election fewer than two weeks away, Harris and the Democrats have been trying to reach young men of color.\n\n– Lorenzo Reyes\n\nTrump headed to Madison Square Garden on Sunday\n\nWhile he officially changed his residence to Florida years ago, former President Donald Trump spent decades living and building his real estate empire in New York City and is returning Sunday for a big rally at Madison Square Garden.\n\nHome court for the New York Knicks and home ice for the New York Rangers, the iconic venue is also known for staging big concerts and boxing matches.\n\nBut on Sunday at 5 p.m. it will transform into MAGA central as Trump diverts from the swing states to stage a rally in a blue state that is deeply associated with his rise to fame and political power.\n\n- Zac Anderson\n\nGeorgia audit finds only 20 noncitizens of 8.2 million registered voters\n\nA state audit uncovered fewer than one in 400,000 registered voters in Georgia who were noncitizens, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced Wednesday at a press conference. The audit by Raffensper's office found just 20 noncitizens among more than 8.2 million registered voters.\n\n“This is the most comprehensive citizenship check conducted in the history of Georgia, if not the most comprehensive check ever conducted in the United States of America,” Raffensperger said.\n\nThe registrations were canceled for all 20 noncitizens, who have been referred for potential criminal prosecution, Raffensperger said.\n\nThe 20 individuals were found through affidavits they submitted to get out of jury duty, according to Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer within Raffensperger’s office.\n\n\"One of the reasons the secretary ordered this noncitizenship audit is to prove to people that, while there are ways that some can potentially get on, it is ceasingly rare,” Sterling said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHarris calls ex-aide's fascism warning a 'window into who Donald Trump really is'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris accused former President Donald Trump of wanting \"unchecked power\" as the Democratic nominee seized on remarks from John Kelly, Trump's former White House chief of staff, who warned Trump would rule like a dictator in a second term and recounted his past admiring statements about Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"This is a window into who Donald Trump really is from the people who know him best, from the people who worked with him, side by side, in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room,\" Harris said in remarks Wednesday from the vice president's Naval Observatory residence in Washington.\n\n\"The bottom line is this, we know what Donald Trump wants,\" Harris continued. \"He wants unchecked power. The question in 13 days will be: What do the American people want?\"\n\nOver three recorded interviews with the New York Times, Kelly said Trump, the 2024 Republican nominee, met the definition of a fascist, would govern like a dictator if allowed, and had no understanding of the Constitution or the concept of rule of law.\n\nOver three recorded interviews with the New York Times, Kelly said Trump, the 2024 Republican nominee, met the definition of a fascist, would govern like a dictator if allowed, and had no understanding of the Constitution or the concept of rule of law.\n\n\"Certainly the former president is in the far-right area, he’s certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators — he has said that,\" Kelly told the Times. \"So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.”\n\nHarris also referenced a separate report from the Atlantic, which quoted Trump saying that, \"I need the kind of generals that Hitler had,\" according to two unnamed individuals.\n\nThe Trump campaign has denied Kelly's accounts and the Atlantic story.\n\nSteven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, slammed Kelly’s accounts as “debunked stories” and said he had “beclowned” himself in a statement to the Times.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWhen will the election results be announced?\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nJD Vance in Las Vegas urges supporters to vote with family, friends\n\nRepublican Vice-Presidential nominee JD Vance implored supporters during a Las Vegas rally on Tuesday to use methods of voting – including early in-person and by mail – that Republicans once criticized as ripe for fraud.\n\n“If Kamala Harris's team is using everything and we're only using one of those methods of voting, then we're going to get killed,” Vance told the crowd.\n\nDonald Trump, Vance’s running mate, attempted to sow doubt about the validity of mail-in voting during the 2020 election, claiming without evidence that it was “a whole big scam.”\n\nThis year, the Trump campaign has sought to walk back some of that rhetoric.\n\n“However you can – early, voting by mail, early in person, going on election day -- whatever makes the most sense to you. Get out there and let's try to bank as many votes by election day as possible,” Vance said on Tuesday.\n\nHe also joked that Trump supporters should “vote 10 times, the legal way” by bringing their friends and family with them to the polls.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nElection certification, inauguration to have heightened security\n\nBoth Jan. 6 and Jan. 20 will be treated as National Special Security Events, the U.S. Secret Service confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nThe results of the presidential election are certified in the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6 and the next president-elect will be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20.\n\nA National Special Security Event is an event that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has deemed nationally or internationally significant and could be a target for terrorism or criminal activity, and enhanced security is likely.\n\nInaugurations, State of the Union addresses, the United Nations General Assembly and both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions are typically considered National Special Security Events. The 2024 NATO Summit held in Washington D.C. was also considered such an event.\n\nThe Secret Service could not confirm media reports that fencing would be erected around the Capitol complex from Jan. 5 to Jan. 20, said USSS spokesperson Nate Herring.\n\nAfter the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol building, an eight-foot-tall metal fence was erected around the complex and stayed up for months.\n\nThe National Park Service has already put up partial fencing near the White House that will stay up through February 2025. Preparation began a month earlier this year, according to NPS.\n\n-- Riley Beggin\n\nTrump's plan for Election Day? Campaign readies for a party in Florida.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump is expected to have his election night party in Florida in the Palm Beach area, according to two sources familiar with the GOP campaign's planning.\n\nThat likely means Trump will be at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, with a Republican operative close to the campaign saying they are \"pretty sure that's where everyone\" will be on Nov. 5. The election night party could be at another venue, or spread across multiple venues, though, sources said.\n\nTrump was in New York City on election night in 2016 and the White House in 2020.\n\nKamala Harris plans to spend election night in Washington D.C. and is considering a speech at her alma mater, Howard University, according to NBC News.\n\n- Zac Anderson and David Jackson\n\nWalz: Trump crossed 'red line' with Hitler comments\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz addressed reporters Wednesday morning in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he reacted to former President Donald Trump's chief of staff John Kelly highlighting past comments made by Trump admiring Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"Donald Trump's descension into madness, and John Kelly, who I thank for showing the courage to come forward,\" Walz said. \"Truly telling the world, those closest to Donald Trump know how dangerous he is. The desire of Donald Trump to wish he had generals like Adolf Hitler had...\"\n\nHe added: \"If there was ever a red line, he has stepped across it.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung in an emailed statement to USA TODAY took issue with the former top White House staffer's comments. \"John Kelly has totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated because he failed to serve his President well while working as Chief of Staff and currently suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" Cheung said.\n\n- Sam Woodward\n\nTrump's regard for Hitler referenced in 2022 book\n\nThis is not the first time voters have heard about Donald Trump's regard for German generals during the Adolf Hitler regime - or the first example of Trump's tenuous grasp of history.\n\nIn their 2022 book \"The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021,\" authors Peter Baker and Susan Glasser reported that Trump told then-Chief of Staff John Kelly: \"You (bleeping) generals, why can’t you be like the German generals?”\n\nTaken aback, Kelly told Trump: “You do know that they tried to kill Hitler three times and almost pulled it off?”\n\nTrump did not know that, and insisted: “No, no, no, they were totally loyal to him.\"\n\nBaker and Glasser wrote about Trump: \"In his mind, the generals had been completely subservient to the Nazi dictator - and this was the model he wanted for his own military. Kelly told Trump there were no such generals in America, but the president was determined to test the proposition.\"\n\nTrump's campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung in an emailed statement to USA TODAY fired back at Kelly, saying the former White House chief of staff \"has totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated because he failed to serve his President well while working as Chief of Staff and currently suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nJohn Kelly adviser says ‘he’s warning us’ about dangers of Trump\n\nThe Harris campaign Wednesday seized on remarks from John Kelly, Trump’s former White House chief of staff who warned that the Republican presidential nominee would rule like a dictator in a second term and made past admiring statements about Adolf Hitler.\n\nRetired Army Reserve Col. Kevin Carroll, a former senior adviser to Gen. Kelly, said during a Harris campaign call with reporters that speaking out “was no small step” for Kelly, who he called “a dedicated, measured public servant.”\n\n“But he’s seen Donald Trump up close in a way that very few other Americans have, and he's warning us that a second Trump term would be dangerous,” Carroll said.\n\n“What the public has learned about Donald Trump from John Kelly's accounting is damning,” Carroll said, adding that top officials who worked with the former president have made clear Trump “has no empathy, that he's increasingly unstable and unfit, and that he's more extreme than ever.”\n\n“Trump is seeking the power to do anything he wants, anytime he wants,\" Carroll added.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Kelly said the former president exhibits the tendencies of a fascist, including his threat to possibly use the military against domestic political opponents. Kelly also told the Times that Trump remarked on multiple occasions that “Hitler did some good things.”\n\n“It's no surprise that General Kelly came out like he did. I mean, I wish he had done it earlier, but it's great that he has,” said retired U.S. Army Brigadier Gen. Steve Anderson, a Republican who is part of a group of national security leaders backing Harris.\n\nAnderson said he and others worry Trump will use the military to “suppress his opposition in the country and man the U.S. border, which are things that the military is not supposed to do.”\n\n“With Donald Trump as a president, we are going to lose our status as a world leader, and that is so important,\" Anderson said.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWalz casts vote early with son, first-time voter\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, cast his ballot early in person in St. Paul Wednesday morning with his wife, Gwen, and son Gus who recently turned 18.\n\nThere, he told reporters he was excited for Gus to cast his first ballot. The two voted across privacy booths from one another.\n\nGus, who has largely stayed off the campaign trail, went viral during the Democratic National Convention is August for his unscripted, emotional reaction to his father's acceptance speech.\n\n−Sam Woodward\n\nObama leans into Trump-Harris fast food fight\n\nWhile campaigning for Kamala Harris at a rally in Detroit, Michigan, former President Barack Obama poked fun at Donald Trump's recent McDonald's campaign stunt.\n\nHarris, as she often reminds voters, worked at the fast food giant for a summer while in college. Trump claimed without evidence on Sunday that this was a lie while working the fryer at a Pennsylvania McDonald's, the Washington Post reported was closed to the public during his visit.\n\nObama contrasted Harris and Trump's upbringings at the rally Tuesday night.\n\n\"She worked at McDonald's when she was in college to pay her expenses,\" Obama said. \"She did not pretend to work at McDonald's when it was closed.\"\n\n−Rachel Barber\n\nJD Vance and comedian Theo Von talk addiction\n\nRepublican vice presidential candidate Sen.

Saturday’s event will mark Michelle Obama’s first time on the campaign trail for Harris, though she did speak at the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nDo you trust the vote count?\n\nElection angst won't end on Election Day, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll finds. Americans, fiercely divided between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, are concerned about the accuracy of the vote count, anxious about the peaceful transition of power and even braced for political violence.\n\nNearly 8 in 10 voters trust the vote. Most said they were \"very\" confident (43%) or \"somewhat\" confident (36%) that the results of the election will be accurately counted and reported.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBut trust was higher among Harris supporters than those who back Trump. Among Harris voters, 70% were very confident and another 25% were somewhat confident; just 4% were not.\n\nIn contrast, a third of Trump voters, 34%, said they were not confident. The former president has fueled those concerns by continuing to argue without evidence that the 2020 election was \"rigged\" against him.\n\n−Susan Page, Sudiksha Kochi and Maya Marchel Hoff\n\nBiden tells voters to 'lock him up,' casting Trump as a menace\n\nPresident Joe Biden turned the tables on Donald Trump on Tuesday, suggesting the time has come to “lock him up” – at least politically.\n\nSpeaking to campaign workers in New Hampshire, Biden said Trump thinks he has the right under a recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity “to actually eliminate, physically eliminate – shoot, kill – someone who is, he believes, to be a threat to him.”\n\n“If I said this five years ago, you’d lock me up,” Biden said during a stop at the New Hampshire Democratic Headquarters in Concord. “We’ve got to lock him up.”\n\nHe paused briefly, then added: “Politically lock him up. Lock him out. That’s what we have to do.”\n\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt blasted Biden's remarks. \"Joe Biden just admitted the truth: He and Kamala’s plan all along has been to politically persecute their opponent President Trump because they can’t beat him fair and square,\" she said.\n\n−Michael Collins\n\nObama raps Eminem’s iconic ‘Lose Yourself’ at Kamala Harris rally\n\nFormer President Barack Obama rapped Eminem’s award-winning 2002 song “Lose Yourself” at a Michigan Kamala Harris campaign rally on Tuesday, after the Grammy award-winning artist introduced Obama to the crowd.\n\n“I have done a lot of rallies, so I don’t usually get nervous. But I was feeling some kind of way following Eminem,” Obama said when he took the stage in Detroit.\n\n“Now, I notice my palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, vomit on my sweater already, mom’s spaghetti, I’m nervous but on the surface I look calm and ready to drop bombs but I keep on forgetting,” Obama rapped as the crowd burst into cheers.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat time do polls open on Election Day?\n\nIt depends on where you live.\n\nIn some states, like Arizona and Connecticut, polling locations can open as early as 6 a.m. on Election Day, which is Nov. 5.

The poll asked 1,000 likely voters if they had seen Harris on podcasts such as \"Call Her Daddy\" or \"All the Smoke,\" as well as if they had seen Trump on \"This Past Weekend with Theo Von\" or \"Flagrant 2.\"\n\nNearly 72% of respondents said that they had not seen Harris on a podcast and 77.5% said that they had not seen a Trump podcast appearance.\n\n−James Powel\n\nTrump campaign accuses UK's ruling Labour Party of 'blatant foreign interference'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's campaign filed a legal complaint late Tuesday against Britain's ruling Labour Party, accusing it of \"blatant foreign interference\" ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election.\n\nThe complaint was made in a formal letter sent by Trump campaign lawyer Gary Lawkowski to the Federal Election Commission.

Roughly a dozen of Donald Trump’s senior campaign officials and top Republican surrogates swarmed the spin room floor to gloat to reporters about the 81-year-old Democratic incumbent's stumbles.\n\nNowhere to be seen: Susie Wiles.\n\nAmong the most powerful figures in national politics, Wiles has helped lead Trump’s political operation for three years and now is co-piloting a presidential campaign that's in as strong a position as it ever could have expected to deliver the controversial former president back to the White House.\n\nYet Wiles, 66, remains a somewhat mysterious figure, rarely front and center on the campaign trail or heard from in public other than through campaign memos co-signed by Trump’s other top campaign aide.\n\n\"She hates the limelight,\" said John Delaney, who employed Wiles when he was the Republican mayor of Jacksonville and is a longtime friend.\n\nWiles traveled to Atlanta for the debate, flying to the event with Trump. She stayed with the former president as other campaign aides, surrogates and several vice presidential contenders raced toward the bright lights of the media.\n\nAvoiding attention is a Wiles specialty. The mild-mannered daughter of a professional football legend is careful not to draw eyes to herself, which may be one of the biggest reasons she has stayed in this particular job longer than any other top Trump campaign leader, many of whom had big personalities that contributed to their downfalls.\n\nWiles prefers to work behind the scenes, like when she lined up a series of congressional endorsements for Trump in Florida early in 2023 before Gov. Ron DeSantis had even entered the Republican primary, laying the groundwork to humiliate DeSantis by getting his home state lawmakers to reject him.\n\nHer methodical approach to the endorsement power play highlights a trait that makes her extremely effective as a leading force in Trump’s 2024 campaign, allies say. Highly organized, Wiles has brought an unprecedented level of order and professionalism to a Trump political operation that often has been in disarray through two White House campaigns and a chaotic presidential term, according to multiple sources close to the campaign. And while those who know Wiles describe her as friendly and low-key, her effort to kill DeSantis' campaign in the crib shows she can play hardball, too.\n\n\"She'll be smiling and walk you right off the plank,\" said a Republican who has worked with Wiles for years.\n\nUSA TODAY spoke with more than 20 people who know Wiles, some going back decades, who describe a savvy political operator who achieved unprecedented success in Florida and has made herself essential to Trump, emerging from his 2020 defeat and her own fallout with DeSantis to become a major power player.\n\nWiles is navigating through one of the wildest campaigns in modern history, one shaped by a criminal trial and three other indictments, with a style that longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone calls “unflappable.”\n\nShe is immersed in every aspect of Trump’s 2024 operation, from developing the themes of next week's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to leading the search for Trump’s running mate. One ally says she has “the biggest vote” in whom is selected other than Trump.\n\nTrump's trial in New York City on state charges stemming from paying hush money to an adult film actress to conceal an affair was a big test of Wiles' skills. She helped orchestrate an unprecedented \"campaign from the courtroom\" that included daily diatribes from Trump, events around Manhattan, court visits from top allies − including the House speaker and vice presidential contenders − and a huge fundraising blitz that helped Trump close the money gap with President Joe Biden despite his historic felony conviction earlier this spring.\n\nUnlike past Trump campaign leaders, Wiles has managed to generate goodwill from all corners of his political orbit. Trump allies credit her with helping make good things happen, like the endorsements, and note that bad things can happen when she’s not around.\n\nWiles killed multiple times the plans for the notorious dinner that Trump ultimately had in late 2022 at his Mar-a-Lago estate with Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, that caused an uproar when Ye brought along white supremacist Nick Fuentes. It finally occurred just days before Thanksgiving when she was out of town, according to a source with knowledge of the incident.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, Wiles said she doesn't deserve the credit for Trump’s surging campaign. “We do everything as a team, and I would argue that’s why we’ve been successful,” she said.\n\nWiles said having other staffers serve as the public-facing part of the campaign frees her up to “to do a better job” orchestrating the mechanics.\n\n“I do prefer to be in the background,” she said.\n\nThough opponents may view Wiles as abetting a candidate many Democrats view as a wannabe dictator, her closeness with Trump and his confidence in her makes the Florida grandmother essential to the GOP's bid to reclaim the White House. She's someone Trump trusts with his most important tasks, such as devising the plan to dispatch DeSantis.\n\n“I think she’s got a very good balance,” said former Trump White House press secretary Sean Spicer. “She’s not looking to be in the spotlight. She’s got the experience. She’s got the trust. She is flying right exactly on the radar where you want to be.”\n\n'He tried to ruin her life'\n\nIn many ways, it’s an odd-couple pairing between Trump and Wiles, who was described in a recent Wall Street Journal column as “the most important woman in American politics.”\n\nWiles hates public attention. Trump craves it. Wiles is disciplined. Trump is chaotic. Wiles is “no drama.” Trump is all drama.\n\nThough there are many stylistic differences between Trump and Wiles, they share at least one thing in common: Both are attempting a comeback after their political careers seemed to be over.\n\nIf Trump completes his resurrection after losing in 2020 and facing widespread recrimination after the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Wiles will be a big reason why.\n\nWiles, meanwhile, has resurrected herself after steering DeSantis to his first gubernatorial victory in 2018 and then being booted from his orbit. She joined DeSantis' campaign that year in the final stretch, when he was floundering in the general election after tacking hard right to win a primary over an establishment Republican.\n\nWith Wiles on board for the campaign's final month, DeSantis narrowly eked out the closest victory of any governor in Florida history. She stayed on to help with the transition effort but soon got crosswise with DeSantis and his inner circle.\n\nDeSantis blamed Wiles after a fundraising memo leaked detailing plans to raise big money by charging lobbyists for golf and other activities with the governor. He pressured Trump to fire her from managing his 2020 campaign in Florida, which he did.\n\nWiles also left her lobbying firm, Ballard Partners, where she was a partner.\n\nThose who spoke to Wiles at the time said she was despondent.\n\nDeSantis “didn’t just have Trump fire her, he tried to ruin her life,” a person who has known Wiles for years said.\n\n“Not only do you get fired, but you basically get publicly … body-slammed where they’re going out and telling everybody 'You can’t hire her, you can’t use her,'” said another person who knows Wiles well. “It was not pretty. It was vicious. They treated her like dirt, and I’m not selling that enough.”\n\nWiles is adamant she didn't leak the memo and said DeSantis never met with her to explain what happened.\n\n“He most definitely tried to make me some sort of a pariah, and I was never able to get an appointment with him or anything after it happened to address it head on,” said Wiles, adding: “Gosh it’s five years ago and a lot of water’s under that bridge. … It is so in my rearview mirror.”\n\nWiles' allies say they believe DeSantis resented the credit she got for his victory and his inner circle grew jealous of her, concerned she was stocking the Florida governor's administration with allies and accumulating too much influence. DeSantis' office didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt wasn’t long before Wiles would have her revenge.\n\n'Left on the environment, left on gay rights'\n\nThe daughter of longtime football broadcaster and former placekicker Pat Summerall, Wiles grew up around fame.\n\nThat may have been part of her appeal to Trump, who has long been drawn to celebrity. It also may be one reason she has successfully navigated Trump's demanding nature.\n\n\"Think about this: Her dad sat between John Madden and Howard Cosell, two of the biggest personalities, pains in the a--, right?\" said a Trump campaign official. \"Really hard thing, and he was the calming center. And it’s genetic. She has that.\"\n\nWiles said her father didn’t have much influence on her political career, beyond ensuring she had the same opportunities as her brothers and encouraging her to follow whatever path she wanted.\n\n“I think the Summerall family is pretty competitive and has been very successful, and I think my dad’s influence was really more that than politics,” she said. “Politics wasn’t his thing. Sports was his thing.\"\n\nWiles' family connections did help launch her into politics, though. She started out working for Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., a football teammate of her famous father. She later worked on former President Ronald Reagan’s campaigns and in his administration.\n\nStone, who got to know Wiles while working on the Reagan and Kemp campaigns, calls her “extraordinarily well organized.”\n\n\"Trump is a free spirit, and Susie both recognizes that but at the same time I think she brings order and structure and organization to the Trump campaign and he trusts her, which is the absolute key element,\" Stone said.\n\nWiles reputation as a top GOP operative was forged in Florida. She and her ex-husband − they have two daughters and a grandson − moved in the early 1980s to Jacksonville, where she has family. She worked in intervals as a consultant and in government, taking 11 years off to raise her daughters.\n\nIn 1995, Wiles helped Delaney become Jacksonville’s first Republican mayor since shortly after the Civil War. She later was Delaney’s chief of staff.\n\nDelaney is a moderate Republican. Among his signature programs was a sales tax increase to pay for infrastructure and an environmental land conservation program. Wiles was instrumental in both.\n\n“She’s a Republican, but she’s not uber-, uber-conservative at all,” Delaney said. “Really you’d be struck more by moderate than anything else. … She’d be left on the environment, left on gay rights.”\n\nRick Mullaney, who worked with Wiles in Delaney’s administration, also described her as “pretty non-ideological.”\n\nWiles takes pride in the Jacksonville land conservation program she helped build, noting she still sits on the group’s board, and said she likes bird-watching, gardening and just being outside.\n\n“If that makes me an environmentalist, that would be so,” she said.\n\nIn 2012, Wiles briefly managed the presidential campaign of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, a moderate Republican who ended his White House run that year during the early days of a primary season ultimately won by Mitt Romney.\n\nFour years later, Wiles was eyeing a job managing Trump's Florida operation for 2016 when she sat down to lunch with Delaney, a lifelong Republican. He advised against it.\n\n“I just don’t think that’s what you want on your obituary,” Delaney, who would not vote for Trump in either 2016 or 2020, said he told Wiles. “He just seemed so unlike her. She’s classy and dignified. She doesn’t curse. … She’s an every-Sunday-churchgoing kind of person.”\n\nDespite Wiles’ button-down image and more moderate personal politics, she has a history of championing insurgent, outsider GOP candidates.\n\nRick Scott, Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump\n\nSen. Rick Scott has now spent nearly 14 years in public office, but when he connected with Wiles back in 2010, he was an unknown former hospital company executive who had the entire Florida GOP establishment lined up against him.\n\nWiles helped Scott tap into the tea party wave as he defeated a well-connected GOP opponent and went on to narrowly win the general election.\n\n“Most Republicans were told if they worked on my campaign in the primary they would never work in Republican politics, so I’ll forever be grateful somebody with Susie’s reputation came to work for me,” said Scott, adding Wiles is \"really smart, she’s a hard worker, she’s a team player, I think she gives really good advice.\"\n\nThat 2010 victory was the beginning of a Wiles winning streak that may be unrivaled in the history of Florida politics.\n\nWiles won four statewide races in 10 years, delivering the state for Scott, DeSantis in 2018 and Trump in 2016 and 2020. In the process, she helped shift what was long seen as the nation's largest swing state into more firmly Republican territory.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz worked with Wiles on multiple campaigns and describes her as “one of the most talented political operatives in the country.\"\n\n\"Highly organized ... driven, trusted by the president,\" Gaetz added.\n\nIn the first three Florida races, Wiles achieved narrow victories of a percentage point or less in incredibly competitive contests.\n\n“She’s probably been the most successful political operative in Florida campaign history,” said Brian Ballard, a Trump fundraiser who runs the lobbying firm where Wiles once worked.\n\nDespite her success, the future of Wiles' political career was in doubt in 2019 after her break with DeSantis. Trump gave her a second chance.\n\nBack with Trump\n\nAs the 2020 election grew closer, Trump’s campaign grew nervous about Florida and decided to bring Wiles back despite DeSantis’ opposition.\n\nTrump ended up carrying Florida by more than 3 percentage points, tripling his margin of victory from 2016. Wiles’ reputation as a winner grew.\n\nOverall, though, the 2020 election was a disaster for Trump, one compounded by his refusal to accept the results, resulting in a mob of his supporters storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nYet while many Republicans distanced themselves from Trump after Jan. 6, Wiles drew closer. She helped run his political operations after his presidency.\n\nWiles said she \"didn’t like the Capitol being destroyed, but that was a very small minority of the people that were there,” and she doesn't believe Trump should be blamed for what happened.\n\nTrump asked Wiles to dinner in early 2021 and eventually tasked her with getting his Save America PAC’s affairs in order. That evolved into other tasks, such as coordinating endorsements and rallies for various candidates.\n\n“I was a believer and I had worked really hard in two tough races, and to the extent that I could help I wanted to,\" Wiles said.\n\nThe job ensnared her in one of Trump’s legal cases.\n\nThe office of special counsel Jack Smith interviewed Wiles about Trump's handling of classified documents in the first of two federal criminal cases against the former president.\n\nWiles is believed to be the unnamed individual in Smith’s original indictment to whom Trump allegedly showed a classified map to, according to ABC News. The federal judge in the case recently agreed to strike the paragraph detailing the map incident from the indictment, though. Wiles declined to comment on the case.\n\nHer position has evolved into leading Trump’s 2024 campaign with another senior adviser, Chris LaCivita.\n\nA Republican who is close to Trump world and knows Wiles believes she saw a chance to resurrect her career by helping Trump at his lowest point.\n\n“I don’t want to pretend that everything Susie does is altruistic, I think she saw an opportunity,” the Republican said. “I think she has a good sense of where the political winds are going, and I think she knew that this wasn’t going to be the end of Trump but also that a lot of people are going to run away and be scared and that Trump values loyalty. And so I think she saw an opportunity to sort of get her foot in the door at a time where she could prove herself to him and sort of solidify her position in Trump world, and she did that.”\n\nWiles’ first job as a top Trump 2024 campaign aide was winning the primary. While Trump pummeled DeSantis as “DeSanctimonious,” Wiles worked behind the scenes to outmaneuver the Florida governor's campaign.\n\nShe helped orchestrate a show of political force by getting most of Florida’s GOP congressional delegation to back Trump at a key early moment, before DeSantis had officially announced.\n\n“It was devastating,” Stone said, calling the move “a major milestone on the way to the nomination.”\n\n“She had worked for DeSantis,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. “She knew his weaknesses intimately and she laid out for the president a strategy that would take DeSantis out of the race, and they executed it.”\n\nWiles allowed herself a rare moment of public celebration and knife twisting after it was clear DeSantis would drop out, writing on X: “bye, bye.”\n\nIt is her only post on the social media site this year.\n\n\"It didn't make me sad,\" Wiles said of DeSantis dropping out.\n\nNot everyone was impressed with the primary win.\n\n“Had they lost the primary it would have been pathetic,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump 2016 campaign aide turned critic. “I think they underperformed, and I think they got lucky it was a big field.”\n\nNunberg noted that Trump had a lot of advantages in the primary and still struggled to win a majority of GOP votes in the early contests.\n\n“I don’t judge them on parking a car properly,” Nunberg said. “Let’s see you win the general election and then we’ll see how good you are.”\n\n'Calming presence'\n\nTrump’s 2024 general election campaign got off to a slow and calamitous start with the former president stuck in a Manhattan courtroom for weeks leading up to a conviction on 34 felony counts.\n\nWiles helped coordinate courtroom visits from top supporters and made appearances herself while helping to plot a campaign strategy that included events around New York.\n\n\"In a way, as awful as the trial was, it presented what I think is a good opportunity to do some things that broaden the party and the president’s base a little bit since we were stuck already in New York,” she said.\n\nMore importantly, allies say, she projected calm and never panicked.\n\nIn that way, Wiles is a lot different from Trump campaign leaders of the past, such as Corey Lewandowski, Steve Bannon and Brad Parscale, who were more hot-tempered and aggressive and eventually lost their jobs, in Bannon's case after he joined Trump's White House. Trump’s past campaigns also were filled with much more drama.\n\n“There are no stories this cycle about infighting and backbiting and drama,” Spicer noted.\n\nTrump’s past campaign leaders often have butted heads with him because they tried to manage him too much, Gingrich said. Wiles is more tactful, observers say.\n\n“She’s not confused,” said Gingrich, who in 2016 was among the finalists who didn't ultimately get picked to be Trump's running mate. “She understands that she is in fact his agent, he’s not hers.”\n\nWiles still acts as a gatekeeper at times. She's judicious in her efforts to control access to Trump, though, and how she tries to influence him, observers say. Wiles knows she can’t really control him and doesn’t try, they say.\n\nYet Wiles has enormous influence behind the scenes as somebody Trump trusts. She is now one of his longest-serving advisers, having worked on all of his campaigns, and has served as a top political aide for more than three years.\n\nOn issues such as who will be Trump’s running mate, his campaign likes to say that only Trump will make that decision. Wiles is the one coordinating the search, though. She vetted all the contenders, digging through their records and making sure Trump had “full visibility into all of it,” she said, while noting that the campaign team doesn't try to influence or advocate for anyone.\n\n“Besides the boss,” said a person close to the campaign, \"she has probably the biggest vote.\"\n\nContributing: David Jackson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/12"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/955655/the-minsk-agreements-and-what-they-mean-for-war-in-ukraine", "title": "The Minsk agreements and what they mean for war in Ukraine | The ...", "text": "As an armed standoff continues on Ukraine’s border with Russia, Finland’s president has suggested that an existing peace deal could help to avert war.\n\nSauli Niinisto “said the Minsk agreement had been somewhat forgotten for several years, but in his most recent call with [Vladimir] Putin the Russian leader had emphasised its importance again”, Reuters reported\n\nBoth Washington and Moscow have also referred to the deals in recent months, raising hopes that they could provide a framework for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

This omission has been used by Moscow to “shirk responsibility for implementation and maintain the fiction that it is a disinterested arbiter” rather than a player in the conflict.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe agreements have not stopped fighting in Donbass and little effort has been made by Moscow or Kiev to implement the accords. However, the parties seemingly agree that it remains the most likely basis for any future resolution to the conflict.\n\nSo could they help avoid war now?\n\nQuite possibly. In January, Alexander Grushko, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, said that if the Minsk accords were implemented, it could “de-escalate” the conflict, leaving the issue of Ukraine as no threat to Russia.\n\nThe previous month, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, also pointed to the accords as a potential way forward. After meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, he said he had “made clear” the US is prepared to work to “support a diplomatic resolution through implementation of the Minsk agreements in any way that we can”.\n\nMeanwhile, said Slate, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has been “pursuing his own diplomatic initiative with Russia” in the form of a 10-point plan, including an exchange of prisoners, and the opening of crossing points for civilians, that “fits comfortably into the Minsk formula”.\n\nTherefore, the “dangling” of the Minsk agreements – first by Blinken and now by Grushko – “shows all parties the way to a finessing of the present confrontation”, it added.\n\nThe ‘Normandy Format’ countries – France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine – have confirmed their support for the Minsk 2 part of the agreements. The nations will hold a meeting later this month, in which the agreements may form the basis of discussion.\n\nWhat obstacles do the agreements present?\n\nNiinisto conceded that one of the most intractable topics to settle in the agreement will be Moscow’s demand to give the Donbass area or the breakaway east Ukraine regions an autonomous status and the right of veto on Ukraine’s foreign relations.\n\nThe Interpreter argued that by accepting Moscow’s terms, Ukraine would risk “becoming liable to rebuild and support the economy of an autonomous region with vast political powers and legitimised pro-Russian leadership”. Therefore, it added, Moscow and Kiev “fundamentally disagree on the provisions of the only peace plan they have”.\n\nWriting in the Moscow Times, Mark Galeotti was scornful of the idea that the agreements were a sign of hope. “It is time to recognize that the Minsk process has run its course – and may if anything be blocking any more meaningful dialogue,” he argued last year.\n\nHe would prefer to see the parties scrap the agreements and return to the drawing board. In a separate piece, for the Council on Geostrategy, Galeotti said: “Minsk is not only dead, it is a rotting corpse slumped over the conference table”. Not only are the agreements “failing to bring peace to the Donbas” but they are preventing “potential new negotiations, or even an honest conversation about the conflict”.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/03/03/trump-defends-attack-zelenskyy-ukraine-white-house/81085408007/", "title": "Trump used a DJ's Facebook post to defend Zelenskyy meeting. I ...", "text": "At first I was repulsed by President Donald Trump’s bullying treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office.\n\nIt appeared Trump had planted America firmly on the side of Russia and, by publicly degrading a respected world leader, showcased his penchant for temper tantrums and reckless disregard for our allies.\n\nBut then I wondered how people who are both karate instructors and wedding DJs might be responding to the geopolitical implications of the event. Fortunately, the Trump administration seemed to share my concerns. And you won't believe what happened next. (To be honest, I'm not entirely sure I believe it.)\n\nTrump defends his Zelenskyy fiasco with praise from a karate instructor\n\nOn Sunday, I came across this actual headline from Britain’s Daily Mail: “Trump fuels rumors White House takedown of Zelensky was a 'setup' by promoting elaborate theory from karate dojo instructor.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAgain, that is a real headline, and it is based on a real thing that really happened, right here in the year 2025. It encapsulates, I guess, the kind of American leadership Republican lawmakers and Trump voters wanted.\n\nThe president of the United States of America ‒ the leader of the free world ‒ has faced withering and deserved criticism for his treatment of Zelenskyy. So to defend himself, he cut and pasted a Facebook post written by a random guy who is apparently a karate instructor and a wedding DJ, and shared it on his social media account.\n\nTrump is apparently taking geopolitical advice from a DJ\n\nThis all seemed a bit like a satirical story from The Onion, so I tracked down the author of the Facebook post via a link to his martial arts business. Michael McCune, of Arizona, and I spoke by phone Sunday afternoon, and I will tell you this: He is a longtime martial arts instructor and a wedding DJ, which I think is both cool and great. He's also a perfectly nice guy to chat with, a guy who had an opinion on what unfolded last week in the Oval Office and has now seen that opinion blasted around the world.\n\nHe's just, as he told me, \"a regular Joe.\" I told him that I'm just a liberal columnist, and that we probably weren't going to agree on much regarding Trump.\n\nBut that was OK. I mainly wanted to confirm he was the one who wrote the post. I also told him I take zero issue with his point of view. My only issue is that the president ‒ on a matter of rather grave importance ‒ decided to treat him as if he's an expert in geopolitical analysis.\n\n'A regular Joe' gives his honest analysis of Trump's Ukraine gambit\n\nMcCune's post ‒ which, and I can't stress this enough, was proudly touted by the president of the United States ‒ begins like this on Friday night:\n\n“Many of you probably watched what took place between Donald Trump and Zelenskyy tonight. Whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, you might be thinking to yourself, Oh my God, Donald Trump just screwed up.\n\n\"However, as a lifelong practitioner of martial arts, strategy, and philosophy, let me explain the difference between what you believe you witnessed and what actually happened.”\n\nIn my chat with him, McCune said he believes his background allowed him to recognize strategic moves Trump was making during the contentious meeting. He compared them with Trump's sometimes vague tariff threats: \"Donald Trump does things in a certain way. He has the heart of a negotiator. If you take it from that aspect and then reverse engineer it, then things are maybe not exactly the way you first thought.\"\n\nPerhaps the president shouldn't be sharing random Facebook posts?\n\nIn his post, McCune wrote confidently: \"So what you witnessed tonight was a setup. Trump and JD Vance knew that the only way to achieve peace was to strategically align, at least on the surface, with Russia.\"\n\nThe portion of the post Trump shared says this:\n\n“Now, Zelenskyy will have no choice but to back down and accept Trump's terms. But here’s the genius part ‒ Trump is actually protecting Ukraine without dragging the U.S. into war.\n\n“By negotiating a mineral deal, Trump ensures that Americans will be involved in Ukraine’s mining industry. This prevents Russia from launching an invasion, because attacking Ukraine would mean endangering American lives ‒ something that would force the U.S. to respond.\n\n“Trump played both sides like a master chess player. In the end, Zelenskyy will have no choice but to concede, because without U.S. support, Ukraine cannot win a prolonged war against Russia. And once U.S. companies have mining operations in Ukraine, Putin will be unable to attack without triggering massive international consequences.\n\n“Don’t underestimate Donald Trump. In this game of chess, he’s 10 moves ahead of everyone.”\n\nWhen one has to look this hard for praise, one may have made a mistake\n\nFor those still picking their jaws up off the floor, allow me to summarize: President Trump and Vice President Vance made America look like a pro-Putin bully by attempting to clown the president of a nation at war. European leaders quickly saw they can no longer count on the United States to be part of the Western coalition of … you know … good guys, so they rallied around Ukraine. Trump needed to feel smart, so he fell back on a regular American's praise-filled Facebook post.\n\nThat’s only slightly better than me proudly posting a note from my mom saying my last column was “really super!”\n\nThe sizable difference, of course, is I’m a lowly newspaper columnist and Trump is THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\n\nBy sharing a karate instructor's fan fiction, Trump raises actual questions\n\nBy sharing McCune's theory, was Trump acknowledging that the Zelenskyy meeting was, as McCune wrote, \"a setup\"? That certainly wasn't the GOP talking point post-fiasco. Trump's congressional toadies framed the moment as Zelenskyy acting disrespectfully and Trump and Vance boldly standing up for America by being jerks. (I know Mr. McCune is going to bristle at that description, and I feel bad about that, because we honestly got along well. So, no offense, sir. It's not you, it's Trump.)\n\nBut even if you liked what Trump did to Zelenskyy ‒ and you definitely shouldn’t ‒ there’s no universe in which anyone should think it's normal for an American president to defend his globally significant actions by citing the Facebook post of a random American.\n\nCareful what you post on Facebook. The president might make you famous.\n\nI told McCune outright that I don't think he deserves any criticism or vitriol for his post, though I'm sure he's getting plenty, along with ample plaudits from Trump supporters. Our conversation was one of those moments when you realize that as divided as we seem, we tend to unfairly paint the other side as enemies. This guy's not my enemy ‒ we just disagree.\n\nMcCune wrote a thing and tossed it up online, something many of us do all the time. And now he's getting calls from news outlets around the globe.\n\n\"That was just my take,\" he told me. \"And I just shared what I believed that I was seeing.\"\n\nGood for him. That's everybody's right, just as writing this column is my right.\n\nBut what concerns me is that Trump or one of his handlers trawled the entirety of the internet to find praise and they came up with a speculative take from a guy whose qualifications, like my own, don't scream \"expert in global diplomacy.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, I hope McCune is right. I hope he saw something I and many others in the world didn't. I hope Trump is playing 3-D chess and liberals like me are going to wind up looking like dummies.\n\nI want what's best for America, and I believe McCune does, too. We're both just regular people.\n\nAnd that's the rub. I want my president justifying his actions on the basis of the sharpest of experts. Not regular Joes.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on Bluesky at @rexhuppke.bsky.social and on Facebook at facebook.com/RexIsAJerk", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/biden-macron-state-visit/index.html", "title": "Biden and Macron affirm commitment to Ukraine but diverge on ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday demonstrated a united front in addressing the ongoing war in Ukraine but offered divergent answers over their willingness to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin, relaying that they spent much their recent meeting discussing the invasion.\n\nBiden told reporters during a joint White House news conference with Macron that he “has no immediate plans” to contact Putin, but added that he’s prepared to speak with the Russian leader if he’s looking for a way to end the war in Ukraine. Biden also clarified that Putin has not done so yet.\n\n“He’s just miscalculated across the board,” Biden said of Putin following his bilateral meeting in the Oval Office with the French president. “And so the question is … how does he get himself out of the circumstances in? I’m prepared, if he’s willing to talk, to find out what he’s willing to do, but I’ll only do it in consultation with my NATO allies. I’m not going to do it on my own.”\n\nMacron said that once Ukraine sets conditions for a peace agreement, he’s willing to speak with Putin. The French leader told ABC’s “Good Morning America” earlier Thursday that he intends to speak with the Russian president in the coming days.\n\nFirm US support, Macron also relayed, “is very important, not just for the Ukrainians … but for the stability of our world today. Because if we consider that we can abandon the country and abandon the full respect of these principles, it means that there is no possible stability in this world,” pledging France’s own increased military, economic, and humanitarian support.\n\nThe French president’s trip to the White House alongside his spouse, Brigitte Macron, marks their second time as the guests of honor for a state visit, having first done so during Donald Trump’s administration in 2018. Thursday’s agenda for Biden’s first state visit since taking office has been filled with formal fanfare, with a list of events intended to highlight the strength of the critical relationship between the US and its oldest ally.\n\nAt the start of the news conference, Biden called the US and France the “strongest partners and our most capable allies,” taking care to note that “Emmanuel has also become a friend, as well as President of that great country.”\n\nIn his opening remarks, Macron praised Biden for fulfilling campaign commitments linked to addressing international challenges, saying “we’re being able to re-engage with you.”\n\n“I can only tell you once again how pleased we were with your choices that very much matched your history and your campaign commitments. The fact that you’re back on international challenges such as health and climate – it is really a New Deal,” the French leader said.\n\nEarlier Thursday morning, the Macrons had stepped onto the South Lawn of the White House for an official arrival ceremony, where a long slate of top French and US officials as well as thousands of other attendees greeted them. The pomp-filled program included military honors, a 21-gun salute, both countries’ national anthems, a review of troops and remarks by both leaders.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Biden referred to the Macrons as “close friends,” remarking that it is a “genuine honor to host you for the first state visit of my administration and to celebrate the current strength and vitality between France and the United States of America.”\n\nFrance, Biden said, is the United States’ “oldest ally” and an “unwavering partner,” referencing the history of the relationship from Lafayette to the beaches of Normandy. He said the alliance will “grow stronger for decades to come.”\n\nMacron referenced common values of the US and France, referring to the nations as “sisters in the fight for freedom” and calling for their countries “to become brothers in arms once more” in the midst of Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Macrons’ return for another state visit also follows a dramatic bounce-back in US-French relations compared to just a year ago, when Macron took the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Washington over a US-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multi-billion dollar defense contract. The rift appears to largely be behind them, and Biden and Macron have deepened their ties even more over the last year in their united efforts to combat the war on Ukraine.\n\nElysée announced that Macron gave the president four gifts: a vinyl and CD of the soundtrack to the film the first couple saw on their first date – “Un Homme et une Femme”, a cup from the house Christofle symbolizing links between France and the US, a sweater from the House Saint James and a watch from LIP Horlogerie. He also gave the first lady copies of “Madame Bovary” and “The Plague, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, and Selected Essays.” He gifted Vice President Kamala Harris a model of the Ariane 5 rocket – a reference to common interests on space shared by the US and France.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden and White House staff present the menu during a media preview ahead of the state dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe American president and first lady presented a custom mirror made of fallen wood from the White House grounds that’s a reproduction of a mirror that hangs in the West Wing, according to the White House. Additionally, the French president was gifted a custom vinyl collection of great American musicians along with “an archival facsimile print of Thomas Edison’s 1877 Patent of the American Phonograph,” the White House said. And the first lady gifted Mrs. Macron a pendant necklace designed by a French-American designer.\n\nAfter the official arrival ceremony at the White House, Biden and Macron began bilateral discussions for an Oval Office meeting which lasted just under three hours. Kicking off the meeting, Biden reiterated the importance of the alliance.\n\n“Things are changing rapidly, really rapidly. And it’s really important we stay in close communication. Doesn’t mean that every single solitary thing we agree on. That does mean we agree on almost everything,” he said, adding that they would work toward strengthening “security and prosperity.”\n\nMacron said the Russian invasion in Ukraine will be one of their main topics of discussion and that “sustainable peace” is about respecting sovereign nations.\n\n“We want to build peace and a sustainable peace means full respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine but at the same time a new architecture to make sure we have a sustainable peace in the long run,” Macron added.\n\nUS and French officials had not expected the visit to yield any major deliverables, but both sides see it as an opportunity for the two countries to deepen their partnership on a slew of global challenges. The two sides expected to advance working group discussions that were launched in the wake of last year’s submarine affair to step up cooperation on space, cyberspace and energy issues.\n\nIn a joint statement following their meeting, the two leaders “outlined a shared vision to strengthen security and increase prosperity worldwide, combat climate change, build greater resilience to its effects, and advance democratic values.”\n\nOf particular note, the two leaders wrote they “strongly condemn Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and stress that intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.”\n\nOn the Indo-Pacific, the two leaders pledge to “continue to coordinate on our concerns regarding China’s challenge to the rules-based international order, including respect for human rights, and to work together with China on important global issues like climate change.”\n\nThere are areas of disagreement that were expected to come up.\n\nOne of the biggest points of tension will be over billions of dollars in electric vehicle subsidies included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which applies only to those manufactured in North America. Macron has slammed the measure as protectionist and French officials said he intends to raise the issue in meetings with Biden and congressional leaders. During Thursday’s news conference, Biden confirmed that they discussed the matter in detail.\n\nHe said the US makes “no apologies” for the Inflation Reduction Act, but he admitted there were “some glitches” and changes that may need to be made to the law.\n\nMacron agreed with Biden and reiterated his belief that they’re going to “resynchronize” and said he was not searching for an exemption for his economy but to “discuss the consequences of this legislation.”\n\nIn their joint statement, the US and France said they “reaffirm their shared goal of accelerating the global green energy transition. They look forward to the work of the U.S.-EU Taskforce on the Inflation Reduction Act to further strengthen the U.S.-EU partnership on clean energy and climate through mutually beneficial ways.”\n\nFollowing their morning at the White House, Jill Biden and Brigitte Macron also visited Planet Word, a language-focused museum in Washington. President Macron also attended a lunch at the US State Department.\n\nThursday evening, the Macrons returned to the White House for the first state dinner of the Biden administration. French guests include film director Claude Lelouch, Louvre Museum Director Laurence des Cars and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, according to the French official.\n\nA White House list of state dinner attendees also included comedian Stephen Colbert, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, fashion designer Christian Louboutin, Laurene Powell Jobs, ABC’s Robin Roberts, musician John Legend, Chrissy Teigen, Vogue’s Anna Wintour, film director Baz Luhrmann, as well as actresses Jennifer Garner, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Ariana DeBose. Biden family members, Cabinet members, politicians and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle – including Republicans Steve Scalise and Kevin McCarthy – were also on the list of attendees. New Orleans native Jon Batiste is performing musical selections.\n\nOn Wednesday, Harris welcomed President Macron to NASA to celebrate the cooperation of both nations in space. The first family also held a private dinner with the Macrons ahead of Thursday’s formal state dinner.\n\nDuring the last leg of their US visit, the Macrons will travel to New Orleans on Friday to highlight new efforts to expand French language education in the US.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Donald Judd Betsy Klein Sam Fossum", "Maegan Vazquez", "Donald Judd", "Betsy Klein", "Sam Fossum"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/07/17/defender-scold-sen-bob-corkers-relationship-trump/478689001/", "title": "Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker's relationship with President Donald ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Sen. Bob Corker was clearly frustrated when he told a television interviewer in early May that the Trump administration needed a more consistent foreign policy.\n\n“Thus far,” said the Tennessee Republican, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, “it’s not hitting on all eight.”\n\nFast forward four weeks, and Corker was practically gushing over Donald Trump’s first overseas trip as president — one that most had labeled an outright disaster. “Executed to near perfection,” he said.\n\nSometimes a defender. Occasionally a scold. It’s the role that Corker, the Senate’s foreign policy leader, has played as Trump’s adviser and confidante, his dinner companion and golf partner.\n\nThe relationship between the detail-oriented southerner and the shoot-from-the-hip Manhattanite has remained steady despite Trump’s rollercoaster presidency. And through it all, Corker said, one thing has been consistent.\n\nTrump listens.\n\n“That, to me, I think, would be the greatest surprise to people in Tennessee, whether they are Republican or Democrat, is that this administration — when you talk with them on the phone and you share something with them or you meet with them, they actually take your input into account and think about it,” Corker said. “And you can see the direct effect.”\n\nRead more:\n\nAs White House stumbles, foreign policy power rests with Tennessee's Bob Corker\n\nCorker talks to Trump and his team often.\n\n“I can’t remember calling over to talk to the president and not being immediately put through and having a conversation with him,” he said. “I can call him at 10 o’clock at night, and he’ll get on the phone. Or I can call him early in the morning, and he’ll get on the phone.”\n\nCorker was introduced to Trump during last year’s presidential election, when he advised the then-GOP nominee on foreign policy. Trump later considered naming Corker as his vice presidential running mate and secretary of state. Corker withdrew from consideration for vice president, and the secretary of state job eventually went Rex Tillerson.\n\nBut because of his foreign policy role, Corker has remained solidly within Trump’s orbit.\n\nBefore Trump headed off to the Middle East and Europe in May, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, came to Corker's Senate office and briefed him on the upcoming trip. During the nine-day trip, Trump’s maiden presidential journey abroad, Corker talked to the president no less than four times and then went golfing with him upon his return to Washington.\n\nA few weeks later, Corker was at the Oval Office on other business when Trump invited him to listen in and offer input during his phone call with King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia. The two leaders were discussing an escalating diplomatic crisis among Persian Gulf nations. An official White House photo shows Corker leaning across the Resolute desk and whispering into Trump’s ear as Trump cradles the phone receiver in his hand.\n\n“Sen. Corker is one of President Trump’s most trusted advisers,” said Dina Powell, the president’s deputy national security adviser.\n\nCorker and Trump “speak regularly about the critical national security challenges facing our country,” Powell said last week in a text message sent from Paris, where she was traveling with the president. “He is extremely respected by the entire National Security Team.”\n\nYet Corker has not refrained from publicly taking Trump to task.\n\nThe senator has said on multiple occasions that Trump would be better off if he would get his Twitter obsession under control, especially when it comes to tweeting about foreign policy.\n\n“Statements about foreign policy matters really are best not done through tweets,” Corker said. “They are best done by sitting down with staff and making sure you are sending the right signals, but also trying to meet an objective.”\n\nIn May, Corker made headlines when he told reporters the White House was in a “downward spiral” and needed to get “under control” amid reports that Trump had revealed classified information to high-ranking Russian officials during an Oval Office visit.\n\nRead more:\n\nDonald Trump has evolved on foreign policy, says Sen. Bob Corker\n\nTo outsiders, Corker’s cutting critiques seem born out of the frustration of dealing with a president who’s prone to speaking off the cuff.\n\n“My impression is that he’s trying to be a good team player and hope for the best, but the president keeps going off even the most basic script and causing mini-diplomatic crises,” said Stewart Patrick, a foreign policy analyst with the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nCorker’s public scoldings of Trump, often followed by public praise, seem intended to instill a sense of discipline in the president and his White House, Patrick said.\n\n“Like any parent confronting an unruly toddler, he’s using a mixture of encouragement and criticism,” Patrick said.\n\nCorker, on the other hand, insists his comments are often misinterpreted.\n\nHis “downward spiral” observation was followed by remarks that Trump has a good national security team in place and that “good productive things” were under way. But, the senator notes regretfully, many news accounts left out those parts of his quote.\n\nYet Corker also acknowledges that he sometimes speaks to Trump through the media. For example, the intended audience for the “downward spiral” comment was not the general public, Corker said, but the Oval Office.\n\n“I know what programs the president watches — I’m sorry, I do — and I know when he watches them,\" Corker said. “I know that media accounts have an effect on him.”\n\nThough he often makes his case in private conversations with Trump, the media is also a useful tool to help shape policy “because public opinion is something that the president also pays attention to,” Corker said.\n\nRead more:\n\nCorker critical to Secretary of State pick's confirmation\n\nCorker’s statement that Trump’s trip to the Middle East and Europe was executed “to near perfection” was one of those intended to send a message to the White House, he said.\n\nIt came amid a hailstorm of criticism, with many analysts declaring the trip a disaster for U.S.-European relations.\n\nIn Brussels, Trump berated members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for not spending enough on military defense and failed to endorse a key NATO tenet, which says that an attack on one member of the alliance is an attack on all. Afterward, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that Europe must take its fate into its own hands and warned that the days when European leaders could count on others were at an end.\n\nCorker dismissed Merkel’s comments as a political statement – “she was in a Bavarian beer garden in Germany at a political event” – and said he made a follow-up call to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who assured him others did not share the chancellor’s sentiments.\n\n► Editorial: Why is Bob Corker now silent on Russia\n\n“By the way,” Corker said, leaning across a table in his office and raising his voice for emphasis, “is there something wrong with Germany beginning to take care of itself? OK. I mean, that to me is not a bad outcome.”\n\nThe contentious meeting with European leaders aside, Corker said, the first legs of Trump’s trip — which took him to Israel, the Vatican and Saudi Arabia — were “an out-of-the-park homerun.”\n\n“This trip was well choreographed,” he said. “It was well planned out.”\n\nAnd that was the point he was hoping to get across to Trump with his congratulatory news release, Corker said, “to reinforce the fact that when you plan something out, when you actually have objectives, which they had, and you achieve those objectives, then that’s a good thing.”\n\nThe statement Corker originally planned to release was even more laudatory, he said, suggesting he initially intended to describe the trip’s execution as “perfection.” But when Trump failed to endorse the NATO mutual-defense policy, Corker tweaked his remarks slightly.\n\n“We made it ‘near perfection,’” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/17/rnc-2024-convention-day-3-live-updates-in-milwaukee/74403472007/", "title": "RNC 2024 convention Day 3 review: JD Vance accepts VP nomination", "text": "Here's a review of Day 3 of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nWednesday was another busy day at the RNC, with a lengthy night of speeches including JD Vance accepting his nomination as the GOP vice-presidential candidate.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel provided full coverage. Here's a recap of Wednesday's action.\n\nWatch Trump's motorcade in downtown Milwaukee\n\n(12:25 a.m.)\n\nBusiness on King Drive stayed open, but slower than usual\n\nAs speeches went on inside of Fiserv Forum, some businesses just south of the hard security zone perimeter stayed open.\n\nSome restaurants saw a steady flow of customers, mostly RNC attendees.\n\nCalderone Club and San Giorgio Pizzeria Napoletana on the 800 block of North Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive took mostly walk-in patrons rather than reservations. But Calderone Club was busy with at least two larger parties.\n\nTwo performers entered Silk Exotic Downtown MKE Gentlemen’s Club, 730 N. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr., one wearing a USA flag cowboy hat. It’s been business as usual at the club this week, apart from a difficult commute to work, said bouncer Jake, who declined to share his last name with Journal Sentinel reporters.\n\nIn the empty George Webb Restaurant, 812 N. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr., employee DeAsia, who declined to give her last name, said she predicted foot traffic would pick up after bar close at the 24-hour restaurant, as it had the first two nights of the RNC.\n\n“I feel like it’s always like this until then,” she said.\n\n(11:45 p.m.)\n\n— Jessica Rodriguez and Bridget Fogarty\n\nDancer handing out free admission passes to Silk\n\nDancer Angela Beltran and a handful of others in matching tees — featuring an image of Trump and the words “Legends never die” — were handing out free admission passes to Silk Exotic Downtown MKE Gentlemen’s Club, at 730 N. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr., as RNC attendees left the hard perimeter near the Hyatt Regency hotel.\n\n(11 p.m.)\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\nBusiness as usual at Milwaukee's oldest gay bar, This Is It, but patrons say downtown has been 'a ghost town'\n\nAt least 30 people were mingling and ordering drinks in anticipation for Wednesday night's drag show at This Is It, Milwaukee's oldest gay bar, at around 10 p.m.\n\nEmployees said traffic at the Wells Street establishment today, between the 7 p.m. trivia games and the 10 p.m. drag show, seemed to track with that of other Wednesdays — with mostly regulars and familiar faces.\n\nOne bartender, however, said he thought the conservative, anti-gay rhetoric that's often associated with the GOP may have kept some people home.\n\nOne patron who asked to remain anonymous because of his career said This Is It regulars he'd normally see haven't been around this week. But he blamed it on the road closures and suspected crowdedness brought in by the RNC.\n\nSurprisingly, downtown Milwaukee is like a \"ghost town\" this week, he said, but least it's been easy to find a parking spot.\n\nAccording to the ACLU, 527 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced in the United States. And while Republican legislators are responsible for these bills, many This Is It patrons said they haven't felt apprehensive about going to gay bars during the RNC.\n\nThere's also been buzz on social media this week that the RNC has contributed to a surge in Grindr users. People have taken to social media to post about seeing a surge in the LGBTQ+ dating app.\n\nEmployees and patrons said they were aware of the spike in interest, but that they hadn't yet seen an increase in foot traffic to go with it. Not yet, anyway.\n\n(10:41 p.m.)\n\n— Quinn Clark and Chris Ramirez\n\nJD Vance shouts out Wisconsin factory workers\n\nJD Vance formally accepted his nomination as the GOP vice-presidential candidate Wednesday. In it, the conservative senator said the moment is “about all of us,” including in the key swing states Republicans are hoping Vance will help attract as the VP pick.\n\n“It’s about the auto worker in Michigan, wondering why out-of-touch politicians are destroying their jobs,” Vance said. “It’s about the factory worker in Wisconsin, who makes things with their hands and is proud of American craftsmanship.”\n\n“It’s about the energy worker in Pennsylvania and Ohio,” he continued, “who doesn’t understand why Joe Biden is willing to buy energy from tinpot dictators across the world when he could buy it from his own citizens right here in our own country.”\n\n(10:10 p.m.)\n\n— Savannah Kuchar, USA TODAY\n\nWorld War II veteran from Wisconsin wows RNC crowd\n\nSergeant William “Bill” Pekrul, a Milwaukee native and World War II veteran, told the RNC crowd that “America is still worth fighting for” during his Wednesday night speech.\n\nThe crowd cheered as Pekrul, 99, said that if Trump returned as “commander in chief, I would go back and re-enlist today.”\n\nThe theme for the third night of the convention is \"Make America Strong Once Again.\"\n\nPekrul was awarded two Bronze Stars and a Silver Star for his service in WWII. He has received additional recognition locally since, including in 2019 when he served as Grand Marshall of Milwaukee's Veterans Day Parade.\n\nA Milwaukee native, Pekrul signed up for the U.S. Army at Boys Tech High School (now Bradley Tech), according to an interview with the War Memorial Center that he gave as part of the Wisconsin Veterans Story Project. Pekrul fought with the 29th Infantry in the second wave of troops during the Normandy Invasion on D-Day.\n\n(9:33 p.m.)\n\n— Mary Spicuzza and Zoe Jaeger\n\nSenators press Secret Service for answers on Trump assassination attempt\n\nA group of senators confronted head of Secret Service Kimberly Cheatle while in Milwaukee at the convention, according to a post on X by Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn.\n\n“You owe the people answers,” Blackburn can be heard saying in the video.\n\nLawmakers have raised questions and concerns in the wake of the assassination attempt against Trump about potential gaps in security.\n\n(9:29 p.m.)\n\n— Savannah Kuchar, USA TODAY\n\nRiverside Theater's marquee hypes Milwaukee's shoreline for RNC attendees\n\nWater is central to life in Milwaukee — a fact that likely surprised many RNC delegates this week.\n\nThe Cream City not only sits on Lake Michigan, but also at the confluence of three major rivers: the Milwaukee, Menomonee and Kinnickinnic.\n\nThat was exactly the message on that the Pabst Theater group highlighted Wednesday on The Riverside Theater's marquee: “We’ve got the water, baby! Over 1,400 acres of sandy beaches.”\n\nEach morning of the RNC, the theater has updated its flashing marquee with messages that are not just for visitors, but reminders to Milwaukeeans of why the city's so great.\n\nRead more\n\n(9:20 p.m.)\n\n— Caitlin Looby\n\nCalifornia’s RNC delegation unveils yellow MAGA hats\n\nEveryone knows about the red MAGA hats. But the California delegation on Wednesday changed it up with golden MAGA hats.\n\nThe convention’s largest state delegations, with over 160 delegates at the RNC, stood out in the crowd with their new hats that were given out.\n\n“We’re proud to wear them — just as much as we are Americans as we are Californians,” California delegate Charles Hilliard said.\n\nHilliard said the color was to represent California’s reputation as the Golden State.\n\nFor Hilliard, California’s presence at the RNC is a “big step” for the state’s GOP party, as the state's legislature is held by a Democratic supermajority.\n\n“We feel the tide turning,” Hilliard said in reference to the GOP flipping some California House districts, “restoring us back to the Republican values that Reagan put up when I was a child.”\n\n(9:10 p.m.)\n\n— Tristan Hernandez\n\nRobin Vos shares his thoughts on the RNC\n\nBaby Trump, anti-abortion protester cross paths\n\nOne woman in a baby Trump costume. Another holding what appeared to be an anti-abortion sign.\n\nThe pair crossed paths peacefully just west of Cathedral Square Wednesday night, nodding to each other as they passed on the sidewalk.\n\n\"I think it's wonderful that we can do this,\" said Melissa H., a Milwaukee resident dressed as Trump who declined to give her last name, citing work concerns.\n\nShe said she bought the costume about six years ago, wore it once and kept it for good measure.\n\nAs for why she got it, she said: \"I despise the man.\"\n\nIt comes with limited visibility. The only way to see where she was going was to stare through a slit of clear plastic in the costume's mouth.\n\nThat inability to make her way over curbs meant she limited her wanderings to a handful of blocks on the east side of the Milwaukee River, away from the security zone and the credentials-only \"hard\" perimeter surrounding the primary convention areas.\n\nDespite her distance from the main RNC area, she was catching the eye of passersby. One Lyft driver abruptly pulled over to take a selfie with her and others couldn't help but notice the rotund baby toddling down the street.\n\nReactions, she said, included clapping and people stopping for pictures.\n\nBut her message was less than cheerful.\n\n\"I'm scared,\" she said. \"The pick of his vice president makes it 10 times worse in my opinion, and I did not like the man as a human. I do not think he was a good leader. I do not think he's good for this country.\"\n\nAn independent voter, she expressed concern that neither Trump nor Biden, men in their late 70s and early 80s, respectively, would live to see the end of a second term.\n\n\"JD Vance scares the hell out of me,\" she said of the Ohio senator and vice presidential running mate Trump announced this week.\n\n(8:20 p.m.)\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nAttendees wear ear bandages in solidarity\n\nIn the sea of RNC attendees Wednesday night, one particular accessory stood out: ear bandages.\n\nSome attendees came to Wednesday's evening event brandishing bandages on their right ears. It may not be a TikTok beauty trend any time soon, but it's being seen as a display of solidarity with former president Donald Trump's attempted assassination Saturday.\n\nTrump made his third appearance at the RNC with a large bandage over his ear.\n\n(8:12 p.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nDonald Trump returns for night 3 of the RNC\n\nTrump returned to the RNC for its third night.\n\nHe walked into the arena to booming applause and a standing ovation as “It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World” blasted at Fiserv Forum.\n\n(8 p.m.)\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\nWho is Kai Trump?\n\nKai Trump, the eldest granddaughter of Donald Trump and daughter to Donald Trump Jr., announced on social media that she will speak at the RNC.\n\n\"I am honored to be speaking at the RNC,\" Kai Trump wrote in her Instagram story Wednesday.\n\nWho is Kai Trump? Here's more on her.\n\n(7:50 p.m.)\n\n— Christopher Kuhagen\n\nRNC has kept Milwaukee's downtown commuters away, at least so far\n\nIt looks like the RNC has kept Milwaukee's downtown commuters at bay — so far at least.\n\nMany expected traffic to be heavy amid the convention this week due to increased security and road closures. But that wasn't the case on Monday and Tuesday — at least during peak commute hours along the Marquette Interchange where Interstate 43, I-94 and I-794 meet, according to data from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.\n\nRead more\n\n(7:25 p.m.)\n\n— Caitlin Looby\n\nJustin Trudeau's half-brother campaigns for RFK Jr. at RNC\n\nA caravan of political boosters have been cruising across Milwaukee, waving flags and cheering on their presidential candidate.\n\nNo, they're not here with the RNC. They're supporters of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the dynastic and controversial third-party candidate for president. So far, they say, the reception — even from Trump supporters — has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nKyle Kemper is the man behind the wheel of a tricked out \"Kennedy 2024\" RV that's been blaring campaign jingles around town. Like RFK Jr., Kemper hails from a powerful political family but is \"a bit of a black sheep.\"\n\nKemper is a vocal critic of his half-brother, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\n\"I love him through and through, but I just fundamentally disagree with what he and the Liberal Party of Canada — along with their global partners — have done,\" Kemper told the Journal Sentinel.\n\nKemper is a vaccine skeptic and a cryptocurrency true-believer. He's wary of both the Democratic and Republican parties, and believes both are captured by corporate interests. A few months ago, he sat down for a 52-minute interview with Tucker Carlson.\n\nKemper and his wife, Brittany, have been driving cross-country in their \"Kennedy 2024\" camper since May, along with their three young children: Sequoia; Charlie; and Ayla, who is 10 weeks old. They've been documenting their journey on Instagram and TikTok, and they've met up with Kennedy himself along the way.\n\nThe Kempers were inspired to support RFK Jr.'s presidential campaign after hearing him speak at a cryptocurrency conference in Miami. After the conference, they enlisted the help of Miami graffiti artists to deck out their RV in \"Kennedy 2024\" images and slogans.\n\nMilwaukeeans might've heard their campaign jingles blaring on the RV's loudspeaker. Kemper used AI to adapt John F. Kennedy's 1960 \"Kennedy for Me\" song into many different genres: reggae, reggaeton, soul, pop, dub step, choir and jazz.\n\nJoined by local Kennedy fans and a group of \"Students for Kennedy,\" the RV has been parading down Brady Street and other main drags. Early Wednesday night, they were camped out in front of the Marcus Performing Arts Center.\n\nPassersby were friendly to the Kennedy crew.\n\n\"I'm so glad he finally got Secret Service protection,\" said a woman sporting an RNC lanyard.\n\n(7:06 p.m.)\n\n— Genevieve Redsten\n\nWhat time is JD Vance speaking tonight?\n\nVance, Trump's vice presidential pick, will speak at the convention Wednesday night.\n\nThe RNC schedule lists Vance as speaking between 9:30 and 10 p.m., CT, as the last speaker of the night.\n\n(6:58 p.m.)\n\n— Maia Pandey\n\nTemporary RNC police headquarters sees small protest\n\nProtesters gathered Wednesday afternoon at the building in Greendale serving as the temporary headquarters for the thousands of law enforcement officers in town for RNC security.\n\nThey were there to protest Tuesday’s fatal police shooting of 43-year-old Samuel Sharpe Jr. a few blocks away from the Republican National Convention.\n\nBlack Lives Are Sacred MKE, a group that amplifies Black voices and inspires people of faith to stand up for racial justice, organized the event.\n\n\"We want to remind the nation that these kinds of incidents are not accidents,\" organizer Jodi Delfosse said. \"It's not just a few bad apples in terms of police officers with a heavy hand and a trigger finger, this is systemic racism, and we need to change the way that we police our society.”\n\nThe activist group had placed signs in the dirt bearing the names of victims of police shootings and provided signs for attendees to hold. By 5:40 p.m., when a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter arrived, the crowd had dwindled to two people.\n\nHeather Godley stood on the sidewalk across the street from the headquarters, holding a sign that said “Stop killing people.” A few drivers honked their horns and shouted “Trump!” out the window.\n\n“There are groups in Milwaukee that have been working for months and months to make sure that outside police officers didn't come in and kill folks in Milwaukee,” said Godley, who was there with her husband, Nathan. “And that's exactly what ended up happening. So I just wanted to come out and make sure that they know that that's not acceptable, that we have to make sure that people are not gunned down like what happened in King Park.”\n\nMPD on Wednesday said that going forward, Milwaukee police officers will accompany all visiting police bicycle units.\n\n\"That's a step in the right direction,\" Delfosse said. \"It was my understanding that was going to be the plan from the get-go. … I wish it had been a proactive rather than a reactive step.\"\n\nNathan Godley said the problem is that out-of-town police aren't familiar with local communities.\n\n“They were right next to a homeless camp,\" Nathan Godley said. \"If there had been an MPD officer there, it's very likely that an officer would have known some of the people in this camp would have been skilled at de-escalating, could have used their names — and it needn't have come to this.”\n\nA lieutenant at the headquarters declined to be interviewed and directed reporters to Bridget Esser with the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs for comment. Esser did not respond Wednesday.\n\n—Adrienne Davis and Erik Handley\n\nRep. Bryan Steil on local impact of RNC, Republican unity\n\nStopping by Wisconsin Media Row Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Bryan Steil said the convention has been a great opportunity to showcase Milwaukee and Wisconsin to thousands of people who haven’t been to the city before.\n\nHe said that “long term, the benefits are great” and that the RNC would encourage other conventions to come to Milwaukee. Steil hoped the economic impact would be felt for “years to come.”\n\nFor many businesses downtown, traffic has been slower than expected during the convention. Wednesday morning, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he heard “some concerns” for businesses in the immediate surrounding area of the RNC.\n\nAsked about the message of unity the Republican Party is promoting, Steil told the Journal Sentinel Republicans need to be unified to enact policies to combat the “reckless spending that we see in the Biden administration.”\n\n“Republicans are unified because we need to, for the sake of the country, do and work to get our country back where it needs to be,” Steil said.\n\nSteil added that the energy in Fiserv Forum is high, especially after Trump made his first appearance since Saturday’s assassination attempt. He said he’s looking forward to speeches from Senator JD Vance tonight and Trump tomorrow.\n\n(6:55 p.m.)\n\n— Tristan Hernandez\n\nParents of U.S.-Israeli hostage host meet-and-greet ahead of evening remarks\n\nRonen and Orna Neutra, the parents of 22-year-old American-Israeli hostage Omner Nuetra, hosted a meet-and-greet outside the Baird Center Wednesday afternoon. They're scheduled to speak to delegates and politicians during Wednesday night’s main remarks, one of their largest audiences yet.\n\nThey called on Republicans and Democrats to work together on a hostage deal to release the estimated 120 people still held in Gaza.\n\n“We will talk to anyone. We talk to Republicans, we talk to Democrats, we talk to people that are not in our comfort zone,” Orna said. “This is what is going to bring our hostages and our loved ones home.”\n\n“This is a bipartisan issue,” Ronen added.\n\nThey were joined by Pency Nance, the CEO and president of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee and Liz Hirsh Naftali, the relative of Abigail Mor Edan, a former American hostage in Gaza. Nance led the small group of attendees in a prayer at the end of the event.\n\n(6:50 p.m.)\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nTensions between protesters dissipate after police line up near checkpoint\n\nTensions between arguing protesters outside a security checkpoint near Fiserv Forum quickly dissipated once about two dozen officers lined up along North King Drive.\n\nA crowd had been forming around a handful of protesters who were shouting at each other through bullhorns.\n\nTwo of the people were recognizable as protesters who had been antagonizing each other over the issue of abortion at a protest earlier in the week. Some of the protesters were affiliated with the Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising group, which on Monday staged a “wedding” for the “abortion industry” and the Republican Party.\n\nThe area outside the pedestrian checkpoint, along King Drive at West Highland Avenue, was a point of confluence Wednesday evening for a variety of people with something to say.\n\nThere was a man with a guitar and a microphone singing Christian songs, a woman holding a large, hand-painted sign over her head that described Trump as a racist and a felon, and several apparently amateur videographers doing man-on-the-street interviews.\n\nIt was all happening as delegates and RNC guests were trying to approach the security checkpoint around 5 p.m.\n\nThe area initially had a minimal police presence. But as the tenor of the protesters’ arguments became more intense, about 70 to 80 police moved toward the scene.\n\nMost stood back, waiting. The officers who lined up — some with their bicycles in front of them — did not interact with the protesters but appeared to create a path for cars to pass by.\n\nWithin minutes, most protesters and onlookers left. A handful remained in front of the checkpoint, but they were not arguing with each other. Eventually, the officers left the area as well.\n\nThrough it all, Riverwest resident TW Hansen, a car salesman, was weaving through the crowd, trying to sell bumper stickers to people that read, “Make Milwaukee Famous Again.”\n\nHansen had made the stickers for the 2020 Democratic National Convention, but never got to distribute them because of the toned-down event. So he was there trying to “get my money back out of these, or they rot in my basement forever.”\n\nHansen, a Biden supporter, said he wasn’t bothered by the mix of people expressing their views.\n\n“The weirder the better, if you ask me,” he said. “Life is too short to allow it to be boring.”\n\nStill, he wished people would “sit down, and have a drink, or five, and a laugh, and try to sort this stuff out.”\n\nHe understood that flashy protesters can cause a spectacle, and that people like to be onlookers to something noteworthy. But Hansen was there with a simple mission.\n\n“I just love selling,” he said.\n\n(6:48 p.m.)\n\n— Sophie Carson\n\nAll quiet at Zeidler Union Square Park protest zone\n\nZeidler Union Square Park stayed quiet late Wednesday afternoon, besides about a dozen demonstration event safety staff, a couple of dog walkers and a sunbather.\n\nSeveral protest groups that had scheduled to demonstrate were no-shows.\n\n(6:44 p.m.)\n\n— Jessica Rodriguez\n\nMPD officers will accompany all visiting police bicycle units after fatal shooting\n\nAfter a fatal police shooting a mile from the security zone of the Republican National Convention, everyone from elected officials to activists and reporters had the same question:\n\nWhy were officers from Columbus, Ohio, in King Park?\n\nMilwaukee police officials were clear before the RNC: They did not intend to use non-Milwaukee officers for \"forward-facing\" roles, and they wanted Milwaukee officers to be the ones interacting with local residents.\n\nMutual aid agreements signed by outside agencies had similar language, saying Milwaukee officers should be the ones to make arrests and requiring at least one Milwaukee officer on most assignments.\n\nOn Wednesday, Milwaukee police said they did not consider the Columbus bicycle unit to be a forward-facing unit, since it was a specialty unit primarily tasked with traffic control and responding to potential demonstrations.\n\nBut the department has since made changes. For the last two days of the convention, all bicycle units will have representation from Milwaukee police.\n\nRead more\n\n(6:30 p.m.)\n\n— David Clarey, Alison Dirr and Ashley Luthern\n\nWisconsin GOP delegates say unity will extend to state politics\n\nAs Republicans center their national convention around a message of unity, two Wisconsin delegates say the approach will also apply at the state level — on the heels of two elections lost after bruising GOP primaries.\n\n“I’ve been calling around to a lot of county chairmen — a lot of them. And there might be some differences between people in the party, but we’re all excited and united about Donald Trump. That’s the one thing — and obviously, Eric Hovde, too. But if we don’t win — it’s no fun not having the executive branch,” former Republican Party of Wisconsin chairman Brad Courtney told the Journal Sentinel.\n\nRepublicans can get candidates elected at every other level, but without the executive branch — whether statewide or nationally — it’s hard to accomplish policy wins without holding the executive office, Courtney said.\n\n“So I think we are very united and very excited to do what we did in ‘16,” he said.\n\nRepublican Party of Marathon County chairman Kevin Hermening noted that the implementation of new legislative maps has resulted in some GOP primary challenges in his area. He said he’s calling on Republican candidates in the county to sign a unity pledge ahead of the Aug. 13 primary election.\n\n“If they don't sign it, that's going to send a big message to the primary voters. And honestly, I've told so many people, so many times, that primary elections are not for all voters. They're for the parties to nominate their standard bearer. Obviously, all voters can vote in it, and that's how we ended up with (former gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels) and (former state Supreme Court justice and candidate) Dan Kelly as our nominees last year — because the Democrats came out and voted for their favorite Republican,” Hermening said, clarifying that he meant the ones they thought a Democrat could defeat. “We all know that.”\n\n(5:54 p.m.)\n\n— Jessie Opoien\n\nVance delivers speech to RNC crowd at Discovery World\n\nMilwaukee is known for its many Lake Michigan landmarks, so it's only fitting that they'd serve as a backdrop for some of the top players at the Republican National Convention this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 17, Republican vice president candidate J.D. Vance spoke at Discovery World. Vance spoke about his reaction after the assassination attempt last weekend against Former President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I was so afraid for him, and so afraid for our country,\" Vance said to the RNC crowd on Wednesday.\n\nRead more\n\n(5:50 p.m.)\n\n— Caitlin Looby\n\nTensions high outside hard security zone entry point\n\nGroups of arguing protesters are gathered at a pedestrian entry point at North King Drive and West Highland Avenue.\n\nAt least 70 to 80 officers have arrived and are largely waiting nearby. But several with bikes have lined up along the street, apparently to create a path for cars to pass.\n\nDelegates are arriving for evening events at Fiserv Forum and are passing through the checkpoint.\n\n(5:22 p.m.)\n\n— Sophie Carson and Vanessa Swales\n\nDemocrats launch 9 billboards highlighting Vance's abortion comments\n\nDemocrats launched nine new billboards in both English and Spanish criticizing Vance's comments on a national abortion ban.\n\nAccording to reporting from CNN, Vance in 2022 said he wanted to see abortion banned nationally, because people seeking abortions would travel from states where its banned to those with liberal abortion laws. Without federal action, he said, abortion couldn't be completely stopped.\n\nVance earlier this week said he planned to adhere to Trump's view on abortion as a state issue, though.\n\n“Alabama’s going to make a different decision from California. That is a reasonable thing,\" he said in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Monday. \"And that’s how I think we build some bridges and have some respect for one another.”\n\nThe new ads, which feature a photo of Vance, will appear along I-94 and I-43.\n\n(5 p.m.)\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nScene outside security checkpoint on King Drive\n\nA pedestrian entry point into the hard zone at North King Drive and West Highland Avenue is serving as a point of confluence of a variety of protesters, activists and RNC attendees.\n\nOne woman is holding a painted sign calling Trump a racist and felon. One man with a bullhorn who has been present at several RNC protesters this week is repeating inflammatory chants.\n\nThere are also activists from the Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, and amateur social media videographers, and a man singing songs with Christian messages.\n\nAll those people are standing in front of the barricades that delegates are using to enter the secure perimeter. Among those who exited vehicles into the chaotic mix Wednesday before 5 p.m. was Wisconsin Senate candidate Eric Hovde.\n\n(4:45 p.m.)\n\n— Sophie Carson and Vanessa Swales\n\nUNC fraternity students who protected American flag enter RNC\n\nThe frat boys are here.\n\nSpecifically, the group of students and fraternity members at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill whose video went viral for holding up the American flag during a pro-Palestinian protest this spring have arrived at the RNC.\n\nThe Trump campaign had announced it was inviting the group last week. The group is among the \"Everyday American Convention speakers\" joining the various sessions throughout the week.\n\nThe students gained national attention when they held up the American flag during the campus protests opposing the United States' role in funding Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas War. Many conservative leaders applauded the students' actions, calling the young men patriots.\n\n(4:33 p.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nWisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde chugs a beer outside Fiserv Forum\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde won a beer-chugging challenge during a live taping of the \"Ruthless Podcast\" outside Fiserv Forum. A video posted to X, formerly Twitter, showed Hovde finished his beer in about five seconds.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is also known for a beer-chugging video from 2022, in which he thanked the Tavern League of Wisconsin for endorsing him. He chugged a slightly larger beer than Hovde did Wednesday, finishing in 3.79 seconds.\n\nHovde is running against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and gave a speech at the RNC Tuesday night.\n\n(4:15 p.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nBusiness has been 'amazing' for one RNC vendor\n\nSequined hats. Stickers. T-shirts with a muscular version of Trump.\n\nVendors have popped up inside and around the RNC security perimeter, selling all kinds of merchandise.\n\nOne seller, Leeann Joyner, said she’s “been doing amazing” during the convention. Her top seller has been cowboy Trump hats, which cost $60 each.\n\nShe’s also selling hats with fake hair made to look like the hair of the former president.\n\nJoyner lives in Orlando, Florida, and travels across the country, selling Trump merchandise at events. She started her business during the COVID-19 pandemic to supplement her income.\n\n“I was a marketing director but I’m making more money here,” Joyner said.\n\n(4:10 p.m.)\n\n— Alex Groth\n\nVoces de la Frontera condemns death of Samuel Sharpe, man shot by Columbus, Ohio, police\n\nA day after Columbus, Ohio, police shot and killed Samuel Sharpe, an unhoused man living at a tent encampment in King Park, Voces de la Frontera released a press release condemning the shooting.\n\nSharpe was killed by five nearby officers from Columbus when they saw he was wielding a knife and lunged at another individual. The officers had ordered Sharpe to drop his weapon before shooting him.\n\nVoces de la Frontera, a grassroots nonprofit that advocates for immigrants and the Latino and Hispanic community in Wisconsin, had warned about the possible dangers of bringing out-of-town law enforcement to Milwaukee. It's a mindset shared by the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression and other Milwaukee organizations.\n\nChristine Neumann-Ortiz, Voces de la Frontera executive director, said in the Wednesday press release that she feared the 4,000 additional police officers in the area would bring \"deadly encounters, particularly involving out-of-state officers who do not know our community.\"\n\nNeumann-Ortiz's statement joins ongoing community outcry from friends, neighbors and homeless and housing advocates, who knew Sharpe in the King Park area as Jehovah.\n\n\"Safer communities that build trust with local law enforcement depend on de-escalation tactics and the redirection of community tax dollars from more militaristic police operations, jails, and repression to providing necessary resources for housing, healthcare, mental health services, and other essential needs,\" Neumann-Ortiz said.\n\n(4:05 p.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nScenes from outside the RNC on Wednesday\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: 'We are in the middle of a war ... but our enemy is an ideology'\n\nAt a lunch event at the Harley-Davidson Museum on Wednesday, Ohio businessman and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy told the California delegation the country is in “a war.”\n\n“We are in the middle of a war in this country — a war for the survival of the United States of America,” Ramaswamy said. “But our enemy is an ideology, a toxic ideology, but an ideology, nonetheless. Not our fellow citizens.”\n\nRamaswamy put Republicans in the role of rescuers of people whose views align more with Democrats.\n\n“I view our job as Republicans almost as the job of a liberator,” Ramaswamy said, then comparing Trump to President Abraham Lincoln. “Donald Trump, I believe, has been given the (second) chance that Abraham Lincoln ... didn’t get.”\n\nRamaswamy isn't the first high-profile speaker to make a inflammatory statement since Trump was shot.\n\nAt an earlier RNC speech, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said Democratic policies were \"a clear and present danger to America, to our institutions, our values and our people.\"\n\nBut that was blamed on the wrong version of a speech being loaded in a teleprompter.\n\n(4 p.m.)\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nWisconsin delegate's dog, Lambeau, is taking hundreds of selfies, did not meet Babydog\n\nDogs have stolen the show at the Republican National Convention — including Lambeau, a 7-year-old purebred English Labrador retriever service dog.\n\n\"I had no expectations of anything,\" Lambeau's human, Wisconsin delegate Terrence Wall, said.\n\n\"I didn't know what to expect. It's the first time to be at a convention, and I am stunned. I was worried about, 'How do I keep a low profile?' And everyone wants to talk to him and meet him.\"\n\nLambeau has gotten his photo taken at least 250 to 300 times a day, Wall said. He met someone from California at Convention Fest whose daughter saw Lambeau on TV and said, \"You gotta track him down and get a selfie.\"\n\n\"I'm just his agent,\" joked Wall, a real estate developer and former U.S. Senate candidate.\n\nSo, did Lambeau meet Babydog, who appeared on stage with her owner, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, during his speech Tuesday night?\n\n\"By total coincidence, I stepped out with him to go to the bathroom\" when Babydog came out, Wall said. \"Which is probably good, because if he saw (her), he would probably want to go greet her and lick her and say hi.\"\n\n(3:50 p.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nWisconsin delegates united in concerns about border, economy\n\nFor Wisconsin State Treasurer John Leiber, economic growth and stability are always top of mind. As a Wisconsin RNC delegate, he said he feels the Republican Party's approach to tackling inflation is ideal compared to the \"Bidenomics\" of the past four years.\n\nLeiber and fellow Wisconsin delegate Matthew Russ walked through Wisconsin Media Row on Wednesday to share about their convention experience and issues important to them.\n\n\"The other side doesn't seem to think there was an issue, but everyone can see, you go to the gas station, go to the grocery store, it's there, and it's real,\" Leiber said of inflation. \"We need a party that's willing to address it and acknowledge it exists.\"\n\nLeiber and Russ said border security remains an issue that they hope to see addressed if Trump wins in November.\n\n\"We're letting in millions and millions of people who haven't gone through the process we have in our immigration system. We have it set up for a reason,\" Russ said. \"If too many people come in, we can't care for them, so it's really not a loving thing.\"\n\nThe pair said that they were happy to see Trump select JD Vance as his running mate, because it demonstrated that the party is focused on selecting a candidate who'll wholeheartedly support Trump in his legislative agenda and not waver from campaign promises.\n\nFor Russ and Leiber, the party feels more united in its mission than it ever has.\n\n(3:45 p.m.)\n\n— Tamia Fowlkes\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene applauded as she enters Baird Center for book signing\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia walked into the Baird Center during Convention Fest and was met from applause from RNC attendees.\n\nGreene was escorted to a private room a little before 3 p.m. and returned to a crowd of media and RNC attendees around 3:10 p.m. for an official book signing of her book, \"MTG.\"\n\nA line of about 40 people cheered as Greene walked out. Then, they waited for their chance to get their book signed and get a photo op with her.\n\n(3:35 p.m.)\n\n— Jordyn Noennig and Alex Groth\n\nDonald Trump conducts walkthrough at the RNC\n\nTrump is conducting a walkthrough Wednesday afternoon at Fiserv Forum ahead of his acceptance speech Thursday.\n\nThe Fiserv Forum floor was cleared for the former president's rehearsal around 2:30 p.m.\n\nTrump, who was officially named the Republican nominee for president Monday, has been in attendance during the RNC speeches Monday and Tuesday nights.\n\nTrump's speech will come just days after he survived an assassination attempt during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The wounds of that attack have been visible on Trump, who has had a white bandage over his right ear. A bullet grazed his ear when a 20-year-old opened fire at Trump on stage at the rally.\n\nTrump will likely be in attendance again Wednesday night as he hears from his son, Donald Trump Jr., and Vance, among others. Tonight's theme is \"Make America Strong Once Again.\"\n\n(3:15 p.m.)\n\n— Christopher Kuhagen\n\nKing Drive slow but steady for lunch as convention-goers spread around the city for RNC events\n\nBars and restaurants along North Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive had a slow but steady crowd for lunch.\n\nTables of officers, RNC guests and media were found around the Milwaukee Brat House, Who’s on Third and Copper on King.\n\nThree RNC guests were sitting at a table outside Copper, enjoying lunch and drinks, one sipping on a Lakefront IPA.\n\nJohnny Shae of Memphis said that it was his second time at Copper. A sign advertising brunch caught his eye.\n\n“The staff are great. They’re extremely friendly,” Shae said.\n\nPeter Marshall, owner of Copper, said business has been steady.\n\n“It’s been going really well for us, but I mean it’s not 50,000 people,” Marshall said. “It’s just nice and consistent all day long, but not overwhelming, but good. We’re happy.”\n\nMarshall, an England native, said he was most excited to see Liz Truss, the former prime minister of the United Kingdom, who served only 50 days in 2022.\n\nCopper had booked three private parties. Marshall also special ordered to-go coffee cups for officers patrolling the area, given the block doesn't have a dedicated coffee shop. He said he’s gone through hundreds of cups in three days.\n\nMany convention-goers were heading to events around Milwaukee before going to the entertainment district, where RNC speeches will start at 5:45 p.m. inside Fiserv Forum.\n\nMany RNC guests were invited to an event at American Family Field and a concert at the Harley-Davidson Museum.\n\n“I block off my morning because I’m still working, and then in the afternoon, we’re going to events and whatnot,” said Mike Andrews of Virginia. He was a guest of the RNC and staying at Saint Kate — The Arts Hotel.\n\n“Today, we’re going to an event at the ballpark and then we’re heading to the Milwaukee Public Museum for an event there,” he said.\n\nHe still made time to break away from scheduled events to check out the lakefront and take a Miller Brewery tour.\n\n“We’ve enjoyed it here,” he said.\n\n(2:30 p.m.)\n\n— Jordyn Noennig\n\nWyoming couple talk about RNC obstacles to exploring Milwaukee\n\nUnder a patio umbrella outside the Milwaukee Brat House, 1013 N. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr., Wyoming couple Bill and Roxie Hensley ate lunch — an Italian sausage for Bill and a brat for Roxie.\n\nIt was the first time the Hensleys had gone much beyond the security perimeter during their week in Milwaukee for the RNC, they said.\n\n“I feel like we've done everything we can do inside,” said Bill Hensley, an alternate delegate for Wyoming.\n\nHe said the trek from the Wyoming delegation’s hotel in Racine has been part of the challenge, plus the delegates from their state are almost entirely first-time RNC attendees. There hasn't been anyone to explain how the convention schedule works, or if there's time to explore, Hensley said.\n\nLots of people stayed in the convention hall for hours Monday and Tuesday, he said.\n\n“If we had someone who had been here before, they could have said, ‘Hey, here's what it's gonna look like,’” Hensley said. \"We just had to figure it out on our own.”\n\nBut convention security could also be a concern, Roxie Hensley said. Ohio police shot and killed an armed man outside of the RNC perimeter Tuesday. Roxie Hensley said she originally heard that it happened inside the security perimeter until someone explained otherwise.\n\n“It’s possible since last Saturday that people have been cautious,” she said.\n\nOther convention delegates agreed that back-to-back events, meetings and evening speeches have made it difficult to explore Milwaukee beyond the convention area.\n\n“It’s been a packed schedule,” said Duke Lowrie, a Louisiana delegate, as he tried to find a security entrance on the east side of the convention Wednesday morning. “We just haven’t had time yet.”\n\n(2 p.m.)\n\n— Brittany Carloni, Indy Star\n\nOne Uber driver is trying to avoid RNC\n\nCurtis Boyd, 77, is doing his best to keep his Uber away from the RNC. But he said he has little choice when the algorithm directs him to pick up a suburban passenger heading into downtown Milwaukee, even if he’s no fan of the road closures that have helped to make it something of a ghost town for local businesses.\n\n“I just work for a bit, wherever it takes me,” Boyd told USA TODAY as he navigated his Toyota Sienna onto an interstate ramp into the city Wednesday. While recognizing he could end up doing loop after loop, driving passengers to the convention site, he said he hoped to be far from the Republican confab “as fast as possible.”\n\nBoyd is a Mississippi native who has been in Wisconsin for most of his life. He’s also a retired cab driver who, a few years ago, sold his business and moved to Uber part-time, about four to five hours a day.\n\n“It’s good money,” he said, adding that he doesn’t typically do an itemized look at the fares he’s making and wasn’t familiar with the specific surge pricing differences that are adding a few more dollars to his wallet, thanks to the RNC.\n\n(1:20 p.m.)\n\n— Sam Woodward and Darren Samuelsohn, USA TODAY\n\n3rd Street Market Hall business picking up but still below normal\n\nA walk through 3rd Street Market Hall during Wednesday's lunch hour found increased activity over Monday and Tuesday, but business still below the typical noon rush.\n\n\"It's been a little bit busier,\" said Joannah Connors, manager at Mid-Way Bakery.\n\nAlso, the food hall, 275 W. Wisconsin Ave., hosted a private event Tuesday night which boosted business, said Edgar Aispuro, owner of Criollo, a Latin American food vendor, and Johnathan Dye, founder of Mr. Dye's Pies.\n\n\"That was good,\" Dye said.\n\n(1:10 p.m.)\n\n— Tom Daykin\n\nMajor Goolsby’s slow during the day but cops, parties keep it going\n\nThe noon crowd at Major Goolsby’s, 340 W. Kilbourn Ave., on Wednesday was about 10 people. That’s been the case the last several days with the convention in town.\n\n“Unfortunately, it’s been a bit slower than we like during the day, than we would prefer,” manager Jessica Mullins said. “But we’ve been really lucky because we booked parties.”\n\nMullins said if Goolsby's didn’t have any parties in the evenings, it would have been “a little bit of a letdown.”\n\nMullins said being right up against the hard security perimeter and road closures have made it difficult for pedestrians to get there.\n\nHowever, it hasn’t been difficult for the thousands of law enforcement and first responders in Milwaukee.\n\n“We have kind of become the cop bar,” Mullins said, adding the restaurant gives uniformed first responders and military 50% off discounts.\n\n“So we have had almost all the police, all day, every day, coming in, so that has helped tremendously.”\n\n(1 p.m.)\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nKristin Brey, JR Radcliffe talk about RNC Day 2: Police shooting, taking Trump's photo, slow downtown business\n\nFormer Republican congressman Scott Klug on trusting Wisconsin elections\n\nFormer Republican congressman Scott Klug stopped by Wisconsin Media Row Wednesday morning to talk about his involvement in the bipartisan Democracy Defense Project, which works to build trust in elections in multiple battleground states, including Wisconsin.\n\n\"We think there's been a lot of stories told about the 2020 election that have nothing to do with reality,\" Klug said. The RNC itself isn't the target of that message, he said.\n\n\"Let me speak bluntly as a former Republican congressman: I think there's a lot of people in here who are rabid Republicans, who believe there was election fraud in 2020. I don't think there's any evidence of it in Wisconsin, whatsoever,\" Klug said.\n\nKlug leads the project in Wisconsin with former Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, former Republican Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen and former state Democratic party chair Mike Tate.\n\nKlug said Wisconsin would be smart to look at reforms that have worked in other states, such as Nebraska's system of drafting poll workers like jurors.\n\nMaking that a requirement could stem conspiracies, he said, if \"half the people don't even want to be in the room. They're just there so they don't get arrested.\"\n\nKlug expressed support for voting early, and said it's important to find a way to start processing early votes faster. A bill to allow processing absentee ballots a day early, and prevent perceptions of \"ballot dumps,\" failed in the state Legislature this session.\n\n\"You wouldn't have the mysterious trucks in the night at the Milwaukee counting center, which exists only because the folks in the Legislature can't get it done,\" Klug said.\n\n(12:30 p.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp and Tamia Fowlkes\n\nWednesday night speaker schedule released, includes JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr. and Milwaukee veteran\n\nThe RNC has released its Wednesday night schedule and list of speakers.\n\nThe list includes Vance and his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, as well as Donald Trump Jr.\n\nIt also includes Peter Navarro, the former director of U.S. Office of Trade & Manufacturing, who just got out of jail Wednesday morning after serving four months for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAlso speaking will be Gold Star families and several decorated veterans, in keeping with the night's theme, \"Make America Strong Once Again.\" One speaker will be Sergeant William Pekrul, a Milwaukee native who's a decorated World War II and D-Day veteran.\n\nThere will also be a musical performance by country music artist Brian Kelley and the Holy Redeemer Church of God in Christ Choir.\n\nHere are a few more of Wednesday night's speakers:\n\n6-6:30 p.m.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace (South Carolina)\n\nRep. Ronny Jackson (Texas); Jackson was also the White House doctor during the Obama administration and served as physician to the president during the Trump administration.\n\nRep Matt Gaetz (Florida)\n\n6:30-7 p.m.\n\nFormer Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich\n\nPeter Navarro, former director of U.S. Office of Trade & Manufacturing\n\n7-7:30 p.m.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott (Texas)\n\nTrent Conaway, the mayor of East Palestine, Ohio, which was in the news last year as the site of a February 2023 train derailment\n\nGov. Doug Burgum (North Dakota), who was thought to be on Donald Trump's shortlist of vice-presidential nominee possibilities\n\nKellyanne Conway, who served as counselor to the president in the Trump administration\n\n7:30-8 p.m.\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna (Florida)\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host and Donald Trump Jr.'s fiancee\n\n8-8:30 p.m.\n\nRep. Michael Waltz (Florida)\n\n8:30-9 p.m.\n\nSergeant William Pekrul\n\n9-9:30 p.m.\n\nDonald J. Trump Jr.\n\nUsha Chilukuri Vance\n\n9:30-10 p.m.\n\nSen. JD Vance\n\n(12:15 p.m.)\n\n— Amy Schwabe\n\nMan arrested blocks from Fiserv Forum on Monday was carrying AK-47\n\nA 21-year-old man arrested blocks from the RNC on Monday was carrying an AK-47 pistol, the Milwaukee Country district attorney's office said Wednesday.\n\nThe man, identified as Donnell V. Tinsley of Milwaukee, was wearing black pants and gloves, a tan sweatshirt, a ski mask and was carrying \"a large black tactical backpack,\" according to Milwaukee police.\n\nTinsley was walking south on the 1200 block of North 11th Street, away from an RNC security checkpoint, when a Homeland Security Investigations special agent and a U.S. Capitol Police officer patrolling the area noticed him. The officers stopped him around 10:45 a.m., according to police.\n\nSearching Tinsley's backpack, officers found a fully loaded magazine containing 7.62X39-caliber rifle ammunition. They also found a \"Scream\" movie mask, flashlight, two sets of black gloves with rubber fingertips, sunglasses, an Allied Universal Security uniform shirt, two cans of spray paint and multiple empty marijuana bags, according to court documents. Tinsley didn't have a concealed carry permit for his weapon, police said.\n\nThe arrest came just days after shots were fired at Trump at his Pennsylvania rally. Officials found an AR-style rifle at the scene.\n\nThough Gov. Tony Evers reportedly sought to ban within the \"soft security perimeter\" of the RNC after the attempted assassination, state law prevented the city or Secret Service from implementing such a rule. Guns aren't allowed within the RNC's \"hard perimeter,\" which includes Fiserv Forum, Baird Center and the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena.\n\nFollowing Monday's arrest, the state will request a \"no weapons/no contact order\" within the RNC's soft perimeter for the rest of the convention, Milwaukee police said. Thursday is the last day of the convention.\n\n(Noon)\n\n— Maia Pandey\n\nDemocrats attack Republicans on abortion stance\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz and U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas joined the Biden-Harris campaign in an attack on Republicans' abortion stance Wednesday morning, calling it a \"dark vision\" for America.\n\n\"The Trump-Vance ticket does not care about women,\" Escobar said during a press conference in Milwaukee.\n\n\"One in three women in America now live in a state with an abortion ban. That's one in three women of childbearing age. It is an abomination that this is the vision they have for all American women.\"\n\nAmanda Zurawski, a resident of Austin, Texas, spoke at the event about her experience after she was denied a medically necessary abortion after extreme complications with her first pregnancy. She and her husband were devastated, she said, and she hoped to have a safe abortion provided by her doctor so she could heal both mentally and physically.\n\n\"I was told to wait until I got so sick that my life was considered in danger, one of the rare exceptions where a doctor can intervene in Texas,\" she said. \"It took three days and a near-death crash into septic shock before my doctor could finally provide the health care I desperately needed.\"\n\nZurawski said, after the abortion procedure to save her life, she again crashed into septic shock and was in the intensive care unit for three days.\n\n\"My family flew in from across the country for fear that I wouldn't make it through the night,\" she said.\n\nThe abortion ban had gone back into effect only days before Zurawski found out her baby wouldn't live, and seeing Trump and supporters brag about overturning Roe v Wade has been difficult for her.\n\n\"It is unthinkable to me that anyone could cheer on the cruel abortion bans that nearly took my life, but they do,\" she said.\n\nWalz also addressed the concern over Biden's health, too. When asked if Biden would be able to speak on issues such as abortion without a teleprompter, Walz said he was confident, but that it's not the time for men to be delivering messages about abortion.\n\n\"As a man, it's time to shut the hell up and stand back,\" he said. \"I think it's much more important that we have the narratives of the people who are out there.\"\n\n(11:45 a.m.)\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nU.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman talks police shooting, lack of focus on abortion\n\nIn an interview on Wisconsin Media Row on Wednesday morning, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman said his convention experience is \"all positive.\"\n\nHe's been to four Republican conventions but said this has been \"the best of the four because Milwaukee's the best city. It's a hidden gem.\" He thinks constituents in his district are \"paying a little more attention\" to the RNC because it's in Milwaukee.\n\nAsked for his response to Columbus, Ohio, police shooting and killing a homeless man about a mile from the RNC Tuesday, Grothman said he saw the body camera footage.\n\n\"Some guy was trying to attack another guy with two knives,\" Grothman said. \"Sometimes on these shootings, you got to really wonder, what was the police supposed to do, right? Let the guy get stabbed to death?\"\n\nAfter little talk of abortion in the party platform and in convention speeches, Grothman said he'll take Trump's word that it's an issue left to the states.\n\n\"I don't expect to be voting on any pro-life, pro-abortion bans in the next two years that he's president ... next four years, really.\"\n\n(11:20 a.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp and Tamia Fowlkes\n\nMusic video featuring Amber Rose is played at RNC\n\nA music video of the song, \"Trump Trump Baby,\" was played at the RNC. The song, by Trump-supporting rapper, Forgiato Blow, is rapped to the tune of Vanilla Ice's 1990 \"Ice Ice Baby.\"\n\nAmber Rose, the model, influencer and former reality TV star who spoke Monday night, appears in the video, with Rose and Forgiato Blow donning red MAGA hats as they dance to the music.\n\nErin Reed, a writer and researcher who tracks anti-transgender legislation, posted about the video on X and said that \"the audience was silent afterwards.\"\n\n(11:05 a.m.)\n\n— Amy Schwabe\n\nWho is Babydog Justice? Meet the English bulldog charming RNC attendees\n\nPeople who tuned in to broadcast coverage of Tuesday evening's program at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee got an unexpected treat during a speech from West Virginia Republican Gov. Jim Justice.\n\nJustice, a member of a prominent coal mining family who's now running for U.S. Senate, told the crowd, \"We become totally unhinged if Donald Trump is not elected in November.\"\n\nThen the camera angle widened, bringing a short and stout bulldog into frame, tongue out, appearing to listen attentively to her owner's words.\n\nThat's Babydog Justice.

This is also the start and end point for the city-designated march route.\n\n(8:30 a.m.)\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nJohnson says Ohio officers appear to have saved other man's life in fatal shooting\n\nThe morning after Ohio police in town for the RNC fatally shot a homeless man, Johnson said the officers' response appeared to have saved another man's life.\n\n\"No one, absolutely no one, wanted this outcome, and I anticipate a full as well as thorough investigation,\" Johnson said. \"The deceased individual had family, had friends, and my thoughts certainly are with them. My thoughts are also with the police officers from Columbus, Ohio. I'm sure they did not expect to be drawn into a tragic situation such as the one that they were involved in yesterday.\"\n\nHe added: \"The information we have leaves a clear impression that these Columbus officers, they saved the life of an unarmed man from death or perhaps serious injury.\"\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, five officers from Columbus, Ohio shot and killed a man identified by a cousin as Samuel Sharpe Jr., who lived in one of Milwaukee's tent encampments and was known in the near west side neighborhood around King Park.\n\nThirteen Columbus officers were holding a briefing when they saw an altercation between two people, one of whom had a knife in each hand, according to preliminary information provided by Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman late Tuesday.\n\nHe didn't drop the knives when ordered to by police and instead suddenly lunged at the other person, which is when police opened fire, Norman said.\n\nRead more here\n\n(8:20 a.m.)\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nJon Stewart explains why 'The Daily Show' canceled Milwaukee RNC plans\n\nOn “The Daily Show” Tuesday night, Jon Stewart talked about the show’s cancellation of its planned appearances in Milwaukee.\n\n“The Daily Show” was originally slated to tape its Monday through Thursday episodes in front of an audience at the Marcus Performing Arts Center. On his Tuesday night show — the first \"Daily Show\" episode since the start of the RNC — Stewart said one of the reasons for canceling Milwaukee plans was that the Marcus Performing Arts Center shifted from the soft security perimeter to the hard security perimeter.\n\n“You don’t want to be in the hard perimeter,” Stewart joked, adding that law enforcement had added “cages around the theater” and that, “We didn’t feel we’d be able to do the show effectively without people.”\n\nRead more here\n\n(7:40 a.m.)\n\n— Amy Schwabe\n\nNielsen reports more than 18 million viewers tuned in for Day 1 of the RNC\n\nMore than 18 million viewers turned on their televisions to watch the first night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, according to Nielsen, a company that measures media audiences.\n\nThat’s higher than viewership on Day 1 of the 2020 convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, which was about 12 million, Nielsen said in a Tuesday release. These numbers don’t include people streaming the convention online.\n\nTV coverage changed the nature of political conventions, USA TODAY has reported, making them more choreographed and strategic. In turn, viewership has dropped as audiences have started to feel like they know what to expect when they tune in. In 2020, for example, 23.8 million Americans watched broadcasts of the Republican convention, according to Nielsen, compared to 32.2 million in 2016.\n\nViewership is typically highest on the last day of the convention.\n\n(7 a.m.)\n\n— Madeline Heim\n\nWeather forecast for RNC Day 3 in Milwaukee: Pleasant temps, with a slight chance of afternoon rain\n\nAfter a steamy start to the Republican National Convention on Monday, Wednesday’s weather forecast again looks to be cooler, with a slight chance of rain in the afternoon and evening.\n\nMilwaukee will be mostly sunny Wednesday with a high of 79 degrees, according to the National Weather Service, with a 20% chance of showers after 2 p.m. There’s also a 20% chance of showers in the evening before 9 p.m.\n\nThe city can expect “pleasant weather” the rest of the week, the weather service said on X, with below-average temperatures and few chances for rain.\n\n(6:30 a.m.)\n\n— Madeline Heim\n\nRNC Day 3 schedule: Here's the Republican National Convention time, events for Wednesday\n\nThe fourth official session of the convention will be at Fiserv Forum Wednesday from 5:45 to 10 p.m. The official speakers list is released mid-day ahead of the nighttime event.\n\nConvention-related events are taking place around the city and southeast Wisconsin. They include screenings of \"Reagan,\" the 2024 Dennis Quaid-led biopic of the former president; a breakfast hosted by the New Hampshire GOP at Grand Geneva Forum in Lake Geneva; a delegation luncheon hosted by the Utah Republican Party at Hubbard Park Lodge; a Lakefront brewery lunch and tour hosted by Washington state delegation; the Great American Farm Fair at Malchine Farms; and two events at the Harley-Davidson Museum: a Hogs and Dogs concert in the afternoon and Europe Night in the evening.\n\nMany events require tickets or registration; more information can be found here.\n\nThe convention isn't open to the general public, but according to an RNC spokesperson, you can stream it on YouTube, X, Facebook Live, Rumble, Amazon Prime, Twitch and Direct TV. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel will also stream RNC events, as will the City Channel.\n\nThe official convention watch party takes place each day at the Drink Wisconsinbly Pub, 320 W.

Just two months ago, on Carter’s 100th birthday, Trump suggested the terminally ill centenarian was happy because Joe Biden had finally replaced him as the worst president ever.\n\nCarter often gave as good as he got. A Georgia peanut farmer before he got his start in politics, Carter was no Georgia peach when it came to his assessment of Trump.\n\nWhen late-night TV host Stephen Colbert asked him in 2018 if Americans wanted “kind of a jerk” as their leader, Carter didn’t miss a beat. \"Apparently, from this recent election, yes,” he retorted.\n\nEarlier this year, Carter suggested to his son, Chip Carter, that he wanted to live long enough to vote for Trump’s rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, in November. Two weeks before election, Carter’s office confirmed that he had voted by mail. For Harris.\n\nAmid the barrage of insults and smack talk were temporary moments of rapprochement between the 39th and the 45th presidents.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, Carter occasionally came to his defense.\n\nCarter not only attended Trump’s first inauguration, he was the first former president to RSVP. Later that year, in 2017, Carter suggested the media had been harder on Trump than any other president. Trump responded by tweeting a message of thanks to Carter for “the nice remarks.”\n\nJimmy Carter on long life, philanthropy: 'I've had an exciting and adventurous and gratifying existence'\n\nIn 2019, Trump’s White House announced that Carter had written Trump a “beautiful” letter about trade talks with China and that the two men had had a \"very good telephone conversation\" on China and other topics.\n\n\"The president has always liked President Carter and First Lady Rosalynn Carter and extended his best wishes to them on behalf of the American people,\" the White House statement said.\n\nIf Trump liked Carter, he seldom let it show.\n\nIn 2014, Trump joked that Carter was dead, even though the former president was very much alive. While speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump referred to the \"late, great Jimmy Carter.\"\n\n“Of course I don't think Jimmy Carter is dead,” he tweeted later amid criticism for the gaffe. “Just being sarcastic,” he said, adding, “but never thought he was alive as President, stiff!\"\n\nOn several occasions, Trump called Carter the worst president in history – at least until Barack Obama came along.\n\n\"I never thought I'd say it in my lifetime, but President Barack Hussein Obama, aka Barry Sotoro, is a far worse president than Jimmy Carter!\" Trump said in 2014.\n\nTrump, who has a tendency to change his stories to suit his audience, offered a slightly different take after Biden defeated him in 2020. He suggested several times that Biden, not Obama, had replaced Carter as the worst president ever.\n\nJimmy Carter state funeral: President to be honored in Washington before burial in Georgia\n\nFor his part, Carter called Trump “a disaster” of a president during a 2018 interview with The Washington Post and suggested the Republican held “an attitude of ignorance toward the truth.”\n\nThe next year, Carter told his church congregation in Plains, Georgia, that Trump had called him to discuss the letter he had sent to Trump about China. Carter suggested China would likely surpass the U.S. as an economic superpower because it had been able to avoid the military entanglements that have drained funds that might otherwise have been spent on infrastructure.\n\n\"I don’t really fear that time, but it bothers President Trump, and I don’t know why,” Carter said. “I’m not criticizing him – this morning,\" he added.After Trump was elected to a second term in November, Carter, who had been in hospice for nearly two years, announced he would not attend Trump’s inauguration but would be there if not for his deteriorating health.\n\nIn a pair of statements after Carter’s passing, Trump made reference to his disagreements with the former president.\n\nThis time, however, he not only dispensed with the insults, he even suggested that Carter had earned his respect.\n\n“While I strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically, I also realized that he truly loved and respected our Country, and all it stands for,” he wrote. “He worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect.”\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

The Capitol was put on lockdown, and it took several hours for it to be secured. Lawmakers evacuated the House and Senate chambers. Vice President Mike Pence was also moved to a safe location.\n\nCongress returned later that evening to certify Biden's victory, but the country — watching the riot live on television — was shaken. The chaos led to the deaths of multiple people on the day of the attack or shortly thereafter. Several officers who responded during the Capitol attack later died by suicide.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were charged by the Justice Department in connection with the riot.

The air conditioning was set at full blast.\n\n“But I like the cold,” Ellison said.\n\nIt’s his first time as a delegate, Ellison said. Living in Dubuque, Iowa, he said he's a typical political junkie but this time in Milwaukee is new to him.\n\n“This is my first convention. I’m soaking it all in,” Ellison said.\n\nIt’s also his first time in Milwaukee.\n\n“It’s not bad. I’ve been to most places in Wisconsin,” Ellison said. \"Security is almost as tight as D.C.

Notably, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, who weren't originally scheduled to speak, rallied the crowd around a message of unity.

We've got to put on the red, white and blue jersey and come together as Americans,” Hovde said, adding the “inflammatory rhetoric of divisiveness” is “tearing up” our country.\n\nIn the wake of the shooting, the Biden-Harris campaign canceled counterprogramming events Sunday and Monday and pulled down advertisements.\n\nIn a Tuesday morning press conference, the campaign resumed its messaging against Republicans, hitting the Trump-Vance ticket on abortion and union issues.\n\nAsked if it was the right move for Democrats to pull their advertisements and cancel events, Hovde said ”whatever can lower the rhetoric and the tension in our country is good on both sides.”\n\n(10:08 p.m.)\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nWhere are the Trump children during the RNC?\n\nFrom business to politics, Trump has famously appointed his children to high-ranking roles in his ventures.\n\nBut this week his daughter, Ivanka, and his wife, Melania, have been noticeably absent during one of the most public moments of Trump's latest presidential campaign.\n\nNeither were in the audience Monday night, when Trump was both formally confirmed as the GOP presidential nominee and made his first appearance after surviving an assassination attempt.\n\nRead more\n\n(10:01 p.m.)\n\n— Maia Pandey\n\nRudy Giuliani takes a fall at the 2024 RNC\n\nRudy Giuliani took a tumble at the convention, tripping while holding an Osmo camera Tuesday inside Fiserv Forum.\n\nGiuliani, who had his New York law license revoked earlier this month, had to be helped up but appeared to be OK.\n\nGiuliani, the ex-New York City mayor and personal lawyer to former President Donald Trump, addressed his fall on X (formerly Twitter) Tuesday night.\n\nRead more\n\n(9:45 p.m.)\n\n— Christopher Kuhagen\n\nHandful of high-end restaurants were closed\n\nA few high-end restaurants were closed to the public Tuesday night.\n\nBlack Chevy Suburbans with Virginia license plates were spotted outside Ardent, 1749-1751 N.

But Tuesday, the delivery driver had car issues and delivery has been closed for the night.\n\n“It cuts a lot of business,” Jimenez said.\n\nLike a lot of businesses on the east side, it has been slow.\n\n“It’s been pretty slow since yesterday,” Jimenez said. “Usually Tuesdays is busy … the bar is filled up.”\n\nZaffiro’s has increased staff for the week in case things change.\n\n“I just dismiss people if it’s slow,” Jimenez said.\n\n(9:01 p.m.)\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nEast side conservative view on RNC, politics\n\nRick Paikowski was drinking a White Claw at Wolski’s Tavern, 1836 N.

If customers are sticking around, he said he’ll stay open until 4.\n\nBut out-of-towers and early risers need not worry: Ransdell is pretty generous with the “I closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\n“As long as you’re not an asshole, I’ll usually just give it to you before you leave,” he said.\n\n(8 p.m.)\n\n— Genevieve Redsten\n\nAt RNC, Lambeau, Babydog and other K-9s steal the show\n\n(7:57 p.m.)\n\nTrump is seeing a familiar building outside his hotel window at the Pfister\n\nWhen Trump looks out his room at Milwaukee's Pfister Hotel this week, he'll see a familiar building. It looks a lot like his former hotel in Washington, D.C. In fact, it's an exact replica.\n\nConstruction on Milwaukee's federal courthouse began in 1892, the same year as the Old Post Office in Washington D.C.\n\nIn Milwaukee, the building that's on the eastern edge of Milwaukee's downtown and kitty-corner from the Pfister, was used for various government functions when it first opened in 1899 — as the Post Office, for state and federal courts, and even an office of weights and measures among others.\n\nToday, the building houses the federal courts as well as various federal offices. The space is immaculately maintained and visitors are awed by the architecture, which is Richardsonian Romanesque.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the same building went up the same year and was used for essentially the same purposes.\n\nIn 2013, the federal government leased the property for 60 years to a consortium headed by Trump, which developed the property into a hotel, the Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., which opened in September 2016. In 2022, it became the Waldorf Astoria Washington DC.\n\nSo if the former president has some insomnia while in town for the RNC — the Pfister is purported to be haunted — he might take some comfort looking out on what sure looks like his old hotel.\n\n(7:26 p.m.)\n\n— John Diedrich\n\nBusiness as usual on Brady Street\n\nBrady Street showed no signs of MAGA on Tuesday.\n\nAlong the strip of bars and restaurants on the lower east side — just over a mile from the RNC — it’s been business as usual.\n\nA caravan of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. supporters, honking their horns and waving American flags as they drove down the street, were Brady’s only happy-hour politickers.\n\nAt La Masa, 1300 E. Brady St., it was a regular Tuesday.\n\nThe Argentine restaurant didn’t staff up for the RNC, and there hasn’t been an influx of new customers.\n\n“No one over here really expected it to change,” manager Darian Emerson said.\n\nLike many Brady Street businesses, La Masa expects Brady Fest this weekend will be bigger for business than the RNC.\n\nNashville North, 1216 E. Brady St., which is normally closed Mondays, stayed open Monday night for the RNC, but business was slow.\n\nThe bar expects Tuesday night will be busier, as the regular crowd trickles in for blue grass and karaoke.\n\nManager Jake Garncarz said Nashville North is ready just in case some RNC visitors spill over from Fiserv. The bar staffed an extra bartender, and it’s stocked up on drinks.\n\n\"I don’t know what to expect, to be honest,” he said.\n\nBandit MKE, a vintage boutique at 1224 E.

He was convicted of federal contempt charge, a misdemeanor. Trump pardoned Arpaio, who has long been a Trump supporter.\n\n\"It was like a middle finger\" to those who charged him, Arpaio told a reporter from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel waiting in line with him Tuesday.\n\nArpaio said he hadn't seen Trump since he's been in Milwaukee and didn't know if he would. But he said he just saw Trump in Arizona last month.\n\n\"He gave me a kiss when he saw me,\" Arpaio said.\n\nAs Arpaio turned to go in the Pfister in a long security line, he was introduced to a police officer from Fort Worth, Texas, in Milwaukee to help with security. The officer was all smiles.\n\n\"It's an honor to meet you, Sheriff Joe,\" he said.\n\n(6:43 p.m.)\n\n— John Diedrich\n\nEric Hovde gets RNC speaking slot, attacks Baldwin, Biden and news media\n\nHovde used his time on the RNC’s stage to launch attacks against some of his favorite targets.\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin, Biden and the media all took the brunt of his criticism.\n\nHovde, a multimillionaire banking mogul, continued his attempts to tie Baldwin to Biden as the Madison Democrat has distanced herself from the president. Hovde said Democratic policies have “made us less safe at home.”\n\nHe pointed to the southern border and the fentanyl crisis as top issues.

Temperatures were predicted to dip to the mid-60s at night.\n\nGagan said forecasts showed temperatures in the upper-70s or low-80s Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, with lows in the upper-50s.\n\nWednesday has a chance of showers between noon to 4 p.m. Thursday and Friday were predicted to be mostly sunny.\n\n“I would say it’s a touch on the cooler side of average,” Gagan said. “It’s not unusual to be in the mid-to-upper-70s this time of year.

Well, almost.\n\nAt 814 W. Wisconsin Ave., the branch is adjacent to one of the vehicle screening spots of the RNC. People are still using the building as a cooling center, including police officers who needed respite from Monday’s high heat, said Melissa Howard, the library's community relations and engagement director.\n\nMilwaukee residents have still been the main patrons this week, Howard said. One change, though, is that cars can’t access the drive-though, so people have been walking up to pick up their books.\n\n“The focus has really been, 'Can we keep our services up and running as much as possible?'” Howard said.\n\nStaff members are playing a role, though, in capturing the local history by collecting photos, brochures and flyers of this week’s history-making event.\n\nSo far, library staff don’t plan to make any of its iconic TikToks related to the event.\n\nHoward hopes out-of-towners come to the library “to see what a big, beautiful institution that we have here in Milwaukee.”\n\n“I also hope that they're able to get outside of the security footprint and just see all the areas of Milwaukee that really make this place great,” Howard said\n\n(4:35 p.m.)\n\n— Caitlin Looby and Bridget Fogarty\n\nChair of Milwaukee County GOP talks Trump appearance at RNC, Milwaukee Republicans\n\nHilario Deleon, chairman of the Republican Party of Milwaukee County, said Trump's arrival at the convention Monday night was an emotional experience.\n\n\"I was wiping tears from my eyes,\" he told the Journal Sentinel at Wisconsin Media Row Tuesday afternoon. \"Just the fact that he came out, his presence there, it unified the Republican Party.\"\n\nDeleon watched the assassination attempt on Trump live on TV and was \"exhausted\" in the days after, fielding calls about how the RNC might be affected.\n\nDeleon said Republicans \"have a right to be pissed\" about the assassination attempt and criticized people who made jokes about the incident on social media.\n\n\"We didn't go out there and create chaos. Instead, we came together and we prayed,\" Deleon said. \"Let's try to lower the rhetoric, bring the country together.\"\n\nDeleon said it's \"not an easy task being the chairman of a minority party in a very blue area.\"\n\nThere are thousands of conservatives who aren't showing up, he said, who could make the difference in Wisconsin.

Ron Johnson pushes for school choice during Moms for Liberty town hall\n\nDuring Moms for Liberty’s “Giving Americans a Voice” Town Hall on Tuesday afternoon, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson pushed for school choice vouchers and called to move past large schools. He brought up the point in relation to the recent assassination attempt against Trump.\n\n“The initial interviews,” Johnson said, showed the shooter was “in probably a large school, being bullied all the time. I’m hoping if there’s one result from Moms for Liberty, and this is actually going to all be tied together here, is we start moving away from these massive, large schools.”\n\nThe shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, attended Bethel Park High School, which had 1,338 students enrolled during the 2023-2023 school year. That makes the school larger than the nationwide school enrollment average of 854 students and Pennsylvania’s average school size of 889 students.\n\n“During COVID-19, parents were looking over the shoulder of their kids and they're seeing that these large schools, these large bureaucracies, are getting completely out of control and unaccountable,” Johnson continued during the speech.\n\nAsked after the event if he was insinuating large schools were partially to blame for the shooting, Johnson said “there’s so much we don’t know” but that the kid was \"alienated\" and \"bullied,\" which he said “we’ve seen too many times in the past.”\n\nJohnson said Trump will speak about unity at the RNC as a result of the assassination attempt, which he said is a good thing.\n\n\"We have to unify and heal this nation,” Johnson told reporters. Asked if he blames rhetoric on the left for the shooting, Johnson told reporters “he blames the shooter” but said “vitriol on the left is not helpful.”\n\n(4 p.m.)\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nEmployees at restaurants just outside of perimeter struggle getting to work\n\nRyan Cooke, director of operations at the Milwaukee Brat House, 1013 N.

After a busy July spent preparing for convention week, he hopes they'll see some financial benefits from the event.\n\n\"You know the first day, there's gonna be miscommunication and challenges, but they're starting to be remedied now,\" he said. \"The funny thing is it's gonna all be figured out by Thursday.

Wisconsin Ave., owner Jill Ruffing extended business hours to accommodate RNC traffic. The cafe is usually open from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. but will stay open until 5 p.m. during the convention.\n\nHowever, business has been slower than expected.\n\n\"We did the same volume yesterday that we would do in our normal 8 to 2 hours\" despite the extended hours, Ruffing said.\n\n\"I planned for double, triple, four times my business. I had to stock up on a lot of food because a lot of my suppliers are not coming into the city this week,\" she said.\n\nBefore the convention, the RNC Milwaukee Host Committee offered 600 East Cafe a spot at the Convention Fest but Ruffing declined because she didn't have the capacity to run a booth and the cafe itself. However, Ruffing made sure to register the cafe with the RNC vendor directory.\n\nA delegate from Pennsylvania called Ruffing to place an order of 150 box lunches, which she said was a \"dream\" for her business. But, the delegate then said that, if 600 East Cafe isn't part of Convention Fest, it can't cater lunch inside the perimeter.\n\nRuffing said she had no idea of this rule when she declined the position at Convention Fest.\n\n\"It's kind of still vague, but we were never really told (the rules),\" she said. \"Yesterday, I was feeling a little bummed because now I can't do catering and there's no people on this side of town.\"\n\nAdam Siegel, the owner of Lupi & Iris, 777 N. Van Buren St., also said communication from the Host Committee has been \"not great.\"\n\nIn 2023, Siegel said the Host Committee led them to have high expectations for RNC business.\n\n\"We thought we were gonna see people booking our private party rooms. We thought that we were going to see elevated business numbers because of us being very close proximity to Fiserv but outside of the security zone (with) plenty of parking above us,\" he said.\n\nThat has not been the case. If Monday's trend continues, Siegel said Lupi and Iris could be down well over 50 percent during the convention.\n\n\"I think that there's a few companies out there that are getting the majority of the business and they have a stronger affiliation maybe with Visit Milwaukee and the Host Committee, from what we hear,\" Siegel said.\n\nAt Andiamo Coffee and Tea, which is next to Lupi & Iris, manager Joshua Huff said traffic has mostly been tenants who live in the apartment building above the coffee shop.\n\nAs Andiamo is situated near the Northwestern Mutual and U.S. Bank offices, Huff said most of its regulars are commuters. This week, those regulars are \"gone.\"\n\n(2:50 p.m.)\n\n— Kathryn Muchnick\n\nHistoric Third Ward business activity lighter than usual\n\nBusiness activity in the Historic Third Ward has been lighter than usual this week.\n\n\"It's very quiet. And this neighborhood is very rarely quiet,\" said Karen Bell, owner of Bavette La Boucherie, a restaurant and butcher shop at 217 N. Broadway.\n\nThat includes a Tuesday lunch business that was about 25% of a normal weekday lunch, she said.\n\nAlso seeing slower than normal traffic this week is The Wicked Hop tavern and restaurant, 345 N. Broadway, said morning manager Lily Nieves.\n\nIt's been quieter than usual at Pink Moon Bay, a woman's clothing boutique at 317 N. Broadway, said Callie Mangan, assistant manager.\n\nBut the store got a bit of a bump Monday from convention attendees buying sun dresses — an apparent reaction to that day's 90-degree temperatures, Mangan said.\n\nAlso, the new Ben & Jerry's Scoop Shop, which had its first full day Monday, is doing a great business, much of its from neighborhood residents, said co-owner Tricia Rasmussen. It's at 203 N. Broadway.\n\nBut perhaps the Third Ward's best bellwether is The Milwaukee Public Market, 400 N. Water St., home to around 20 restaurants, taverns and shops.\n\nThe market had less business than usual Monday, said Paul Schwartz, executive director.\n\nHe attributed that in part to the market's proximity to security checkpoints for motorists heading west across the nearby Milwaukee River to the RNC, which tied up traffic. Tuesday has seen an uptick in business, Schwartz said.\n\nAnother factor that could be slowing down Third Ward activity: several parking spots in the 200 block of North Broadway were blocked off Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThat was apparently tied to security concerns centering on a private event scheduled for Tuesday night at The Kimpton Journeyman Hotel, at East Chicago Street and North Broadway, neighborhood business owners said.\n\n(2:40 p.m.)\n\n— Tom Daykin\n\nAt an empty protest zone, push-up competitions to pass the time\n\nThe Haymarket Square demonstration zone a couple blocks away from Fiserv Forum remained quiet Tuesday.Two speakers spoke to an audience of about 13 event staffers and a few reporters until about 11:35 a.m. Other speakers had booked slots but hadn't shown up since then, with bookings slated until 6 p.m., according to one staffer.To pass the time, some event staffers began some push-up competitions.\n\n(2:35 p.m.)\n\n— Jolan Kruse and Piet Levy\n\nNBC News' Kristen Welker on being in Milwaukee: 'We are honored to be here'\n\nFor Kristen Welker, moderator of \"Meet the Press\" on NBC News, what's stuck out most about Milwaukee is how \"every single person who I encountered feels really proud\" to live in a swing state that's hosting a major political event.\n\n\"We are honored to be here,\" Welker told the Journal Sentinel in an interview at Good City Brewing, where NBC News has set up operations for the week. \"You can feel the responsibility and the weight that the people here in Milwaukee feel about hosting this convention. And in talking to people, people are buzzing about this race.\"\n\nWelker called Wisconsin \"ground zero\" for who wins the election. After winning the state in 2016 and losing it to President Joe Biden in 2020, Trump \"wants to win it back. That's why he's here.\"\n\n\"He is making a statement that these voters, that Wisconsin matters to the Republican Party,\" Welker said. \"I think you are going to see both candidates make an incredibly forceful play to try to win over the voters here in Wisconsin.\"\n\n(2:10 p.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nHot dog vendors move to Red Arrow Park, have message for new Milwaukee visitors\n\nOn a typical weekday in Milwaukee, Jay Brown and Ireland Jones set up their mobile hot dog stand, IJ’s Quick Eats, on Third and Wells streets.\n\nRoadblocks and the RNC perimeter had kept them from getting to their normal spot, Jones said, so they set up shop on the southeast corner of Red Arrow Park.\n\n“This was the only spot,” he said, adding that an individual with the RNC welcomed the duo to sell their hotdogs, brats and chips there for the afternoon.\n\nThe traffic and parking challenges are “inconvenient,” Jones said, but he’s hopeful for business.\n\nJones and Brown said they’ll serve hot dogs and brats until 6 or 7 p.m. Tuesday and open back up Wednesday.\n\nAs Jones and Brown attended to a customer, chants on a loudspeaker from about 10 individuals holding signs with anti-LGBTQ+ messages stood on the roof above the coffee shop that looks over the park.\n\nOtherwise, Tuesday afternoon at the park was quiet in contrast to the hundreds of protestors who gathered there Monday.\n\nJones had a message for anyone visiting Milwaukee for the first time.\n\n“It’s a safe place to visit,” he said. “No matter what you see on the news, no matter what you hear, you just got to come here and enjoy (the) city for yourself.\n\n“I hope everybody who comes here from out of town, you have a great experience. And get some food.\"\n\n(2:05 p.m.)\n\n— Bridget Fogarty, Caitlin Looby and La Risa Lynch\n\nMost of this morning's protest action was at the hard perimeter entrance near the Baird Center\n\nThe designated protest zones remained quiet throughout much of Tuesday morning and early afternoon. Instead, small groups of protestors have congregated outside the entrance areas to the hard security area.\n\nFor example, about 10 protestors were outside the entrance near the Baird Center near Wisconsin Avenue and Dr. Martin Luther King Drive in the early afternoon. Many said they wanted to be near the action and felt like their voices would be better heard there.\n\nSean Keefe, an evangelist from North Carolina, said he was there because the protest zones and other entrance points were \"dead.\"\n\n\"It's a battle for ideas,\" Keefe said. \"So, we're just going where the people are.\"\n\n(2 p.m.)\n\n— Caitlin Looby and Bridget Fogarty\n\n3rd St. Market Hall vendors: 'None of us really made money yesterday'\n\nRNC week is off to a slow start for the vendors at 3rd St. Market Hall, 275 W. Wisconsin Ave. Most stalls struggled to reach their normal sale numbers Monday, despite expecting a rush of visitors from Fiserv Forum.\n\nBusiness owners were told by market hall managers to expect 1,200 to 1,300 customers. Instead, there were barely 300 people, said Ken Hughes of DawgCity Hot Dog.\n\nThe business owners said RNC event-goers were given pre-purchased gift cards that can be used at any stall. How each stall will be compensated for these gift-card purchases remain unclear for stall owners. Many of them are asking: What happens when these gift-card users don’t show up?\n\nThe huge difference in the expected and actual number of customers have already led to monetary loss. Hughes said he had hired extra hands in preparation for the RNC; Monday, he had to send two of the workers home.\n\nHughes said he saw stall owners handing out leftover food for free Monday.\n\nAccording to Edgar Aispuro, owner of Criollo, hall managers misjudged not only the size of the crowd but the time of its arrival.\n\n“First, they told us the food should’ve been ready at 1, so we were ready at 1. Nobody showed up,” Aispuro said. “They were like, ‘Oh, it’s gonna be 5:30.’ Still, nobody showed up. We ended up being open to 10. Still, nobody showed up.”\n\nAispuro said he hopes business will pick up. In the first few hours Tuesday, the store has made more profit than Monday.\n\n(1:45 p.m.)\n\n— Jane Park\n\nFBI, DHS warn of retaliatory attacks from extremists after assassination attempt on Trump\n\nIn a joint bulletin issued to law enforcement agencies across the country Monday, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security warned that extremist individuals or groups may instigate “follow-on or retaliatory” attacks related to the 2024 presidential election over the next several months.\n\nThe warning was issued on the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and in the wake of a shooting at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania that left one attendee and the gunman dead, and two others critically injured. The shooting is being investigated as an assassination attempt against former Trump, who was wounded at the rally.\n\nWhile the warning was issued Monday, there's no clear connection to Milwaukee or the RNC.\n\nRead more\n\n(1:40 p.m.)\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY\n\nTuesday night speaker schedule released, includes Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde\n\nThe RNC has released its Tuesday night speaker list and schedule.\n\nEric Hovde, who is running for U.S. Senate against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, will speak in the 6 p.m. hour, according to a source familiar with the schedule.\n\nReince Priebus, chairman of the Host Committee, will also speak.\n\nHere's the schedule of speakers:\n\n5-5:30 p.m.\n\nChairwoman Anne Hathaway, Committee on Arrangements\n\nGov.

Marco Rubio (Florida)\n\nCo-Chair Lara Trump, Republican National Committee\n\nHere's more on the speakers Tuesday night at the RNC\n\n(1 p.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nRestaurants near Pfister Hotel see mixed results\n\nCubanitas and Brunch It Up, both in the 700 block of North Milwaukee Street, have seen mixed results.\n\nBusiness from downtown workers and other regular customers is off. But the restaurants are seeing an influx of new customers visiting for the RNC.\n\n“It’s not going to be a big moneymaking week but it’s going to be steady,” Cubanitas owner Marta Bianchini said.\n\nThe Cuban restaurant is extending its hours during the RNC, with a breakfast menu as well as a limited late-night menu.\n\nBrunch It Up’s sales goal for Monday was $1,800, said Allison Moseley, general manager. It finished the day with less than $1,000 in revenue.\n\n“Sales were a little slower than usual,” she said.\n\nBoth Moseley and Bianchini lamented the lack of street parking.\n\nThe block’s metered parking spaces are temporarily closed, with Milwaukee Street serving as a busy bus corridor for RNC attendees.\n\nAlso, the block is just west of the Pfister Hotel, where Trump is staying. That means heavy security and nearby street closures.\n\n(12:55 p.m.)\n\n— Tom Daykin\n\n85% of scheduled speakers in south protest zone didn't show up Monday\n\nAs Day 2 of the RNC started Tuesday — a day with weather much more forgiving than Monday’s extreme heat — one of two designated protest zones at Zeidler Union Square was quiet.\n\nAbout a dozen event safety staffers stood in the park.\n\nGroups are signed up to speak Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. So far, three groups that signed up to speak in the protest zone haven’t show up, according to the safety staff.\n\nStaff members also said that about 85% of Monday‘s speakers who signed up to talk at Zeidler Union Square didn’t show.\n\nFive men who said they’re with the group Official Street Preachers came to the park to speak but were turned away by event staff since they weren’t signed up to protest. The street preachers wore shirts with messaging against abortion, queer relationships and Bible verses.\n\n“Our plan was to preach but there’s no one to preach to,” said Rich Penkoski of Stillwater, Oklahoma.\n\nPenkoski has faced legal action in Oklahoma over inflammatory and threatening online posts about a gay couple, the Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise reported.\n\nThe safety staff members said they expect it'll be even quieter Tuesday than Monday.\n\n(12:50 p.m.)\n\n— Bridget Fogarty, La Risa Lynch and Caitlin Looby\n\nTwo east side restaurants among businesses closed during convention\n\nSome east side downtown businesses are closed for the RNC.\n\nThey include two eateries in the lower level of an office building at 770 N. Jefferson St.: Shah Jee, a Pakistani restaurant, and Midwest Sad, which includes breakfast items and desserts on its menu.\n\nLast week, Midwest SAD owner Sam Sandrin told the Journal Sentinel that she was worried about how her still-new business would do during the RNC.\n\nShe had put out a call on the Milwaukee subreddit to encourage people to try their best to support local restaurants and small businesses during the convention.\n\n(12:45 p.m.)\n\n— Tom Daykin\n\nDissenting voices engage more closely than ever at RNC security perimeter\n\nStanding on the same street corner near the 3rd Street Market Hall, protesters engage in discourse, face-to-face. Their long conversations occasionally attract the attention of other passerby, who stop to listen or take photos.\n\nIn addition to protesting in large groups Monday, individuals such as Nadine Seiler are deciding to stand alone or in pairs to protest near the perimeter. Some hold banners that declare “JESUS 2024: The Only Hope.” Others hold signs that read, “A World Without Fascism Is Possible.”\n\nAccording to Seiler, whose sign says, “A Racist Rapist Seditionist Frauder & Felon Walks into his Convention,” protesting alone can be a vulnerable experience, particularly as a Black woman. Earlier Tuesday, a passing man responded to her chants of “Trump’s a loser!” and slapped her finger.\n\nDespite that, she said she'll continue protesting Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n(12:30 p.m.)\n\n— Jane Park\n\nU.S. Coast Guard establishes maritime security zone on Milwaukee River\n\nThrough Friday, the U.S. Coast Guard will be monitoring security on the Milwaukee River from Cherry Street to Michigan Street.\n\nNo commercial or recreational vessel traffic will be permitted along the stretch of the river, called \"Maritime Zone 3,\" although privately owned vessels docked at their registered locations may move along the river — as long as their boats don't require road bridges to be raised. Road bridges will remain in the closed position for the week.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel first reported in February that the Milwaukee River would likely close down for the RNC.\n\nIn May, members of the U.S. Coast Guard received RNC maritime security training on Lake Michigan. It was part of a comprehensive security training that involved agencies including the Milwaukee Police Department, Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Capitol Police, U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Customs & Border Protection.\n\nAll privately owned vessels moving within the maritime security zone are subject to screening before re-entry. Docked vessels can remain stationary.\n\n(12:25 p.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nWisconsin delegate Eric Toney said political rhetoric has been toned down for convention\n\nEric Toney, the Fond du Lac County district attorney and a Wisconsin RNC delegate, said that, after Saturday's assassination attempt, there's been a marked shift in how people are talking at the convention.\n\n\"The rhetoric we're seeing appears to be changing and being toned down from some of the speeches that we saw last night, and it seems like that's probably going to continue throughout,\" he said. \"I think President Trump has an incredible opportunity as a leader to continue to help change the tone and make sure we're dialed in on the issues, because that's what we're seeing voters really care about.\"\n\nToney, who spoke to reporters on the Wisconsin Media Row, said people have been so siloed when it comes to political parties in recent years, important conversations about how to change things haven't been happening.\n\n\"We might not agree, but we need to have those discussions, because that's what makes America so wonderful, that we can express those views,\" he said. \"I think we have to be more open to that moving forward because we can't continue to see this political violence.\"\n\nOn the floor of the convention, Toney said, things have been a bit hectic for delegates, with long hours and plenty of heat outside. But getting to see former Trump was a great experience Monday night, even if he didn't speak to the crowd.\n\n\"You could just feel the energy in the room, and what really felt like one of those moments in history,\" he said.\n\n(12:20 p.m.)\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\n'Why am I the only one here?' Protest zone in Haymarket Square empty Tuesday morning\n\nHaymarket Square in the north protest zone was largely empty around 11 a.m. Monday, with one speaker, 82-year-old Florida resident Bob Kunst of Shalom International, monologuing on a microphone to a couple of reporters and about 13 event staffers, including one staffer sitting on a gray barricade, nodding off.\n\n“Why am I the only one here?” asked Kunst, sitting and wearing a baseball cap and shirt in support of Israel.\n\nA registered Democrat, Kunst largely shared criticisms of President Joe Biden’s policies and the mainstream media, and called for more grassroots protest movements to gather and voice their concerns.\n\n“If we don’t fight for our liberty, we’re not going to make it,” he said.\n\nHe was followed after about 25 minutes by Lisa Bingenheimer, a speaker from local volunteer group Wisconsin 2A Team, which supports candidates who support the Second Amendment.\n\nBingenheimer said she was demonstrating Tuesday to promote freedom from government involvement, thanking the “nine people” within earshot who heard her speak for about 10 minutes, including her husband off to the side, who offered a round of applause.\n\nBy noon, the speakers were gone, leaving some staffers sitting around an empty stage.\n\n(12:15 p.m.)\n\n— Jolan Kruse and Piet Levy\n\nMilwaukee County Executive David Crowley says Day 1 of RNC was a great learning experience\n\nMilwaukee County Executive David Crowley said Day 1 of the RNC went smoothly and has been a great learning experience for the county, as well as an economic boost.\n\n\"I'm glad that so far all the vendors who are organizing the convention and convention-goers are enjoying themselves,\" he said. \"I know that traffic has been a little bit crazy for many of our residential folks and folks coming in to volunteer, but it's been a great opportunity to showcase and spotlight Milwaukee.\"\n\nCrowley said that, as a Democrat, he's been listening to what Republicans have to say.\n\n\"It gives me an opportunity to hear the message and what they're going to be bringing to the table as it relates to policies,\" he said. \"I want to see what that stark contrast looks like moving forward, because I truly believe that Democrats not only have a vision to share, but we have a story to tell.\"\n\nHe also offered some advice to first-time visitors to Milwaukee.\n\n\"Well, first and foremost, you have to go to a beer garden. ... You have to go down and visit Bradford Beach,\" he said. \"I know everyone knows us for our cheese curds and beer, but I think we're a pretty big foodie community and we have restaurants all over the city, in the county that everyone should absolutely go out to.\"\n\n(11:55 a.m.)\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nJournal Sentinel's Kristin Brey and JR Radcliffe talk about what happened, what's ahead at RNC\n\nVance photographed in downtown Milwaukee Tuesday morning\n\nVance was photographed walking through downtown Milwaukee near Water Street and Wisconsin Avenue on Tuesday morning with his family.\n\n(11:20 a.m.)\n\n— Alex Groth\n\nPro-Biden infrastructure signs dot RNC perimeter\n\nIt's an almost subtle sign against the more flashy red, white and blue in downtown Milwaukee, but it certainly stands out: \"Project Funded by President Joe Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\"\n\nThe sign was sponsored by the City of Milwaukee, the U.S. Department of Transportation and Investing in America, the latter of which is a White House agenda that aims to mobilize \"historic levels of private sector investments in the United States,\" according to the White House.\n\nAs of March, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has put $6.6 billion funds in Wisconsin, with more than 510 specific projects identified for funding, according to a White House press release.\n\nMilwaukee received about $85 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation and $2.5 million from the Environmental Protection Agency. A portion of that funding has gone into the Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport Project, which aims to replace obsolete flat roof areas on airport buildings, making the buildings more resilient to weather and energy efficient.\n\nThe lion's share of the Department of Transportation's funding, at $80 million, will go to replacing the existing Interstate 39, 90 and 94 Wisconsin River bridge with two new bridge spans to improve the flow of traffic. Although this funding was awarded to Columbia County, north of Dane County, the route links Madison, Milwaukee and Chicago, serving as a key connector for these cities.\n\nThe Biden administration put another $36 million toward Milwaukee's 6th Street Complete Streets Project, which will reconnect communities along the more than 2½ miles of the 6th Street corridor.\n\nAccording to a White House fact sheet from March, the project provides wider sidewalks for children walking to school, safe bike lanes for residents and visitors, dedicated bus lines for faster transit, new trees and green infrastructure to prevent sewage run-off into the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan.\n\n(10:40 a.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nRNC brings some patriotic fashion choices\n\nOutside the Hyatt Regency hotel, 333 W. Kilbourn Ave., on Tuesday morning, Jay Kremmerer posed for a photo. He said his wife dressed him and he liked “the spirit of it.”\n\nNearby, Duane Schwingel said he was dressed by the “spirit of Uncle Sam.”\n\nHe wore an ear bandage with the words “fight fight” on it. He said he wanted to sell bandages with that written on them, too.\n\n(10:30 a.m.)\n\n— David Clarey\n\nEx-Gov Tommy Thompson praises image of Trump after assassination attempt\n\nFormer Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson likened a photo of former President Donald Trump raising his fist after an assassination attempt Saturday to the iconic 1945 photo of Marines hoisting an American flag on top of Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi, and said that image alone will win Trump the election.\n\n\"Nothing is going to derail the campaign,\" Thompson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on the floor of the RNC on Monday.\n\nRead more\n\n(10:20 a.m.)\n\n— Jessie Opoien\n\n8 new 'Dark Brandon' billboards emerge around Milwaukee area\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is ramping up its campaign, this time with \"Dark Brandon\" billboards, a riff on the popular MAGA phrase \"Let's Go Brandon!\"\n\nThe satirical persona, which depicts a grinning President Joe Biden with red beams shooting from his eyes — think Cyclops from X-Men — can be seen at eight locations across Milwaukee:\n\nNorth side of McKinley Blvd., 100 feet east of 7th Street, facing east\n\nEast side of Interstate 43, 215 feet south of North Avenue, facing north\n\nEast side of I-94, 800 feet south of I-794, facing south\n\nSouth side of I-794, 250 feet east of 6th Street, facing west\n\nWest side of I-794, 50 feet south of Potter Avenue, facing north\n\nEast side of I-43, 270 feet north of Juneau Avenue, facing north\n\nEast side of I-94, 0.3 miles north of National Avenue, facing north\n\nSouth side of I-94, 200 feet east of 20th Street, facing west\n\nThe billboards come out simultaneously to the DNC's first anti-Trump-Vance billboards since the former president announced his running mate Monday.\n\nThe Dark Brandon billboards play on some of the same hot-button issues as the Trump-Vance billboards: abortion, Social Security cuts, democracy and health care.\n\nAbhi Rahman, DNC deputy communications director, said in a press release Tuesday morning that Trump, Vance and MAGA Republicans \"kicked off their Project 2025 convention by highlighting unpopular and extreme policies that would rip fundamental rights away from women and leave working families behind.\"\n\nTrump has made a point of disavowing Project 2025, a presidential transition project with conservative policy proposals written by the DC-based think-tank Heritage Foundation. Trump has repeatedly said he knows nothing about the plan.\n\n\"The DNC is highlighting Joe Biden’s winning platform and policies that are delivering for the American people,\" Rahman said in the Tuesday press release. \"We’re making sure voters know it by bringing Dark Brandon to Milwaukee to outline a bold second term agenda that sharply contrasts with what Wisconsinites are seeing on the RNC stage this week — restoring Roe, lowering costs, protecting Social Security, and safeguarding our democracy.”\n\n(9:45 a.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nTeamsters president makes history at Monday night's session\n\nSean O’Brien, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, on Monday night said it was an “honor” to be the first president in the union’s history to address a Republican National Convention.\n\n“Today, the Teamsters are here to say we are not beholden to anyone or any party,” O’Brien said. “I don’t care about getting criticized. It’s an honor to be the first Teamster in our 121-year history to address the Republican National Convention.”\n\nO’Brien said he reached out to both the Republican National Convention and Democratic National Convention to speak. He thanked Trump for inviting him to speak at the convention. While he didn't offer an endorsement, O’Brien underscored that the union has supported GOP presidential candidates in the past, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush.\n\nRead more\n\n(9:30 a.m.)\n\n— Rebecca Morin, USA TODAY\n\nLate night shows quip about Milwaukee, RNC\n\nLate night television took a few swipes at Milwaukee and more than a few at the RNC speakers Monday night.\n\nWisconsin and Milwaukee got the most airtime on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” which dedicated a live monologue to the opening day of the RNC. Right away, Milwaukee and its nicknames got Colbert’s first jabs, after he kindly described it as a “beautiful” place.\n\n“Also known as Brew City, Beer City and ‘All of the other Cities are Worried about you’ City,” he said.\n\nColbert seemed to have genuine respect for some of the other names around the city, too, especially one in the RNC’s soft security zone.\n\n“If you’re in Milwaukee, and you can’t get into the convention, there is an official convention watch party at a local pub called — and this is true — Drink Wisconsibly,” he said. “Lovely, bravo. Truly one of the best state- and warning-label-themed bars in the country.”\n\nColbert also made fun of the state law that doesn’t allow for guns to be banned in the RNC’s soft zone, but things like tennis balls are banned. He also poked at U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson’s remarks on Wisconsin’s very kind people as a reason to not be concerned about safety.\n\n“Yes, Wisconsin only produces the nicest people like Tony Shalhoub, Chris Farley and Jeffrey Dahmer,” he said.\n\nThe last Wisconsin person to get teased was none other than Rev. James A. Roemke of Messiah Lutheran Church in Kenosha. Roemke gave his best impression of Trump, saying that everyone was “going to be so blessed” and waved his hands in a Trump-esque way.\n\n“Oh my lord. It is a miracle,\" Colbert said. \"Someone has a worse Trump impression than me.”\n\nRead more\n\n(9:15 a.m.)\n\n— David Clarey\n\nDemocratic National Committee moves overnight to hit Trump-Vance ticket\n\nThe Democratic National Committee wasted no time responding to Trump selecting Vance as his running mate.\n\nSixteen billboards and a mobile billboard in the Milwaukee area sprouted overnight, in time for the RNC's second day. It's the first paid media campaign that takes shots at the Trump-Vance ticket.\n\nThe billboards strike a grim tone, veering on doomsday for democracy. The DNC took aim at the Trump-Vance stance on abortion, tax breaks for the wealthy and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEach billboard also references Project 2025, a proposed presidential transition project by the Heritage Foundation, a DC-based think tank. One billboard echoed the fear that Trump would use the election to transform the United States into a dictatorship: \"Dictator on 'Day One,'\" alluding to the nearly 900-page document.\n\nTrump has attempted to distance himself from Project 2025.\n\nVance has taken a hardline stance on abortion, which he opposes even in cases of incest and rape. It's one of the key issues likely to dominate the campaign trail. When he ran for the Senate in 2022, his campaign website said simply \"Ban Abortion\" on the issues page. The DNC's billboard played up his two-word stance, with \"Ban Abortion, Punish Women.\"\n\nDespite his rags-to-riches story that his bestselling memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegies,\" encapsulates, the DNC billboard said a Trump-Vance ticket means \"Tax breaks for billionaires, higher costs for you,\" according to another billboard.\n\nThe other billboard says that a Trump-Vance ticket will destroy the Affordable Care Act and Social Security: \"Terminate the ACA, Gut Social Security.\"\n\n(9 a.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nMilwaukee mayor seeks to reassure businesses seeing less-than-normal traffic during RNC\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson on Tuesday sought to reassure local businesses that saw less traffic than normal on the first day of the Republican National Convention.\n\nRestaurants in the Third Ward reported normal or lower-than-normal diner levels Monday.\n\nJohnson said he heard announcements within Fiserv Forum that Trump would be making an appearance in the convention hall. Then, Johnson said, Trump’s appearance was repeatedly delayed, which he thought prompted people not to leave the area to avoid missing Trump’s first public appearance since an assassination attempt on Saturday in Pennsylvania.\n\nInstead of leaving the credentials-only “hard” perimeter, he thought convention attendees went to Convention Fest, a vendor fair at the RNC showcasing local Milwaukee businesses for RNC attendees.\n\nJohnson expected business outside the hard perimeter to pick up Tuesday.\n\n“From what I understand, that was probably more of an anomaly just because folks had to wait. They chose to wait,” Johnson said.\n\nHis comments were also political. Johnson, a Democrat and a vocal supporter of Biden’s re-election campaign, urged people to vote in November’s presidential election.\n\nHe was also critical of Trump and his choice of Vance to be his vice presidential running mate.\n\n“There are a lot of questions and certainly a lot of concern,” Johnson said. “We now have a Republican candidate on the vice presidential side without any executive experience and a Republican presidential candidate whose executive experience we’ve already endured over the course of a term.”\n\nJohnson called Trump's response to the COVID-19 \"botched\" and credited Biden's policies for helping turn around city crime during the pandemic.\n\nJohnson pointed to the pairing of local policies and the American Rescue Plan Act as helping Milwaukee abate crime that had spiked during the pandemic. Recent crime data shows that, halfway through 2024, crime is above 2019 levels but made improvements from prior years.\n\n\"Working with President Biden's administration and our policies around accountability and prevention, for the last two years, all under President Biden's leadership we've seen crime trend down year over year in Milwaukee,\" Johnson said. \"I don't think there's really much to touch in terms of public safety when you compare the policies.\"\n\n(8:15 a.m.)\n\n— Alison Dirr and David Clarey\n\nMayor says three arrested Monday, protest goes smoothly\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said three people were arrested near the Republican National Convention on Monday but lauded it as a “peaceful” start to the week.\n\nOf the three arrests, one involved a repeat offender. That person attempted — for the second time — to climb a fence into a restricted area, Johnson said. A second arrest occurred when someone blocked traffic in the evening and didn't follow police orders to move.\n\nJohnson said the third arrest occurred at the end of the Coalition to March on the RNC demonstration. The person was arrested for disorderly conduct, the mayor said.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel previously reported that online video showed a man wearing a Chicago Bears shirt was seen in handcuffs following the parade. Authorities said the man took signs from protesters and attempted to knock over a booth, causing a disturbance to protesters who just finished a march that ended at Red Arrow Park, at 920 N. Water St., around 3:20 p.m.\n\nOverall, Johnson said the march and day went peacefully, without major incident. No one was hurt and there wasn't significant property damage involved with the march.\n\n“By most important measures, things are going pretty well,” he said. “Overall, it was a calm day, it was a peaceful day.”\n\n(8 a.m.)\n\n— David Clarey\n\nArtist, Trump fan will display 24K gold-plated MAGA hat at RNC\n\nThough plenty of MAGA hats are sure to be spotted at the convention, one is set to stand out.\n\nA 24K gold-plated bronze replica of the MAGA hat will be on display today through Thursday at the convention. Artist XVALA — a contemporary artist known for using controversial celebrity images and artifacts of the internet age in his work — will be showcasing the gold hat.\n\nIn a press release, XVALA said the hat aims to represent the legacy of Make America Great Again.\n\n\"Trump will usher in a new golden age for America. MAGA is the gold ticket to success for America,\" the release said.\n\nThe hat is a 3D-printed replica of a real MAGA hat, signed by Trump. On his website, XVALA wrote that the hat is intended as a response to Maurizio Cattelan's \"America,\" a fully functioning toilet made from 18-karat solid gold.\n\n\"XVALA's MAGA hat, while impractical for everyday use, remains technically functional as it is a 1:1 replica of the original,\" the website read. \"But unlike Cattelan, the hat exhorts us to make America great, not to disparage it as a waste receptacle.\"\n\nAfter the convention, the hat will be auctioned off at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Friday. The hat is listed for $15,000 on XVALA's website.\n\n(7:45 a.m.)\n\n— Kathryn Muchnick\n\nNew York artist, activist makes a virtual point\n\nNew York-based artist and political activist Norm Magnusson has created augmented reality art that shows historical markers on the plaza of Fiserv Forum with pointed statements.\n\nThe works aren't visible — they can only be seen through the Scavengar – easy AR mobile app.\n\nThe blue and gold markers include political messages about Project 2025 class inequality, former presidents’ roles and more.\n\nOne of the piece's messages reads: “On this site stood every single U.S. President since 1980. Each oversaw the continued redistribution of wealth from lower and middle classes to the richest 1%.”\n\nThe plaques are similar to others Magnusson made in the early 2000s and fit in the vein of his other work. On his artist website, he breaks down work critical of former President George W. Bush and his administration and other political topics.\n\nMagnusson’s work has appeared in The Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of the City of New York and others. He's known for his funism artwork, a style described as fun to look at and think about, while being intellectually engaging without being elitist.\n\nHe's from Illinois, according to a story on his work from The Villager, a New York publication.\n\n(7:30 a.m.)\n\n— David Clarey\n\nRNC weather: Temperatures, humidity will start to fall after overnight showers\n\nAfter overnight rains, Monday's hot temperatures should cool off.\n\nMilwaukee is expected to see a high of 82, according to the National Weather Service. Though the humidity shouldn't be as extreme as yesterday, it might still feel \"a touch muggy\" as a cold front continues to move through the area, meteorologist Andrew Quigley said.\n\nOvernight, Milwaukee received .17 inches of rain, with a thunder shower over downtown between 4:30 and 5 a.m.\n\nSouthern Wisconsin had more severe weather overnight, with reports of damaging winds and large hail along the state line with Illinois. The NWS has received reports of tree damage affiliated with straight-line winds.\n\nNo additional severe weather is forecasted for Tuesday, though Quigley said there's potential for an isolated shower in the afternoon.\n\nDrier and less humid air is expected for the rest of the RNC, with temperatures in the mid-70s from Wednesday to Friday.\n\n\"Improvement is on the way,\" Quigley said.\n\n(7:15 a.m.)\n\n— Kathryn Muchnick\n\nWhat time is the RNC? Here's the Republican National Convention schedule, events for Tuesday\n\nThe official session of the convention starts at 5 p.m. and runs until 10 p.m.\n\nOther events begin as early as 8 a.m., such as state delegation breakfasts. Other events include discussion panels, screenings of \"Reagan,\" the 2024 Dennis Quaid-led biopic of the former president, and the BBQ Bikes & Blues Western States event at the Harley Davidson Museum.\n\nMany events require tickets or registration and more information can be found here.\n\nThe convention isn't open to the general public, but according to an RNC spokesperson, you can stream it on YouTube, X, Facebook Live, Rumble, Amazon Prime, Twitch and Direct TV. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel will also be streaming RNC events, as will the City Channel.\n\nThe official convention watch party takes place each day at the Drink Wisconsinbly Pub, 320 W.

And when the teleprompter experienced a malfunction, it got to show off more of its set.\n\nBut that was OK for many, since people were loving the country music band, which played songs from the Foo Fighters, Cheap Trick, the Doobie Brothers and more.\n\nRead more\n\n(6:45 a.m.)\n\n— Christopher Kuhagen\n\nWhat road closures and parking restrictions will be in place during the RNC?\n\nNumerous downtown Milwaukee streets will be closed in downtown Milwaukee in and around the security perimeter until Friday at about 1 a.m.:\n\nWest Wisconsin Avenue closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and James Lovell Street\n\nWest Wells Street closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and James Lovell Street\n\nWest Kilbourn Avenue closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and North 8th Street\n\nKilbourn Avenue exit tunnel closed from Interstate 43\n\nKilbourn Avenue entrance tunnel closed to I-43\n\nWest State Street closed between North 8th Street and Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive\n\nWest Juneau Avenue closed between North 8th Street and Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive (Moderne Condo garage will be accessible to residents)\n\nNorthbound I-43 offramp closed at eastbound and westbound Fond du Lac Avenue\n\nWest Fond du Lac Avenue, West McKinley Avenue and East Knapp Street closed between I-43 and North Water Street\n\nOld World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, no northbound traffic past West Juneau Avenue (the Aloft Hotel will be accessible to guests)\n\nOld World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, no southbound traffic past West McKinley Avenue\n\nNorth Vel R.

That's also where the first Republican debate was held in August. Thousands of delegates will gather there to hear the big speeches.\n\nThe nearby University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena and the Baird Center will also be used as spaces for the event.\n\nHere's more about each venue:\n\n(5:30 a.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nCan I get tickets to the Republican National Convention?\n\nUnless you're a delegate, politician, media member or volunteer, you won't be able to attend the RNC.

Trump spoke at a border security-themed event in Cochise County on Thursday.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. endorsed Trump on Friday afternoon in downtown Phoenix. Late Thursday, Kennedy filed to withdraw his name from Arizona's Nov. 5 ballot.\n\nKennedy appeared with Trump at the rally at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale on Friday.\n\nFoo Fighters didn’t lend anthem to Trump campaign, band says\n\nFoo Fighters didn’t give Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump permission to use 1997 song “My Hero” at Friday’s rally in Glendale, the American Rock band said.\n\nWhen asked by a user on X if the band let Trump use the song to introduce former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the band simply replied, “No.”\n\nKennedy dropped out of the race earlier in the day, giving his endorsement to Trump after a 16-month campaign.\n\nThe band performed the same song at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in honor of former President Barack Obama after he accepted his party’s nomination to run for a second term. Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl has publicly spoken against Trump in the past, with the topic coming up in his music.\n\n— Helen Rummel\n\nRepublicans still workshopping a Trumpian nickname for Harris\n\nRepublicans haven’t settled on a derisive nickname for Kamala Harris, trying out a number of options during Donald Trump’s Arizona campaign swing. Trump referred to Harris as “Comrade Kamala” on Thursday during a trip to the southern border, trying to cast her as a “radical leftist” during a news conference. Earlier in the month, his campaign used the term “Kamabla” to describe her on social media.\n\nTrump allies tried out a few more nicknames Friday. Goya Foods CEO Bob Unanue referred to the vice president as “Que Mala” when he warmed up the crowd at Trump’s rally in Glendale. Tyler Bowyer of Turning Point Action used Harris’s first name to make a play on communism, calling it “Kamala-unism.”\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nRFK Jr. siblings call his Trump endorsement ‘sad ending to a sad story’\n\nA group of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s siblings called their brother’s endorsement on Friday of Republican former President Donald Trump “a betrayal” of their father’s and family’s values. They are the children of former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., who was assassinated while running for president in 1968.\n\n“We want an America filled with hope and bound together by a shared vision of a brighter future, a future defined by individual freedom, economic promise and national pride,” sister Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, sister Courtney Kennedy, sister Kerry Kennedy, brother Chris Kennedy and sister Rory Kennedy said in a joint written statement posted to the social media platform X.\n\n“We believe in (the Democratic ticket of Kamala) Harris and (Tim) Walz. Our brother Bobby’s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear. It is a sad ending to a sad story.”\n\nIn an appearance at the Renaissance Phoenix Downtown Hotel, RFK Jr. announced that he was suspending his independent presidential campaign and backing Trump. He said he was working to withdraw his name from the ballot in about 10 “battleground states” where he could potentially be a spoiler who would help the Democrats.\n\n— Dan Nowicki\n\nFact check: Data shows illegal border crossings into Arizona much lower than Trump claims\n\nDonald Trump claimed during his rally in Glendale that 3 million people have come through the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona.\n\nTrump made the claim while praising former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was seated in a front row.\n\n“Do you remember when Sheriff Joe was at the border. You didn’t have people coming in. I think for the one year he had one person come in but they got him,” Trump said. “Now we have 3 million people coming in through your border, your border.”\n\nMaricopa County, however, does not share a border with Mexico, although Arpaio did conduct crime suppression sweeps in predominantly Latino neighborhoods that were aimed at identifying and deporting people in the country illegally. A federal judge later ruled Arpaio’s immigration actions were unlawful.\n\nTrump’s claim that 3 million people have come through the Arizona border with Mexico is also not accurate, based on a review of U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nOver the past four fiscal years, Border Patrol agents and CBP officers have encountered a total of nearly 2 million people unauthorized to legally enter the U.S. in the Tucson and Yuma sectors.\n\nThe number includes unauthorized migrants encountered at official ports of entry and between ports of entry. The Yuma sector straddles both the Arizona and California borders, so not all of the encounters took place in Arizona.\n\nWhat’s more, the number includes encounters that occurred from Oct. 1, 2020, through July of this year. That period covers the Biden administration as well as the last three months of the Trump administration.\n\nThe 2 million number also only includes unauthorized migrants encountered by CBP officers and Border Patrol agents during that period, not the number of asylum seekers allowed to enter the U.S. and remain while asylum claims are pending. Many were deported to Mexico or other countries, either immediately or later. The 2 million encounters also do not represent 2 million individual people since many migrants attempt to cross again after being sent back to Mexico and each apprehension is counted as a separate encounter.\n\nIn his 3 million number, Trump may have been including the number of so-called “gotaways” — unauthorized migrants who entered the U.S. after evading Border Patrol agents in addition to unauthorized migrant encounters. However, data for the estimated number of “gotaways” by the Border Patrol is not published by CBP.\n\n— Daniel Gonzalez\n\nTrump wraps up remarks after nearly 90 minutes\n\nFormer President Donald Trump put a clear focus on immigration during his remarks, which lasted more than an hour.\n\nHe bashed Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival, as a “border tsar” and called her a “flip-flopper” who changes her stance on issues. Trump attacked Harris for supporting so-called sanctuary cities when she was the San Francisco district attorney. He also hammered her for praising the “defund the police” movement in 2020, bringing the president of the Arizona Police Association on stage to make his point.\n\nThe Republican former president also relished in making personal attacks, saying that he doesn’t listen to his advisers who tell him to talk about policy, not personality.\n\n“I have to get personal,” Trump said, saying that speakers at the Democratic National Convention such as former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama were “nasty.”\n\nTrump polled the rally crowd on whether he should refer to Harris as “comrade Kamala” and at one point did an imitation of her “choking.” He also attacked Rep. Ruben Gallego, the Arizona Democrat running for Senate against Trump-endorsed Republican Kari Lake, as a “fricken loser”\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nHarris launches new economy-focused ad, billboard blitz\n\nKamala Harris is airing a new economy-focused TV ad in Arizona and other battleground states, her campaign said Friday. The 30-second spot features a direct-to-camera appeal from Harris, along with press coverage of her campaign’s new economic plan.\n\n“Middle class families, like the one I grew up in, they want common sense solutions,” Harris says in the ad. “We must create an opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to get a car loan, buy a home, start a business.”\n\nThe commercial is part of an eight-figure ad buy across eight battleground states. The campaign did not say how much it is spending to promote the spot in Arizona.\n\nHarris is also using digital billboards around Arizona for an advertising blitz to counter Trump’s visit to the state. The billboards feature the slogan “A NEW WAY FORWARD” and a photo of Harris on a blue background. The Harris campaign billboard ads cover 35% of billboard inventory within a 12-mile radius of Phoenix, Tucson and Mesa, her campaign said.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nArizona Police Association president joins rally\n\nJustin Harris, the president of the Arizona Police Association, joined Donald Trump on stage in Glendale to voice his support for the Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“He always had our backs,” Harris said of Trump’s relationship with law enforcement.\n\nHarris criticized Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, referencing her comments about \"reimagining\" public safety made in 2020.\n\nJustin Harris said Trump will provide the funding and support he’s looking for, pointing to fears surrounding border issues and drug trafficking which have been common talking points throughout Trump's campaign.\n\nHarris was most recently in public view for denouncing the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation into the Phoenix Police Department, which was released earlier this year.\n\n— Helen Rummel\n\nTrump allies eager to compare his crowd to Harris\n\nDonald Trump’s Glendale rally is the perfect opportunity for a crowd size comparison — Kamala Harris drew 15,000 people to the same venue earlier this month. His allies were happy to compare the crowds on Friday.\n\n“We have more people than Kamala had — outside,” Tyler Bowyer of Turning Point Action said, referencing the long line outside the arena. The arena seats 19,300 people, according to its management company.\n\nThere were approximately 12,000-13,000 people inside Desert Diamond Arena as of 3:30 p.m. on Friday, according to a police officer monitoring the crowd. That number will go up, he said, because a long line of Trump supporters were still waiting to get into the building.\n\n“Someone who wants to be president had an event here and she had to partition all this off,\" Turning Point founder Charlie Kirk said. \"We draw a bigger crowd than Kamala Harris, don’t we?”\n\nState Rep. Justin Heap, who is running for Maricopa County recorder, echoed Trump claims that Harris is using artificial intelligence to inflate her crowd sizes.\n\n“You don’t need to use AI to make it look like the seats are full,” Heap said.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nRFK takes the stage; Trump pitches assassination attempts commission\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. received a warm welcome at Donald Trump’s rally, coming on stage to pyrotechnics and the Foo Fighters song “My Hero.”\n\nKennedy suspended his presidential campaign and endorsed Trump in Phoenix on Friday morning, saying that he would take his name off the ballot in battleground states to avoid being a spoiler in the race.\n\nKennedy told the Glendale rally crowd that he and Trump don’t agree on everything, but they found common ground on “having safe food and ending the chronic disease epidemic” and each want to “end the grip of the neocons on U.S. foreign policy.”\n\n\"Don't you want a president who is going to get us out of the wars?\" Kennedy asked.\n\nTrump praised Kennedy as a “phenomenal person” as the crowd chanted, “Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.” The former GOP president told supporters that Kennedy called him after his attempted assassination in Pennsylvania last month.\n\n“Upon my election, I will establish a new independent presidential commission on assassination attempts,” Trump said, noting that he will release all remaining classified information on President John F. Kennedy’s assassination.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nTrump takes the stage in Arizona\n\nDonald Trump took the stage Friday in Glendale at around 4:30 p.m.\n\n“A very big hello, Arizona. Hello, Phoenix,” Trump said.\n\n“We are going to win Arizona. We’re going to defeat comrade Kamala Harris,” he said.\n\nTrump, the Republican presidential nominee, drew a rally crowd of more than 13,000 people to Desert Diamond Arena, the same venue where Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, rallied a crowd of 15,000 earlier in August.\n\nTrump and Harris are locked in a tight battle in battleground Arizona, with statewide polls showing the Democratic nominee slightly ahead. Both campaigns expect Arizona could come down to a small number of ballots — President Joe Biden beat Trump by fewer than 11,000 votes four years ago.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nMaricopa County recorder candidate makes pitch to independents, Democrats\n\nRepublican Justin Heap used his time on stage to make his first appeal to voters outside his base since winning his primary for Maricopa County recorder last month.\n\nHe will face Democrat Tim Stringham for the seat in November. Swing voters are expected to play a key role in the pivotal race, which will determine who controls voter registration and early voting in Arizona’s most populous county. Heap’s remarks came a little more than 30 minutes before former President Donald Trump was expected to take the stage, a prime time slot for a local race.\n\n“To the independents and Democrats in the room today … join me,” Heap said. “Free and fair and honest elections is not a Republican issue, it is an everyone issue.”\n\nHeap said he was running to “secure our elections” and called for full election results on election night. That isn't possible under current state law and wouldn't be attainable without significant changes to when voters are permitted to return early ballots.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nOfficials treat dozens of rally attendees Friday afternoon\n\nThe Glendale Fire Department treated more than 100 Trump rally attendees for things such as heat-related illnesses, Assistant Chief Tim Pirtle told The Republic.\n\nPirtle said the sheer volume of patients delayed Glendale firefighters' ability to treat and transport people to the hospital.\n\nBy about 3:20 p.m., nearly all attendees had made their way into air conditioning, according to Pirtle.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, the temperature in Glendale was about 104 degrees with partly cloudy skies, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n— Rey Covarrubias Jr.\n\nVoter turnout a big focus at Trump rally\n\nAhead of Donald Trump’s appearance in Glendale, speakers at his rally called on attendees to drive GOP turnout in Arizona. Trump lost Arizona by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020 — the smallest margin of any state in his battle against President Joe Biden four years ago.\n\n“We need every vote. We can win Arizona,” said Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz. “Will you help us get every Republican voter to the ballot?”\n\nThe rally is co-hosted by Turning Point PAC and Turning Point Action, the Arizona-based conservative group that is helping turn out voters for Trump.\n\n“This is our election to lose,” said Rep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., encouraging the crowd to help Turning Point “chase ballots” this fall. “We can’t count on Donald Trump to carry this entire load on his back.” Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., put it plainly: \"Please ask your neighbors to vote — unless they’re Democrats.”\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nMaricopa superintendent candidate: ‘Students need to be taught the importance of our constitution’\n\nMaricopa County School superintendent candidate Shelli Boggs declared schools a battleground while taking the podium in Glendale. She said teachers aren’t being supported and parents have been “disrespected” and “ignored” as their tax dollars fund the destruction of education.\n\nDuring her campaign, Boggs has portrayed herself as a fierce advocate for depoliticizing American classrooms. At the same time, she has said she does not want schools to teach about racism, transgender students should not use facilities that align with their gender identity and schools should discourage talk of pronouns.\n\n“Students need to be taught the importance of our constitution and what it means to be an American. Now more than ever, we must protect and strengthen our schools,” Boggs said.\n\n— Nicholas Sullivan\n\nHeat, long lines discourage some Trump fans\n\nThousands of people stood in line outside Desert Diamond Arena on Friday afternoon in the 104-degree heat, hoping to get a seat inside for Trump’s rally. Terrence Feller, 62, came from Casa Grande to see the former president with his daughter. They saw the long line and decided to turn around, especially after speaking with one attendee who arrived at 9 a.m. and was just entering the arena after 1 p.m.\n\n“It has to be a mile,” he said. “After seeing how long the line is, we decided to turn around and go back to Casa Grande.”\n\nFeller said he’s voting for Trump because he’ll boost the economy and “get us back on the right energy path, where we’re selling instead of buying.”\n\nAs someone who works at a migrant detention center, Feller named the border as another top issue and said immigration is a much larger issue than is presented in the media.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nCrowd begins to fill stands at Desert Diamond Arena\n\nMore than two hours before former President Donald Trump was scheduled to take the stage in Glendale, thousands of supporters filled in much of Desert Diamond Arena’s lower bowl.\n\nThe upper section of the arena was not yet occupied as state Sen. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek, fired up the crowd. The venue has a capacity of close to 19,000, according to its website.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\nHarris campaign reaches out to RFK Jr. supporters\n\nJen O’Malley Dillon, Democrat Kamala Harris’ campaign chair, reacted to independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to suspend his campaign by reaching out to his supporters.\n\n“For any American out there who is tired of Donald Trump and looking for a new way forward, ours is a campaign for you,” O’Malley Dillon said Friday in a written statement. “In order to deliver for working people and those who feel left behind, we need a leader who will fight for you, not just for themselves, and bring us together, not tear us apart. Vice President Harris wants to earn your support.”\n\n“Even if we do not agree on every issue, Kamala Harris knows there is more that unites us than divides us: respect for our rights, public safety, protecting our freedoms, and opportunity for all.”\n\nSpeaking Friday in downtown Phoenix, Kennedy announced that he is suspending his campaign and backing Donald Trump. He said he is working to remove his name from the ballot in about 10 “battleground states” where polling suggests he might play spoiler to the benefit of the Democrats.\n\n— Dan Nowicki\n\nWho else will be speaking at the Trump rally in Glendale?\n\nA number of Republicans running for office were scheduled to speak at the rally, according to Turning Point Action, including Kari Lake, candidate for U.S. Senate; Abe Hamadeh, candidate for Arizona’s 8th Congressional District; Jerry Sheridan, candidate for Maricopa County sheriff; Justin Heap, candidate for Maricopa County recorder; and Shelli Boggs, candidate for Maricopa County school superintendent.\n\nTurning Point Action asked people to register for the rally via the Trump campaign website, which allowed people to sign up for two tickets per mobile phone number. Attendance will be first come, first serve, according to the Turning Point Action.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nRFK Jr. suspends his campaign, endorses Trump\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent presidential candidate, announced Friday in downtown Phoenix that he is suspending his presidential campaign and backing Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\n“I want everyone to know that I'm not terminating my campaign. I am simply suspending it and not ending it,” a hoarse-sounding Kennedy said from a ballroom inside the Renaissance Phoenix Downtown Hotel. \"My name will remain on the ballot in most states.\"\n\nIn \"about 10 battleground states,\" where he could play spoiler in favor of the Democrats, Kennedy said he is withdrawing his name from the ballots. The Arizona Secretary of State's Office confirmed Thursday to The Arizona Republic that he filed to take his name of the ballot here.\n\nTrump is set headline a rally later Friday at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale. Since Thursday, the Trump campaign has been touting the appearance of an unnamed “special guest” at the event. Trump said Thursday he would consider an RFK Jr. endorsement\n\nKennedy, a former Democrat, is the son of slain 1968 presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of assassinated President John F. Kennedy.\n\nKennedy said Friday that he left the party because the Democrats have abandoned “the core values I grew up with.” He said he believed he would have won the election \"in an honest system.\"\n\n— Dan Nowicki\n\nWhat time is Donald Trump's rally in Glendale?\n\nFormer president and 2024 Republican nominee Donald Trump has a rally scheduled in Glendale on Friday afternoon, the day after the close of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and Vice President Kamala Harris' speech accepting the Democratic nomination.\n\nTrump will appear at Desert Diamond Arena, the same venue where Harris held a rally earlier this month. The event will be co-hosted by conservative groups Turning Point PAC and Turning Point Action.\n\nTrump's rally in Glendale was scheduled to begin at 4 p.m., according to the former president's campaign. Doors open for attendees at 11 a.m., and \"pre-programming\" was expected to start at 2 p.m., according to Turning Point Action.\n\nArizona is an \"emerging problem\" for Trump, one longtime political observer said recently, and Trump’s own allies have said he should be in the state more often.\n\nTrump visited Arizona's southern border on Thursday. The former president painted a grisly, violent picture of illegal immigration during a tour of the U.S.-Mexico border, using Cochise County as the backdrop for his counterprogramming on the day the vice president accepted her party’s presidential nomination.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nWhere has Donald Trump been campaigning this week?\n\nDonald Trump hit the campaign trail in several battleground states this week.\n\nOn Monday, the former president spoke to a crowd of supporters on a factory floor in the working-class city of York, Pennsylvania, and vowed to end rules created by the Environmental Protection Agency that would limit air and water pollution from power plants.\n\n\"It's a disaster for our country,\" Trump said. \"Instead of shutting down power plants, we will open dozens and dozens more, and they'll happen fast.\"\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, are appearing at series of campaign events in Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Nevada and Georgia in addition to Trump’s stop in Arizona.\n\n— Melissa Cruz, USA TODAY\n\nWhere is Donald Trump on Friday morning? In Las Vegas\n\nBefore his rally in Glendale on Friday afternoon, Donald Trump will speak at a restaurant in Las Vegas about noon to discuss his campaign promise to not tax tips. Trump flew to Las Vegas after his Arizona border visit on Thursday afternoon.\n\nRFK Jr. files to withdraw his name from Arizona's Nov. 5 ballot\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. late Thursday filed to withdraw his name from Arizona's Nov. 5 ballot, the Arizona Secretary of State's Office confirmed to The Arizona Republic.\n\nKennedy filed to withdraw around 5:30 p.m., according to JP Martin, a spokesperson for Secretary of State Adrian Fontes.\n\nSpeculation has swirled about Kennedy considering ending his campaign and endorsing former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nKennedy is scheduled to speak Friday in Phoenix about his \"path forward.\" Later in the day, Trump is holding a rally with an unnamed \"special guest\" at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nMan suspected of threatening Trump has been arrested\n\nThe Cochise County Sheriff's Office said Thursday it arrested a man who authorities say made threats on social media against former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The Cochise County Sheriff's Office was made aware of threatening statements made via social media by the subject Ronald Syvrud towards candidate Trump,\" Carol Capas, a department spokesperson, told The Arizona Republic. \"As a result, additional information was developed confirming outstanding warrants for this subject, and a subsequent public release was issued.\"\n\nTrump made a stop Thursday at the U.S.-Mexico border in Cochise County. He told the media there that he was unaware of the then-ongoing manhunt for Syvrud.\n\n“But no, I haven’t heard that but I’m not that surprised,\" Trump said. \"And the reason is I want to do things that are very bad for the bad guys. I have heard that it's very unsafe to make this trip. There were some people who really didn't want me to make it.\"\n\nSyvrud, 66, of Benson, had \"outstanding warrants from the state of Wisconsin for DUI/Failure to Appear for DUI and from Graham County Arizona for Hit/Run and Felony Failure to Register as a Sex Offender,\" the Cochise County Sheriff's Office said on Facebook.\n\n— Perry Vandell\n\nArizona Democrats blast Trump 'border stunt'\n\nArizona Democrats dismissed former President Donald Trump’s appearance Thursday in Cochise County as a “border stunt.”\n\nThe state Democratic Party in a written statement said Trump went to the U.S.-Mexico border “to take attention away from Democrats hosting one of the largest political rallies in our state's history and a Democratic Convention where Arizona Democrats solidified our status as the future of the party.”\n\nThe Democrats also highlighted what they called Trump’s “long record of demonizing immigrants, promising mass deportations, and killing bipartisan solutions that would help border states like Arizona.”\n\nTrump’s role in torpedoing a bipartisan Senate border compromise has been a constant line of attack from Democrats. Trump urged Republicans to reject the deal so as not to give President Joe Biden an election-year legislative victory.\n\nThe state party also recalled Trump’s odd decision to kiss former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio on stage at an event earlier this year at Dream City Church in Phoenix.\n\n\"I don't kiss men. But I kissed him,\" Trump said at the time.\n\nAs president, Trump pardoned Arpaio, an anti-immigration hardliner who in 2017 had been convicted of criminal contempt of court as part of a long-running case involving racial profiling by his agency.\n\n— Dan Nowicki\n\n'Special guest' touted to appear Friday at Trump's Glendale rally\n\nPresident Donald Trump's campaign on Thursday announced that an unnamed \"special guest\" would join Trump on Friday at his afternoon rally at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale.\n\nThe announcement comes amid speculation that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intends to bow out of the race and endorse Trump.\n\nKennedy, the son of slain 1968 Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, is expected to make his own late morning appearance Friday in Phoenix where he will discuss his \"path forward.\"\n\nAsked at an Arizona border stop about the Kennedy speculation, Trump said there were no plans for Kennedy to appear with him in Glendale.\n\nTrump called Kennedy “smart” and “a little bit different but that’s OK.\"\n\nLater, the Trump campaign said in a written statement: \"President Trump will be joined by a special guest as he delivers remarks about his America First policies and his vision to lower inflation and the cost of living, secure the border, and make our cities safe again.\"\n\nAnnounced guest speakers at the Trump rally include Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk; Senate candidate Kari Lake; U.S. Reps. Andy Biggs, Eli Crane and Paul Gosar; congressional candidate Abe Hamadeh; and Maricopa County sheriff candidate Jerry Sheridan.\n\n— Dan Nowicki and Stephanie Murray\n\nTrump unaware of police search for man suspected of threatening him\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, speaking at the Arizona-Mexico border, addressed a Cochise County manhunt for a person suspected of making threats against him.\n\nResponding to a question from the media, Trump said he was unaware of the situation.\n\n\"I've heard it's dangerous, but I also have a job to do. I heard it's very dangerous. I haven't heard about that,\" Trump said. \"They probably want to keep it from me. Thank you for telling me.\"\n\nTrump added that he has \"great respect\" for the Secret Service, which came under bipartisan fire last month after Trump was wounded in a July 13 assassination attempt.\n\n\"Mistakes were made, and they're going to learn from the mistakes,\" he said.\n\nThe Cochise County Sheriff's Office confirmed to The Arizona Republic Thursday that they were searching for Ronald Syvrud, a 66-year-old Benson resident, after it \"was made aware of threatening statements made via social media.\"\n\n“But no, I haven’t heard that but I’m not that surprised,\" Trump said. \"And the reason is I want to do things that are very bad for the bad guys. I have heard that it's very unsafe to make this trip. There were some people who really didn't want me to make it.\"\n\n— Dan Nowicki, Stephanie Murray and Perry Vandell\n\nAn RFK Jr. endorsement would be a great honor, Trump says\n\nTrump said he hasn’t spoken recently with independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. but acknowledged speculation that Kennedy may drop out of the race Friday. That would be a great honor, Trump said.\n\nTrump noted the pair will both be in Arizona tomorrow but said there are no plans for Kennedy to appear at his rally in Glendale.\n\nTrump called Kennedy “smart” and “a little bit different but that’s O.K.\"\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nTrump calls Harris 'a Marxist' who wants open borders\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his remarks at the border by knocking President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The former president addressed reporters with law enforcement officials and families of victims of crimes committed by people who crossed the border illegally.\n\nTrump referred to Harris as a “Marxist” and claimed she wants “open borders.” He gave his speech at an unfinished portion of the border wall in Cochise County, and often gestured to pieces of the wall piled nearby.\n\n“It could have been put up in a matter of weeks,” Trump said, calling the barrier the “Rolls-Royce” of walls.\n\nHe was joined by the family of Rachel Morin, who was raped and murdered in 2023 in Maryland. An immigrant from El Salvador was arrested and charged in connection with the crimes.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nTrump arrives at the Arizona-Mexico border\n\nDonald Trump arrived at the southern border shortly after noon Thursday. He was joined by campaign advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, along with Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley.\n\nThe former president exited his motorcade and met with Cochise County officials at the border wall.\n\nHe was wearing a blue suit and red tie.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nTrump changes tune on the Obamas\n\nTrump, a harsh critic of Obama and his time in office, actually offered some rare praise for his predecessor while speaking to reporters Tuesday. That praise? Trump referred to the 44th president as a “nice gentleman” whom he happens to “like and respect,” in an interview with CNN.\n\n“I thought he was a terrible president. He didn’t do the job. He let people take advantage of us on trade,” Trump said while on the campaign trail in Michigan. “Especially trade — he was very weak on trade. But I happen to like him. I respect him and his wife.”\n\nTrump was not too thrilled with Barack and Michelle Obama's comments at the national convention.\n\n\"Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night take shots? He was taking shots at your president,\" Trump said at a rally in Asheboro, North Carolina, on Wednesday, the day after the Obamas spoke at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe use of Obama's full name harkens back to Trump's promotion of the “birther” conspiracy, a false claim about Obama’s birthplace that Trump eventually walked back in 2016.\n\n\"He was very nasty last night. I try to be nice to people you know, but it gets a little tough when they get personal,\" Trump continued.\n\nTrump mentioned that his campaign advisers tried to keep him from getting \"personal\" and to stick with policy talk. He asked the crowd if he should follow that advice or get personal. The crowd responded wanting him to get personal.\n\n— Joyce Orlando, USA TODAY\n\nHeavy security at Trump border stop\n\nAwaiting Donald Trump’s visit to Arizona, Secret Service agents, Cochise County sheriff officers and other law enforcement lined a dirt road leading to the U.S.-Mexico border. The former president was set to arrive at Sierra Vista Municipal Airport on Thursday morning, tour a portion of the border near Coronado National Monument and speak with the press.— Stephanie Murray and Sarah Lapidus\n\nDonald Trump to rally at same Glendale arena as Kamala Harris\n\nDonald Trump will hit the campaign trail in Glendale on Friday, holding a rally at the same venue where Kamala Harris drew a crowd of 15,000 people earlier this month.\n\nIt’s the perfect opportunity for a crowd size comparison.\n\nThe Republican former president is under pressure to upstage Harris by packing Desert Diamond Arena with a huge crowd. It’s a comparison of his own making: Trump has been disputing the size of Harris’ fired-up campaign crowds lately, even falsely claiming she used artificial intelligence because her sea of supporters was so large at a recent event.\n\nThe event marks Trump’s first large-scale campaign event in battleground Arizona since Harris became the Democratic nominee. Trump had a comfortable lead over President Joe Biden in the state, but the race has tightened now that Harris is his opponent.\n\n“Until Kamala Harris took the top of the ticket, Trump was known for throwing the better party,” said Stacey Pearson, a Phoenix Democratic political consultant.\n\nThe size of a rally is not an indicator of who will win an election, but a campaign crowd can provide a peek into how enthusiastic voters are about a particular candidate. That’s notable in Arizona, where Biden had struggled to get voters excited to turn out before he left the race.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nDonald Trump has visited Arizona often. Here's the list\n\nFor years, Arizona has been one of former President Donald Trump's favorite spots to campaign.\n\nHe was a frequent visitor in 2015 and 2016 on his way to the Republican nomination. Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in Arizona in 2016 to capture the state's 11 electoral votes.\n\nIn 2020, despite multiple visits, Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden in Arizona by fewer than 11,000 votes. He returned for additional rallies after his presidency, often lamenting a \"stolen\" and \"rigged\" election.\n\nIn 2024, Trump again has ramped up his time in Arizona as he makes another run for the presidency, this time taking on Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\nWho is leading in the polls in Arizona?\n\nIt’s hard to say which presidential candidate, Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris, is ahead in Arizona, generally regarded as one of the nation's seven swing states in the 2024 election.\n\nRecent public polling has run from Harris ahead by 5 percentage points to Trump leading by 4.\n\nBy comparison, Trump led every public poll involving him and Biden in Arizona tracked by the nonpartisan website FiveThirtyEight in June and July, sometimes by double digits.\n\nThe reality is the shake-up of the Democratic ticket, followed by the party’s national convention, has likely boosted Harris’ standing in the polls. The convention ends Thursday, and public opinion could be more stable after that, at least until the rivals' Sept. 10 debate in Philadelphia.\n\nPollsters won’t have a clean look at public opinion for at least another week, leaving the state’s uncertain status unchanged for at least a few more days.\n\nThe major political ratings organizations all list Arizona as a toss-up at the moment.\n\n— Ronald J.

Kennedy and John Lennon, to movie/music megastars such as Sylvester Stallone, Jon Bon Jovi and Jimmy Buffett, to titans of industry such as Charles Schwab, casino mogul Steve Wynn, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson and Dan Gilbert, Cleveland Cavaliers majority owner and the founder of Quicken Loans, real estate was hopping in 2020 in Palm Beach, the new full-time home to probably the world's biggest name, President Donald Trump.\n\nThe year may have been marked by the deadly coronavirus pandemic, civil unrest and a contentious presidential election, but it was a good year for Palm Beach real estate agents and brokers because of an onslaught of buyers.\n\nJust compare the residential sales that hit or exceeded $20 million this year to 2019. Last year, there were 10 of those transactions. As of the last week of 2020, there had been 21 deals in that price category recorded by the Palm Beach County Clerk’s office — an annual record for the island.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the transactions involving some pretty big names.\n\n$72M home sale reported to company linked to Charles Schwab\n\nIn June, a renovated landmarked estate at 8 S. Lake Trail set a lakefront price single-sale record when it changed hands in a private deal.

Lake Way stands on 1½ acres with 253 feet of lakefront. It features a dock and a sandy beach beyond the seawall.\n\nThe sale was financed with a $15 million, 30-year mortgage, courthouse records show.\n\nStallone, 74, in the 1990s owned a home on Miami’s Biscayne Bay.\n\nNFL Jet's owner Woody Johnson buys never-lived-in house for $32 M\n\nIn April, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson used a Delaware limited liability company to buy a never-lived-in house developed on speculation at 446 N. Lake Way for $32.2 million. On the seller’s side was luxury homebuilder Mark Pulte of Mark Timothy Inc., who was represented by Moens. Agent Jim McCann of Premier Estate Properties acted for the buyer.\n\nCompany linked to Estée Lauder company buys home for $25M\n\nIn April, the home of the late philanthropists Morton L. and Barbara A. Mandel at 1063 N.

She was 76.\n\nShe died at 9:50 a.m. ET surrounded by family at her home in Detroit.\n\nA family statement released by her publicist, Gwendolyn Quinn, said \"Franklin's official cause of death was due to advance pancreatic cancer of the neuroendocrine type, which was confirmed by Franklin's oncologist, Dr. Philip Philip of Karmanos Cancer Institute\" in Detroit.\n\nThe family added: \"In one of the darkest moments of our lives, we are not able to find the appropriate words to express the pain in our heart. We have lost the matriarch and rock of our family.\"\n\nFranklin was one of the transcendent cultural figures of the 20th century. Raised on an eclectic musical diet of gospel, R&B, classical and jazz, she blossomed out of her father's Detroit church to become the most distinguished female black artist of all time, breaking boundaries while placing nearly 100 hits on Billboard’s R&B chart – 20 of them reaching No. 1.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe Queen of Soul, as she was crowned in the 1960s, leaves a sprawling legacy of classic songs that includes \"Respect,\" \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\" \"Chain of Fools,\" \"Baby I Love You,\" \"Angel,\" \"Think,\" \"Rock Steady,\" \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" and \"Freeway of Love,\" along with a best-selling gospel catalog.\n\nReaction: John Legend, Barbra Streisandand other celebs grieve\n\nAretha Franklin: What we know about her funeral and memorial\n\nHer death follows several years of painstakingly concealed medical issues, which led to regular show cancellations and extended absences from the public eye.\n\nIn March, Franklin canceled two concerts scheduled in New Jersey. According to a statement from her management team, she was following doctors' orders to stay off the road and rest for two months, and she was \"extremely disappointed she cannot perform as she had expected and hoped to.\"\n\nFranklin's last performance was on Nov. 2, for the Elton John AIDS Foundation in New York. The previous June, visibly feeble but still summoning magic, Franklin played her final hometown Detroit show, an emotion-packed concert for thousands at an outdoor festival downtown.\n\nShe ended the performance with a then-cryptic appeal to her the crowd: \"Please keep me in your prayers.\"\n\nThe Queen of Soul sang for presidents and royalty, and befriended high-profile leaders such as the Revs. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesse Jackson. Amid the global glitter and acclaim, she remained loyal to her adopted home, living in the Detroit area for decades, including the Bloomfield Hills house where she moved in the late ’80s.\n\n“My roots are there. The church is there. My family is there,” she told the Detroit Free Press in 2011. “I like the camaraderie in Detroit, how we’ll rally behind something that’s really worthy and come to each other’s assistance.”\n\nFranklin’s voice was a singular force, earning her a multitude of laurels through the decades, including 18 Grammy Awards, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and honorary doctorates from a host of institutions. In 1987, she became the first female artist inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and seven years later, at age 52, the youngest recipient of a Kennedy Center Honor.\n\nFranklin topped Rolling Stone magazine’s 100 Greatest Singers of All Time list, and her signature hit, “Respect,” ranked No. 4 on “Songs of the Century,” a 1999 project by the National Endowment for the Arts. She performed at the inaugurations of U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, garnering global attention at the latter for her big fur hat with its crystal-studded bow – a piece now in the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nFranklin's influence is vast and indelible. It's most obviously heard in the myriad voices that followed her, from Mary J. Blige to Adele, and even male singers such as Luther Vandross.\n\nBut just as important is Franklin's broader social impact: She embodied American black culture, emphatically and without apology, and through sheer force of talent, thrust it onto the global stage.\n\nFranklin revolutionized black music and the way it was absorbed and perceived, helping create a world where we take for granted that a Beyonce can reign atop mainstream popular culture.\n\nFranklin was emotionally complex, a woman who relished her diva status but whose vulnerabilities and insecurities always seemed to lurk just beneath. Her public success masked a private life of turbulence and loss, making for an intriguing character driven by conflicting forces: Franklin was sassy but naturally shy, urbane but down-home, confident but reckless.\n\nThat deep, complicated humanity imbued her music with authenticity. Franklin’s singing, soaked in feeling and executed with virtuoso skill, moved seamlessly among styles: gospel, soul, pop, blues, R&B, jazz, even opera. She belted, purred, seduced, testified. Even as the propulsive power left her voice in later years, she remained as expressive as ever, and her live performances continued to earn critical acclaim.\n\n“I must do what is real in me in all ways,” she told Ebony magazine in 1967, the year when a string of hit singles – “Respect,” \"Baby I Love You,\" \"Chain of Fools\" – gave Franklin her first major crossover success.\n\nFranklin's early life\n\nBorn in Memphis on March 25, 1942, Franklin moved at age 4 to Detroit when her father, the Rev. C.L. Franklin, took over duties at New Bethel Baptist Church.\n\nTurmoil set in early: Her mother left Detroit for Buffalo, New York, when Aretha was 6, and died four years later.\n\nStill, Franklin grew up in an environment ideal for nurturing her skills. Her charismatic father was a preacher and singer with a national reputation, with sermons that became top-selling records and a gospel revue that toured the country. That brought important musical figures into the young singer’s orbit, including household guests such as James Cleveland, Mahalia Jackson, B.B. King and Sam Cooke. Growing up on Detroit’s northwest side, she was a childhood friend of Smokey Robinson.\n\nShe became a singing prodigy at New Bethel, and her sisters, Carolyn and Erma, also honed their gospel skills. But it was Aretha who emerged as the standout, and by age 14 she was accompanying her father on his gospel travels.\n\nGospel was the main focus, but the Franklin household was teeming with all manner of music.\n\n“I heard classical music from the beginning. It was always in our home,” Franklin told the Free Press in 2011. “As a teenager I took more to the R&B, but I always loved classical.”\n\nR&B music, frowned upon by many in the traditional gospel world, was also welcome in the house. The Rev. Franklin, progressive in politics and disposition, put up little resistance to the secular sounds exemplified by artists such as Cooke.\n\nThe young Aretha absorbed the emotional power of music in its many forms, whether in the throes of an ecstatic congregation or the intimacy of close listening.\n\n“(My older sister) Erma was a big fan of ‘Be My Love’ by Mario Lanza,” she recalled. “How many times did we hear that in our house?! Sylvia Robinson, Smokey’s sister, used to visit Erma and play ‘Be My Love,’ pressing their ears against the speakers, just crying.\n\n\"I was quite young at the time, and I thought it was very funny that these girls were crying with their ears against the speaker. I didn’t do that with the artists I heard (then) – Frankie Lymon, the Clovers, LaVern Baker, Ray Charles. As an adult I began to perfectly understand it. When I heard someone knocking me out, I thought, ‘OK, so this is what that was about.’ ”\n\nIn 1960, at age 18, Franklin spurned a hometown offer from Berry Gordy’s fledgling Motown label and opted to sign with New York’s Columbia Records, where her demo tape had caught the ear of iconic talent scout John Hammond. A year later – shortly after Franklin married her manager, Ted White – her Columbia debut was released.\n\nThat record set the tone for her five-year, nine-album tenure at Columbia, where she was groomed as an interpreter of jazz and pop standards, presented as a chanteuse at the piano.\n\nFranklin was quietly masterful at the keyboard. Throughout her career, it was a skill overshadowed by her voice – although she played piano on most of the work for which she's now remembered.\n\nThe Columbia period proved fruitful but frustrating for the young singer, helping expand her talent while sticking a bridle on the gospel-honed voice behind it. Even as her critical reputation and live draw grew, she managed only a handful of minor hits.\n\n“It’s a fast track to the top if you’ve really got it going on. But I like the way I came up in the industry,” she told the Free Press in 2014. “It wasn’t too fast. It wasn’t overnight, but (rather) little by little. And gradually I grew in the industry. I like that more than the overnight sensation, as one might put it. I was able to learn along the way and grow at a very, very nice pace. My pace, really. I wasn’t thrust into anything I wasn’t ready for.”\n\nReal success blossomed in 1967, when the 24-year-old Franklin declined to renew her Columbia contract and signed with Atlantic Records, where executives Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler saw a chance to unleash the raw power of Franklin’s vocals. Her first Atlantic single – “I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)” – was cut at the burgeoning soul-music hotbed FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.\n\nWithin weeks it was Franklin’s first No. 1 on Billboard’s R&B chart, cracking the pop Top 10 as well. She was on her way to mainstream success.\n\nAs with so much of her coming work, the performance on \"I Never Loved a Man\" was fueled by a deep intensity but with an intimate, welcoming feel that helped Franklin connect with listeners across the board.\n\n“She has never learned how to be pretentious enough to build a false image, and deeply identifies with people on all levels,” Ebony wrote that year, going on to quote Franklin:\n\n“Everybody who’s living has problems and desires just as I do,” she told the magazine. “When the fellow on the corner has somethin’ botherin’ him, he feels the same way I do. When we cry, we all gonna cry tears, and when we laugh, we all have to smile.”\n\n'Respect' and the ascension to fame\n\nFranklin’s career quickly skyrocketed: With Wexler overseeing sessions and many of the Muscle Shoals players recruited to Atlantic's New York studio, Franklin recorded a flurry of hits in the ensuing months, all of them enduring for decades as staples of her repertoire: “Respect,” “Baby I Love You,” “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,” “Chain of Fools, “Ain’t No Way.” She was backed on many by sisters Carolyn and Erma, who enjoyed modest solo success of their own.\n\nFranklin was no one's puppet in the studio: Even in her earliest years, she was assertive during record sessions, crafting arrangements and dictating commands to seasoned musicians many decades her senior.\n\nBy '68, Franklin was an iconic figure in the African-American community – “the Queen of Soul,” as she was christened by the black press. She was now inescapably important: Franklin's status was seconded by mainstream America that summer when she graced the cover of Time magazine.\n\nWhile Franklin was not often explicitly political in public, she embraced her anointed role just as the black-pride movement was flowering. “Respect,” in particular, took on anthem-like stature, hailed as a bold feminist and civil-rights statement – though Franklin long insisted she had no grand designs when she recorded the Otis Redding tune about household relationships.\n\nOn Feb. 16, 1968 – declared “Aretha Franklin Day” by Detroit Mayor Jerome P. Cavanagh – she performed a celebratory hometown show for 12,000. In attendance was the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., two months before his assassination, and he took the stage to present Franklin with an award on behalf of his Southern Christian Leadership Council.\n\nAs would become typical of Franklin’s story, the outward success masked drama behind the scenes. The marriage to White, in particular, had become fraught, marked by domestic violence. By 1969, they were divorced. She would go on to wed actor Glynn Turman in 1978, a marriage that lasted six years.\n\nThe hits continued to pile up. By the end of the 1960s she had placed 28 songs in the R&B Top 40, a mix of original material and eclectic cover songs, including work by the Beatles (“Eleanor Rigby”) and the Band (“The Weight”). The momentum carried into the following decade, with a string of hit records and a 1972 gospel album, “Amazing Grace,” that became one of the genre’s all-time best sellers.\n\nSuccess on the R&B side continued in the ’70s even as the pop hits tapered off, though 1976’s “Sparkle” soundtrack produced one of Franklin’s abiding crossover classics, the Curtis Mayfield-penned “Something He Can Feel.” A scene-stealing appearance in the 1980 comedy “The Blues Brothers,” where Franklin performed as a waitress belting out “Think,” was a colorful introduction for a younger generation.\n\nThat same year, searching for a new musical direction, Franklin signed with Arista Records, where mogul Clive Davis helped groom a fresh career path for the singer, now approaching 40.\n\nAfter several tries, the 1985 album “Who’s Zoomin’ Who” became the mainstream smash they sought, producing the hit “Freeway of Love” and placing Franklin in front of the MTV audience. A duet with George Michael, “I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me),” topped the global charts two years later.\n\nFranklin, who had spent much of the 1970s in Los Angeles, was now permanently resettled in metro Detroit, with several area properties including the Bloomfield Hills residence that would remain her primary home for the next three decades. Her father had died in 1984 after a five-year coma; he’d been shot during an attempted robbery at his Detroit home.\n\nThe 1990s saw Franklin growing into the role of elder soul stateswoman, satisfied with her status as one of pop history’s greats and playing up the diva role that had become an integral facet of her persona. While the studio pace slowed – she released just five albums from 1998 through her death – her latter-day music was generally well received, with Grammy nominations for “A Rose Is Still a Rose” (1998) and “So Damn Happy” (2003).\n\n“I’m comfortable in my own skin, and my six-inch heels,” she told the Free Press in 2011.\n\nThough Franklin still performed regularly in the ’90s and ’00s, her touring work was hampered by her fear of flying, which set in after a frightening small-plane trip in the early ’80s. She insisted on bus travel, trekking across the U.S. to play for adoring crowds at theaters and summer amphitheaters.\n\n\"I've definitely evolved to a greater maturity onstage, a savoir faire, I think,\" she told the Free Press. \"It's just about relaxing more, really, and having fun with it. That comes with time, to evolve to that level and find that it's really very simple ... that it's really about having fun and communicating with your audience.\"\n\nFranklin was long dogged by weight issues and struggled with alcohol abuse in the late 1960s. But the first glaring sign of health problems came in 2010, when she canceled six months of concert commitments while hospitalized for undisclosed reasons.\n\nShe re-emerged the next summer visibly slimmer and seemingly healthy, returning with a glowing show at the Chicago Theatre: \"Six months after the world was braced for the worst, Aretha Franklin gave it her best,\" as the Free Press reported at the time.\n\n\"Her voice was velvety and potent as she rolled into her set, still finding new curves and corners in the notes of songs such as 'Think,' 'Sparkle' and 'Baby I Love You,' \" read the review.\n\nNevertheless, Franklin's concert activity became hit-and-miss during her final years, and show cancellations became par for the course, often chalked up to unnamed health problems. She increasingly spoke of winding things down, performing fewer shows by the year, and in February 2017 finally raised the prospect of retirement, saying she was recording a final album.\n\nTwo missions loomed large during the final decade of Franklin's life, and both were still in the works when she died: She was in ongoing talks to produce a film about her life, frequently talking up potential lead actresses such as Jennifer Hudson, Halle Berry and Audra McDonald. And she was enchanted by the idea of opening a soul-food restaurant in downtown Detroit.\n\nReclusive by nature, Franklin liked being at home and enjoying “the small things,” as she said in 2011 – polishing the silver, buying a tea set, washing and ironing. She was a reader drawn to biographies and an avid media consumer who looked forward to her daily newspapers.\n\n“I enjoy the comfort of home very much,” she said. “I’m very domestic when I’m at home. I can stay in the house for the longest kind of time and not get out.”\n\nFrom Obama to Pavarotti, always grand\n\nIt was always BIG with Aretha Franklin. The public situations skewed to the larger-than-life, the supersize, the majestic. She was an immense presence, physically and psychologically, and could take over rooms simply by sweeping into them.\n\nShe had a knack for finding herself at the center of grand moments, whether stealing the show at the Obama inaugural or filling in for the ailing Luciano Pavarotti with an impromptu “Nessun Dorma” at the 1998 Grammys.\n\n“She could get a U.S. president on the phone with two calls,” said Brian Pastoria, who co-engineered some of Franklin's studio work.\n\nIndeed, it was the little stuff that seemed to vex Franklin most. She struggled with personal finances, and was frequently forced into small-claims court by mom-and-pop operations around metro Detroit – limo services, caterers, contractors. Her home was often cluttered and unkempt, and while experts on creative genius might say that comes with the territory, it was enough to frustrate neighbors and leave visitors puzzled why she had so little help around her.\n\nFor years Franklin talked about plans to tackle her flying phobia, but never followed through. It kept her grounded for the final 35 years of her life, plausibly costing her millions in touring revenue.\n\nFranklin was scrupulously private; her personal life was shielded by a tight cadre of family members and friends. When writer Mark Bego set out to pen the first authorized Aretha Franklin biography, 1989’s “The Queen of Soul,” he was struck by the array of unknowns that still surrounded her – basic details about her two marriages and divorces, her upbringing, even her musical inspirations.\n\n“I felt as if I had just encountered one of the great unsolved mysteries of the show-business world,” he wrote.\n\nFranklin cautiously traipsed into some of those topics with her 1999 autobiography, “Aretha: From These Roots.” But she remained elusive enough that her handpicked co-author, David Ritz, was compelled to write his own uninhibited Franklin biography 15 years later.\n\nThat book provoked the singer’s wrath – the sort of eruption familiar to those in Aretha's world. Franklin continually churned through support staff, hiring and firing lawyers, publicists and producers. She feuded with other female singers and knew how to hold a grudge, including a beef with Dionne Warwick that became public only when Franklin alerted the press out of the blue – five years after it happened.\n\nBut when it came to the music, few were more disciplined than Franklin. She was serious about her voice and exacting about her concert conditions: big on honey and hot tea before a show and insistent on rooms without air conditioning, aware it could dry out her throat.\n\nMany who worked closely with her also glimpsed the humanity at the heart of the superstar singer who came up in the church.\n\n\"She (was) very compassionate,\" the late Darryl Houston said in 2010. Houston was Franklin's accompanying pianist for more than two decades. \"When I was dealing with the sickness and eventual death of my father in Mississippi, she was very encouraging in thought and deed. I remember a few times I would get a call from a travel agent saying: 'When do you want to go see your dad? Ms. Franklin has taken care of the ticket.' \"\n\nBrian Pastoria was part of a studio team that worked with Franklin in the 1990s and 2000s, including recording sessions at her home.\n\n\"Before the vocal sessions, she'd be in the kitchen making chili. After recording a couple of hours, she'd say, 'OK, time to eat!' \" Pastoria recalled. \"Even though she was the greatest of all time, the Muhammad Ali of vocals, it was still always her calling on the phone for business, not her lawyer. You'd hear, 'Hi, honey, how are you!' It was nice. It was real. You never felt like you were dealing with a major superstar.\"\n\nFor all the public gowns, glitz and diva references – she was famously portrayed in a Snickers commercial as a crabby prima donna – Franklin was a homegirl at heart. She was a connoisseur of old-school Southern soul food, proud of her knack with homemade dishes like fried chicken and ham with black-eyed peas.\n\n\"I think I rank with the best when it comes to the stove,\" she told the Free Press in 1996.\n\nThat sort of organic realness coursed through her work.\n\n\"She paints a picture with a song,\" said Houston. \"Outside of being vocally astute, you can feel what she's singing. You can tell when someone is just singing a song, and when the song is a part of their inner being. With Aretha, what leaves the heart reaches the heart.\"\n\n\"It seems she never, ever forgot those roots of the church, and she really believed that we need to look above the things of this world, to a more spiritual level,\" said social activist Rocky Twyman. \"You felt like she wanted to bless humanity with her music.\"\n\nFranklin made her final hometown appearance in Detroit on June 10, 2017, headlining the Detroit Music Weekend festival for thousands gathered in the streets. Down the block two days earlier, tears had streamed down her face as she was honored by the city with the unveiling of Aretha Franklin Way.\n\nFor nearly two hours on the festival stage that weekend, she performed a spirited, feisty set while clearly struggling through pain, at one point singing from a plush chair.\n\nFranklin did it her way that night, foregoing many of her biggest hits for a deeper dive into her catalog and a stirring, 11-minute gospel workout of \"Precious Memories.\"\n\nThe old, soaring power may have been missing, but the passion was intact. For one last time in front of her hometown community, there was Aretha Franklin, and there was that voice.\n\nThat voice – still captivating, but now comforting in its decades-long familiarity. A sound still melding urban vitality with the warmth of Southern soul. Still joy, pain, ecstasy, liberation. Still strength and femininity. And still offering, as it always will, the promise of transcendence.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press music writer Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/12/19/biggest-pop-culture-moments-2024/76455140007/", "title": "Taylor Swift, Beyonce, 'Deadpool': 2024's biggest pop culture moments", "text": "A year of rap beefs, \"Brat\" and surprise music drops is almost in the books.\n\nWhen pop culture historians look back at 2024, which moment will stand out first?

The Bad Boy Records founder has since been denied bail despite multiple attempts to be released from a detention center in Brooklyn, New York, ahead of his trial next May.\n\nThe hip-hop heavyweight's arrest came amid a slew of civil lawsuits alleging abuse, including a highly publicized suit filed in 2023 by his ex-girlfriend \"Me & U\" singer Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura that was settled 24 hours later.\n\nThe arrest followed a pair of federal raids that targeted him as the subject of a sex trafficking investigation and came after a surveillance video surfaced of Combs kicking, dragging and hitting Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.\n\nDiddy's long history of legal troubles: Unraveling old lawsuits, allegations\n\nChappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter blow up as Charli XCX ushers in Brat summer\n\nChappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter have bubbled under the surface of pop music's mainstream for years, but in 2024, the pair finally emerged as up-and-coming superstars.\n\nAlthough Roan's debut album, \"The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,\" was released in 2023, she saw a major surge in popularity this year, as her track \"Hot to Go!\" became inescapable.\n\nBut the burgeoning pop star wasn't afraid to scold \"creepy behavior\" from fans and speak out about the way fame is affecting her, which could inspire future industry rookies to set similar boundaries.\n\nIt was also a massive year for Carpenter, whose earworm \"Espresso\" helped cement her as a pop sensation and became Spotify's most-streamed song of the year.\n\nAnd let's not forget Charli XCX, whose album \"Brat\" so defined the summer that Vice President Kamala Harris joined in on the fun − forcing a CNN panel to unpack Gen Z's seasonal moment.\n\nJennifer Lopez files for divorce from Ben Affleck\n\nBen Affleck and Jennifer Lopez made us believe in love again with their reunion in 2022, but by this year, the couple affectionately known as Bennifer were constantly in the news amid tabloid rumors about the health of their marriage.\n\nAfter months of rumors that ranged from bad to worse, fans finally got word in August that Lopez had filed for divorce − on the couple's second wedding anniversary. (The two were married two years ago after calling off their engagement in 2004.)\n\nLopez also canceled her summer tour in May amid the split.\n\nTaylor Swift's 'The Tortured Poets Department' and Beyoncé's 'Cowboy Carter'\n\nSwift and Beyoncé aren't known for taking days − or years − off, and 2024 was no different.\n\nIn March, Beyoncé released her genre-bending record \"Cowboy Carter,\" proclaiming in an Instagram caption that her eighth studio album \"ain't a Country album. This is a 'Beyoncé' album.\" It hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with the help of her twang-tinged lead single \"Texas Hold 'Em.\"\n\nThe album featured Shaboozey, Dolly Parton, Miley Cyrus, Post Malone, Willie Jones, Willie Nelson, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, Tanner Adell, Reyna Roberts and country legend Linda Martell.\n\n\"Cowboy Carter\" was seen as a response aimed at Nashville's mainstream after the music legend got an icy reception during her performance of \"Daddy Lessons\" featuring The Chicks at the 2016 CMA Awards. A month after Beyoncé got back on the saddle, Swift followed up with a record-breaking album of her own.\n\nThe singer/songwriter megastar wrote her way into music's history books with more than 300 million streams in a single day for \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" It became the most-streamed album in a single day in 2024, according to a rep for Spotify.\n\nLead single \"Fortnight,\" featuring rapper and genre-bending singer Post Malone, also made history as the most-streamed song in a day. Swift also claims the top three albums most-streamed albums in Spotify history with 2023's \"Midnights\" and \"1989 (Taylor's Version).\"\n\n'Inside Out 2' and 'Deadpool & Wolverine' set records; 'Wicked' defies gravity\n\nIs there any better summation of 2024 than the fact that the year's most iconic movie character may be anxiety?\n\n\"Inside Out 2\" exceeded box-office expectations over the summer by tapping into 2010s nostalgia and millennial anxiety. It's not only the biggest movie of 2024 but also the highest-grossing animated film of all time. Later in the year, another Disney animated sequel, \"Moana 2,\" had the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever at the box office. Both films marked a comeback for Disney after a series of animated flops like \"Wish,\" \"Strange World\" and \"Lightyear.\"\n\nMarvel similarly rebounded from financial disappointments and beat superhero fatigue allegations with \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" the current second-highest-grossing film of the year and biggest R-rated movie in history. Its success could lead Marvel to lean even harder into fan service and cameos going forward.\n\nIt wasn't all good news on the comic book movie front: DC's \"Joker: Folie à Deux,\" starring Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix, was a stunning failure both in terms of box office grosses and fan reception. The crash raised the pressure on new DC boss James Gunn to reset the superhero brand with next year's \"Superman.\"\n\nIf there was a true successor to the \"Barbie\" craze, it was \"Wicked,\" which wowed audiences after an Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo-peppered press tour that made the movie musical feel like a true must-see event.\n\nPrincess Kate and King Charles III battle cancer\n\nKing Charles III and Princess Kate bucked royal tradition this year by publicly revealing their respective cancer diagnoses.\n\nCharles, who celebrated his 76th birthday Nov. 14, announced his unspecified cancer diagnosis in February and underwent a \"corrective procedure.\"\n\nThe news came after the palace announced Jan. 17 that the monarch \"has sought treatment for an enlarged prostate,\" telling the press and public his condition was \"in common with thousands of men each year.\"\n\nKate's surgery in the spring led doctors to discover she had cancer. Her absence from public view fueled weeks of speculation about her whereabouts. In a video message in March, she announced she had cancer and told viewers it took time to \"explain everything\" to her three children \"and to reassure them that I'm going to be OK.\"\n\nShe asked for privacy and said she needed to \"focus on making a full recovery.\" In September, Kate shared her \"relief\" after completing her chemotherapy.\n\nStars stump for Kamala Harris, embrace 'childless cat lady' label\n\nWhen President Joe Biden made the historic decision to drop out of the 2024 election, stars were quick to rally around Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSwift and Beyoncé joined the list of celebrities who endorsed the Democratic nominee. Swift's endorsement was particularly anticipated, and she strategically dropped it just after Harris' debate with Donald Trump.\n\nMany of the endorsements also seized on Vice President-elect JD Vance's controversial comments about the Democratic Party consisting of \"childless cat ladies.\" But in the end, all the star power in the world couldn't prevent a decisive loss for Harris, while stars including Zachary Levi,Joe Rogan and Rob Schneider celebrated Trump's victory.\n\nLiam Payne, James Earl Jones and more celebrity deaths\n\nHardly any time passed in 2024 without the deaths of industry titans and stars gone too soon.\n\nIn October, One Direction star Liam Payne died at 31 after falling from a hotel balcony. For a generation that grew up with the boy band, the news was especially heavy and difficult to process.\n\nOther young stars lost this year included Chance Perdomo, who died at just 27 years old in a motorcycle accident, and \"General Hospital\" star Johnny Wactor, who was shot and killed at 37.\n\nSeveral stars also died after battling cancer, including Shannen Doherty, Toby Keith and Morgan Spurlock.\n\nCarl Weathers, Richard Lewis, Louis Gossett Jr., Shelley Duvall, Richard Simmons, Bob Newhart, James Earl Jones, John Amos and Quincy Jones were among the year's losses.\n\n5 charged in death of Matthew Perry\n\nMatthew Perry's death last year shocked legions of \"Friends\" fans, leading to questions about Perry's condition at the time of his death in October 2023. But in 2024, we found apparent answers.\n\nIn August, five people were charged in Perry's death from \"the acute effects of ketamine.\"\n\nPhysician Salvador Plasencia, 42, and Jasveen Sangha, 41, whom a Department of Justice press release referred to as the \"The Ketamine Queen\" of North Hollywood, originally faced 18 criminal counts for allegedly \"distributing ketamine to Perry during the final weeks of the actor’s life.\"\n\nSuspected co-conspirators named in the case are Perry's live-in assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, 59; Dr. Mark Chavez, 54; and Erik Fleming, 54, who was described as Perry's acquaintance.\n\nIwamasa's plea agreement gave a look at Perry's final days and his private battle with ketamine addiction. Perry was found dead in a hot tub at his Pacific Palisades home in Los Angeles on Oct. 28, 2023.\n\nInvestigators said Iwamasa conspired alongside others to purchase at least $55,000 worth of ketamine on behalf of Perry to inject the actor with the drug without proper medical licensure. Ketamine is an anesthetic that contains psychedelic contents. Prosecutors claim Iwamasa injected Perry with ketamine three times on the day of his death.\n\nMatthew Perry's death: Doctor who illegally obtained ketamine pleads guilty\n\n'Oppenheimer' dominates Oscars, but Ryan Gosling steals the show\n\n2023 was the year of Barbenheimer, but the phenomenon spilled over into 2024 thanks to awards season, which culminated in \"Oppenheimer\" winning the best picture Oscar as Christopher Nolan was awarded best director.\n\nBiggest moments from the 2024 Oscars, from Emma Stone's surprise win to naked John Cena\n\nThough it was not unexpected, it was the moment Hollywood officially crowned Nolan as not only one of the most financially successful filmmakers working today but one of the best.\n\nStill, the image we'll remember most from the 2024 Oscars may be of someone who didn't win anything: Ryan Gosling, who in a bedazzled pink suit delivered a performance of \"I'm Just Ken\" from \"Barbie\" that was so inspired it may actually top the one in the movie. We always knew he was Kenough.\n\nJon Stewart and Robert Downey Jr.'s shocking returns\n\nJust when we thought they were out ... two stars unexpectedly returned to the franchise that made them famous.\n\nJon Stewart revealed in January that he would return as host of \"The Daily Show,\" at least for one night a week. It was a surprising move for the comedian, who exited with great fanfare in 2015.\n\nWho is Doctor Doom? Robert Downey Jr.'s shocking Marvel casting explained\n\nBut fans have been impressed with Stewart's new episodes, and although his comeback was first pitched as just for the election, he's now set to stay through 2025. Could this just be the start of a long second run for the man who for years was one of the most influential voices in late-night?\n\nAnd Robert Downey Jr., who left the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2019 with the emotional death of Iron Man, shocked fans at Comic-Con in July when he revealed he's returning for the next \"Avengers\" movies − not as Iron Man but as the villain Doctor Doom.\n\nTo quote Luke Skywalker: In Hollywood, no one's ever really gone.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/memphis200/2019/04/17/memphis-bicentennial-history-trivia/3301701002/", "title": "Memphis Bicentennial: Here are 200 Bluff City historical facts", "text": "Memphis — the city established on the bluffs of the Mississippi River and named after an ancient capital on the Nile delta — turns 200 this year.\n\nIn recognition of this bicentennial, here are 200 markers along the road of history that led to the present day.\n\nThe events cited range from the comic to the tragic, from the risible to the world-shaking, from the all-but-forgotten to the never-to-be-forgotten. But they barely scratch the surface of the rich, silty soil that enabled Memphis to become \"the Hardwood Capital of America,\" to cite just one of the city's nicknames.\n\nIn other words, this is not a definitive Memphis timeline. With a few exceptions, it ignores music and sports (which will be celebrated by this newspaper later in the year with their own bicentennial tributes). You will have complaints about omissions. But we hope you will enjoy or appreciate the inclusions.\n\nSo, here it is — a Memphis 200 for a Bluff City Bicentennial.\n\n1. May 22, 1819: Modern Memphis is founded by planter and judge John Overton, Revolutionary War officer James Winchester and future president Andrew Jackson, a year after the federal government purchased the territory from the Chickasaw Nation in negotiations partly led by Jackson. Planned as a grid of streets along the river, the city is named for a former great river town, the ancient capital of Egypt.\n\n2. Progress was slow. \"From its founding in 1819 until about 1840, Memphis was a primitive and pestilential little mudhole striving to survive as a town.\" — John E. Harkins, \"Metropolis of the American Nile,\" 1982.\n\n3. The city's founding came 270 years after the first Memphis-area encounter between American Indians and Europeans, led by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Both France and Spain would build forts on the \"Chickasaw bluffs\" in the 18th century.\n\n4.

Wells makes an international reputation: \"Miss Ida B. Wells is a negress, a young lady of little more than twenty years of age, a graceful, sweet-faced, intelligent, courageous girl.

Ellett, grandly introduces the 24th president of the United States and then promptly drops dead on stage. The newspaper calls it “one of the saddest incidents that ever characterized a gala occasion,\" and offers this recounting: \"Judge Ellett was placed upon the platform, his shoes removed, and all that mortal effort and medical science could suggest applied to bring resuscitation. It was useless, his spirit had fled.\"\n\n32.

Natch, who lived chained to a tree, is poisoned by a bruincidal maniac in 1906; his head is removed, stuffed and put on display at the zoo, but reportedly is petted and hugged so often by the Natch-loving public that it literally falls to pieces.\n\n38. Prohibition advocate Carrie Nation, notorious for attacking bars and taverns with her signature hatchet, makes the rounds of several Memphis saloons on Oct. 23, 1902.

Banning David O. Selznick's \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1947, Binford wrote: \"It is sadism at its deepest level. It is the fleshpots of Pharaoh, modernized and filled to overflowing.

Reviewing Elvis' acting debut in \"Love Me Tender\" in 1956, an unimpressed Time magazine critic wrote: \"Is it a sausage?

It has the same sort of big, soft beautiful eyes and curly lashes, but who ever heard of a goldfish with sideburns?\"\n\n79. Known for his black outfits, Bogart sneer and prowess with a bullwhip, movie cowboy Lash LaRue is arrested for buying and concealing stolen property — sewing machines — in connection with car thefts that occur while he is a \"Wild West\" performer at the 1956 Mid-South Fair.

Its striking modern design by Memphis architect Roy Harrover now partially obscured by an ugly parking garage, the current Memphis International Airport terminal opens on June 7, 1963.\n\n88.

A beloved and seemingly ubiquitous harbinger of summer from the 1960s through the mid-1970s, the Memphis-born circular ice-cream delivery vehicle known as the \"Merrymobile\" roams the streets at a puttering 15 mph, making it easy prey for loose change-wielding, popsicle-craving urchins.

The union of white country and black gospel vocalists was intended to \"set an example of racial partnership\" in the wake of King's assassination, according to publicity, but both chains folded, in part because a major investor was financially embattled Tennessee gubernatorial candidate John Jay Hooker.\n\n107. About a dozen Memphis and Shelby County library titles — including \"Valley of the Dolls,\" \"Myra Breckenridge\" and \"Portnoy's Complaint\" — are placed off limits to readers under 18 in the summer of 1969 after Mayor Henry Loeb attended a library board meeting and \"shooed all women out of the room and read aloud passages he had underlined in red ink\" from \"Portnoy,\" according to The Commercial Appeal. Asked one board member: \"Is this book fit for women to read?\" After the newspaper's story appears, demand for \"Portnoy\" increases so much that the library orders 10 extra copies to join the five already in circulation.\n\n108. According to a report in The Commercial Appeal, Memphians on July 20, 1969, are so engrossed by the Apollo 11 moon landing that for a period of seven minutes water pressure rises so high from lack of usage that MLGW is forced to shut down all five main pumping stations.\n\n109.

Visionary Memphis State University theater director Keith Kennedy courts controversy and causes a sensation in March 1970 by staging a student production of Broadway's Age-of-Aquarius \"tribal love-rock\" musical, \"Hair\" — the first licensed production outside New York.

May 21, 1970: Inspired by the new availability of liquor-by-the-drink, Memphis investors open the first Friday's restaurant and bar outside of New York, spurring what would become the Overton Square-centered nightlife explosion of the next two decades.

Prior to that decision by Pope Paul VI, the entire state of Tennessee had been encompassed by the Diocese of Nashville.\n\n114. 1971: Outraged by the use of nude models and an exhibition of nude photography at Memphis College of Art (then known as the Academy of Art), brick mason Newton C. Estes kidnaps the 14-year-old son of art instructor Richard Batey, in order to force the school to remove the offending pictures. College officials quickly comply, and the boy is released unharmed two hours later.\n\n115. March 1971: In a victory for the citizens who organized to fight plans to extend Interstate 40 through Overton Park, the U.S. Supreme Court overturns decisions by district and appellate courts and rules that the federal Secretary of Transportation had failed to demonstrate the lack of “feasible and prudent” alternatives to the park route, as required by a 1966 highway bill intended to protect public spaces. The decision preserves the park.\n\n116. June 7, 1971: After years in Ellis Auditorium, professional wrestling relocates to the Mid-South Coliseum, attracting 9,253 fans for opening-night matches showcasing such suplex superstars as Tojo Yamamoto, Bearcat Brown, the Fabulous Moolah, Len Rossi and Sputnik Monroe.

April 20, 1972: U.S. District Judge Robert McRae Jr. orders the Memphis Board of Education to implement a desegregation plan that will require the busing of an estimated 13,789 students during the following school year.

In what comes to be regarded as a revolutionary moment in the history of photography, an exhibit of color work by William Eggleston goes on display on May 24, 1976, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, establishing the Memphis photographer as arguably the Bluff City's most influential artist outside the realm of music.\n\n125. Nov. 23, 1976: A pistol-toting and inebriated Jerry Lee Lewis is arrested after pulling up to the gates of Graceland in a new Lincoln Continental and demanding to see Elvis.

Hooks of Memphis becomes national executive director of the NAACP.\n\n127. Jan. 15, 1977: Three months after hitting No. 1 with his novelty dance hit \"Disco Duck,\" Memphis deejay Rick Dees — recording as \"Rick Dees and His Cast of Idiots\" — releases a follow-up single, \"Dis-Gorilla.\" Even an appearance on \"The Brady Bunch Hour\" that finds Dees introduced by the kids from \"What's Happening!!\" and performing in front of a pair of swinging King Kong arms couldn't lift the song above No. 56 on the Billboard pop charts.\n\n128. The Memphis in May International Festival is organized in 1977. The first \"honored country\" is Japan.\n\n129. Out of office less than five months, former president Gerald Ford sinks a hole-in-one during the June 1977 pro-am portion of the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic golf tournament at Colonial Country Club.

Nov. 15, 1977: Memphis-based \"Woolly Bully\" creator Sam the Sham releases \"The Wookie,\" a \"Star Wars\"-inspired would-be dance hit that celebrates Han Solo's furry sidekick, Chewbacca.

Hundreds of National Guardsmen are assigned to Memphis in the summer of 1978 after police officers and firefighters go on strike. On July 1, 1,400 firefighters walk off the job; that same day, 45 fires occur in four hours, inspiring a front-page editorial in The Commercial Appeal: \"The rash of vandalism and harassment that accompanied the strike is contrary to the public image of Memphis firemen. It comes as an ugly shock.\" The next month, police also go on strike.\n\n134. 1979: Adrian Rogers, senior pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church, is elected to the first of the three terms he will serve as president of the Southern Baptist Convention.

Organized by a coalition of bar owners, restaurateurs and devotees of blarney that calls itself \"Irish Eyes of Memphis,\" the St. Patrick's Day \"pub crawl\" reaches its bacchanalian height (or depth) in 1982, when an estimated 50,000 revelers stagger from Main Street to Overton Square in search of green-dyed beer. Legal fees and other complications eventually reduce the event to its current manageable form, a parade on Beale.\n\n146. 1982: The Mud Island river park opens to the public, complete with concert amphitheater and monorail transportation between the park and the \"mainland.\" Its most impressive aspect may be its \"Riverwalk,\" a scale reproduction of the 954 miles of the lower Mississippi River, with \"every sandbar, oxbow, and topographic contour faithfully reproduced in cement,\" according to Roadside America. Starting at \"Cairo, Illinois,\" the Riverwalk ends at a \"Gulf of Mexico\" that for several embarrassing years was rebranded as a Budweiser-sponsored water park named \"Bud Boogie Beach.\"\n\n147. When the New York Metropolitan Opera brings a touring performance of \"Macbeth\" that features a topless witch to the Auditorium North Hall on May 10, 1983, a group calling itself MASH — Memphians Against Social Harassment — stage a \"strip-in\" to protest the unequal enforcement of the city's anti-nudity ordinance.

The ordinance later is declared unconstitutional.\n\n148. \"Memphis — A Diamond in the Bluff'\" is the winning entry in a 1983 contest to pick a slogan for Memphis, sponsored by The Commercial Appeal and the Rotary Club.

Jan. 7, 1984: Restored to its former glory, The Orpheum — Main Street's historic \"palace\" of a theater — reopens with a public \"Champagne and Gershwin\" party. A harbinger of Downtown's revival, the theater was built in 1928, on the site of the Grand Opera House, which had burned to the ground in 1923.\n\n152. The bizarre and \"epic\" (in the characterization of The Commercial Appeal) Georgian Hills Day Care child sex abuse scandal dominates much of the news from 1984 to 1988 and results in the indictments of four adult workers in connection with the alleged molestations of at least 19 children. Eventually, all charges are dropped and the one conviction overturned, due in part to the implausibility of much of the testimony of the child witnesses (one boy said child victims were \"baptized to the devil\"). The investigation is now regarded as a textbook case of 1980s \"satanic panic.\"\n\n153. Sept. 5, 1986: In a predecessor to the current \"Mighty Lights\" display, the \"M\"-shaped structure of the Hernando de Soto Bridge (still referred to as \"the new bridge,\" if you're old) is illuminated with 200 sodium lights, following a fundraising campaign by fashion designer Pat Kerr Tigrett and developer Henry Turley.\n\n154. \"After we moved to Memphis, I don't recall Mother's ever once saying: 'A gentleman must always' do so and so. Or: 'A lady will never' do so and so ... The old delicate balance between her wild nature and her strict Presbyterian, genteel upbringing was gone in Memphis ... When we were all in the doldrums, she more than once said: 'I sometimes think a shooting in the family would have been better than a move to Memphis.'\" — Peter Taylor, \"A Summons to Memphis,\" which wins the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987.\n\n155. 1988: Michael Hooks becomes the first black candidate elected to countywide office when he wins the race for assessor.\n\n156. 1989: Self-promoting promoter Sidney Shlenker makes a deal to take over Mud Island, announcing plans to convert the river park to a $100 million entertainment complex called \"Rakapolis,\" a name intended to suggest ancient Egypt and modern rock 'n' roll. Rakapolis was to come complete with a huge crystal sphinx, a \"time machine\" ride and a re-created Egyptian village. Shlenker — who already had the contract to manage the then-under-construction Pyramid arena — predicts 3 million visitors a year. For some reason, people believe him. Eventually, local government has to sue to regain control of the attractions.\n\n157. Commodities trader Charles D. McVean invests about $8 million into the development of a new type of \"horse\" racing: indoor Hackney pony races with remote-controlled robots for jockeys, the reins attached to the robots' tiny metal arms. \"You put 10,000 people in here with a six-pack of beer apiece, and then by God you've got something!\" McVean told the Wall Street Journal, during a test run at the Fairgrounds in 1989. The state Racing Commission rejects the idea.\n\n158. Memphians are all shook up when the news media hypes \"self-proclaimed climatologist\" Dr. Iben Browning's prediction that a major earthquake will rock the New Madrid Fault on Dec. 3, 1990. When the much-feared date arrives, Memphis fails to shake, rattle, or even roll, at least tectonically.\n\n159. Writing in his book \"Rythm Oil\" in 1991, Stanley Booth sticks up for the Bluff City when confronted by skeptics: \"I told them that in this century, Memphis, Tennessee, had changed the lives of more people than any other city in the world. I used, I regret to report, the phrase 'cultural influence' ... I never had a chance to tell them that, like it or not, they had shopped at supermarkets, eaten at drive-in restaurants, slept in Holiday Inns, and heard the blues because people in Memphis had found ways to convert these things into groceries.\"\n\n160. July 4, 1991: Constructed around the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the National Civil Rights Museum is dedicated. It opens to the public in September 1991.\n\n161. Oct. 4, 1991: Former city schools superintendent W.W. Herenton is elected mayor, defeating incumbent Dick Hackett by 172 votes out of about 250,000 cast. (Proving joke candidates can make a difference, Robert \"Prince Mongo\" Hodges, who claimed to be a resident of a planet named Zambodia, received 2,921 votes.) The city's first elected black mayor, Herenton will be elected to five terms; he resigns in 2009 to pursue an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\n\n162. Memphis' distinctive Pyramid arena opens with a concert on Nov. 9, 1991. The headliners? The mother-and-daughter country act, the Judds.\n\n163. On Nov. 16, 1991, patrons burst like scalded cats from the doors of the Madison Avenue punk club, the Antenna, when shock rocker GG Allin lived up to his reputation and began flinging his own feces into the crowd. The cover charge: $5.\n\n164. \"They left Chickasaw Gardens and drove west with the traffic toward downtown, into the fading sun ... The warm, sticky, humid Memphis summer air settled in with the dark. Softball fields came to life as teams of fat men with tight polyester pants and lime-green and fluorescent-yellow shirts laid chalk lines and prepared to do battle. Cars full of teenagers crowded into fast-food joints to drink beer and gossip and check out the opposite sex.\" — John Grisham, \"The Firm,\" 1991.\n\n165. Lionel Linder, 60, editor of The Commercial Appeal since 1988, is killed in a 1992 New Year's Eve accident on Union Avenue when a drunk driver plows into his car. Linder spearheaded the campaign to bring President George H.W. Bush to Memphis in 1989 for an event on the newspaper's lawn, where Bush designated The CA as the first \"Point of Light\" in a program honoring the nation's volunteers.\n\n166. \"In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists of all time,\" wrote critic Leonard Feather. He was Phineas Newborn Jr., whose classic albums include \"A World of Piano!\" (1961) and \"The Newborn Touch\" (1964). He is found dead of natural causes at his Memphis home on May 26, 1989, at the age of 57.\n\n167. 1992: \"Several visitors to a zoo exhibit called 'Dinosaurs Live!' asked for refunds after discovering that dinosaurs ceased to roam the Earth 65 million years ago,\" the newspaper reports, in a story about zoo patrons who expected to find real live dinosaurs when they attended an exhibit that actually featured motorized mechanical replica dinosaurs. \"People have watched too much Fred Flintstone,\" says zoo vice president Ann Ball.\n\n168. Artist Carroll Cloar, 79, who had been suffering from cancer, dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 10, 1993. In The Commercial Appeal, critic Fredric Koeppel writes that the Arkansas-born Cloar \"drew on memories of rural life to compose canvases whose realism was tempered with touches of whimsy, folklore and mystery.\" Many of Cloar's paintings are on display at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art.\n\n169. Feb. 11, 1994: Memphians wake to the warzone-like cracks of explosive timber after the region is blanketed by a devastating ice storm that snaps trees — at least one person is killed by a falling limb — and cuts power to close to 425,000 MLGW customers, some of whom are without electricity for 17 days.\n\n170. On April 7, 1994, the crew of a Federal Express DC10 flight leaving Memphis overpowers a hammer-wielding company employee and safely lands the plane after a hijacking-suicide attempt by Auburn Calloway, 42, a pilot facing termination for falsifying his job application. Calloway is sentenced to life terms for attempted murder and attempted air piracy; he said he planned to crash the aircraft so his family could collect his $2.5 million life insurance policy.\n\n171. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University becomes the University of Memphis — the fifth name change since its founding in 1912 as the West Tennessee Normal School.\n\n172. Longtime WHBQ-TV kiddie-show host and toy store impresario Harold \"Happy Hal\" Miller, 74, dies on Nov. 28, 1997. From the 1950s to 1973, Miller was Memphis' answer to \"Captain Kangaroo\"; his hand-puppet sidekick was the blue-hued and taxonomically indeterminate \"Lil' Bow,\" described by Miller in a 1988 interview as a bow-tie-wearing \"cross between a mouse and a chipmunk-type thing.\"\n\n173. In 1998, University of Memphis student Kelly Chandler hangs a sheet on the wall of The Edge coffee shop in Cooper-Young and hosts a group of local filmmakers, who project their work on the sheet. This is the humble origin of what is now the region's largest film event, the Indie Memphis Film Festival.\n\n174. Downtown's gem of a baseball diamond, AutoZone Park, opens on April 1, 2000, with an exhibition game between the Memphis Redbirds and the St. Louis Cardinals.

Ben Affleck, Michael Jordan and Donald Trump are among the 15,327 who reportedly attend the Mike Tyson-Lennox Lewis heavyweight boxing match at the Pyramid on June 8, 2002.

In 2002, former Shelby County Public Defender A C Wharton is elected the first black mayor of Shelby County. In 2009, he is elected the 63rd mayor of Memphis, but he loses his 2015 re-election bid to Jim Strickland.\n\n178. During Elvis Week 2002, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, then at the height of his leonine majesty, sits atop the base of a large upwardly tilted silver \"rocket\" ship during the Elvis Beale Street parade. The suggestion that this man is the literal father of rock 'n' roll is hard to miss.\n\n179. Nicknamed \"Hurricane Elvis,\" the most damaging wind storm in Memphis history strikes on July 22, 2003, toppling trees and telephone poles, cutting service to 340,000 homes and businesses, and introducing Memphians to the term \"derecho,\" which refers to a type of devastating straight-line wind.\n\n180. After some five years of planning, the $250 million FedExForum opens to the public with a Sept. 6, 2004, \"open house.\"\n\n181.

A movie about a North Memphis hustler who \"dares to dream the pimpossible dream\" (to quote Time magazine), Craig Brewer's future Oscar-winner \"Hustle & Flow\" has its Memphis premiere at the now vanished Muvico Peabody Place 22 on July 6, 2005. Police report that some 6,000 \"well-behaved\" fans crowd the red carpet to see such celebrities as Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson; producer John Singleton; members of Three 6 Mafia; Brewer (“resplendent” in a Girbaud denim suit, gold Versace sunglasses, straw cowboy hat and a 3-carat diamond ring that had belonged to Sam Phillips); and — incongruously — martial-arts star Steven Seagal.\n\n183. In a spectacular blast that attracts hundreds of spectators, the 50-year-old Baptist Memorial Hospital on Union Avenue — where Elvis was declared dead, among other historic happenstances — is razed at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005, by the controlled detonations of 600 pounds of explosives placed on six of the building's 21 stories.\n\n184. March 5, 2006: Thirty-four years after Stax legend Isaac Hayes earned an Oscar in the same category for \"Theme from Shaft,\" Memphis hip-hop artists Jordan Houston (Juicy J), Paul Beauregard (DJ Paul) and Cedric Coleman (Frayser Boy) win the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp,\" their contribution to writer-director Craig Brewer's made-in-Memphis \"Hustle & Flow.\"\n\n185. Graceland is known for celebrity visitors, but on July 1, 2006, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visits Elvis' home in the company of President George W.

An off-course manatee appears on Oct. 24, 2006, in Wolf River Harbor, some 720 miles north of its usual coastal habitat.

April 9, 2011: Funeral services are held for former University of Memphis basketball player and coach Larry Finch, 60, arguably the most significant sports figure in local history.

May 23, 2015: The Memphis in May Sunset Symphony ends its 39-year annual run at Tom Lee Park. The event was perhaps best known for its 17 years of “Ol' Man River,” the \"Showboat\" tune that was a centerpiece of the symphony until the 1998 retirement of James Hyter, the sonorous-voiced singer who each year led thousands of riverside revelers in multiple singalong encores.\n\n194. In association with nationwide actions organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the police killings of black civilians, almost a thousand protesters shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River for close to four hours on July 10, 2016.\n\n195. Statues of Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest and Confederate president Jefferson Davis are removed from city parks on Dec. 20, 2017, following some political sleight of hand in which the city outfoxes statue advocates in the state legislature by selling the two parks to nonprofit Memphis Greenspace for $1,000 each.\n\n196.

The Alabama State Port Authority says it has signed a deal to build a $60 million automotive terminal in Mobile. It’s supposed to be ready early next year and will allow for vehicles to roll on and off ships. The 57-acre terminal will be able to handle 150,000 vehicles annually with connections to rail service and highways, officials say. Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Honda currently make cars in the state, and Mazda-Toyota is building a factory in north Alabama. A docks official says the new terminal will open a new business stream for the docks. The project is a joint venture between Terminal Zarate, S.A., a Grupo Murchison company based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Neltume Ports, based in Santiago, Chile.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Legislators have proposed changes to key elements of the state’s Village Public Safety Officer Program. About 1 in 3 communities in the state has no police of any kind, Anchorage Daily News reported last week in partnership with ProPublica. The Department of Justice subsequently declared the public safety gap a federal emergency, officials said. The 40-year-old program uses state money to train and pay officers working in remote villages, but the number of officers fell to a record-low 38 compared to the more than 100 in 2012, legislators in the working group said. The working group spent five months seeking ways to fix the program, which includes placing more certified officers in rural Alaska, increasing morale among current officers and retaining village-based first responders who know their communities best, legislators said.\n\nArizona\n\nQueen Creek: A company’s proposal to take water from farmland along the Colorado River and sell it to this growing Phoenix suburb has provoked a heated debate, and some Arizona legislators are trying to block the deal with a bill that would prohibit the transfer. The legislation introduced by Rep. Regina Cobb would bar landowners who hold “fourth-priority” water entitlements from transferring Colorado River water away from communities near the river. Cobb said this water was supposed to be used for agriculture, and diverting it elsewhere would harm farming communities along the river. “We just needed to get ahead of it and let them know that we’re not for this,” said Cobb, R-Kingman. Cobb said without legislation, she’s concerned hedge funds will try to make more deals to use farmlands for selling off water.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: Forrest L. Wood, who created one of the top brands in the boating industry and was a pioneer of bass tournament fishing, has died at age 87.

Wood was known as the “father of the modern bass boat.” Keith Daffron, his grandson, said in a Facebook post that Wood died Saturday surrounded by his family, after a brief illness. In a statement, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wood’s death “is a deeply sad moment for our entire state.” Former President Bill Clinton said in a statement that Wood was “ambitious and determined and Arkansas is a better place because he fully invested his time and his talents right here.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Former Gov.

Private letters and other items that had belonged to Edmund G. “Pat” Brown when he was governor are being offered by the auction house Sotheby’s, which estimates the value at $20,000 to $30,000. Sotheby’s says the seller wants to remain anonymous. The elder Brown, who died in 1996, was California’s top elected official from 1959 to 1967, and eight years later his son started the first of his record four terms as governor. Jerry Brown says he was not consulted or informed of the sale and believes the items should instead reside at the University of California, Berkeley, “with the rest of my father’s papers.” Sotheby’s touts Brown’s materials for sale as unique because “it comes from a single source” and “chronicles a country in mourning.” The auction opened Monday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dipped to 2.5% in December, the lowest level in at least 44 years. An unemployment rate of 2.6% in October and November tied the previous record-low rate in early 2017. The lowest rate before that, 2.7%, occurred in 2000, The Denver Post reports. Yuma and Kiowa counties in northeastern Colorado had the nation’s lowest seasonally unadjusted unemployment rate of 1.1% in December. Low unemployment is better than high unemployment but can make it hard for employers to find workers, economist Gary Horvath said. “We are in uncharted territory,” Horvath said. “I’m baffled by how companies are making this work.” Colorado has averaged about 84,000 job openings a month since 2001. Colorado had about 150,000 openings in September but only 85,000 people unemployed and seeking work, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Voters who are registered with one party but want to vote in a different party’s presidential primary are facing a key deadline. Secretary of the State Denise Merrill said those voters must change their registration by Tuesday. Voters can look up and check their current registration status online and make any changes at myvote.ct.gov/register. Unaffiliated voters, the state’s largest block of voters, have until April 23 to register with a party online, by mail or at the Department of Motor Vehicles if they want to participate in that party’s presidential primary. They have until April 27 to register in person. Connecticut’s Democratic and Republican presidential primary elections are scheduled for April 28. There are currently 2,192,828 active voters registered in Connecticut. Of those, 895,218 are registered as unaffiliated, 803,802 as Democrats, 459,403 as Republicans and 34,405 in some other party.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: This tiny coastal town’s environment committee held its first discussion last week on ways to reduce plastic intake. Committee members are in the early stages of suggesting various restrictions on plastic, from banning materials outright to putting a fee on others. Along with Wilmington and Newark, Rehoboth is the “farthest along” in reducing plastic use, like charging a fee for single-use bags, says Dee Durham, president of Plastic Free Delaware. The environment committee is eyeing single-use plastic bags, plastic straws and polystyrene, which Durham calls the “low-hanging fruit” of plastic products, meaning they are typically easier to restrict. Last year, state lawmakers chose to ban single-use plastic bags at large retailers. That law, which goes into effect in 2021, doesn’t really impact Rehoboth Beach because it generally applies only to stores 7,000 square feet or bigger or ones with three or more Delaware locations at least 3,000 square feet.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A male harbor seal considered geriatric for his species has died at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo. Luke, 35, was humanely euthanized last week, according to a statement. The zoo said he outlived the median life expectancy for his species – 25 years in the wild and 30 years in human care. Luke had been experiencing ocular discomfort and had trouble orienting himself recently, according to the zoo’s statement. He had also experienced a loss of appetite and an unusual lack of interest in training with keepers and socializing with other animals. Animal care staff decided to euthanize him after trying several methods to treat his symptoms. Luke was born June 17, 1984, at New York Aquarium in Brooklyn, and he came to the nation’s capital in 2011, the statement said. He didn’t father any pups, according to news outlets, but lived at the zoo’s American Trail habitat with another male harbor seal and a gray seal colony.\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples: Residents in an upscale community are seeing red over a paint job on a half-million-dollar home. The home was painted in large patches of extremely bright primary colors with random splatters throughout. The home in the Il Regalo Circle Community in Naples resembles a preschool play toy or cartoon home. Even the trees, lawn and mailbox were splattered with paint. Neighbors said the paint job got worse over the course of a week. WBBH News reports that Collier County Code Enforcement are investigating the paint job. Jeffrey Leibman, 40, is listed as the owner of the home, according to property appraiser records. Neighbors said he painted it, but the management company for the neighborhood said he no longer lives there. The company estimated that reversing the paint job could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp is proposing that the state borrow nearly $900 million for construction projects and equipment next year, an amount likely to rise before lawmakers get done with the budget. Key projects in the Republican governor’s plan include $70 million to expand the state-owned convention center in Savannah and $55 million to build a new headquarters for the Department of Public Safety in Atlanta. Lawmakers authorized borrowing of nearly $1.1 billion last year. The agency that forecasts Georgia’s borrowing said the state could issue up to $1.2 billion in bonds this year. In one shift, Kemp wants to move more funding to aid school construction from districts statewide to those that have small property tax bases. Kemp would borrow $155 million for construction in such low-wealth districts, up from $44 million this year.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State lawmakers have proposed initiatives to help reduce the number of traffic-related fatalities after transportation officials confirmed more than 100 deaths in the past year. Those initiatives include installing traffic cameras to capture drivers running red lights, and enforcing zero-tolerance policies for drinking and driving, Hawaii News Now reports. “Every year, you hear of a horrific pedestrian accident that’s occurring at an intersection because someone did not stop at a red light,” state House Speaker Scott Saiki said. The cameras would automatically record anyone who runs a red light, and a ticket would then be mailed to the address associated with the license plate number, officials said. “There could potentially be a bench warrant for someone who doesn’t appear or who doesn’t respond to the ticket,” Saiki said. “And if you have a bench warrant, potentially there could be some jail time.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two environmental groups have given notice that they intend to file a lawsuit to stop a proposed underground natural gas pipeline from Idaho to Wyoming that the groups say will harm protected grizzly bears and other wildlife. The Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Yellowstone to Uintas Connection sent a required 60-day notice to sue to the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last week. The groups contend the Forest Service’s approval of the pipeline project in November violated the Endangered Species Act. The groups also say the 18-mile portion of the 50-mile pipeline would cut a corridor through the Caribou-Targhee National Forest and create a road through six Inventoried Roadless Areas. The 2001 Roadless Rule prevents road construction and timber harvest in designated roadless areas, which are typically 5,000 acres or larger.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The story of a boy who grew up across the street from Abraham Lincoln’s family and later presided over one the nation’s larger retailers will be told in the annual George L. Painter Looking for Lincoln Lecture. Julius Rosenwald spent his formative years in the shadow of the future president and grew up to be president of Sears, Roebuck & Co. He used the fortune he amassed to help those who faced racial injustices. His life will be recalled as part of the annual lecture series at 8:30 a.m. Feb. 12 at the Lincoln Home National Historic Site. It’s presented with the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area, which preserves the history of the central Illinois communities touched by Lincoln’s life. The Rosenwald home, part of the Lincoln historic site, will be renamed in his honor and an exhibit panel about his life and legacy unveiled.\n\nIndiana\n\nJasper: A one-room schoolhouse where the last lessons were taught in early 1950s has been dismantled after efforts to find a buyer for the small building failed. The Dick School had educated generations of Dubois County residents in rural Jasper from 1892 to 1951. But a few weeks ago, the shed-like building was taken down piece by piece in the city about 40 miles northeast of Evansville. The weatherboard structure with a tin roof was moved to a new location after it was closed, and it had remained in good shape. Robin Pate, the current owner of the property on which it stood, had advertised the old schoolhouse and reached out to the Dubois County Historical Society. But Pate couldn’t find any takers for the school, which had been the region’s last functioning one-room schoolhouse, The (Jasper) Herald reports. She’s selling the 2-acre site on which the building stood.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: The leaking inflatable dam on the Cedar River in downtown Waterloo has been fixed, officials said. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports contractors found a slit in the half-inch-thick rubber and repaired it. Associate city engineer Wayne Castle said the final cost of the project will be significantly below the original $388,350 contract approved in November with J.F. Brennan Co., of La Crosse, Wisconsin. “We’re not completely done yet, but we should be just under $220,000,” Castle said. A major reason for the lower cost was that a marine contractor was able to use divers to inspect the riverbed on the downstream side of the dam, Castle said. The original contract anticipated the contractor building a more expensive wall around the inspection area. The city has inflated the bladder dam since 2009, raising the Cedar River level by about 4 feet to enhance boating. It’s usually inflated in June and deflated in October.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: An effort is underway to more fully tell the story of a boulder that was a sacred prayer rock for a Native American tribe before it was moved to Lawrence and inscribed with the names of the city’s founders. The Lawrence Journal-World reports Pauline Eads Sharp, who serves as secretary and treasurer of the Kanza Heritage Society, and Lawrence artist Dave Loewenstein are leading a wide-ranging team of people, including historians, geologists, artists and filmmakers, to increase interest in the 23-ton red quartzite Shunganunga boulder. At issue is that there currently is no mention on the boulder-turned-monument of the Kanza tribe, which was forcibly removed to Oklahoma in 1873. The approximately yearlong project, called Between the Rock and a Hard Place, will include research, community workshops and the creation of a documentary film and book.\n\nKentucky\n\nHopkinsville: A prosecutor has been absent from court in the weeks following the release of the letter in which he asked former Gov. Matt Bevin to pardon a man convicted of sexual abuse. Two judges in Christian County said there is an agreement between them and Commonwealth’s Attorney Rick Boling that he remain absent from their courtrooms for the “foreseeable future,” The Kentucky New Era reports. Dayton Jones was granted a commutation by Bevin on Dec. 9. The letter Boling wrote on official letterhead Dec. 7 asking the former governor to pardon Jones was released Jan. 9. Boling apologized after it was released. Jones pleaded guilty in 2016 to sodomy, wanton endangerment and distribution of matter portraying a sexual performance by a minor. Boling wrote in his letter to Bevin that the prosecution of Jones was politically motivated. He said the case involved intoxicated teenagers and people in their early 20s “being stupid and immature.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Fans of the late Louisiana author Ernest J. Gaines, who wrote such storied works as “A Lesson Before Dying” and “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” are gathering to remember his work as part of Black History Month celebrations. The Louisiana Center for the Book in the State Library of Louisiana is hosting the discussion Feb. 19, according to a news release from Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser. Gaines died Nov. 5, 2019. He grew up on a small Louisiana plantation, experiences that later translated into his rich literary characters. “A Lesson Before Dying,” published in 1993, was an acclaimed classic. Both “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman” (1971) and “A Gathering of Old Men” (1984) became honored television movies. The program will be hosted by Darrell Bourque, who is a two-time Louisiana poet laureate, a close friend of Gaines and a member of the Ernest J. Gaines Center.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The Finance Authority of Maine’s board on Monday approved loan guarantees and a loan necessary for a Boston investment group to proceed with purchasing Saddleback Mountain and reopening the area to skiers next winter. The board unanimously approved $2.5 million in loan insurance on a $12.5 million loan, which was smaller than the original request, along with a $1 million direct loan. Arctaris Impact Fund also raised private funds and received a separate $1 million loan through the Maine Rural Development Association. The finance authority and rural development funds will be part of a $23.5 million funding package that includes private equity, new market tax credits, community loans, and community grants for the purchase of Saddleback, officials said. Bruce Wagner, CEO of FAME, said the agency is pleased to “help restart this historic and beloved Maine ski mountain.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Singer and recording artist CeCe Peniston – who released her signature dance hit, “Finally,” in 1991 – will be the headline entertainer and grand marshal for the city’s first organized LGBTQ+ pride celebration, according to Salisbury’s branch of PFLAG, the United States’ first and largest LGBTQ+ ally organization. The city made the announcement in a video on Facebook. The lovably corny clip features Mayor Jake Day vibing to Peniston’s “Finally” in the city government offices. Peniston rose to fame in the early 1990s, when she rapidly become one of the most successful dance club artists in the history of the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play Charts, according to her official website. Salisbury PFLAG announced the city’s inaugural Pride Parade and Festival on National Coming Out Day last October. The event is set for 11 a.m. Sunday, June 7.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state has received more than $160 million from federal immigration authorities since 2012, most of which went to four county jails in exchange for housing and transporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, according to a report in The Boston Sunday Globe that cited documents obtained through a public records request. Advocates and immigration attorneys oppose the agreements with the jails. They say the payments are a waste of taxpayer money, and there are better alternatives to deal with people facing federal immigration charges. The sheriff’s offices for Plymouth, Bristol, Franklin, and Suffolk counties that run the jails have defended the arrangements, with at least two saying their relationship with ICE has made Massachusetts safer. But Matt Cameron, a Boston-based immigration lawyer, said there was “no good public safety justification” for local sheriff’s departments to house ICE detainees.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Home values are projected to increase by an average of 20% across most of the city’s neighborhoods, according to Mayor Mike Duggan. Residential assessments for 2020 also show that property values are up 30% in several parts of the city. The city said that the figures are based on two years of actual market sales and that homeowners are protected by a 2% cap on property tax increases as long as ownership has not changed. Property owners can appeal assessments until Feb. 22. Detroit residential property values rose an average of 13% last year. “This is great news for Detroit homeowners, particularly those who held on to their properties and stayed in the city,” Duggan said. “Home values in nearly every neighborhood are rising and helping to build new wealth, without significant tax increases. This shows as clearly as anything that the city’s revitalization has reached nearly every corner of our city.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The city has planted hundreds of trees in the past few years in an effort to green up downtown, but many aren’t surviving past their first year. City staff have been trying to figure out why, and they think they might have found the culprit: salt. Soil tests show that salinity levels in some of the planting spots are much higher than what’s ideal for trees to thrive, said Ben Shardlow, director of urban design for the Minneapolis Downtown Council and the Downtown Improvement District. Salt is used liberally in downtown Minneapolis to keep sidewalks and parking lots clear of ice. After the ice melts, the extra salt left behind piles up or gets pushed to the side – sometimes directly into the places where the trees are trying to grow. For three years in a row, a tree census showed only half of the trees the city planted had survived, Shardlow told Minnesota Public Radio News.\n\nMississippi\n\nIndianola: A historical marker will commemorate the legacy of civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer. Research for the project was led by a Mississippi Valley State University student and professor, the Greenwood Commonwealth reports. C. Sade Turnipseed is an associate professor of history, and 17-year-old Nigerian native Brian Diyaolu took her public history course during the fall semester. They recently received approval from the Sunflower County Board of Supervisors to place the Hamer sign in front of the county courthouse. It will be unveiled during a ceremony March 27. Students in Turnipseed’s course are assigned a historical topic, and Diyaolu’s was Hamer. He said he wrote three drafts of the historical marker’s narrative before pitching the idea to the supervisors. He said other students helped him edit the narrative and prepare the presentation. Hamer was born to sharecroppers in Montgomery County on Oct. 6, 1917.\n\nMissouri\n\nCreve Coeur: The St. Louis Holocaust Museum & Learning Center will triple in size with an $18 million expansion as officials seek to reach even deeper into issues of bias, bigotry and hate. Details about the expansion were announced Monday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Officials hope to make the building more visible and accessible. The museum, in the suburb of Creve Coeur and operated by the Jewish Federation of St. Louis, draws 30,000 annual visitors, about two-thirds of whom are students. Admission is free. Museum officials are in touch with about 30 Holocaust survivors who live in the St. Louis area. Monday’s announcement came on International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. The museum’s new executive director, Sandra Harris, says groundbreaking will be in May, and the goal is to finish by the end of 2021.\n\nMontana\n\nIsmay: U.S. Postal Service officials say mail service will resume in this town where a fire destroyed the post office. The fire in early January has prompted some residents of Ismay to worry about their mail. Since the fire, they’ve taken turns dropping off and picking up mail in a town almost 20 miles away. Postal officials plan to put a mailbox in a community center in tiny Ismay, population 20, Postal Service spokesman James Boxrud says. Meanwhile, property owners Rita and Gene Nimitz tell the Billings Gazette they’re making tentative plans to rebuild the post office, which dated to the 1920s. A faulty furnace or electrical wiring is believed to have started the blaze.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The city’s school district is about to take a major step in the recovery from a fire that destroyed the district office more than eight years ago. The school board is expected to vote next month on a nearly $1.15 million construction project agreement to build a backup data center, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. It’ll be constructed in the basement of the building built to replace the office burned in May 2011. The blaze was started by a disgruntled teacher who was later sentenced to prison for arson. The fire wiped out nearly everything in the building, including severely damaging the computer system that held email servers, grades, payroll and other records. District officials worked with University of Nebraska-Lincoln information technology staff to get the data system back online. The district built an off-site data center near Lincoln High School about a year later. The district wants the backup data center finished this summer.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Local tourism officials have canceled several activities tied to the launch of a new city slogan in the wake of basketball star Kobe Bryant’s death. A 60-second spot touting the “what happens here, only happens here” campaign aired during the Grammy Awards as planned Sunday night, but other plans were postponed. The new slogan is a play on the longtime saying that “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.” The city had intended to display the new slogan on more than two dozen hotel and casino marquees on and around the Strip. Instead, most resorts showed messages of grief. They included “L.A., OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO YOU” and “#RIPKOBE.” Steve Hill, CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, said all the planned activities will take place at a future date. But Bryant, his daughter and the other lives lost in a helicopter crash were too much on everyone’s minds.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State health officials are seeking input on whether the state needs a residential treatment facility for youth with mental health and addiction issues. The Department of Health and Human Services has issued a request for information about the opportunities and challenges associated with establishing a psychiatric facility that would provide the highest level of care next to an acute psychiatric hospital. The state’s only youth drug and alcohol treatment center closed last month after a spate of nonfatal overdoses. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu says a new facility would ensure that young people struggling with addiction, mental illness or both get the right level of care in a safe environment. The deadline for submitting information is Feb. 24.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nGalloway Township: Gov. Phil Murphy unveiled a sweeping energy plan Monday that sets goals for shifting the state to 100% clean energy by 2050. The first-term Democratic governor announced the plan at Stockton University alongside two Cabinet officials who will be carrying the plan out, Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Catherine McCabe and Board of Public Utilities President Joe Fiordaliso. Murphy cast climate change as an urgent concern and pointed to a Rutgers study that indicated the state could see 1 foot of sea level rise in the next decade. “Quite frankly it will be hard for future generations to create their Jersey Shore memories if the Jersey Shore is only a memory,” Murphy said. The plan calls for reducing the use of fossil fuels while increasing renewable sources of energy. New Jersey currently gets 94% of its electricity from natural gas and nuclear plants, according to the U.S. Energy Department.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A former state lawmaker’s emu that has been missing since Thanksgiving is safely back at its home near the city. Former state Rep. Brad Cates learned his emu had resurfaced last week thanks to a barrage of images people shared on social media. Pictures of the large bird around a subdivision near Cates’ home prompted inquiries from a state livestock inspector and a game warden. Later Sunday, Cates with some help corralled the 150-pound emu named “Hey You!” Cates was also the Republican nominee for Dona Ana County district attorney in 2016. He lost to Mark D’Antonio.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State taxpayers could decide to contribute to a fund that helps pay for abortions under a proposed bill. State Sen. Alessandra Biaggi and Assemblymember Karines Reyes say their bill would create an abortion access fund to which taxpayers could voluntarily contribute when they file their personal income tax returns. The Democrats say the fund’s money would go to not-for-profit groups that provide financial and logical assistance to individuals seeking abortion care. The Legislature passed a sweeping law last year to protect a right to abortion care in New York in case of changes on the federal level. Lawmakers could consider passing the latest bill this year before they depart in early June. The bill would also require a report to lawmakers and the governor about the amount of money deposited in the abortion access fund and how it was spent. The state wouldn’t be able to request the names of anyone who sought money from the fund.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: Three months after a set of anonymous, threatening, racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic emails sent a wave of fear through the sociology department at Wake Forest University, the department chairman says he’s still waiting for university leaders to announce a meaningful response. The emails to faculty in sociology and two other departments called for a “purge” of minorities and the LGBTQ community. Alarmed by what he deemed white supremacist terrorism, chairman Joseph Soares canceled sociology classes for a week. When they resumed, Wake Forest police officers were stationed outside classrooms and the building itself. Doors normally open were closed and locked. Even a study lounge was locked. “It was the most stressful experience of my academic life,” said Soares, who began his college teaching career in 1991 and has taught at Wake Forest since 2003. “My faculty were afraid.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A massive 1984 diesel spill in Mandan, North Dakota, has finally been cleaned up. State officials said the cleanup at a rail yard in downtown Mandan was complicated because of limited access to the affected area, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Workers collected about 770,000 gallons of fuel over the years, said Dave Glatt, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. “It’s pretty much gone,” Glatt said at a Wednesday meeting. “It seems like a long time, but when you look at, in a downtown area where access is limited, we had 4 to 6 feet on top of the groundwater in some areas. This is a success.” Burlington Northern ran the rail yard when the spill was found in 1984, but BNSF Railway runs it now.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Cheetahs from the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden will have about 5 acres of open terrain where they can run at a facility anticipated to be completed this summer. The cheetahs will be transported from the zoo in suburban Cincinnati in custom, built-in van crates to the “Cheetah Run” at the zoo’s Bowyer Farm in Warren County. The animals will have the space to run but will not be required to do so, said zoo spokeswoman Michelle Curley. Zoning records indicate some residents raised safety concerns, but the Warren County Board of Zoning and Appeals approved the plan last year. The tree-lined “Cheetah Run” project will be enclosed by a fence. Zoo officials have no safety concerns, said Mark Fischer, vice president of facilities, planning and stability for the zoo. He said the cheetahs, raised by humans and dogs, are “docile” and “timid.” Fisher said the run will be fun for the cheetahs – Tommy, Nia, Savanna, Donni, Cathryn, Willow, Redd, and Kris – and give them space to stretch their legs.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A prosecutor has been arrested, accused of domestic abuse. Robert McClatchie, an Oklahoma County assistant district attorney, was booked into Oklahoma County jail about 4 a.m. Saturday on complaints of domestic abuse by strangulation and domestic abuse in the presence of a minor child. Jail records also did not list an attorney for him. District Attorney David Prater said in a statement that McClatchie “will remain in jail until he is released by a judge or when his bond is posted after a judge sets his bond, like any other person arrested on a domestic abuse charge.” Prater said he’s “not intervening in this matter in any way.” He said the case will be assigned by the attorney general to another district attorney to assist Oklahoma City police in their investigation “and ultimately, make a charging decision.”\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: Local police now have an extra set of eyes with them. Each of Pendleton’s 24 sworn police officers has been equipped with body cameras that will record each call of service to which they respond, the East Oregonian reports. “Certainly, the preservation of evidence in real time is something you can’t replace,” Police Chief Stuart Roberts said. The cameras are located on the officers’ left breast pocket and attached using a magnetic plate. Officers must double tap the camera to activate it when responding to a call. The program joins Pendleton police with departments in Boardman and Hermiston as the only agencies with body cameras in Northeast Oregon. All footage collected by the department will be held for a minimum of 180 days, and anything that is a part of an investigation or court case will be held for an additional 30 months, officials said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Former Mayor Stephen Reed, who served for almost three decades but was later sentenced to probation for accumulating Wild West artifacts he bought with public money for a museum that was never built, has died. He was 70. A statement from the family reported by PennLive.com said Reed died Saturday “surrounded by his family.” “Reed was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006 and fought it courageously,” the statement said. Reed served seven terms but lost the 2009 primary amid criticism over the millions of dollars he had spent on museum-related items. He and city officials scoured the country for artifacts that would stock the museum, which he had called part of a wider plan to make the city a museum destination for tourists. He pleaded guilty in 2017 to 20 counts of receiving stolen property and was sentenced to two years of probation. Reed apologized and told the judge he took responsibility for his actions, calling his prosecution “a gut-wrenchingly humiliating” process.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo wants to reform the state’s criminal justice system through a series of proposals in her budget and administrative actions. The Democratic governor released a nearly $10.2 billion state budget plan this month. The Legislature will review the proposals and present its plan before the 2021 fiscal year begins in July. The budget includes recommendations from Raimondo’s working group on criminal and juvenile justice. Among them, the proposal seeks to improve discharge planning, shift staffing to improve access to health care, update the parole statute to include geriatric parole and provide incestives for work release programs. Raimondo is also looking to bring her signature workforce training program to prisons.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Residents who want to vote in the state’s Democratic presidential primary next month face a deadline to register this week. The State Election Commission said all voters for the Feb. 29 primary must be registered by Thursday. The first-in-the-South presidential primary is open, which means a voter does not have to be a registered Democrat to cast a ballot. People who are 17 years old can vote in the primary as long as they will be 18 by Election Day on Nov. 3. Registration forms can be downloaded at scvotes.org, and residents can also check to see if their South Carolina registration is current. Voters can also register at their county registration offices. Republicans will not have a presidential primary in South Carolina as President Donald Trump runs for reelection.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster State Park: After the near-decimation of the Custer State Park bighorn sheep herd, wildlife managers are now seeing the group as a success story, the Black Hills Pioneer reports. In 2004 the herd was 200-plus animals strong when members contracted mycoplasma ovipneumoiae, a pneumonia-causing bacteria that killed 70-80% of the animals. Since that time, the adults in the herd obtained an immunity to the bacteria, but the lambs suffered – most died from the disease within months, and on a good year, one would survive. Some wildlife managers even began discussions about destroying the remaining 20-25 animals and starting over with disease-free sheep. Then, three years ago, biologists discovered that only three of the bighorns shed the pathogens responsible for the die-off. Those were removed from the herd, and the population rebound began. The first lambing year, eight of the nine born in the park survived.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A new $200 million Amazon distribution center in the city’s Raleigh neighborhood will employ 1,000 workers and should be up and running in time for this year’s holiday season, officials said Monday. With the building’s skeleton and yellow bulldozers in the background, Amazon officials and state and local politicians gathered at the busy construction site in north Memphis to provide details about the project. Workers will make at least $15 per hour as they pack and ship books, electronics and other consumer goods alongside Amazon’s robots, officials said. At 855,000 square feet – the equivalent of 14 football fields – the order fulfillment center will be Amazon’s third in Memphis. The company employs about 6,500 people in Tennessee, Amazon officials said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Local police are inviting people to drop off their unwanted firearms and ammunition, with no questions asked, Tuesday at an East Austin police substation. This is the first of several gun surrender events this year, police said. On Tuesday, people can drop off these items from 3 to 8 p.m. at the Robert T. Martinez Central East Substation. “No questions asked” means police will not attempt to identify those who drop off guns, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said. “We merely want to get weapons that are no longer wanted off the streets, out of homes, and destroyed so they don’t end up potentially in the wrong hands if there was to be a burglary,” Manley said. “This is a service we want to provide for the community.” Austin police will host similar programs throughout the year on April 28, July 28 and Oct. 27.\n\nUtah\n\nLogan: An event straight out of the Old West is attracting more people with its mountain-man appeal, organizers said. About 50 people gathered in Blacksmith Fork Canyon to compete in the state-organized biathlon – an event combining cross-country skiing and sharpshooting – that features muzzleloader guns, the Herald Journal reports. Many wore traditional mountain-man gear to the event this month dubbed Willy Wapiti’s Smoke Pole Biathlon at Hardware Ranch, which is surrounded by snow-capped mountains and populated by hundreds of elk. Shooters raced along a snowy trail, with or without snowshoes, to five separate shooting stations. Prizes like electronic earmuffs, knives and fire starters were given to the best score out of 10, said Rachael Tuckett, a wildlife recreation specialist with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, which organized the event. Prizes also are given for the best mountain man outfit. The event has grown by 40% since last year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The completion of a 93-mile rail trail across northern Vermont would help link an ever-expanding network of recreation trails across New England and beyond, advocates say. The effort got a big boost last week when Republican Gov. Phil Scott asked lawmakers to approve $2.8 million as the state’s share of the estimated $14.1 million cost of completing the remaining 60 miles of the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail. It runs from Swanton, near the Canadian border, to St. Johnsbury, not far from the Connecticut River border with New Hampshire. The 30-mile section of the trail currently open is already benefiting businesses and the communities that people visit so they can use it, officials say. Trail advocates say completing one section of the trail boosts other nearby trails.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: The post office where survivors reunited after a mass shooting in a government office building now is named after the man who gave his own life for his co-workers. A plaque was unveiled Friday honoring Ryan Keith Cox at the post office that now bears his name, The Virginian-Pilot reports. Cox was one of 12 people who died in the mass shooting last May 31 at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center. “We are a city of heroes, and Keith is a perfect example of one of them,” Mayor Bobby Dyer said during the ceremony. In interviews, Cox’s co-workers have said he ushered women into a room and told them to barricade the door. Cox then left to see if anyone else needed help. The gunman and shot and killed him soon after that. Cox, 50, had been an account clerk in Virginia Beach’s public utilities department for 12 years.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A school district has warned parents about a potentially dangerous “penny challenge” spreading on social media. The Tacoma School District said a middle school student in the district took part in the online trend last week, KOMO-TV reports. The school district provided a photo of a burned electrical wall outlet resulting from the penny challenge. No injuries were reported. Social media users are challenged to record a video of themselves sliding a penny between a partially plugged-in cellphone charger and a wall outlet, officials said. Users are asked to film and post the results on the TikTok video-sharing channel. Placing a penny across an active electrical connection will create sparks that can damage the outlet and potentially start a fire and cause injury, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Projects involving sites listed in the National Register of Historic Places are eligible to apply for historic preservation development grants through the West Virginia Historic Preservation Office. Projects should involve the restoration, rehabilitation or archaeological development of historic sites, the state Department of Arts, Culture and History said in a news release. Approximately $369,000 is expected to be available for the grants, depending on appropriations from Congress or the Legislature. Privately owned properties are only eligible where there is evidence of public support or public benefit, the release said. Governmental properties that aren’t accessible to the public are not eligible for funding. Applications must be postmarked by March 31.\n\nWisconsin\n\nLa Crosse: For nearly a century and a half, the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration have said prayers every hour of every day in their chapel in La Crosse. But next month that practice will be coming to an end. The sisters have announced that after a dozen years of study and reflection, they will begin to cut back their prayer ritual, which began in 1878, to 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. daily. In 1997, prayer partners were invited to take the daytime hours while sisters living at St. Rose Convent continued the night hours. As demographics continued changing in the early 2000s, the sisters began studying the future of the practice. “Our thoughtful study over the years has included a growing understanding of a modern way to live in adoration through our prayer lives and actions, no matter where we are,” said FSPA President Eileen McKenzie.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The city’s police don’t have the authority to enforce the new federal law that increased the legal age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21, the agency says. Officers can only legally enforce state laws and Cheyenne city ordinances, spokesman David Inman says. He says city officials posted the clarification on Facebook because they’d been receiving calls from residents and local businesses. Nonetheless, it’s still illegal for someone under the age of 21 to purchase products containing tobacco or nicotine, including vaping products. The Legislature is expected to consider a bill that would change state law to match the new federal law on tobacco sales. If it passes, Inman said the city would likely pass a similar ordinance, and then police would have the power to enforce it.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/28"}]}

Winners will be announced starting at 9 p.m. ET/6 PT.\n\nThe ceremony, which will also spotlight the HFPA's philanthropy efforts, will not have a live audience due to the recent surge in coronavirus cases around the U.S. The select HFPA members in attendance will need to present a negative PCR test along with proof of COVID-19 vaccination and booster dose, a news release says.\n\nUS COVID-19 map: Tracking cases and deaths\n\nAccording to Variety, efforts by talent bookers to secure celebrity presenters for this year's ceremony were unsuccessful.

The investigation also revealed more than 30 members were given a swanky trip to Paris paid for by the producers of Netflix's \"Emily in Paris\" prior to the show, which has received mixed reviews but shocked with two Globe nominations last year.\n\nAfter the shortcomings of the organization became public, HFPA unveiled a slew of reformative changes including new codes and bylaws and in October inducted 21 new voters that HFPA describes as its \"most diverse class to date.\"\n\nCOVID delays: Grammys postpone January awards show due to omicron surge\n\nAre the Golden Globes being boycotted?\n\nWhile there isn't an organized boycott, many top-flight film and TV companies, including Netflix, Amazon and WarnerMedia, as well as Golden Globe-winning actor Tom Cruise, distanced themselves from the organization and the Globes after the governing body's lack of diversity came to light.\n\n\"Mission: Impossible\" star Cruise returned his three Golden Globe trophies to the HFPA in May in response to the organization's turmoil. The trophies included two best actor Globes (\"Jerry Maguire\" and \"Born on the Fourth of July\") and one best supporting actor award (\"Magnolia\").\n\nWill viewers be able to watch the Golden Globes?\n\nThis year's ceremony will not be broadcast in any form.\n\nA spokesperson for the HFPA confirmed to USA TODAY that following NBC's decision last year to drop the broadcast, the ceremony won't livestream.

But the erotic drama has polarized audiences and didn’t exactly light up the Christmas box office, either, and the 17-time SAG nominee was ultimately passed over this year.\n\nSebastian Stan\n\nThe Marvel star won a well-deserved best comedy actor trophy at Sunday’s Globes for “A Different Man,” dovetailing with his nomination for best drama actor for Donald Trump biopic “The Apprentice.” So it’s strange, then, that he was completely shut out at SAG. Is a Trump film too noxious for most actors? Or did both movies simply split votes? We’re guessing some combo of both.\n\n'The Brutalist'\n\n“The Brutalist,” a 3½ hour labor of love about a post-war designer and his American journey, won big at the Globes, nabbing not only best drama but also best actor for star Adrien Brody and best director for Brady Corbet. But only Brody earned a nomination from SAG: The cast was shut out of best ensemble, as were Guy Pearce and Felicity Jones in supporting actor and actress categories (both were nominated at the Globes).\n\nSelena Gomez\n\n“Emilia Pérez” had a big morning, landing three nominations: best ensemble, plus best actress for Karla Sofía Gascón and supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña, who won a Globe for her performance. But Gomez was overlooked after being nominated at Globes.\n\nHugh Grant\n\nThe curmudgeonly British heartthrob has become a shockingly formidable awards contender this season for “Heretic,” playing a reclusive chatterbox who holds Mormon missionaries captive in his basement. But the horror thriller’s outlandish second hour may have alienated SAG voters, who skipped over Grant despite Golden Globe and Critics Choice nods.\n\nStanley Tucci\n\n“Conclave” has been an unlikely viral sensation and awards favorite, picking up nominations for Ralph Fiennes at every turn. Tucci was seemingly along for the ride in his role as a liberal cardinal, but missed at SAG for the soapy papal melodrama.\n\nGlen Powell\n\nThe “Hit Man” star has pummeled us with charm for the last nine months, carting his parents and pooch to every conceivable stop on the promotional trail. Powell scooped up a best actor Globe nod for the stranger-than-fiction crime caper, but his luck ran out when SAG nominations rolled around.\n\nMarianne Jean-Baptiste\n\nWe’ve been banging the drum all season long for Jean-Baptiste, who is equal parts hilarious and devastating in Mike Leigh’s character study “Hard Truths.” The British veteran has been a hit with critics – winning best actress prizes from New York and Los Angeles groups – but her film has otherwise struggled to gain eyeballs ahead of its Jan. 10 release in theaters.\n\nFernanda Torres\n\nThe Brazilian icon surprised at this year’s Golden Globes, where she bested A-listers Angelina Jolie, Kate Winslet and Nicole Kidman for the best drama actress prize for “I’m Still Here.” Sadly, her stirring work has gone unseen by stateside audiences – the film's limited release is Jan. 17 – and she was blanked in Wednesday’s SAG nominations.\n\nClarence Maclin and 'Sing Sing'\n\nKieran Culkin has been steamrolling awards season with his flashy turn in dramedy “A Real Pain.” We thought Maclin might be able to overtake him with his naturalistic work in “Sing Sing,” but after snubs from SAG and the Golden Globes, the first-time movie actor may be out of the supporting actor race. The movie missed out on best ensemble as well, receiving just one nod for Colman Domingo in best actor.\n\nKate Winslet\n\nWar movie “Lee” came and went in theaters last fall, but that hasn’t stopped Winslet from tirelessly campaigning for her passion project. Her appearance in the Globe nominations and on BAFTA's long list made some pundits think she could pull an Andrea Riseborough, who netted a shocking Oscar nod for the similarly underseen “To Leslie.” Alas, Winslet’s name was missing from this year’s SAG nominations.\n\nAunjanue Ellis-Taylor\n\nWe get it. “Nickel Boys” is a tough film to market, with its disturbing subject matter and unorthodox point of view (shot almost entirely from a first-person perspective). Still, Amazon MGM Studios has dropped the ball on getting the drama in front of audiences. After her unjust snub for last year’s “Origin,” Ellis-Taylor was once again passed over for her poignant work here.\n\nKingsley Ben-Adir\n\nIn a year of lousy music biopics, “Bob Marley: One Love” wasn’t actually half-bad. Paramount tried to remount an Oscar campaign for Ben-Adir as the reggae icon, but the film has been all but forgotten by most voters since last February’s release.\n\nFelicity Jones\n\nThe British actress stars in one of this season’s biggest awards heavyweights, “The Brutalist,” and her co-star Adrien Brody earned a SAG nom for best actor. But Jones only appears in the less-liked second half of the 3½-hour drama, which may have contributed to her snub here.\n\n‘September 5'\n\nThe nail-biting thriller has been well-liked by critics since its premiere at Venice Film Festival, recounting the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre from a journalists’ perspective. But the movie’s release has been botched with an endless rollout in theaters, and the ensemble drama has struggled to cut through the noise with most awards bodies, including SAG.\n\n‘Saturday Night'\n\nOn paper, Jason Reitman’s latest should be Oscar catnip, with its zippy behind-the-scenes look at “Saturday Night Live,” featuring a game cast of rising Hollywood stars including Gabriel LaBelle, Cooper Hoffman and Rachel Sennott. Despite a hyperbolic festival reception, the comedy quickly fizzled after bombing at the box office and underperforming in precursor awards.\n\nContributing: Marco della Cava and Kim Willis", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2025/02/03/did-taylor-swift-win-any-grammys-2025-grammy-awards-presenter-nominee-beyonce-album-of-the-year-ttpd/78179133007/", "title": "Taylor Swift was nominated in six categories at the 2025 Grammys ...", "text": "After ending her record-setting international Eras Tour, which she brought to Indianapolis for three shows in November, Taylor Swift attended the Grammy Awards Sunday night but went home empty-handed despite being nominated for awards in six categories.\n\nSwift — who released her eleventh studio album, \"The Tortured Poets Department\" while on tour— presented the award for Best Country Album to Beyoncé and was photographed dancing the night away.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nWhile Swift was nominated in six categories this year, she did not win any Grammys.\n\nHer nominations were:\n\nAlbum of the Year, \"The Tortured Poets Department\"\n\nSong of the Year for \"Fortnight\" featuring Post Malone\n\nRecord of the Year: \"Fortnight\" featuring Post Malone\n\nBest Pop Duo/Group Performance: \"Us\" with Gracie Abrams\n\nBest Pop Vocal Album: \"The Tortured Poets Department\"\n\nBest Music Video: \"Fortnight\" featuring Post Malone\n\nAlbum of the Year went to Beyoncé's \"Cowboy Carter.\" Song of the Year, Record of the Year and Best Music Video, went to Kendrick Lamar for \"Not Like Us.\" Best Pop Duo/Group Performance went to Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars for \"Die With A Smile\" and Best Pop Vocal Album went to Eras Tour opener Sabrina Carpenter for \"Short n' Sweet.\"\n\nAlthough she didn't add any new hardware to her collection on Sunday, Swift already has 14 Grammy Awards and has been nominated 58 times throughout her career.\n\nMore on Taylor Swift: Taylor Swift releases her eleventh studio album \"The Tortured Poets Department\"\n\nSwift was a presenter at the 2025 Grammy Awards for Country Album of the Year, an award she herself won back in 2010.\n\n\"Hi, they say you never forget where you came from and I will never forget standing here, right on this spot, almost exactly 15 years ago accepting the Grammy Award for best country album,\" Swift said. \"It's an honor that has gone to artists that I admire so much like the Chicks, Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn, George Strait, Faith Hill, Vince Gill, Alison Krauss and Shania Twain.\"\n\nSwift presented the award to Beyoncé for her album \"Cowboy Carter.\" Beyoncé also took home the night's top prize for Album of the Year.
