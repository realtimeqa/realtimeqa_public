This story includes details of the shocking twist at the end of the papal thriller \"Conclave\" (in theaters now), so look away if you plan to see the movie first.\n\n\"Conclave\" is less a movie about the Catholic Church than it is a thrilling procedural in the vein of legendary tick-tock epics ― think \"All the President's Men\" about the 1972 Watergate break-in and coverup ― that were long admired by its director, Edward Berger.\n\nBut \"Conclave\" differs in onesignificant way: Its shocking ending, which echoes the 2016 Robert Harris thriller on which it's based. For anyone who's a fan of the 1992 crime thriller \"The Crying Game,\" the discovery toward the end of the movie left moviegoers gasping, at least at one festival screening several weeks back.\n\nJoin our Watch Party! Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox.\n\nDespite the out-of-left-field ending of \"Conclave,\" Berger says the big reveal is not meant to be the movie's centerpiece.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"You certainly don’t want to spoil things for people, but whether or not that (ending) is a secret is not that important,\" he tells USA TODAY. \"The movie doesn’t hinge on that reveal, because every character has their twists and surprises.\"\n\nHow does the plot set up the ending of 'Conclave'?\n\nIn the movie and the book, the 200-plus College of Cardinals has gathered at the Vatican after the death of the pope in order to elect his successor. The process is called a conclave, and is steeped in ritual and tradition.\n\nAs the voting begins inside the solemn Sistine Chapel, a number of high-profile cardinals are vying to be the new leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, some making cases for themselves quite stridently, including Cardinal Tedesco (Sergio Castellitto) and Cardinal Adeyemi (Lucian Msamati). One cardinal who does not want the post is Cardinal Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes), dean of the College of Cardinals, despite encouragement by Cardinal Bellini (Stanley Tucci).\n\nWho is Cardinal Benitez in 'Conclave'?\n\nThe wild card who ultimately upends the conclave is the mysterious and contemplative Cardinal Benitez (Carlos Diehz), who arrives late to the proceedings. Although he appears to hail from Latin America, Benitez explains to his fellow cardinals that he has been posted, apparently by the pope himself, to a variety of far-flung and usually dangerous place. Most recently he has been ministering to Catholics under siege in Afghanistan.\n\nBenitez repeatedly votes for Lawrence, who shares his growing anger at this gesture given his own questions about faith and desire to perhaps even leave the church. But Benitez persists, explaining that Lawrence has the virtues necessary to lead the faithful, unlike some of their fellow cardinals who seem to want the job for its power and status.\n\nWhy does Cardinal Lawrence investigate Cardinal Benitez in 'Conclave'?\n\nCardinal Benitez comes under the scrutiny of Cardinal Lawrence, who is running the conclave. Lawrence is puzzled by unearthed documents suggesting the late pope had approved Benitez's trip from Afghanistan to Switzerland for a medical procedure.\n\nThis fact jumps to the fore after a series of literal and philosophical explosions rock the cardinals, and days into the conclave they finally and overwhelmingly elect their new leader: Cardinal Benitez. Lawrence is happy about the result, but is concerned that perhaps the medical trip hints that the newly elected pope is ill and won't last long. In secret, he presses his direct reports to dig into the details of that trip.\n\nWhat is the shocking ending of 'Conclave'?\n\nIf you've made it this far, and still haven't seen the movie, you clearly want to know what happens at the end of \"Conclave.\" So be it.\n\nLawrence interrupts Benitez's preparations for being announced as the new pope, and demands he be told why Benitez was given a trip to Switzerland, even though he never made the journey. Lawrence thinks perhaps Benitez has a terminal illness, but instead is told the procedure would have removed his uterus. Benitez is intersex, having reproductive parts that don't fit the traditional definition of male or female.\n\n\"What are you?\" Lawrence asks.\n\nBenitez smiles and answers: \"I am as God made me.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/959699/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-16-february-2023", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 16 February 2023 | The Week", "text": "1. Search for Sturgeon successor begins\n\nThe search for a new First Minister of Scotland is underway after Nicola Sturgeon decided to stand down. The SNP leader, who made the surprise announcement after more than eight years in the job, plans to remain in office until her successor is elected. Among those tipped to run for the post are John Swinney, deputy first minister, Kate Forbes, the finance secretary and Humza Yousaf, the health secretary who has held several senior posts in government. A recent poll over the weekend suggested Forbes was a frontrunner, said The National.\n\nIf at first you don’t secede: the rise and fall of Nicola Sturgeon\n\n2. Corbyn attacks Starmer move\n\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has described Keir Starmer’s decision to bar him from standing for the party at the next general election, as a “flagrant attack” on democracy. In a statement posted on Twitter, Corbyn said it was up to local party members to choose their candidate, not Labour leaders. If Corbyn decides to run at the next election as an independent it would “pose an existential dilemma for Momentum, the grassroots leftwing group that emerged out of his leadership campaign”, said The Guardian.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

France could outgun Britain\n\nA think tank has warned that Britain could fall behind France as Nato’s leading military power in Europe. The International Institute for Strategic Studies said France has more combat aircraft, more frigates and more troops than Britain despite spending significantly less on defence. France has 203,250 personnel across its navy, air force and army compared with 150,350 in the Britain armed forces, which is set to shrink even further. President Macron has unveiled a multi-year plan to boost defence spending by a third but Rishi Sunak is “reluctant to sanction a similar increase”, said The Times.\n\nCan the UK rely on the British Army to defend itself?\n\n4. Ambulance callers could be diverted\n\nSome ambulance callers will be told to go elsewhere under a new way of screening calls, reported the BBC. NHS England is asking ambulance crews to review which non-life-threatening calls can be treated elsewhere. The category will include incidents that may not need such a fast response, such as burns and severe headaches. About 40% of calls under this category will receive callbacks from a doctor, nurse or paramedic to see whether there is an alternative to sending an ambulance. Sir Julian Hartley, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents ambulance services, called it a “welcome step”.\n\n5. Police reveal Bulley ‘vulnerabilities’\n\nPolice have said that missing mother Nicola Bulley had “significant issues” with alcohol brought on by her ongoing struggles with the menopause. Lancashire police said the issues “caused some real challenges” for her partner and family. After previously saying Bulley had “specific vulnerabilities”, the force acknowledged it was an unusual move to divulge such personal information about a missing person, but said it wanted to explain what it meant by “vulnerabilities”. Since the 45-year-old went missing on 27 January during a riverside dog walk in St Michael’s on Wyre there has been a huge amount of speculation and intrigue into the case.\n\nNicola Bulley: are armchair detectives and TikTok sleuths a help or hindrance?\n\n6. Brockovich tells Ohio residents to leave\n\nThe environmentalist Erin Brockovich has told residents of a US town where a train carrying toxic waste derailed to ignore government guidance and leave if they do not feel safe. Around 50 carriages derailed earlier this month in East Palestine, Ohio, and the chemical cargo was burned to minimise risk of an explosion. The large fire sent a vast plume of toxic smoke into the air. Speaking to Newsnation, the activist, whose campaign against a utilities giant was turned into a Julia Roberts movie, said: “I need the community to act for themselves.”\n\n7. Sacked Russian general found dead\n\nA Russian general killed himself a month after he was relieved from his post by Vladimir Putin, reported The Independent. Journalists in Moscow said Major General Vladimir Makarov, 72, was the main organiser in the “hunt” for those deemed an inconvenience by the Kremlin, spearheading the oppression of journalists, opposition activists and protesters. He was found with gunshot wounds to the head at his suburban home in Golikovo, northwest of Moscow, Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper reported.\n\n8. NYT writers attack trans coverage\n\nThe New York Times has been accused by its own writers of fuelling “bigotry and pseudoscience” against trans people. Sex and The City actress Cynthia Dixon, writer Lena Dunham and whistleblower Chelsea Manning are among the contributors to have penned a letter raising “serious concerns” about the newspaper’s coverage of transgender, non-binary and gender nonconforming people. In a statement to NPR, the paper’s spokesperson, Charlie Stadtlander, defended the coverage, saying the issues are reported “deeply and empathetically”.\n\n9. Pompeo says Israel is not occupying\n\nFormer US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has said Israel has a biblical claim to Palestine and is therefore not occupying it. “[Israel] is not an occupying nation,” he told the One Decision podcast, adding that “as an evangelical Christian, I am convinced by my reading of the Bible that 3,000 years on now, in spite of the denial of so many, [this land] is the rightful homeland of the Jewish people”. As Donald Trump’s diplomat, Pompeo oversaw a “shift in US policy away from mediating a two-state solution and toward more openly siding with Israel”, said The Guardian.\n\nWill deadly rise in West Bank violence prompt full-scale Palestinian uprising?\n\n10. Waitrose tries to lure back middle-class\n\nWaitrose will slash prices across “hundreds of grocery staples” as it “battles to win back cash-strapped middle class shoppers”, said The Daily Telegraph. The grocery chain said nearly a quarter of price cuts are worth 20% off. Fresh vegetables, meats and cheese are among the 300 Waitrose own-brand items enjoying reductions, with a 1kg bag of carrots dropping from 60p to 50p and Savoy cabbages falling from 90p to 70p. Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital, said Waitrose’s prices have been “top of the charts, at a time of clear economic hardship”.\n\nHow to save on your weekly shop", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2021/06/29/kcci-chief-meteorologist-kurtis-gertz-ready-life-regular-iowan-weather-des-moines-tv-station/7551966002/", "title": "KCCI chief meteorologist Kurtis Gertz ready for life as regular Iowan", "text": "The first time Kurtis Gertz stood in front of a green screen to deliver a TV weather forecast was at college.\n\nThe future chief meteorologist at Des Moines' KCCI was helping a friend on a meteorology class assignment.

That had to change.\"\n\nOn the to-do list: Scholarships, salaries, facilities, fundraising — all areas in which UVM lagged behind its conference peers.\n\nThirteen years later, what is the final accounting of that mandate?\n\n• A sweeping transformation of the university’s “front porch,” as Corran called the program when he was hired in May 2003 — vastly improved coaching salaries, a 70 percent increase in scholarships and two all-purpose turf fields, including one with lights and a 2,500-seat stadium under construction.\n\n• Funding at levels that dwarf what the department had previously seen — Vermont’s pre-Corran athletics budget was $6.5 million and will be $19 million-plus after he departs, the bulk supporting that competitive pay structure and athletic aid.\n\n• Revised plans and hard decisions — the grand dream of a modern, multi-purpose arena hasn’t graduated from artist renderings to reality, while the move to cut the baseball and softball teams to solve a budget shortfall in 2009, making UVM four sports lighter than the 2003-04 school year, remains controversial in the community.\n\n“You look at where the department was before he got here to where it is now. We are just in a really healthy position to be successful,” said men’s basketball coach John Becker. “I think he absolutely was the right guy at the right time for this place. … He gave it a structure and gave it a culture.”\n\nTime for an overhaul\n\nFormer men’s basketball coach Tom Brennan was, in more ways than one, an exception to the rule when his team skyrocketed to the top of the America East Conference for three straight NCAA Tournament berths.\n\nAnd yet his career arc was indicative of the UVM athletic department as a whole.\n\nBrennan spent most of his time at UVM with a limited number of scholarships. He famously went 14-68 his first three years and had nine losing seasons in the 16 before the Catamounts claimed their first NCAA berth in 2003.\n\nWithout the serious backing of the school’s central administration, the athletic program operated under radically different circumstances for Corran’s predecessor, Rick Farnham.\n\n“It’s like apples and oranges,” said swimming and diving coach Gerry Cournoyer, the lone head-coaching holdover from the Farnham years.\n\nThe needs weren’t limited to resources. The people within the program needed a sense of hope, Corran said, “that things are going to get better — that things can get better.\n\n“That was really what struck me the most when I arrived,” he said. “The lack of resources in the program and as a result of that people were just looking to get by.”\n\nThe push for transformation started at the top with former UVM President Dan Fogel, provost at Louisiana State before coming to Burlington, who was adamant that athletics needed to reflect the excellence of the university.\n\nIn his first convocation address on Sept. 3, 2002, Fogel informed the campus that it had something called a “competitive metabolism” and, in the same breath, that it needed to improve. The bullish statement became the refrain for a bold vision of the future.\n\n“With that came some greater support and we were able to do some things internally to generate more revenue so that the marketing effort became much stronger, fundraising became much stronger,” Corran said. “It was a nice combination of the institution investing more and us creating more that really allowed us to grow pretty substantially.”\n\nWithin a year of taking the reins, Corran unveiled the Victory Club as the department’s new catch-all fundraising arm.\n\nIn the past, booster-operated clubs like Friends of UVM Hockey raised money to donate to specific sports with varying results. In 2002-03, the Friends groups for the school’s three highest-profile sports — men’s hockey, men’s basketball and women’s basketball — raised a combined $67,000. Teams that didn’t have robust community support had to resort to bake sales, t-shirt sales and car washes.\n\n“When I got here the financial restraints on the department were pretty tough,” Cournoyer said. “It just didn’t allow the non-top tier programs, teams other than hockey and basketball at that time, to have a chance to really strive.”\n\nWhere the splintered fundraising efforts usually cobbled together between $100,000 and $200,000 each year, the Victory Club has raked in an average of $750,000 per year, according to USA Today Sports’ annual college finances reporting.\n\n“That was tough for some of those groups to buy into because it was something they’d been doing for years and in their view of the world everything was good,” Corran said.\n\n“They don’t have that 30,000-foot view that you need from time to time, in terms of long-term, where is the program going, how do we get to where we’re going?”\n\nThe more equitable approach raised expectations and excitement across the board. The same can be said of the attempt to cover the blind spots: Upgraded locker rooms, an expanded athletic performance center (1,200 square feet to 11,000) and converting the indoor tennis courts to a turf facility for the winter months.\n\nSalaries, scholarships on the rise\n\nA successful four-year stint at Division III Lycoming College in Pennsylvania got Cournoyer in the door as the Catamounts’ new swimming and diving coach in 2000. His plan was to spend three or four years, then land a different D-I gig.\n\nGiven the situation, it would be hard to fault his thinking.\n\n“When I was hired here I actually took a pay cut to come here,” Cournoyer said. “And I had more jobs here. I had to teach PE classes on top of coaching, which took time away in my day from being a quality coach. I was on a 10-month contract — and the funny thing is no coach only works 10 months.”\n\nThe effects of Corran’s head-spinning first year changed that.\n\nFirst, Cournoyer was one of several coaches to get a raise and extension. Then in March 2004 he lost his men’s team, one of four programs cut along with golf and men’s and women’s tennis. In the same stroke, the UVM women’s team saw its lot improve greatly: Supplied with 0.15 scholarships in 2003-04, the squad was one of several put on track for incremental increases.\n\nNow at 5.75 scholarships a year, Cournoyer’s squad has gone 113-73-1 since Corran arrived, compared to a 10-88 mark the decade before.\n\n“We’re a lot more competitive now within the conference,” Cournoyer said. “I’m recruiting against schools like Michigan and we’re getting those athletes more and more. That’s a direct result of the support we’re getting for the swimming program that wasn’t there before.”\n\nAcross the department, scholarships are up 70 percent, climbing from 88 to almost 150 since Corran’s first year.\n\nAnd that’s no small outlay for one of the priciest public schools in the nation, with the annual cost of attendance for out-of-state students just shy of $54,000. The scholarship price tag for the 2015-16 school year is an estimated $7.3 million, according to figures obtained in a public records request.\n\n“Scholarships are what help you attract the best student-athletes, allow you to be competitive, and that was a major level of focus when (Corran) arrived,” said Jeff Schulman, a senior associate athletic director since 2003 and Corran’s successor.\n\n“You can’t compare the level of support that we can now provide to our student-athletes and our coaches and staff,” Schulman said. “Our resources are completely different and he deserves a ton of credit for that.”\n\nFrom the start that transformation included boosting salaries for administrators and staff, a bid to lure and retain talent.\n\nCorran’s initial $140,000 base salary was $55,000 more than Farnham’s final year, according to reports at the time.\n\nWhen basketball coach Brennan led the Catamounts to their first NCAA appearance in 2003, he did it on a $69,000 salary. The following year, Corran’s first, coaches transitioned to 12-month contracts and reaped substantial raises. Brennan’s deal improved to the then-unprecedented realm of $97,000 per year.\n\nSince then three athletic department employees — Corran ($243,463), Becker ($225,000) and men’s hockey coach Kevin Sneddon ($241,500) — have eclipsed $200,000 in yearly earnings, according to UVM’s annual list of base pay.\n\nProgram success during Corran era\n\nWhen Mike Lonergan left for George Washington following the 2010 season, few would have guessed Becker, five years removed from working as an IT manager, would be his boss’s successor.\n\nAlthough he had opportunities to join Lonergan at GW or mull an offer from Colby College, Becker went all in for the UVM men’s basketball gig.\n\n“The easier thing would have been to maybe hire someone from a bigger program or a bigger name,” said Becker, initially tapped as interim head coach.\n\nCorran, instead, rewarded Becker — who’s spent his time repaying that faith.\n\nBecker’s Cats have won at least 20 games and earned post-season tournament invites in each of his five seasons. They have also made the NCAA Tournament (2012) and advanced to three America East Conference title games.\n\nMen’s hoops since Corran’s arrival has been the department’s beacon of consistency. They are 283-147 since 2003-04, good for a 65.8 winning percentage, with four tickets booked to March Madness.\n\nThe start of Corran’s run also marked the closing chapter of the program’s golden era led by Brennan, Taylor Coppenrath and T.J. Sorrentine. But Corran and his team developed a knack for usually finding the right coach to lead a UVM program.\n\nOut of the gate, Corran was tasked with hiring four head coaches — Bill Reichelt (skiing), Sharon Dawley (women’s basketball), Kevin Sneddon (men’s hockey) and Matt Belfield (track and field).\n\nSchulman said those were “critical hires.”\n\n“It was very clear to me from the beginning that this was a person who was incredibly professional and had a high level of integrity,” Schulman said. “I knew that we were going to be in good hands.”\n\nReichelt’s ski program returned to glory in 2012 with its sixth national title, the first since 1994. Dawley and court stars Courtnay Pilypaitis and May Kotsopoulos sent the women’s hoops program to new heights with an NCAA tournament win in 2010 to conclude a strong three-year run.\n\nAnd men’s soccer has posted a 52.6 winning percentage (104-91-51) with two NCAA tournaments. In the previous 10 years, the program had a 47.9 winning percentage.\n\n“He got us organized so we could go forward as a department. He also is a quiet leader,” said men’s soccer coach Jesse Cormier, hired in 2004. “He listens and forms his opinions after hearing the details to make an informed and analytical decision.”\n\nBut not every hire panned out. Women’s soccer did not record a winning season while Corran was on campus and is onto its third coach. Field hockey has posted a 26.8 winning percentage since 2003 and women’s basketball went into a six-year funk when Dawley left.\n\n“Like any administrator you’re going to hit a home run with some, and sometimes you’re not,” Cournoyer said. “You’re never going to hit a home run every time.\n\n“But what Bob has done through his tenure, which I appreciated, was support his coaches. Just look at Ryan Curtis and men’s lacrosse.”\n\nCurtis, who stepped down after a 10-year run earlier this spring, had his best season in 2016, bringing the Catamounts to the program’s first America East championship game. Curtis compiled a 48-101 overall record; along the way, the program’s scholarship allocation grew from 5.28 to 11.45 per year.\n\n“They struggled for years, but Bob worked with Ryan, let him develop and they were a couple goals from making the NCAA tournament,” Cournoyer said. “A lot of other administrators may have just cut someone loose quick. Bob was very cautious to make those quick decisions.”\n\nThe move to Hockey East\n\nThe men’s hockey program, still reeling from the 1999 hazing scandal, was the only winless Division I team in the country. The young women’s program had a 7-63-4 record in the last two years.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Corran and UVM from reaching out to Hockey East in December 2003.\n\nNaturally, criticism ensued.\n\n“We heard, ‘Who do you think you are, trying to move into the best conference in the country?’” Schulman said.\n\nThe jump from ECAC to Hockey East was officially announced Jan. 8, 2004, with commissioner Joe Bertagna on hand at the news conference. The move severed a four-decade relationship with ECAC, but Corran’s foresight would be proven right, Schulman said.\n\n“Bob was not afraid to go against the grain,” Schulman said. “It was an example of Bob being two steps ahead of everyone else.”\n\nIn the 11 years since, the men’s program has a 47.1 winning percentage. The Cats have reached three NCAA tournaments, one Frozen Four (2009), one Hockey East final and a logged pair of league semifinal appearances. They have not, however, finished higher than seventh in the regular-season standings since 2009.\n\nBy contrast, in the 10 seasons before Corran’s tenure started, the Cats compiled a 47.9 winning percentage, made three NCAA tournament appearances and lost a memorable yet controversial Frozen Four game in 1996 during the St. Louis-Perrin-Thomas golden era.\n\nThe women’s program, which welcomed a splurge of scholarships, endured two coaching changes (Dennis Miller to Tim Bothwell and Bothwell to Jim Plumer). They have compiled a 92-146-36 record and just one winning season — 18-14-4 two winters ago — in Hockey East.\n\n“I don’t think you can argue with the success of Hockey East,” said Schulman of the league’s challenges to win consistently.\n\nDropping baseball, softball\n\nAfter 13 years, one choice continues to loom above the rest.\n\nWhy? The signs are — literally — all around, chiding UVM to “Bring it back!”\n\nFacing a $1.1 million budget gap, Corran announced in February 2009 a plan to cut the school’s baseball and softball programs. The move saved more than $800,000, sparing across-the-board cuts that would have negatively impacted every program. But it also inspired bad feelings that still linger today, in large part because coach Bill Currier’s baseball team had been consistently competitive — before getting an injection of scholarships — and was the rare UVM program rich with Vermont talent.\n\n“I’ve said often: We know it wasn’t a good decision, but it was the best decision we could make at the time,” Corran said.\n\nCorran’s department ran different scenarios to solve the shortfall before opting to shed the two programs, which supported 43 student-athletes and six staff positions between them.\n\nCut scholarships from every sport? Eliminate five scholarships here, three assistant coaches there? Trim resources elsewhere, put projects on the back burner?\n\n“When we finished that (process), we said, you know, each of these where you’re pulling from here and here, pulling from different programs, what it does is it weakens everyone,” Corran said.\n\nThe piecemeal solution would’ve been more popular and palatable. It also would’ve hacked away at the department’s philosophy of building quality the previous six years.\n\nWhen the athletic administration presented its “rational, logical” solution, it encountered the opposite.\n\n“It was very emotional and I understand that,” Corran said. “I don’t think everyone really tried to understand the rationale.”\n\nWith two exceptions, the results since 2009 appear to support the decision.\n\nMost programs held steady with prior results, based on a comparison of win-loss records, or had noteworthy milestones. Only women’s basketball and field hockey saw winning percentages dip significantly — and coaching changes have resulted for both programs.\n\n“We would have a much more difficult time to measure up to the league, regionally, and I think competing nationally would be a hope or a dream, not a reality,” said Cormier, whose men’s soccer team reached the NCAA Tournament last year for the first time since 2007.\n\nAny attempt to bring back baseball or softball remains a daunting challenge, one that would only be compounded by Title IX requirements.\n\nAssuming the same number of scholarships (five) that existed when baseball was dropped, the program would require an annual budget of roughly $700,000, Schulman said. He said that would require an endowment with a principal between $14 and $15 million. It would roughly be the same for softball.\n\nNo regrets with arena progress\n\nWhispers of arena plans started before Corran was hired. And they will continue after he leaves his post.\n\nBut what impact did Corran have on furthering UVM’s dream to build a new arena for its hockey and basketball programs?\n\nThe blueprints are covered in Corran’s fingerprints.\n\n“There has definitely been opportunities along the way for it go in a different direction and he’s really been the driving force to keep it on the rails and keep the discussion really prominent in the minds of our entire campus and the Trustees and the community as well,” Schulman said.\n\nThe first proposal, put forth by a UVM task force in 2008, called for an 8,000-seat, $85 million arena. When that project didn’t take off, Corran and the school unveiled a toned-down version in late 2014.\n\nThe two-phase, $65 million project would keep a hockey-basketball arena on campus and repurpose Gutterson Fieldhouse into a student fitness center. But lack of fundraising — the school needs to raise $50 million through non-debt sources to get Phase 1 under way — has kept the arena as a pipe dream.\n\n“The arena was one that we really did want to see happen and hopefully it is going to happen here in the nearer future,” Corran said.\n\nWhile he has no regrets, Corran said the 2008 financial collapse factored in the arena plans initially falling apart.\n\n“I don’t think anyone ever leaves a job like this with everything being finished.”\n\nPotential off-site plans with South Burlington and Burlington were revealed earlier this year, but how the university proceeds isn’t a decision for Corran to make.\n\n“(Schulman), he’s got the challenge now but there’s good things happening and promising things happening,” Corran said.\n\nCorran arrived in Burlington and took swift action, driven to force positive change and reshape the athletic department. Those close to him say he accomplished exactly that, making what comes next the easy part.\n\n“There’s no anxiety about it at all. It’s much more excitement,” Corran said. “People talk about it being the next chapter and it really is, doing something completely different.

It is not one he planned to seek, initially agreeing to serve as an interim — 13 years ago — just to provide stability during a time of upheaval.\n\nHe has spent a lot of time in recent months reflecting on what he accomplished, all that he will miss and what will come next.\n\nSmart, who was a highly successful attorney before joining Missouri State as general counsel in 2007, announced in September that the 2023-24 year would be his last, giving the MSU Board of Governors the better part of a year to find a successor.\n\nThe board unanimously chose Richard \"Biff\" Williams, former president of Utah Tech University, to serve as the 12th president. He is expected to move to Springfield and assume the role shortly.\n\nSmart has been savoring his final months in the job. In May, the board gave Smart a rare Bronze Bear Award for his contributions. Mayor Ken McClure gave him a key to the city and an anonymous donor gave more than $1 million to construct a new alumni center on campus, which will be named the Clifton M. Smart III University Advancement Center.\n\nSmart, 63, said he plans to work until his final day. He and wife Gail, who live blocks from campus, will remain in the city and spend more time giving back as community volunteers.\n\nOn May 28, Smart sat down for an \"exit interview\" of sorts, reflecting on his legacy and future. Here is that interview, edited only for clarity and conciseness:\n\nQ: You were announced as the interim president — to fill a leadership vacuum during a turbulent period — on June 27, 2011. That day, what were you most apprehensive about?\n\n\"Everything happened so quickly over that weekend, leading up to that Monday the 27th announcement. The thing that I was most apprehensive about was lack of academic experience. It became essential, if I was going to accept the position that had been offered me, that we address that immediately.\"\n\nThe day before, Smart and longtime MSU vice president Jim Baker convinced Frank Einhellig to serve as interim provost. Not long after, \"interim\" was dropped from the job titles for both Smart and Einhellig.\n\n\"We talked about what that would look like and how we'd work together. And (Einhellig) agreed, and that decision, I've often said, is maybe the best decision I've ever made. Because it set us up for success. And it reassured faculty that academics was important. And there was someone they trusted, that was going to lead that piece.\"\n\nQ: Reflecting on your accomplishments as president, which were the most important to you and why?\n\n\"Having our university designated as a doctoral university is clearly at the top of the list, because that ... impacts things in lots of different levels. That was important.\"\n\nSmart also referenced the plan for Missouri State to leave the Missouri Valley Conference for Conference USA, where it will become a full member during the 2025-26 athletics season.\n\n\"Although there's much left to be determined, the athletic conference decision that we've been working on the last couple of years, and that we've talked about intermittently the whole time I've been here, has the potential to be really meaningful. But there's some unknowns and some risk associated with that, as well. And so we'll have to see how that plays out.\"\n\nQ: Of the physical changes to the MSU campus in the past 13 years, which one is the most meaningful to you?\n\n\"The biggest thing we were able to do was get the funding to expand and renovate (the former Temple Hall) what we now call Roy Blunt Hall. That is the biggest construction project in the history of the university. And it was also a huge need, that I didn't think there was any way we would be able to tackle.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm looking forward to an alumni center that has my name on it. The welcome center was important. The Glass Hall renovation was important. The health buildings were important. A new Magers Health and Wellness Center — all those things are important. But I think they all pale in comparison to putting $125 million into a state-of-the-art science facility that no one thought we could ever get done.\"\n\nQ: As you prepare to leave MSU, what do you hope will never change about the campus?\n\n\"The thing that I hope never changes is the personal connections and relationships that students develop with faculty and staff members of the university. I don't think that happens everywhere — the connections, the stories, the relationships, the undergraduate research, and teaching and peer mentoring ... It's particularly important at a big university.\"\n\nOver the years, Smart estimates he's taken \"maybe tens of thousands\" of selfies with students and alumni. Smart chronicled his experiences as president on X, formerly Twitter, and was featured in scores of mostly silly and fun university videos on Instagram.\n\nQ: In your interactions with students and alumni, and your social media presence, what message were you trying to convey?\n\n\"When we started it, probably several things were at the root of that. For students, nobody knew who the president was and so showing that I'm a real person, that I can laugh at myself, that I'm engaged in lots of things, I think was important. People also don't know what a president does. It's been both helpful, for internal and external constituencies, to say, 'Clif is engaged in things, he is a leader in the community, he is making a difference in Jeff City, etc.'\"\n\n\"Primarily, I use it to promote the university, look at all the great things that are happening here ... It's to promote the faculty, staff and students as well as what the university does for the community.\"\n\nQ: Given how public you have been during your tenure, what is something people might be surprised to learn about you?\n\n\"I'm a huge mystery book reader, fan. For example, I've read every novel Agatha Christie has written. I've read all the Lord Peter Wimsey books. I'm working my way through the Nero Wolfe books written by Rex Stout. I just read for fun.\"\n\n\"Another fact is I love travel, we love to travel, particularly in and around the Mediterranean. And Gail and I religiously watch Rick Steves' travel show at 9 p.m. almost every night.\"\n\nQ: You have described Gail, your wife of nearly 38 years, as your partner in the presidency. What is she better at than you? How has she shaped your impact?\n\n\"She is really good at connecting deeply with people. She does that better than I do. I'm reasonably good at connecting with hundreds of people casually. My favorite example of that is at an alumni event early on ... in Florida, an older man came by himself, dressed in a coat and tie. No one dresses in a coat and tie in Florida, particularly at our alumni events, and Gail spent 30 minutes talking to him to make sure he felt included, and invited and important. And she does that over and over.\"\n\n\"She cares deeply about things ... That led to her running a food pantry for six years, because that was really important to her. She has both a softer side and a harder edge than I do. She's very protective of me and she is not afraid to ... give me some advice of how it could have been a little better or shorter or more impactful. And I appreciate those things, although I tease her about it sometimes.\"\n\nQ: With the benefit of hindsight, what would you have done differently? And what did you learn from making a mistake?\n\n\"Without using his name, I made an awful vice president-level hire, and I knew it was the wrong hire. I felt like I'd been kind of pressured into doing it and then it didn't work. And then I didn't fix it for four years ... As soon as it was fixed, and he had moved on, the whole tone of our administrative leadership meetings changed because it was just poison to have him in the room. And what I learned from that is to go with your gut, you've got to make the hires you think are right, regardless of what others think ... And if you make a mistake, just own up to it and fix it.\"\n\nQ: The toughest decision you made as president?\n\n\"To reopen as a residential campus in the fall of 2020. Because we still had the pandemic going on, we didn't have a vaccine yet, we didn't have medicine that we were confident in. We didn't know if we could do it but we had to because ... thousands of our students would have 'stopped out' and never have come back. They didn't have the ability, or the support or the technology to just do online in the fall from home. Some of them didn't have a home, some of them didn't have technology, we had to come back on campus. And there are a lot of people that thought that was a bad decision.\"\n\n\"The result of that was we kept our enrollment, we didn't have to lay anyone off. And we showed that we could do hard things. And I was really proud of our team.\"\n\n\"I still get emotional four years later thinking about that, because it was a challenging time.\"\n\nQ: Your contract originally ran through summer 2026. At the time you announced plans to retire you said it was due, in part, to the presence of at least one viable internal candidate. (Only one, Provost John Jasinski, was publicly named because he was a finalist.)\n\n\"We had two at the time and the board went a different direction and that is their prerogative.\"\n\nQ: How did you decide it was the right time to step down? Are you still happy with the timing?\n\n\"The timing, as things have gone on this year, has proven to be completely correct. And (the presence of an internal candidate) was a factor but it wasn't the only factor. At least as big a factor was the departure, or the moving on, of other people that have been essential to our success.\"\n\nSmart singled out U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, both of whom he considers a friend, as well as state Sen. Lincoln Hough.\n\n\"Blunt has retired. He was tremendously important to our success. Gov. Parson is in his last half-year ... to have a pro-education, pro-workforce development governor is so important for a public university.\"\n\n\"Sen. Hough, who is running for lieutenant governor, I am confident he is going to win and he's no longer going to be appropriations chair. I can't tell you how important he has been to our success.\"\n\n\"When you think about those three critical people rolling off, it's good for somebody else to come in because you're going to have to build relationships again, and those relationships need to be meaningful and long-term and ... I wasn't going to be around another four years or six years.\"\n\nSmart and wife Gail have two sons and six grandchildren. They enjoy traveling and want to spend more time giving back to this community.\n\n\"Personally, I wanted to go out while I was healthy, when we could do other things, before everybody was banging on the door ready to push me out. It's just better to go out kind of on your own terms.\"\n\nQ: The 12th president, Richard \"Biff\" Williams will soon step into the role. Do you plan to be available to him as an advisor or mentor or leave him to find his own way?\n\n\"I don't expect to be a mentor but I want to be available any way he wants me to be. But I put that ball in his court. I'm not going to leave him a list of stuff to do or a bunch of issues to address. He knows how to be a president. He's been a successful president. But he's got my whole team here, right? Everyone has continued on.\"\n\n\"I'm happy to be available and play any role that that he would like me to play but he would need to be the one to take the initiative on those kinds of engagements. I don't want to do anything to overshadow him or hinder him being successful.\"\n\nQ: Post-presidency, how active will you be on social media?\n\n\"I will be significantly less engaged and, again, I don't want to do anything to overshadow the new president. I am going to be the emeritus president and so I will significantly scale back. Don't expect to ever do another video to be posted after the last one we've got in design right now. That will go out the end of June. And my Instagram career will be over.\"\n\nQ: How will your community involvement change? Are there roles you haven't been able to play because of being the MSU president?\n\n\"I haven't taken on new board roles yet ... I've got almost three years left on my City Utilities term, and we're in search for a new general manager. Expect to be involved in that. Expect to continue on on the (Mercy Health Springfield Communities) board that's not directly connected to being president of the university ... Expect to continue on the United Way (of the Ozarks) board, at least for some period of time. I have talked to Dr. Williams. He wants me to continue to chair the Missouri Partnership board, which is a statewide board, and I'll do that for another year and a half.\"\n\nSmart said he wants to be more involved at the University Heights Baptist Church, which he and Gail have joined, calling it \"more inclusive, welcoming.\"\n\n\"We'll do some specific volunteer work that isn't 'leadership' work, things like Safe to Sleep, volunteering with Gail at that. It could include Ozarks Food Harvest. There are a variety of charitable kinds of faith organizations we'd like to be more involved in.\"\n\nQ: Ever consider running for elected office? For mayor?\n\n\"I did think about the mayor race and decided against it. Never interested in running for partisan office so I don't have any interest in running as a Democrat or Republican for state rep. or state senate or anything else ... Did think about the mayor's race as something I might have been interested in. But it's not the same ... as it was 10 years ago when you're really running to help your community grow. Everything has become partisan, even the the nonpartisan races. I didn't really want to be in that. I'm a big supporter, big fan of Councilman Abe McGull and I would expect to support him for mayor.\"\n\nReached by phone Tuesday, McGull confirmed he is \"seriously considering\" a run and will announce a decision later this year.\n\nQ: What piqued your interest about the mayoral role? Was it because of what Mayor Ken McClure has been able to do? (McClure ran for office after a long career at Missouri State, where he was a vice president).\n\n\"It really did. And I've known other mayors as well, Bob Stephens and Tom Carlson. We love Springfield ... and we want it to continue to grow and thrive. But it's a tough environment right now and I hate to say ... while I've loved this job, it has also been a tough job. And just didn't think I wanted to go from the fire into the frying pan.\"\n\nQ: What are your plans for the summer and fall?\n\n\"Our biggest plan is we are hosting a Missouri State alumni cruise from Oct. 3-13 that starts in Barcelona and ends in Rome. And we've added some days on both ends of that trip.\"\n\nQ: What will you miss the most?\n\n\"I'm going to miss regular engagement with my team. I really love our academic and administrative leadership team. We're friends, we do things together. We talk about everything. We plan together, we socialize together. While some of that will continue, a lot of it won't.\"\n\n\"I'm also going to miss the community leadership role. A lot of that goes away because it sits on the office ... being involved in community decisions and brainstorming ideas and plans.\"\n\n\"We'll miss engagement with the students. That was one of the things that was surprisingly fun ... Every generation thinks the next generation is not up to theirs but what I found is this next generation is amazing and students are doing incredible things. I'm going to miss that engagement and I would have never thought that when I took this job 13 years ago.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/16/south-dakota-us-senator-john-thune-election-2022-win-is-set-for-senate-gop-leadership-future/69635295007/", "title": "South Dakota Sen.

The process for finding a new chief is already underway.\n\nSelecting Minter's successor is the responsibility of Savannah City Manager Jay Melder, but he says he won't be the only voice in the decision-making process.\n\nIn the meantime, Melder has appointed Assistant Chief Lenny Gunther to lead the department. Gunther has been with SPD since 2001, and was appointed as assistant chief under Minter.\n\nMelder has been part of the hiring process for two police chiefs in his career, which includes stints as an assistant city manager. At his most recent previous job, in Washington D.C., the mayor made the final call, not the city manager.\n\nTop law dogs: A look back at two decades of Savannah police chiefs\n\nMelder said \"hiring a police chief is the most important HR decision that an executive can make.\"\n\nThe process he's laying out for the next few months reflects that. He said vetting would be \"thorough and arduous\" for applicants, and he'll be fielding opinions from a broad spectrum of voices: community members and stakeholders, faith and business leaders, SPD staff and city council. All will get a say.\n\nMelder's plan\n\nThe last three searches conducted by the City of Savannah to find Savannah’s top cop all took about seven months. Each was conducted under a different city manager.\n\nMelder has set a more ambitious schedule, telling council his goal is to have the next police chief hired by the end of the year — five months.\n\nHe isn't going to let that schedule speed up or slow down the process. The goal is to find the best candidate, Melder said. And to do that, the first step is to contract a \"gold standard police executive recruitment firm.\" He says the city is in the \"final stages\" of that.\n\nDuring the last search in 2018, Minter was one of four finalists selected for the position. All finalists underwent a series of interviews and meetings with key executive city staff, two citizens advisory panels and a law enforcement panel.\n\nFinalists also completed a formal assessment process conducted by the city's contracted search group, Developmental Associates, LLC, in which the candidates' knowledge, skills and abilities were assessed.\n\nThen City Manager Rob Hernandez collected feedback from those who attended the interviews and meetings before making the decision to hire Minter. Melder says he's looking to expand upon that.\n\nMelder said the process would include online surveys and focus group settings to collect public opinion on what Savannah residents would like to see from a new chief.\n\nPublic opinion is important, Melder said, especially given the spate of officer-involved shootings in recent months as well as two recent shootings near City Market, Melder says there's a lot of trust to be built, especially in the realm of racial disparity in policing.\n\nHe wants a chief that can help build that public confidence.\n\n\"We need to recognize the reasons why some of those we serve may not trust us, and work every day to build trust and confound that distrust,\" Melder said. \"And so we need a chief who's going to be able to continue to lead critically in that effort, and make sure that our officers understand the dynamics between policing and racial justice, and how they are really a part of the solution there and the healing and community.\"\n\nPolice opinion\n\nSavannah police, from rank and file officers to the command staff, will get a say as well.\n\nMelder said he's already having conversations with the SPD brass, with plans to expand his input collection down the chain of command. He's not ruling out internal candidates for the position, noting \"I think we've got some great leadership there, and some great talent.\"\n\nInput from those who would actually work day-to-day under the new chief is valuable insight, as there were plenty of officers who took issue with Minter's leadership.\n\nIn April 2020, a group of 77 members of the Savannah Police Department, including the captains of all four precincts, signed a statement of workplace conflict with 22 complaints against Minter.\n\nThe undated letter, sent to the city of Savannah’s Human Resources Department, includes claims of favoritism, public embarrassment and “outright disrespect.”\n\nMore recently, a survey of 137 Savannah police officers alluded to distrust of command staff and a culture that stokes fear of retaliation by Minter.\n\nMelder said in his discussions with SPD staffers so far, he's learned they want a leader with good communication skills, a focus on leadership and training opportunities, and someone who supports officers through career development and pay increases.\n\nMelder will also be proposing raises for SPD officers in an attempt to help the new chief keep staffing high and turnover low — $50,000 and up starting pay.\n\n\"We want to make sure that we're gonna get a leader into the police department who our police officers want to have, and want to work hard for,\" Melder said. \"And so they're going to have a really important role in helping shape that criteria, which ultimately, is going to shape the decision.\"\n\nMelder said Minter himself has also been part of the process, but he said ultimately, the search is about the future of the department, not the past.\n\n\"We're going to be focused on the future here, and we'll get his input. Just like I've gotten input from past leaders of the department as well,\" Melder said. \"But really, most important to me is going to be that our officers, our corporals, our lieutenants, our sergeants, those folks who are working in the department now and are looking at 20 years to go in the department, I want to make sure that they've got a leader that they're going to feel excited about continuing their career and service for.\"\n\nMelder’s decision\n\nOn the job since last September, Melder is now working to fill two major public safety vacancies following the resignation of Savannah Fire Department Chief Derik Minard last month.\n\nThe city charter gives the city manager full jurisdiction over and power to appoint various positions and department heads within the organization, including the chief of police, which means Savannah City Council will not get a vote on the matter.\n\nAt his weekly press conference last week, Savannah Mayor Van Johnson listed off a few of his wishlist superlatives for the next police chief. Johnson says he’s hoping for someone with “a mixture of knowledge, skills and abilities of policing as a profession,\" and “someone who has equity and inclusion in their lens.”\n\nHe even loosely quoted Rudyard Kipling’s poem “If,” noting he’s looking for someone who can “walk with the crowd and keep their virtue, or walk with kings and keep the common touch.”\n\nBut above all, Johnson said he was hoping for someone who “gets Savannah.”\n\n“They could be a great police chief, but they have to get Savannah; they have to be able to withstand Savannah,” Johnson said. “Savannah can be a hard gig.”\n\nPrevious searches\n\nWhen the city took on the search for a chief in 2014, the timeline was similar. The position was advertised for two months and attracted 11 applications from 29 states. The eventual hire, Joseph Lumpkin, was one of three finalists considered for the job.\n\nThe seven-month search included an online survey to gather input on what traits the public would like the chief to have in addition to various community panels interviews and interviews by city and county managers.\n\nPrior to Lumpkin, it took the city seven months to settle on Willie Lovett, an internal hire. Lovett had been named interim chief following the departure of Michael Berkow.\n\nA total of 90 applicants applied for the position. A Police Department Policy Committee, which was made up of then Savannah City Manager Michael Brown, Mayor Otis Johnson, County Manager Russ Abolt and Commission Chairman Pete Liakakis settled on Lovett.\n\nAccording to past new reports, the group based their decision on Lovett’s ability to achieve five goals: Improve command staff leadership; crack down on repeat offenders; put civilians in administrative positions; engage the community; and attack drugs, gangs and gun violence.\n\nLovett was forced to retire in 2013 due to a sexual harassment complaint filed by a department officer and was later sentenced to nearly eight years in prison for his role in a commercial gambling operation.\n\nWill Peebles is the enterprise reporter for Savannah Morning News.

Within days of losing the Falklands Islands War to the United Kingdom in 1982, Argentina's General Leopoldo Galtieri, the leader of the embattled military junta that had launched the war to head off popular demands for new elections, resigned his office and started the process of restoring democracy. To say that things have not ended well for many individual dictators who tried to add territorial aggrandizement to domestic oppression, from Benito Mussolini to Saddam Hussein, is putting it lightly.\n\nThat stark history surely weighs heavily on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been Russia's increasingly brutal authoritarian leader throughout nearly the entirety of the 21st century and whose disastrous war of choice in Ukraine entered its fourth year in February, a conflict that has failed to \"achieve almost any of his stated military objectives,\" said the Institute for the Study of War , \"despite an estimated 900,000 Russians killed and wounded.\" While Putin's regime is currently in no danger of being overthrown by Ukrainian tanks surrounding the Kremlin, the longer the war drags on without a decisive military breakthrough, the more likely it is that Putin could be subject to removal from rivals inside Russia, or perhaps even tossed aside by the Russian people themselves, who are no strangers to revolution.\n\nFor a few weeks in early 2025, it looked like newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump was throwing Putin a lifeline, publicly dressing down Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelenskyy in the White House, blaming the war on its Ukrainian victims and siding with Russia at the U.N. Security Council. But in March, Trump \"refused to acquiesce to Putin’s top demand,\" which was \"ending foreign military and intelligence aid to Ukraine,\" said the German Marshall Fund . Trump himself \"appears to be rapidly losing patience with a faltering peace process that is showing few signs of progress,\" said The Atlantic Council , although it remains unclear if he is \"prepared to turn up the pressure on Putin and increase the costs of continuing the invasion.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Meanwhile, the war grinds on, while Putin has had to rely on military reinforcements from North Korea , forging \"a marriage of convenience or even a marriage of desperation,\" said RAND . Putin has also had to lean on Iran, inverting the longstanding patron-client relationship between Moscow and Tehran. Iran has made \"substantial contributions to Russia's ground operations\" as well as \"delivered hundreds of short-range ballistic missiles to Russia,\" said the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . Neither of these developments is a sign of strength for Putin and his regime.\n\nThe Russian economy is also starting to groan under the weight of long-term sanctions and its wartime footing. While the Russian economy has \"repeatedly defied expectations\" since the beginning of the Ukraine war, even seeing significant GDP growth, Putin is fighting to \"manage a wartime economy\" that is struggling to combat \"rising inflation, sanctions pressure and record defense sector spending,\" said The Atlantic Council. With inflation approaching 9% and interest rates hiked to 23%, even Putin has been forced to admit \"that the country’s economy is overheating,\" said CNBC. Russia's economy is in \"an increasingly precarious state,\" said Reuters, despite contradictory claims from Moscow.\n\nAt 72, Putin is also entering the twilight of his life after dominating Russian politics for 25 years. A survey of more than 40 Russia experts conducted by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) in July 2024 found that 40% believe Putin will remain in power until he dies, while 23% expect a \"palace coup.\" Just 3% of experts believe that Putin will ever leave voluntarily. But regardless of how it happens, there are several alternatives who may someday replace Putin as president of the Russian Federation. Putin himself \"constantly considers potential successors and confirmed he has a list of candidates,\" said the Kyiv Independent , citing an interview the Russian strongman conducted with \"pro-Russian state journalist Pavel Zarubin.\" Putin, unfortunately, did not reveal any names on his list.\n\nMikhail Mishustin\n\nRussia's 59-year-old prime minister would be a logical choice for successor, and not just because he would become the interim president should Putin step away before his term ends. Mishustin was also regarded as Putin's most likely successor by Russia experts in the RFE/RL survey. A trained economist, Mishustin spent a decade as head of the country's tax bureau before his appointment as prime minister in 2020. Mishustin has been muted about the Ukraine war, and focused largely on containing the fallout from Western sanctions placed on Russia since the February 2022 war began — but he was reportedly opposed to Putin's decision to invade. That might make him well-placed to keep the basic structures of the Russian authoritarian regime intact, while making a strategic retreat or settling on less favorable terms than Putin has been willing to countenance.\n\nSergei Sobyanin\n\nMoscow's long-time mayor, Sergei Sobyanin , has long been a rumored successor and was the second most popular choice among experts in the RFE/RL poll. The 66-year-old Sobyanin was born in Russia's Tyumen region and before embarking on a political career in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, worked in a metal pipe factory. A former regional governor who also served as Deputy Prime Minister of Russia between 2008 and 2010, Sobyanin is a close Putin ally and a member of his United Russia political party. His rise to prominence was helped by his \"ability to toe whatever lines Putin has set on key aspects of Russia's internal policies while staying mum on some of the tricky-to-navigate external policies,\" said Olga Kiyan of Russia Matters . What makes him a top-tier contender to lead Russia after Putin is his success in keeping \"Russia's capital running smoothly through mass opposition protests, the disastrous Covid pandemic and now regular Ukrainian drone attacks,\" said the Agence France Presse .\n\nDmitry Medvedev\n\nMedvedev, 59, served four years as Russia's president from 2008 to 2012 before stepping aside for Putin in what was later revealed to be a prearranged agreement. The Leningrad native and former law professor is perhaps Putin's longest-standing ally, and he accepted the subordinate role of Prime Minister from 2012 to 2020. Now the deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, Medvedev has struck a belligerent tone about the war in Ukraine. \"This conflict will last for a very long time. For decades, probably,\" he recently said to Russian news agencies, per Reuters . He has also threatened a preemptive nuclear strike if Ukraine were to try to acquire its own nuclear stockpile. Questions remain, however, about whether someone who has been so subservient to Putin for so long could take or consolidate power. The Spectator 's Mark Galeotti recounted a joke purportedly making the rounds in Moscow, in which Medvedev looks for the steering wheel in a car and Putin pulls out a remote control from the passenger seat and announces he'll be the one driving.\n\nSergei Kiriyenko\n\nPutin's 62-year-old first deputy chief of staff is a jack-of-all-trades who was most recently given the job of managing the sham referenda in the regions Russia seized from Ukraine in 2022. In the 1990s, Kiriyenko was known as a liberal reformer, so much so that then-President Boris Yeltsin made him the country's youngest-ever prime minister in 1998. But Kiriyenko's tenure coincided with the country's worst post-Soviet financial crisis, and he was forced to step down after four months. During his brief turn in office, Kiriyenko made the fateful decision to appoint Putin as the head of the FSB, the successor institution to the KGB. Kiriyenko is working hard \"to make himself an irreplaceable cog in the wheels of power,\" said Carnegie Politika . As a Putin inner-circler, Kiriyenko would likely only get the top job if the succession process was managed by Putin or his allies.\n\nAlexei Dyumin\n\nDyumin, 52, cut his teeth as Putin's bodyguard in the 1990s before ascending to play various roles inside the Russian state, including deputy director of the military intelligence bureau GRU, governor of Tula Oblast and now Secretary of the State Council. Dyumin was instrumental in spiriting pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych out of the country in 2014 after a pro-democracy uprising in Kyiv, and then served as a special forces commander in the successful operation to seize Crimea from Ukraine. Once a deputy to Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, extensive rumors said Dyumin would take the place of his former boss, though he did not ultimately get the position. Dyumin's rise to power is emblematic of how Putin operates, identifying allies and then shuffling them from one position of authority to another inside the sprawling Russian state. This points to a \"creeping process of late as the people closest to Putin,\" including bodyguards, \"start getting appointed to key positions,\" said Mark Galeotti at War on the Rocks . If Putin were to step aside voluntarily, Dyumin \"would be a top contender, thanks both to his long-time proximity to the Russian leader and his versatile professional experience,\" said the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies .\n\nNikolai Patrushev\n\nUntil May 2024 , Patrushev was the secretary of Russia's Security Council. He was also a leading proponent of the idea that there is a Western conspiracy to weaken or possibly break up the Russian Federation. The 73-year-old has known Putin since they worked together in the KGB, and became a major strategist in both the 2014 and 2022 invasions of Ukraine. \"His ideas form the foundations of decisions taken by Putin. He is one of the few figures Putin listens to,\" said Tatiana Stanovaya to The Washington Post in 2022. \"Washington and London are again conniving with Nazism and fascism,\" Patrushev said in a March 2023 interview with Russian newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta . \"They have no qualms about using Ukraine to set Europe or the entire world ablaze in a belief that they can get away with anything.\" During the war, Patrushev traveled widely, seeking to shore up Russia's diplomatic position and playing a critical role in managing the alliance with China. But after he was replaced on Russia's Security Council by Sergei Shoigu, Patrushev's star seems to have dimmed. Patrushev's 47-year-old son Dmitry , currently deputy prime minister for agriculture, is another rumored Putin successor. The younger Patrushev has \"has made a dizzying career\" and \"regularly attends Kremlin meetings with Putin,\" said RFE/RL .\n\nOther possibilities\n\nBefore his 2023 assassination, Wagner Group mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin would also have been considered a potential successor; but in Putin's Russia, it is dangerous to be seen as having too much ambition. One name that has vaulted to the top of the potential successors list is Andrei Belousov , who was named Russia's new defense minister in May 2024. An economist by training, the 66-year-old Belousov had served as first deputy prime minister from 2021 until his appointment as defense minister. Another close Putin ally, Belousov would likely carry on with most of Putin's policies both inside and outside of Russia. The change at the defense ministry likely means that Sergei Shoigu, the outgoing minister, is on the outs with Putin, particularly given the trajectory of the war he had been tasked with overseeing. Shoigu did not receive any votes in the RFE/RL survey of Putin successors despite his appointment as Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.\n\nThere is also 66-year-old Dmitry Kozak , a former deputy prime minister and now deputy Kremlin chief of staff, who reportedly worked out an agreement with Ukraine prior to the war that Putin rejected.\n\nIn the event of a full rupture of the regime itself, of course, the list of possibilities would not be limited to Putin loyalists and other Kremlin insiders. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny would have once been the most prominent politician who could seek to lead a post-Putin Russia, but he died in prison in February 2024. Putin has had some opposition leaders, like Boris Nemtsov, assassinated , while others, like tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, live in exile.", "authors": ["David Faris", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/08/27/broadmoor-baptist-church-how-sexual-abuse-response-stands-apart-from-southern-baptist-convention/74696830007/", "title": "Broadmoor Baptist Church: How sexual abuse response stands ...", "text": "Broadmoor Baptist Church, a Madison church commended for its initial response to an abuse report in October 2022, shares findings of third-party investigation and compliance review.\n\nAmid recent uncertainty about future of denomination-wide reforms, Broadmoor Baptist case offers window into challenges and progress of local church leadership taking initiative to address abuse.\n\nThird-party investigative report reveals examples of inaction by former Broadmoor Baptist pastor who later served as chief executive for Mississippi Baptist Convention.\n\nA Jackson-area megachurch’s course reversal on a history of repeatedly mishandling sexual abuse cases offers a counternarrative within the Southern Baptist Convention to examples of denial and cover-up.\n\nDespite a third-party inquiry's findings on Broadmoor Baptist Church's former leadership mishandling an abuse case, the third-party firm commended the Madison church's current leadership for implementing accountability measures and caring for the same survivor who the church's former leadership mistreated.\n\nThat survivor reported her case to current Broadmoor leadership in October 2022, leading the church to hire third-party firm Guidepost Solutions to investigate her case and to audit the church's policies for abuse prevention and response.\n\nBut the rarity of Broadmoor’s story these past 21 months stands in contrast to what is taking place elsewhere in the nation's largest Protestant denomination.\n\n“It’s just so upper level that some of our churches just aren’t in that universe,” said Mississippi pastor Brad Eubank, a survivor and advocate for reform in the SBC. “We just hope everybody starts at step one and works their way through.”\n\nShe came forward to tell her story: Sexual abuse survivor shares her story of grooming by youth pastor at a MS Baptist church\n\nBroadmoor’s progress may not be replicable for everyone in the SBC, but its story offers a window into the struggle at the local level to create substantive change in the denomination. Due to the denomination’s structure anchored in autonomous churches, the future of abuse reform in the SBC will rely on local ministry leaders to own up to failures and take initiative to operate differently.\n\n“The current leadership at Broadmoor is to be commended for their openness and willingness to address and initiate this investigation,” third-party firm Guidepost Solutions said in its report on Broadmoor. “Though this matter went unaddressed for many years … leadership acted appropriately with dedication and transparency.”\n\nDuring the course of Guidepost's inquiry, the third-party firm discovered a second abuse case unrelated to the first. That latter case is now at the center of an ongoing Mississippi Bureau of Investigation inquiry.\n\nGuidepost’s review of Broadmoor’s policies and practices evaluated the church’s child protection policy, an abuse response policy, and a special team that oversees those policies’ implementation and compliance. The assessment found some strengths, such as volunteers consistently adhering to a two-unrelated-adult supervision rule. But Guidepost also found inconsistent and often low rates of volunteers completing background checks and an abuse response training module known as Ministry Safe.\n\nGuidepost’s recommendations for Broadmoor to bridge policy compliance gaps is already a level of sophistication that Eubank said is uncommon for most Southern Baptist churches. Many have minimal screening measures in place, a major deficiency that the SBC Abuse Reform Implementation Task Force sought to combat through its “Essentials: Sexual Abuse Prevention and Response” curriculum. The curriculum, one of the most tangible outcomes of the task force’s two years of work that ended this June, is aimed at the convention’s many small churches with limited resources and often led by bi-vocational pastors.\n\nThe 80-page curriculum includes a list of questions for applicants for staff and volunteer leadership roles, a step-by-step guide on reporting abuse to law enforcement and state officials, and considerations for pastors to care for victims who report abuse. An online version of the curriculum features videos for church leadership teams to use in training sessions.\n\n\"It’s not the end all, be all,” Eubank said. “It is simple and a very specific target because we wanted to start small and grow big.”\n\nHealing and confession\n\nEven more complex than policy revisions, Broadmoor realized it also had a duty to the healing process.\n\nBoth the survivor who came forward, Tracy Ashworth, and the church needed healing, leading Broadmoor leadership to engage consultants like attorney Rachael Denhollander and to hire Guidepost. Even those decisions came with some risk due to heightened criticism among some Southern Baptist factions, placing pressure on SBC leaders not to consider Guidepost to manage abuse-related projects. The criticism follows Guidepost’s work with the SBC at the national level, such as its investigation into the history of how convention leaders handled the abuse crisis.\n\nFor Broadmoor to support Ashworth’s healing, the church is paying for counseling and it offered legal backing in the event of a lawsuit from the alleged abuser, former Broadmoor youth pastor David Ingram, over a non-disclosure agreement.\n\n“Broadmoor took this on knowing that it could be detrimental to how people view our church,” Ashworth said in a statement, which Broadmoor published with Guidepost’s report. “Instead of being fearful, they wanted to bring this darkness to the light.”\n\nAshworth isn’t identified by name in the Guidepost report, but she gave permission to The Clarion Ledger to use her full name.\n\nThen, with the revelations in Guidepost’s report, Broadmoor’s current leadership apologized on behalf of the institution for the pain it has caused.\n\n“We did not listen when listening was desperately needed, act when action was required, or hold those accountable who should have been held responsible,” Broadmoor leadership said in a statement accompanying the release of Guidepost’s report.\n\nGuidepost zeroed in on the actions of former Broadmoor senior pastor Jim Futral, who was the first major authority figure to learn of Ingram’s alleged abuse in a conversation with Ashworth in 1988. Guidepost found Futral’s response failed to seek clarity on key details as to the nature of the abuse, allowed Ingram to remain a Broadmoor member and ministry volunteer even after Ingram was no longer on staff, and provided zero care for Ashworth.\n\nBut Guidepost’s criticism didn’t stop there and expanded to higher levels of SBC oversight. After leading Broadmoor, Futral became chief executive for the Mississippi Baptist Convention and was confronted yet again with an opportunity to hold Ingram accountable.\n\nAfter reporting Ingram’s behavior to Futral in 1988, Ashworth approached Futral in 2019 in response to Ingram starting a new job as pastor of Tinsley Baptist Church. Ashworth noted a resolution the SBC adopted at its 2019 annual meeting that says a pastor accused of abuse is not qualified to serve in ministry. Despite Futral and Ashworth agreeing on the need to address Ingram’s appointment at Tinsley, Futral never acted and instead dodged Ashworth’s follow-up requests.\n\nIt was only later that Futral’s successor, Shawn Parker, who stepped into the role in late 2019 and was unaware of these conversations about Ingram, acted. Within a week of Broadmoor’s announcement in October 2022 about the abuse report involving Ingram, the Mississippi Baptist Convention notified Tinsley Baptist it was disfellowshipped from the state convention.\n\nIngram and Futral did not respond to The Clarion Ledger’s requests for comment.\n\n“While autonomous churches might choose to deal with cases in a contextual manner, we pray that every church will recognize the heinous nature of sexual abuse and address such situations,” Parker said in a statement regarding the report on Broadmoor. Parker added the Mississippi Baptist Convention developed and revised its own staffing and ministry policies “to encourage protection for the vulnerable, to provide support for victims, and to assist churches if abuse should occur.”\n\nAt least two dozen other state Southern Baptist conventions have taken up similar initiatives, inspired by a recognition that state leaders can more effectively guide change at the ground level based on close relationships with local ministry leaders. Even more decisively, state convention leaders in South Carolina announced a plan last year to employ a contractor to serve as a full-time sexual abuse adviser.\n\nMeanwhile, reform at the national level of the SBC is currently in stasis following the expiration of the SBC Abuse Reform Implementation Task Force in June. Members of that task force are helping lead a new nonprofit that still promises to launch an early version of a database of ministers accused of abuse. Many other reforms are now in the hands of the SBC Executive Committee, which is the denomination’s administrative arm, and its staff and members are expected to discuss those next steps at a meeting in September.\n\nLiam Adams covers religion for The Tennessean.

Viewers will be invited to say in unison: “I swear that I will pay true allegiance to Your Majesty, and to your heirs and successors according to law. So help me God.\"\n\nThe oath idea must have seemed like “an easy win for inclusivity and modernity”, said The Daily Beast’s Royalist correspondent Tom Sykes. But “it seems no one thought to check with the people first”, and “turns out they aren’t so keen”.\n\nIn an online poll for ITV’s Good Morning Britain, 86.5% of more than 164,000 respondents said they would not participate.\n\nForeign Secretary James Cleverly told Sky News that the pledge was “an invitation, a very generous invitation, to expand what has traditionally been quite an exclusive function”.\n\n“If you want to do it, and I will, great. If you don’t want to do it, fine,” he added.\n\nTransport Secretary Mark Harper told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday that he “hopes people do” swear the proposed oath. Labour elections campaign chief Shabana Mahmood also welcomed the “lovely idea to involve the people”.\n\nBut other politicians were “more sceptical”, said The Guardian’s Whitehall editor Rowena Mason.\n\n‘Offensive and tone-deaf’\n\nLabour MP Clive Lewis told The Guardian that the oath would be “unwelcome or ignored by many”. He added: “As Jesus is said to have said: ‘Give unto Caesar what is his.’ And this ain’t it.”\n\nAnti-monarchist organisation Republic claimed the oath was “an offensive and tone-deaf gesture that holds the people in contempt”.\n\nBoth Buckingham Palace and Lambeth Palace were “clearly taken aback” by the “strength of feeling” about what was meant to be a “well-meant rallying cry” for the nation, said the Daily Mail. According to the paper, many felt that the Archbishop of Canterbury’s call had “played into the hands of Republicans and critics of the ceremony generally”.\n\nA senior source told The Sun that the spiritual leader had “gone off-piste on this one”. Palace officials issued a clarification yesterday about the oath, which was an “invitation” for people to vocally offer their “true allegiance” to the monarch rather than an “expectation or request”.\n\nBut senior aides fear the controversy is “casting a cloud over the celebrations” said the newspaper.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/02"}]}

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/marijuana/2019/03/13/medical-marijuana-pets/3134109002/", "title": "Marijuana for pets: Here's how some say it can help", "text": "Last summer, Brad Stottelmyer called his 11-year-old dog Misty “Four Paws Walking,” a gallows tribute to the nickname that death-row inmates are given as they await their execution.\n\nThe 77-pound chocolate Labrador retriever, whose dark brown coat is flecked with gray, was hobbled last spring by bone cancer in her right front leg. The pain meds prescribed by Stottelmyer's veterinarian weren’t providing much relief for Misty as the pooch limped around their Dearborn Heights home and yard, tucking her paw underneath her leg and resting her snout on the stricken limb.\n\nSo Stottlemyer began to plan for a pet owner’s worst nightmare, putting down his constant companion. But as a medical marijuana cardholder, who uses weed and cannabidiol (CBD) to ease the pain from a back injury he suffered at his former job preparing apartments for lease, he had one more trick up his sleeve.\n\nHe found CBD-infused oils designed for pets at his local medical marijuana dispensary and started feeding Misty 300 milligrams three times a day as well as rubbing the oil into the dog’s stricken shoulder joint.\n\nBy July, he had quadrupled the dose to 1200 milligrams three times a day and that seemed to do the trick for Misty, who has gone from a death sentence last year to now bounding around the yard, chasing squirrels and sniffing a neighbor’s boulder for any sign of a new pup on the block. The cancer hasn't retreated, Stottelmyer said, but it also hasn't spread and the CBD — which does not cause a high — has provided Misty with pain relief.\n\n\"It was the best Christmas present I got,\" Stottelmyer said. \"These things are really working for her.\".\n\nA growing market for the marijuana industry\n\nMisty is just one of an untold number of customers in a relatively new, but growing market — pot for pets.\n\nThese aren’t the edibles or oils that contain THC — tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive compound in marijuana that provides the “high” in humans — although there are some products being sold that contain low doses of THC. These are hemp-based products that provide relief for all sorts of doggie ailments, from arthritis to cancer to anxiety.\n\nAnd in an industry where pet owners spend an estimated $72 billion a year in the United States on supplies, veterinarian bills and medications, according to the American Pet Products Association, some experts believe the next big thing for doting dog owners is cannabis.\n\nThere aren't many scientific studies about the benefits of CBD for pets, but researchers at Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine published a study last summer showing that 80 percent of a small sample of dogs showed pain relief and increased mobility after two to four weeks of CBD treatment. Colorado State University also is working on a clinical trial that is showing early positive results of treating epileptic dogs with CBD.\n\nWord of mouth also is boosting the business, According to BDS Analytics, a Colorado-based cannabis research firm, more than $7 million in cannabis-based products for pets were sold in marijuana dispensaries in California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington in 2017. The products range from oils and tinctures to rubs and biscuits.\n\nAnd it doesn’t get much more mainstream than lifestyle guru Martha Stewart, who became an adviser last month to Canopy Growth, a Canadian cannabis company, to help develop a line of pot-infused products for people and pets.\n\n“It’s going to be huge. I think it’s just starting and when we look at the amount of pets in this country, there are 90 million dogs alone. If you look at the percentage of people who spend over $1,000 a year on vet bills, that’s 40 million people,” said Caroline Coile, the author of 34 books about dogs, including “Cannabis and CBD Science for Pets” and the owner of eight Salukis and a Jack Russell Terrier mix. “It’s a huge market right now. It’s gone mainstream.”\n\nThe legal uncertainty over CBD-infused products\n\nBut the legal gray cloud that hangs over CBD-infused products for humans extends to animals even more. While Congress passed the farm bill late last year, which, in part, legalized hemp, the product derived from cannabis plants that contains nearly undetectable levels of THC, the guidelines to regulate the growth, processing and transportation of the plant haven’t been fully developed yet.\n\nThe uncertainty means many vets who believe cannabis can be beneficial for pets remain silent about using it to treat animals. Only California has a law, passed last year, that allows vets to talk about CBD-infused products, but not prescribe or sell them. In other states, even where marijuana is legal for medical and adult use, pot for pets remains a verboten subject at worst and only whispered at best.\n\nIn Michigan, where regulations have only addressed cannabis consumption for humans, the market for pets hasn’t been a focus for the state, said Andrew Brisbo, director of the state Bureau of Marijuana Regulation.\n\n“With the passage of the industrial hemp bills as well as the language of the 2018 ballot initiative (that legalized recreational pot in Michigan), we’re working closely with MDARD (Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development) on how industrial hemp products will be regulated in this market,” he said.\n\nCommercial sales for the recreational market won't happen until early next year after the state develops the rules and regulations that will govern the market and begins handing out licenses to pot businesses. Those rules may also address CBD-based products for both humans and pets.\n\nWithout specific rules, that leaves the CBD-infused products for pets a mostly online business, although some pet products are also being sold in medical marijuana dispensaries and health food stores. A check with the big pet supply chains revealed that CBD-based products aren't on their shelves, yet.\n\nShayna Palinkas, manager of the Bloom City dispensary in Ann Arbor, has consulted with customers about cannabis for pets. She has used some products to help her arthritic dog, who has since died, and her mother used a CBD product that also had a low level of THC to transition her dog off the canine-version of the opioid painkiller Tramadol.\n\n“We recommend CBD to start,” she said. “A lot of our customers talk about trying to relieve arthritis pain in older dogs, or alleviating the symptoms from cancer. And some have anxious dogs and they want the CBD for that.”\n\nMelody Simmons, a Ypsilanti resident, was at Bloom City last week looking for relief for both herself and her mixed breed mutt Lucy. She was intrigued to learn more about a gel that could be rubbed on the inside of a dog’s ear for quicker relaxing results.\n\n“I used CBD for my dog, for sure,” Simmons said. “After an eye dropper with about 10 milligrams (of CBD), she seems to really calm down.”\n\nBut neither Simmons nor Stottelmyer heard about the benefits of CBD from their veterinarians. Because of ambiguity about CBD-infused products, which until the farm bill passed were still considered a Schedule 1, illegal drug by the federal government, vets don’t want to risk their licenses by talking about the products.\n\nDr. Christian Ast, a Farmington veterinarian and vice president of the Michigan Veterinary Medical Association, said the lack of rigorous scientific data and the legal cloud surrounding CBD products has veterinarians reluctant to delve into that marketplace.\n\n\"It puts vets in an awkward position because we want to make pets feel better and there’s some anecdotal evidence that it works,\" he said. \"I have many clients who ask me about CBD oil and I'll share with them my concerns about the safety of the product, but much beyond that, we tend not to discuss it.\"\n\nThat's not to say that vets don't want to be more open about options for pets, he added. \"If it’s an opportunity to alleviate pain, we should be able to prescribe it. But from a legal standpoint, I want to be on solid footing. I could absolutely put my license at risk if I prescribe it.\"\n\nAnd that needs to change, said Dr. Rob Silver, a Colorado veterinarian who says he went from “pothead to prophet” after using acupuncture to treat pain in dogs early in his career and then seeing the benefits of pot from pet owners who told him they had “shared their stash with Fido.”\n\n“It’s a big problem right now,\" he said. \"With all the marijuana legalization passing in state after state, you’re allowing physicians to recommend the use of medical marijuana. But because it’s still a Schedule 1 drug on a federal basis (for THC-infused products), and veterinary licenses are reviewed at a state and federal level, vets are prohibited from even talking about it.”\n\nHe’d like to see vets have the ability to consult with pet owners to ensure that they know the benefits and differences between CBD-infused products versus THC-laced products and to make sure their dogs don’t overindulge. While there have been two deaths of small dogs from THC intoxication reported in the early days of Colorado's legalization of pot, there haven't been any deaths reported in the last five years, according to the Poison Pet Helpline, a Minnesota-based emergency hotline for pet owners.\n\nWhen marijuana legalization passes in a state, “the first thing you see is that veterinary offices are being deluged with dogs who are overdosing on THC from well-meaning owners who don’t know proper dosages, or they’re leaving their edibles out and the dogs are getting into them or you’re at a party and some people, unfortunately, think it’s funny to get the dog high. … And dogs do not like to be high. THC just unbalances them.”\n\nKathleen Gray covers the marijuana industry for the Detroit Free Press.

The university will also not allow transgender athletes to compete in female athletic programs, and it has to send personal apology letters to impacted swimmers.\n\nREVAMPED RULES: How NCAA's transgender athlete policy has changed\n\nLia Thomas records\n\nThomas competed for one year as a women's swimmer for Penn after three seasons competing on the men's team.\n\nShe holds Penn women's swimming records in the 100 free (47.37), 200 free (1:41.93), 500 free (4:33.24), 1,000 free (9:35.96) and 1,650 free (15:59.71).\n\nThomas won her NCAA title in the women's 500-yard freestyle event in 2022. She also tied for fifth in the women's 200-yard freestyle and was eighth in the 100-yard freestyle that year.\n\nThe NCAA did not respond to a request for comment after the announcement of the Penn resolution.\n\nReaction to Penn's decision on transgender athletes\n\nThe decision comes as the Trump Administration has focused on banning transgender athletes from competing girl's sports. In May, President Donald Trump had promised \"large scale fines\" on California after a transgender athlete was allowed to compete and won two medals in the track and field state championship.\n\n\"Thanks to the leadership of President Trump, UPenn has agreed both to apologize for its past Title IX violations and to ensure that women’s sports are protected at the University for future generations of female athletes,” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement.\n\nThe DOE's Office for Civil Rights’ opened a Title IX investigation into Penn on Feb. 6 − a month into Trump's presidency − surrounding Thomas. Title IX is a law passed in 1972 that forbids sex discrimination in at any academic institution that receives federal funding.\n\nOn April 28, the office concluded the university violated Title IX and issued a resolution agreement proposal, or it would either refer the case to the Justice Department or begin another process to cut the school's federal funding. In March, the White House cut $175 million in federal funds for Penn related to the issue.\n\nThe university said in a statement it will comply with Executive Order 14168, Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government. University president J. Larry Jameson said it is a \"complex issue\" and he was pleased to reach the agreement for the investigation.\n\n\"Our commitment to ensuring a respectful and welcoming environment for all of our students is unwavering,\" Jameson said in the statement. \"At the same time, we must comply with federal requirements, including executive orders, and NCAA eligibility rules, so our teams and student-athletes may engage in competitive intercollegiate sports.\"\n\nJameson added the university has \"always followed – and continues to follow\" Title IX, as well as following NCAA and Ivy League policies. Penn will begin the process to review and update the women's swimming records set during Thomas' season on the team \"to indicate who would now hold the records under current eligibility guidelines.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/03/supreme-court-transgender-athletes-state-bans/84445716007/", "title": "Supreme Court to review banning transgender athletes from girls ...", "text": "WASHINGTON−The Supreme Court is diving back into the culture war issue of transgender rights, adding a potentially blockbuster case on transgender athletes to its next term.\n\nThe court's July 3 announcement that it will review Idaho's and West Virginia's bans on transgender athletes joining female sports teams came just weeks after the court’s conservative majority upheld Tennessee’s ban on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for minors.\n\nThe justices are likely to hear arguments in the fall and hand down a decision next year.\n\nMore than half the states have passed laws preventing transgender athletes from competing on female school sports teams, saying they are trying to prevent competitive advantages. The laws don't take into account someone's athletic ability or how far they are in transitioning to another gender.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who campaigned on the issue, has moved to cut off federal funding from schools that allow transgender athletes to compete against other athletes who match their gender identity.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania this week said it will prohibit transgender athletes from competing in women's sports and stripped the record of former swimmer Lia Thomas as part of an agreement with the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nPenn entered the resolution agreement July 1 to comply with Title IX, the department announced, as the university had been under investigation surrounding the case of Thomas, who became the first openly transgender athlete to win a NCAA Division I title.\n\nTwo-thirds of adults surveyed in February by Pew Research Center favor requiring trans athletes to compete on teams that match their sex assigned at birth.\n\nSupport was even higher than the 56% who don’t want gender transition care for minors.\n\nThe court’s 6-3 decision upholding Tennessee’s prohibition on such care left unanswered how its ruling might apply to bans on transgender participation in school sports, bans on transgender care for adults, and other issues.\n\nThe ideologically divided court said the ban does not discriminate against transgender people because the restrictions turn on age and the purpose of the medical treatment, not whether the person is transgender.\n\nOn the athletic bans, state officials said the justices need to address a “growing trend of males identifying as females competing against – and beating – females in women’s sports across the country.”\n\n\"It's time to return girls' sports to the girls and stop this misguided gender ideology once and for all,\" West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey said in a statement.\n\nLower courts blocked Idaho and West Virginia from enforcing their bans against a Boise State University student and a middle-school student in West Virginia.\n\nAttorneys for the Idaho and West Virginia students described their clients as no threat to other members of female sports teams.\n\nThe West Virginia student, for example, had never experienced the effects of testosterone and consistently placed in the back of the pack in cross country competitions.\n\nDespite never winning a competition during three seasons, her attorneys said, she still considered those years the best of her life.\n\n\"Everyone understands the value of participating in team athletics, for fitness, leadership, socialization, and myriad other benefits,\" said Sasha Buchert, an attorney with Lambda Legal.\n\nThe Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said West Virginia couldn’t enforce its ban against Becky Pepper-Jackson, who takes puberty blocking medication and has publicly identified as a girl since third grade.\n\nIn 2023, the Supreme Court denied the state's request to keep the ban against Pepper-Jackson in place while the underlying litigation continued. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented from that decision.\n\nIdaho’s ban, the first in the nation when passed in 2020, was challenged by Lindsay Hecox, a transgender woman who attended Boise State University.\n\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the ban likely discriminates against transgender female athletes. The court also said Idaho hadn’t shown how the ban would further the stated goal of greater opportunity for women athletes.\n\nHecox played soccer and ran on school club teams.

Now, the university must not allow transgender athletes to compete in female athletic programs, in addition to erasing Thomas' achievements.\n\nThe agreement comes as President Donald Trump has made it a point of his presidency to ban transgender athletes from competing female sports. He's passed executive orders and threatened legal action regarding the issue, and it's resulted in changes to college sports.\n\nDid NCAA allow transgender athletes in women's sports?\n\nYes. Thomas began transitioning in 2019 with hormone replacement therapy and followed the then-established NCAA and Ivy League rules. In 2022, the NCAA updated its transgender athlete policy. The update took a sport-by-sport approach that \"preserves opportunity for transgender student-athletes while balancing fairness, inclusion and safety for all who compete.\" At the time, it aligned with decisions by United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee, as well as International Olympic Committee.\n\nUnder the policy, at the start of the 2022-23 academic year sports calendar, transgender student-athletes had to document sport-specific testosterone levels at the beginning of their season, six months after the first and four weeks before championship selections.\n\nThomas won the NCAA Division I title in the women's 500-yard freestyle event in the spring of 2022 before the policy went into place.\n\nHow Trump Administration impacted transgender athletes\n\nTrump had emphasized during his president campaign his goal of blocking transgender athletes from competing in women's sports. On Feb. 5, less than a month into his presidency, Trump signed an executive order that bars transgender women and girls from playing on school sports, and it would cut off federal money for schools that don’t comply.\n\nThe executive order directs the Department of Education to pursue \"enforcement actions\" under Title IX, the federal law prohibiting discrimination based on sex at educational institutions that receive federal funding.\n\nIn April, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced legal action against Maine for refusing to ban transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. In June, Trump threatened fines in California and the Justice Department threatened to sue the state's public high schools after a transgender athlete was allowed to compete and won two medals at the track and field state championship.\n\nDid NCAA transgender athlete policy change?\n\nYes. One day after Trump's executive order, the NCAA changed it's policy to only allow student-athletes assigned female at birth could compete in women's sports. The policy was \"effective immediately and applies to all student-athletes regardless of previous eligibility reviews under the NCAA’s prior transgender participation policy.\"\n\nThe updated policy states a student-athlete assigned female at birth \"who has begun hormone therapy” may not compete on a women’s team, and if they participated in any NCAA competition, the team would not be eligible for NCAA championships. The organization did state individual schools have the autonomy to determine athletic participation on their campus.\n\n“We strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today's student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions. To that end, President Trump's order provides a clear, national standard,\" NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement.\n\nHow many transgender athletes are in the NCAA?\n\nLess than 10, according to what Baker told a Senate panel in December. There are about 510,000 men and women who compete in the NCAA.\n\nThe number reflects a similar percentage to how many transgender athletes compete in sports, starting at youth sports. According to the UCLA Williams Institute, transgender youth make up only 1.4% of American teenagers. A 2017 study of 17,000 young people found that about 1 in 10 transgender boys said they played sports, and it is roughly the same figure for transgender girls.\n\nLia Thomas records: What happens to them?\n\nWhat happens to Thomas' NCAA records is unclear. The NCAA did not respond to a request for comment. Thomas won the women's 500-yard freestyle event in 2022, and she tied for fifth in the women's 200-yard freestyle and eighth in the 100-yard freestyle.\n\nHowever, Thomas' records at Penn will be erased.

The policy is “effective immediately and applies to all student-athletes regardless of previous eligibility reviews under the NCAA’s prior transgender participation policy.”\n\nThe announcement comes one day after the Trump administration issued an executive order barring transgender women and girls from competing in women’s sports and directing agencies to withdraw federal funding from any academic institution that refuses to comply.\n\n“The NCAA is an organization made up of 1,100 colleges and universities in all 50 states that collectively enroll more than 530,000 student-athletes,” NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement. “We strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today's student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions.

Read more opinion on CNN.com\n\nCNN —\n\nBetween rounds of chemotherapy during my senior year of high school, as I battled Hodgkin’s lymphoma, I still practiced and competed in games on the boys’ varsity ice hockey team.\n\nChemo had completely worn my body down: I could only last a single, one-minute shift during each three-period game before the muscles in my legs began to feel as if they were pushing through my skin. But during those brief few minutes of playing time, I felt free, whole – as if my troubles did not exist.\n\nDanielle McLean Courtesy Danielle McLean\n\nAfter graduating from college, I moved from my parents’ home to an apartment on the outskirts of Boston. I had the support of my amazing family and a small group of friends. But I still felt isolated and sad, as if I were climbing an insurmountably steep mountain, alone.\n\nHockey took on even greater meaning in my life after I began my male-to-female gender transition over a decade ago. After I started transitioning, a large number of my childhood friends rejected me. The first couple of years during my transition were tough: During one particularly rough three-month period, I posed as a man at work while living my true identity outside it.\n\nThroughout my transition, I remained active in my sport. I tried playing adult men’s “beer league” hockey at first, but I didn’t feel safe physically, since I was playing against large bodies as my own body was rapidly changing and losing muscle mass.\n\nAnd playing in that league only added to my anxiety, since I didn’t feel comfortable expressing my true identity in front of my teammates. I was certain that my male teammates wouldn’t accept my transition. I felt like a complete outsider, as if I had something to hide every time I stepped in the locker room – whether I was covering up the physical changes I was experiencing because of transitioning, or lying about my life off the ice.\n\nTwo years after starting hormones, I joined a local adult women’s hockey team in the Boston area. That’s when everything started to change for me – emotionally and socially.\n\nMy teammates, with whom I shared a love of our sport, became a core part of my new social circle. Most of them knew that I was trans, but didn’t care. They accepted me as one of their own. For whatever reason – perhaps because our connection was not anchored in superficial ideals of masculinity – they loved me for me.\n\nThrough the recreational women’s hockey league that I competed in, I was able to build a new support system. That includes some of my best friends and my amazing partner of three years.\n\nOver the years, I’ve gone to teammates’ weddings and baby showers and supported them through some of the hardest moments of their lives. Our sports connection has provided me with community and a social support system. But it’s also given me much more: Women’s hockey has allowed me to escape my anxieties and let out my frustrations.\n\nTransitioning is one of the hardest things I’ve ever faced in my life. The outlet of women’s hockey saved me.\n\nA 2021 survey by the Trevor Project – a nonprofit focused on suicide prevention in LGBTQ youth – found that more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth considered taking their own lives over the previous year. I’ve personally spoken to several trans and gender nonconforming people who considered or attempted suicide. I even dissuaded one friend – a trans woman who announced their suicidal intentions on social media – from harming themself on the phone one difficult night.\n\nIn my experience, the anxieties that the vast majority of trans people feel are not based on regret, but rather on whether they will ever be accepted in their true identities. They also experience discrimination, harassment, poverty and challenges accessing transition-related medical treatment, as well as lacking a sense of affirmation. Today’s politics, in which our very identities are being targeted by malicious discourse and discriminatory legislation, have only made things worse.\n\nAbout a dozen states, including Oklahoma, Arizona, Iowa and Florida, have passed laws banning trans athletes from participating in sports teams consistent with their gender identity. These laws really only target young trans kids in school who are looking to express themselves, play sports with their friends or who like me, escape their anxieties through competition.\n\nPoliticians who try to make bogeymen of trans athletes make it seem as if they are taking over sports. But Utah’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox noted when he vetoed such a ban in his state recently, there are 75,000 kids playing high school sports in his state – only four are transgender, and just one plays girls’ sports.\n\n“Four kids who aren’t dominating or winning trophies or taking scholarships. Four kids who are just trying to find some friends and feel like they are a part of something. Four kids trying to get through each day. Rarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few,” Cox said in his remarks last month. “I don’t understand what they are going through or why they feel the way they do. But I want them to live.”\n\nHis veto was overridden by Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nGov. Cox is right that trans women and youth are not dominating women’s and girls’ sports the way that supporters of these bills would lead you to believe. One recent study by the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that trans women in the US Air Force had only slightly faster running speeds and indistinguishable muscle mass compared to their cisgender peers after two years of hormones. The report’s authors also said trans teens who took puberty blockers and estrogen probably have no advantage at all.\n\nPeople who oppose allowing trans girls and women to play on women and girls’ teams offer no realistic alternative. During the times I’ve competed against men since transitioning, I’ve been physically dominated in front of the net, and even tore my knee during one fight for the puck. And critics also leave out the fact that a lot of cisgender women are really, really good at sports: I’ve been playing hockey since I was 4 – it’s a huge part of my life. Yet, there are a number of players on my team who are larger and stronger than I am. I often have trouble keeping up with the much faster and more skilled women’s hockey talent I’ve played with and against.\n\nIn addition to playing for a regional women’s hockey league, I play on Team Trans, a collection of some 50 trans and gender nonconforming hockey players in the US and Canada. The team has only competed together a couple of times since its inception a few years ago because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the geographic distances between players, who are scattered throughout North America.\n\nI and other trans women would like to be the best we could be at the top levels of the sports we’ve spent our entire lives training for – that means competing with and against other dedicated women athletes. No athlete should be subjected to abuse from politicians, online trolls and international news outlets for competing in the sport they love. They should not have to feel as though they are letting down their community or being placed in a fishbowl of hate when they achieve a level of success.\n\nI don’t know how NCAA swimmer Lia Thomas has managed to cope with the venom directed at her after winning a single event at the NCAA D-1 National Swimming championships last month. Analyses breaking down her physique and her body chemistry have been splashed over the fronts of national publications and covered by news outlets, including CNN.\n\nThomas is just an athlete in her early 20s competing in the sport she has trained in for her entire life. While commentators claim to care about women’s sports, there’s little coverage of the successes of her non-trans competitors during those meets. She’s become the target of criticism from people as powerful as Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida and a possible future presidential contender. I can’t imagine it’s been easy for her.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe anti-trans invective against Thomas is offered as evidence that she, a person trying to battle gender dysphoria, is less than woman. This disgusting hate could send trans athletes down a dark emotional road that way too many have gone down in the past – a path of dejection and despair. I pray that this “debate” is only a flashpoint in time and that opportunities for trans athletes to find peace through sports – in the face of sometimes grueling life experiences – is not taken away.\n\nMore than anything, I want trans kids to be able – as I have – to find love and support through sports, even after their friends and family support dissolve off the field, court, pool or ice. I know that some trans people are staying in the closet and possibly contemplating suicide because of terrible, unfair laws being passed around the country.

Ron DeSantis hosted a press conference Tuesday in Jacksonville to sign a bill into law that will ban transgender women athletes from competing in high school girls' and college womens' sports teams.\n\nSB1028 is a wide-ranging education bill that includes school choice measures as well as the controversial transgender ban.\n\n\"We believe, in the state of Florida, in protecting the fairness and integrity of women's athletics,\" DeSantis said. \"In Florida, girls are going to play girls' sports and boys are going to play boys' sports ... We're going to go based off biology, not ideology.\"\n\nDig a little deeper: Florida Legislature passes bill banning transgender women and girls from female sports teams\n\nThe press conference took place at Trinity Christian Academy, where the governor threw ball caps into the audience. A podium read \"The Fairness in Women's Sports Act.\"\n\nDeSantis invited Selina Soule, a Connecticut high school track star, to speak on her experience, where she says she was sidelined by transgender girls competing against her.\n\n\"I've lost countless opportunities over the last few years,\" she said. \"Allowing male athletes to compete in girls' sports shatters dreams.\"\n\nShe thanked DeSantis, who added later that Soule may be looking into transferring to a Florida university.\n\nBill critics have warned that the ban provision could hurt the state's chances at hosting large sports conferences or securing corporate sponsorships. But DeSantis told the crowd that he's not concerned and that the most important thing is to \"protect our girls,\" and that he'd do that over a financial deal \"every day and twice on Sunday.\"\n\nThe ban has also drawn sharp criticism from LGBTQ+ advocacy groups as well as Democratic lawmakers.\n\n“It’s shameful that Republican lawmakers are wasting tax dollars attacking Florida’s most vulnerable communities rather than prioritizing the issues that impact everyday people’s lives,” State Sen. Shevrin Jones said in a statement asking the governor to veto the bill as it approached veto deadline.\n\nShortly after the press conference ended, the Human Rights Campaign announced it would be filing a lawsuit to block the ban. Equality Florida also announced a series of rallies against the law across the state.\n\n“We need to be clear about the message of this hateful bill: Governor DeSantis and GOP leaders in the legislature are not concerned about athletics, they simply don’t believe that transgender people exist,” Equality Florida director Gina Duncan said.\n\nDuncan leads the group's Transgender Equality department. “That is the kind of erasure that makes life more dangerous for those who are already at the highest risk of violence,\" she said. \"This bill is shameful, violent, and just made the world less safe for our most vulnerable young people.”\n\nHumanity of transgender athletes: High school sports documentary shows importance of transgender inclusion\n\nI'm a lifelong competitive athlete and a mom: Transgender athletes aren't a threat to women's sports\n\nI was the fastest girl in Connecticut: But transgender athletes made it an unfair fight.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter about the timing of DeSantis' bill signing, on the first day of Pride month, the governor replied that he met personnel from Trinity Christian at a football game.\n\n\"It was nothing more than that,\" he said. \"They had a venue to offer ...

According to the policy, athletes who have begun hormone therapy will be allowed to participate in workouts, practices and team activities \"at the discretion\" of the school at which the athlete is enrolled, but not allowed in interscholastic competition.\n\n\"With the exception of competitive cheer and competitive dance, the NAIA created separate categories for male and female participants,\" the policy reads. \"Each NAIA sport includes some combination of strength, speed, and stamina, providing competitive advantages for male student-athletes. As a result, the NAIA policy for transgender student-athletes applies to all sports except for competitive cheer and competitive dance, which are open to all students.\"\n\nThe policy goes in effect in August, to coincide with the start of the 2024 sports calendar.\n\nThe policy was enacted in a vote Monday at the NAIA's national convention in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nTransgender athlete participation has become a polarizing political issue dividing the country. Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), issued a statement Monday criticizing the NAIA for its decision.\n\n\"Today, the NAIA decided to bar an entire category of people from competition simply because of a right-wing outrage campaign that purposefully misrepresents and distorts the realities of transgender athletes while doing nothing to support women’s sports,\" Robinson said in the statement. \"The benefits of sports to the mind, body, and spirit are well known. Every student, including transgender student athletes, deserve the opportunity to be a part of a team and to learn about sportsmanship, self-discipline, perseverance and more.\"\n\nSouth Carolina coach Dawn Staley, who led her team to an NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament championship Sunday, spoke out in support of transgender women competing in women's sports and said she is in favor of allowing them to compete.\n\n\"The NAIA should listen to Hall of Famers like Coach Dawn Staley, and do everything it can to expand access to athletics, including to correct the long-standing lack of resources and support for women’s athletics, instead of engaging in even more discrimination,\" Robinson continued in the statement. \"The chilling message this sends not just to other sanctioning bodies but also to youth sports leagues across the country is dangerous and it must be stopped in its tracks.\"\n\nIn January 2022, the NCAA, which is a wholly separate operation from the NAIA, revised its policy for transgender athletes to align with the U.S. and International Olympic Committees. The NCAA's transgender policy has been in place since 2010 and calls for one year of testosterone suppression treatment and documentation of testosterone levels to be submitted prior to championship competitions.\n\nWhen asked about whether he sees any changes coming to the NCAA’s policy, NCAA president Charlie Baker said Sunday the current policy is “reasonably consistent” with policies from governing boards across the country and internationally. He said the NCAA policy has been “adjusted several times and we’ll just continue to act on that based on data that’s available and also how we fit into the grander scheme of what’s going on with sports generally.”\n\nA study in 2019 conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that an average of 1.8% of high school students identify as transgender. When coupled with a 2017 study from the HRC — which estimated that just 14% of transgender boys and 12% of transgender girls participate in youth sports — data suggests the number of transgender athletes participating in college athletics to be quite small.\n\nThis issue has sparked legislation across dozens of states seeking to prevent the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports. In April 2023, the Republican-majority House passed a bill that blocked transgender girls and women from participating in school athletic programs for female athletes.\n\nAccording to data compiled by the Movement Advancement Project, 24 states have passed laws banning transgender youth from participating in sports on teams that match their gender identity. Alaska also has regulations on trans youth in sports.\n\nJust Wednesday, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers vetoed a bill that would have banned transgender and gender nonconforming youth from participating on school athletic teams that align with their gender identity.\n\nContributing: USA TODAY Sports reporter Lindsay Schnell from Cleveland; Laura Schulte and Kinsey Crowley, USA TODAY NETWORK", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/25/ohio-gov-mike-dewine-statement-transgender-athlete-bill/5345326001/", "title": "Ohio Gov.

Schools that knowingly violated these rules could find themselves facing civil lawsuits.\n\n“This issue is best addressed outside of government, through individual sports leagues and athletic associations, including the Ohio High School Athletic Association, who can tailor policies to meet the needs of their member athletes and member institutions,\" DeWine said in a statement Friday morning.\n\nThat statement also applies to standalone bills pending in the Ohio House and Senate that would ban transgender girls and women from female sports, a spokesman confirmed.\n\nBut DeWine stopped short of promising a veto, and a spokesman said it would be \"premature\" to comment on whether the Republican governor would veto any bills not on his desk.\n\nRepublican-led legislatures in several states have introduced bills to ban or restrict transgender athletes' participation in girls and women's sports, saying such athletes have inherent biological advantages over their cisgender competitors.\n\nThe amendment to Senate Bill 187, passed largely along party lines, would need Senate approval before heading to DeWine's desk. A veto would tank the college athlete name, image and likeness language that supporters, including Ohio State University, wanted passed by July 1 to be competitive with other states.\n\nBut the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate. Senate Republicans criticized the addition of the amendment to an otherwise noncontroversial, bipartisan bill. They added the NIL language to a separate bill Thursday night.\n\nDeWine, a Republican, had not weighed in on the issue before Friday. The Ohio High School Athletic Association has a process for approving transgender athletes to play.\n\nThe process, approved by member schools in 2014, permits transgender girls to compete following a year of hormone therapy or test results that show \"sound medical evidence that she does not possess physical (bone structure, muscle mass, testosterone, hormonal, etc.) or physiological advantages over genetic females of the same age group.\"\n\nAbout 400,000 kids play on middle and high school sports teams in Ohio each year.

What ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThailand’s Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has temporarily stepped aside as the country’s leader but remains its defense minister, according to a government spokesman.\n\nThe unusual leadership reshuffle follows a ruling by the Constitutional Court of Thailand on Wednesday, which ordered Prayut to stand aside while it considers if he breached the eight-year term limit recently written into the constitution.\n\nPrayut took the role of prime minister after a military coup in 2014 before winning a controversial general election in 2019.\n\nIn the meantime, he ordered the kingdom’s constitution to be re-written, banning the prime minister from serving more than eight years in office. But the question now is whether Prayut has breached his own limit.\n\nEarlier this week the court accepted a petition signed by 172 opposition lawmakers that claims Prayut’s rule started in 2014, when he took power in the coup. The court will also likely consider if his term officially began in 2017, when the constitution was rewritten, or even 2019, after the election.\n\nFive out of nine constitutional court judges agreed on Wednesday that Prayut should be suspended while the court considers the matter, but didn’t provide a timeline for the ruling. The court gave Prayut 15 days to submit a counter statement as to why he should keep the job, once he formally receives the court paper.\n\nIn a statement, Prayut’s office said he respects the court’s decision.\n\nThe order “will not affect the administration of the nation, work carried out by civil servants or the government’s ongoing policies,” the statement said.\n\nWho is in charge now?\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan will step in acting as prime minister while the court mulls its final verdict, government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri told reporters on Wednesday. Prawit himself is former army chief and a longtime supporter of the Thai monarchy.\n\nFresh elections are due by May next year under the constitution, but the sitting prime minister still has the power to call early elections by dissolving the elected House of Representatives.\n\nPrayut has survived four no-confidence votes in the past months, and looked set to cling on to power until the elections, said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok.\n\nBut critics say it is time for him to go.\n\n“There have been some economic mismanagement, politics is still polarized, since over the past eight years since he’s been prime minister – or since he’s been called as the prime minister – Thailand has not done well,” Thitinan said.\n\nWhile youth-led protests seem to have died down as of late, he said this was because some of the movement’s leaders had been prosecuted and grievances over the Prayut’s government remain.\n\nWhy is Prayut unpopular?\n\nPrayut’s rule as a military coup leader turned prime minister has been marred with growing authoritarianism and widening inequality.\n\nThe former military chief came to power in a bloodless coup in 2014 that overthrew Yingluck Shinawatra’s scandal-laden government following six months of civil unrest and violent street protests.\n\nBut shortly after taking over, Prayut banned all political campaigning including political gatherings of more than five people. During his leadership, hundreds of activists have been arrested and charged under draconian laws such as sedition or the lese majeste – which prohibits criticism of the royal family.\n\nIn 2020, young people across the country defied threats from the military-backed government to take to the streets and call for Prayut’s resignation. The mass protests stemmed from failed promises to restore democracy, and what activists say is a repression of civil rights and freedoms.\n\nThe military government’s mismanagement in handling of the coronavirus pandemic and economy, nepotism and lack of transparency and accountability, also amplified calls for Prayut to step down.\n\nDissatisfaction over the military government and the kingdom’s monarchy continued well into 2021.\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn, who assumed the throne in 2016 and was crowned in May 2019, is believed to spend much of his time overseas and has been largely absent from public life in Thailand as the country grappled with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSince becoming King, billions of dollars worth of assets held by the Thai Crown have been transferred to Vajiralongkorn, asserting his control of royal finances and vastly increasing his personal wealth, which drew ire among the public who are required to revere the monarchy.", "authors": ["Kocha Olarn Kathleen Magramo", "Kocha Olarn", "Kathleen Magramo"], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/south-and-central-asia/961707/thailand-election-winner-stopped", "title": "Why Thailand's election winner was stopped from becoming prime ...", "text": "Pita Limjaroenrat’s bid to be nominated as Thailand’s new prime minister has ended, despite his victory in the general election.\n\nPita’s Move Forward Party had promised “deep structural reforms” to how the Southeast Asian country of more than 70 million people is run, said CNN.\n\nThis manifesto proved popular and the party leader “swept to victory” in the election in May as voters “rejected years of military rule”, said the BBC.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

That party was led by another “young, charismatic”, US-educated politician, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit.\n\nAfter Thanathorn’s party was dissolved for allegedly accepting an “illegitimate” loan, it was replaced by the new Move Forward Party, which became popular among young voters who wanted to end nearly 10 years of conservative military rule.\n\nPita was elected leader in March 2020. Alongside his popularity among the young, his reputation for “technocratic vision” appeared to have won him the support of more conservative voters, Napon Jatusripitak, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told The Guardian.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nHowever, his path to the top job was blocked by conservatives.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nElections in Thailand are conducted under a constitution, which was written by the military in 2017. Under the rules, Pita needed the votes of more than half of the 749 members in parliament’s two chambers to become prime minister.\n\nBut the 249 members of the Senate, who were appointed by the previous military junta, get a vote in electing the prime minister. This feature of the constitution is designed to allow the “military-appointed” Senate to “play the role of spoiler”, said Simpson in The Conversation.\n\nPita “always faced an uphill battle”, said the BBC, as there was “little evidence” that the 249 senators would support him. Last week, Pita secured only 324 votes in all, 51 short of the required number.\n\nFollowing accusations that Pita violated election laws by allegedly holding shares in a “long-defunct” media company, he was “dramatically suspended” from parliament by the constitutional court, said the BBC, “forcing him to leave the debating chamber”.\n\nThe “bitter battle” took a new turn yesterday, said The Independent, when legislators agreed to block a second vote on whether Pita should be prime minister. Out of the 715 members of parliament present for the vote, 395 voted to block the second nomination.\n\nWhy is he opposed?\n\nPita won on the promise of “major reforms”, said the BBC, including a pledge to amend Thailand’s “strict royal defamation laws”. This pitted him against the unelected senate and other conservatives who say he “poses a threat to the monarchy”.\n\nMove Forward has threatened other vested interests. It “seeks to reduce the influence of the military”, said Al Jazeera, which has staged more than a dozen coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, and Pita has also spoken out against “big business monopolies”, said the news site.\n\nWhat might happen next?\n\nThe stumbling blocks in his path have not come as much of a surprise for Pita. He said on Tuesday that he was expecting “pre-planned” obstacles, describing efforts by the establishment to stop him as like a “broken record”.\n\nHe addressed parliament on Wednesday to bid “farewell,” while the constitutional court’s investigation is underway. “I think Thailand has changed and will never be the same since 14 May,” he said, in reference to the date of his election victory. “The people have won halfway, there’s another half to go.”\n\nHowever, said CNN, over the last two decades the nation’s constitutional court has “repeatedly ruled in favor of the establishment, dissolving several parties that had challenged the political elite”.\n\nMeanwhile, the mood among Move Forward’s supporters is one of anger, noted Al Jazeera. Hundreds of Pita’s followers protested peacefully in Bangkok against the efforts to stop him. “What’s the point of having elections when you’re going to throw democracy down the toilet?” asked one.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/middleeast/india-islam-comments-gulf-mime-intl", "title": "Why India is in damage-control mode with Arab nations | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE and New Delhi, India CNN —\n\nIt took India less than 24 hours to discipline two politicians after a controversy that had been brewing at home for over a week caught the attention of its Arab trade partners.\n\nIndia’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday suspended a spokesperson and expelled another official after derogatory comments they made about Islam’s prophet led to an outcry in Arab countries.\n\n“India was taken aback by the response,” said Kabir Taneja, a fellow with the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. “Communal issues are not new in India and in previous cases, we have not had such a response [from Arab states].”\n\nOn May 26, BJP spokeswoman Nupur Sharma made comments on an Indian news channel about Prophet Mohammad that were deemed offensive and Islamophobic. Qatar, Kuwait and Iran summoned India’s ambassadors, and the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation issued statements of condemnation. At least 14 countries have so far condemned the remarks.\n\nSharma said on Twitter she had “said some things” in response to comments made about a Hindu god but it was “never my intention to hurt anyone’s religious feelings.”\n\n“If my words have caused discomfort or hurt religious feelings of anyone whatsoever, I hereby unconditionally withdraw my statement,” she said.\n\nMost Indian news outlets reporting on the story didn’t directly quote Sharma’s original comments.\n\nNaveen Jindal, a BJP leader, was expelled from the party over comments he made about Islam on social media, the BJP office said.\n\nAnalysts said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has walked a tight rope between keeping his Muslim international allies happy while pushing his party’s Hindu nationalist agenda at home.\n\n“Modi has tried very hard to prevent his party’s domestic political agenda from spilling over and poisoning India’s relations with the Gulf states,” said Hasan Alhasan, a Bahrain-based fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies who researches Indian foreign policy in the Gulf. “The extent to which Sharma’s comments have clouded India’s relations with the Gulf states is unprecedented, and that’s of course because she is, or was, the spokesperson of the BJP.”\n\nTaneja said the Indian government has realized that a lot of religious rhetoric “has been taking place for a while and has been going unnoticed, but it will not go so anymore.”\n\nThe hashtag “Anyone but the prophet, oh Modi” was trending on Twitter in all six Gulf countries, and as far away as Algeria, with residents in Muslim nations calling for a boycott of Indian products. Oman’s outspoken Grand Mufti Sheikh Ahmad Al-Khalili, the chief religious figure in the country, called Sharma’s comments “a war on all Muslims” and a matter that “calls for all Muslims to rise as one nation.”\n\nOffending depictions of Islam’s prophet have in the past led to mass boycotts, diplomatic crises, riots and even terror attacks.\n\nThe controversy comes as Gulf states and India look to significantly enhance their economic partnership. India, the world’s third-biggest importer of oil, looks to the Middle East for 65% of its crude imports. On the other hand, the Asian nation sends millions of workers to the Gulf states who send home billions of dollars in remittances.\n\n“There are over 8 million non-resident Indians across the Gulf. The Gulf states are key sources of India’s oil and gas imports, and bilateral trade is over $100 billion,” said Alhasan. “So it is a very important set of relationships from the Indian perspective.”\n\nThe UAE alone, where some 3.5 million Indians live, accounts for 33% of remittances to India, at more than $20 billion a year.\n\nThe UAE has singled out India among seven other nations as its future economic partner. India’s Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal has said the Gulf nation plans to invest $100 billion in his country, in part for manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\nThis year, India signed a free trade agreement with the UAE, its first in more than a decade, and has eyed the rest of the Gulf states for similar agreements, according to news reports. The UAE pact aims to see annual trade rise to $100 billion in five years and contribute to the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs in India.\n\nAbdulaziz Sager, chairman and founder of the Gulf Research Center in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, said that nature of India-Saudi relations gives Riyadh political and economic leverage over the Indian government.\n\n“I don’t think that will have a jeopardizing effect in terms of the economic or political relations because India is still an important country,” said Sager. “It is an important relationship but Saudi Arabia is not going to accept any sort of insult to the Prophet or undermining of religious Islamic issues,” said Sager.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 million Indians in Saudi Arabia, according to Indian officials.\n\nTaneja said India knows the clout Gulf states have over it because of the diaspora in those countries. “That is why we saw such a brisk response from the government.”\n\nCNN’s Esha Mitra contributed to this report.\n\nThe digest\n\nBiden’s meeting with Saudi crown prince pushed back to July\n\nA meeting between US President Joe Biden and Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), is now expected to happen next month, according to an administration official.\n\nBackground: CNN reported earlier that Biden and the crown prince were planning to meet at the end of June as part of a broader summit of Gulf countries. Officials said the July trip would allow for more time to plan and set a schedule and agenda. Biden on Friday defended the prospect of meeting with MBS.\n\nWhy it matters: An in-person meeting with MBS would mark the first time Biden directly engages with the de facto Saudi leader since taking office. Biden has so far opted instead to speak directly with King Salman, the crown prince’s father. The meeting would represent a turnabout for Biden, who once suggested that Saudi Arabia be made a “pariah.” Two key deals were also reached last week – OPEC announcing it would increase oil production and the extension of a truce in Yemen – that laid the groundwork for the meeting between Biden and the crown prince.\n\nIran’s Khamenei says unrest caused by foreign ‘enemies’ trying to overthrow Islamic Republic\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday that recent protests across the country are caused by foreign “enemies” seeking to overthrow the Iranian regime.\n\nBackground: Protests have in recent weeks erupted across Iran over skyrocketing inflation. Anti-government demonstrations also broke out last month after a 10-story commercial building located in the city of Abadan collapsed and killed at least 37. “Today, the enemies’ most important hope for striking a blow at the country is based on popular protests,” Khamenei said in a televised speech on the 33rd anniversary of the death of the leader of Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.\n\nWhy it matters: Iran has suffered one economic blow after another amid a strong budget deficit, rising food prices, and uncertainties about its main oil buyer China amid looming sanctions on Russia’s oil after its invasion of Ukraine. Protesters have accused the government of negligence and have repeatedly chanted slogans against the Islamic Republic and its rulers.\n\nBriton sentenced to 15 years in prison in Iraq for artifact smuggling\n\nA retired British geologist was sentenced to 15 years in prison by an Iraqi court on Monday for attempting to smuggle ancient artifacts out of the country.\n\nBackground: 66-year-old James Fitton was arrested in March by Iraqi authorities at Baghdad airport for carrying small fragments and ancient pottery in his luggage. Fitton’s lawyer said that he did not know that the fragments were artifacts, and that he will appeal the verdict on the grounds that there was no criminal intent.\n\nWhy it matters: Iraq’s ancient heritage has been hurt by years of conflict, and many of the country’s artifacts were looted amid the fighting, especially after the US invasion of 2003. The Iraqi government has been on a quest to locate and retrieve its many lost treasures, including those previously smuggled out of the country.\n\nAround the region\n\nExtreme drought has wreaked havoc in Iraq, causing sandstorms that have sent thousands of people to the hospital. But for some archaeologists it has been a temporary blessing.\n\nAs water levels in the Mosul reservoir dropped late last year, an ancient city emerged, and scientists rushed to study it before it disappeared underwater again.\n\nA team of German and Iraqi-Kurdish archeologists was in a race against time after the 3400-year-old city under the Tigris River in Iraq’s Kurdistan region was uncovered this year.\n\nAs the water levels began to rise again, scientists rushed to excavate and document what is believed to be the urban center of the Mittani Empire, which stretched from northern Iraq through Syria and into Turkey.\n\nThe researchers, who announced their findings last week, were able to map a massive fortification of walls, storage facilities and an industrial complex. The team was stunned at how well preserved the city walls were, made from sun-dried mud bricks.\n\n“This good preservation is due to the fact that the city was destroyed in an earthquake around 1350 BC, during which the collapsing upper parts of the walls buried the buildings,” the researchers said in a statement.\n\nTo prepare for the city’s looming reflooding, excavated buildings were covered with plastic sheeting and gravel fill. The city is once again underwater, waiting to be rediscovered.\n\nBy Mohammed Abdelbary\n\nPhoto of the day\n\nSamaritan worshippers lift up Torah scrolls as they gather at dawn on June 5 to pray on top of Mount Gerizim near the northern West Bank city of Nablus.

They are furious over what they view as a military coup and say they don't accept any of the military's recent decisions.\n\n\"We will not leave until Morsi comes back,\" said Mohammad Ibrahim, a pharmacist, who wants Morsi to be released from detention. \"We believe in democracy of the West, and I came here because I voted for Morsi.\"\n\nCrowds poured into the rally taking place outside a Cairo mosque as the sun set over the capital. Ibrahim had been there for more than a week with others who sleep in tents along the road where demonstrators gather.\n\n\"The people wanted Morsi, and voted for him,\" said Sayyed Al-Azab, an engineer, who came with his wife to the rally. Azab said he was not just demonstrating in support of Morsi, but to protect all votes in elections since the country rose up against autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011.\n\nOn Wednesday, Egypt's army chief Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi announced the nation would embark on a new transition with a plan that suspended the nation's constitution, dissolved the elected legislature and called for fresh presidential and parliamentary elections. Morsi was replaced by head of the High Constitutional Court, Adly Mansour, who is serving as interim president.\n\nMiles away from Nasr City in Tahrir Square, Morsi's opponents backed the army's decisions. They refuse to consider the army's actions a coup, claiming the military simply acted on the will of the people. More than a million people rose up since June 30 to demand Morsi resign and call for early elections.\n\n\"We're here to tell the world that our revolution is about the people, not the army,\" said Mona Youssef, who came to Tahrir Square on Sunday evening with her family.\n\nAs Youssef spoke, military planes flew in crisp formations over the square, putting on a coordinated show for those below. The planes trailed streams of black, red and white smoke for the colors of the Egyptian flag as demonstrators erupted in celebration.\n\nProtesters here criticized the United States because they believe President Obama supports Morsi. One poster showed Obama's face crossed out with a giant red X that said: \"Stop supporting terrorism.\"\n\n\"I like the American people,\" said Islam Mohammad, 22, who just graduated from college. \"But American politics don't respect Egyptians.\"\n\nAs tension persists between opposing political camps, there is a risk of renewed violence. At least 36 people have died in clashes nationwide that started Friday. Some of the violence erupted in central Cairo after Morsi supporters demonstrated near anti-Morsi crowds, prompting the two sides to battle.\n\nMansour has called for the divisions to end and declared that his top priority is national reconciliation.\n\nBut there are other disputes, and political confusion. On Saturday night, Egyptian officials walked backed from earlier reports that opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei would be named the new interim prime minister.\n\nSenior opposition official Munir Fakhry Abdelnur told the Associated Press that the hard-line Islamist Nour Party refused ElBaradei's appointment, resulting in the reversal.\n\nThe vice chairman of the Nour Party, Bassem El-Zaraka, told Egypt's Al-Hayat TV that ElBaradei's vision of a secular state does not match the Nour Party's vision, particularly when it comes to sharia law.\n\nThe rift underscores the lack of consensus among various political groups that is permeating a second transitional period in the past two years after Hosni Mubarak was overthrown in 2011. A group of ruling generals governed for more than 16 months until Morsi was elected president in June 2012.\n\n\"You have a very fragile democratic experience in Egypt,\" said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics. \"We are back to square one.\"\n\nContributing: Jennifer Collins in Berlin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/09/24/uk-supreme-court-rules-boris-johnsons-suspension-parliament-unlawful/2426306001/", "title": "UK Supreme Court rules Boris Johnson's Parliament suspension ...", "text": "LONDON – Britain's highest court ruled Tuesday that Prime Minster Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks was unlawful.\n\nThe decision could have wide-ranging political ramifications for Britain's efforts to leave the European Union – Brexit – and Johnson, who is attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

He has vowed not to do that, though he says the government will obey the law.\n\nThe suspension of Parliament sparked several legal challenges, to which lower courts have given contradictory rulings.

If he is removed from office, a snap election will be called.\n\nPrime Minister Han Duck-soo, who was appointed by Yoon, became acting president while Yoon remains in office but with his presidential powers suspended halfway through his five-year term.\n\nHan promised his utmost efforts to ensure stability after Yoon's impeachment. \"I will give all my strength and efforts to stabilise the government,\" Han told reporters.\n\nYoon is the second conservative president in a row to be impeached in South Korea. Park Geun-hye was removed from office in 2017. Yoon survived a first impeachment vote last weekend, when his party largely boycotted the vote, depriving parliament of a quorum.\n\n\"Although I am stopping for now, the journey I have walked with the people over the past two and a half years toward the future must never come to a halt. I will never give up,\" Yoon said.\n\nRegarded as a tough political survivor but increasingly isolated, he has been dogged by personal scandals and strife, an unyielding opposition and rifts within his own party.\n\nProtesters backing Yoon's impeachment leapt for joy near parliament at the news, waving colourful LED sticks as music pumped out. By contrast, a rally of Yoon supporters emptied following the news.\n\nOpposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung told protesters near parliament that they should fight together so Yoon was removed as quickly as possible. \"You, the people, made it. You are writing a new history,\" he told the jubilant crowds braving subfreezing temperatures.\n\n'Fight to the end'\n\nThe impeachment motion was carried as at least 12 members of Yoon's People Power Party joined the opposition parties, which control 192 seats in the 300-member national assembly, clearing the two-thirds threshold needed for impeachment.\n\nThe number of lawmakers supporting impeachment was 204, with 85 against, three abstentions and eight invalid ballots.\n\nYoon shocked the nation late on Dec. 3 when he gave the military sweeping emergency powers to root out what he called \"anti-state forces\" and overcome obstructionist political opponents.\n\nHe rescinded the declaration barely six hours later, after parliament defied troops and police to vote against the decree. But it plunged the country into a constitutional crisis and triggered widespread calls for him to step down on the grounds that he had broken the law.\n\nYoon later apologised to the nation but defended his decision and resisted calls to resign.\n\nOpposition parties launched the fresh impeachment vote, supported by large demonstrations.\n\nYoon is also under criminal investigation for alleged insurrection over the martial law declaration, and authorities have banned him from travelling overseas.\n\nIn another defiant speech on Thursday, Yoon vowed to \"fight to the end\", defending his martial law decree as necessary to overcome political deadlock and protect the country from domestic politicians who he said were undermining democracy.\n\n'Race in the courts'\n\nYoon's impeachment is unlikely to end South Korea's political turmoil, analysts warned.\n\n\"It is not even the beginning of the end,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.\n\nOpposition leader Lee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in 2022 and is favoured to win an election to replace him, is also in legal jeopardy, with a conviction on appeal and other rulings pending that could disqualify him from office.\n\n\"So before the final race in the polls, there will be a race in the courts,\" Easley said.\n\nIllustrating the divisions the political crisis has stirred on the streets, one Yoon supporter said he would leave the country if the Constitutional Court backed Yoon's impeachment.\n\n\"It breaks my heart and makes me feel despair to see lawmakers trying to depose the president,\" said Lee Sang-eun, a 69-year-old retired professor.\n\nBut a resident at an anti-Yoon rally called for him to resign. \"For the sake of the people of South Korea, and for this nation, I hope for a swift... resolution,\" said 46-year-old Lee Hoy-yeol.\n\nWhen first elected, Yoon was widely welcomed in Washington and other Western capitals for his rhetoric defending global democracy and freedom, but critics said this masked growing problems at home.\n\nHe clashed with opposition lawmakers, calling them \"anti-state forces\". Press freedom organisations have criticised his heavy-handed approach to media coverage that he deems negative.\n\nThe crisis and ensuing uncertainty have shaken financial markets and threatened to undermine South Korea's reputation as a stable, democratic success story.\n\nSouth Korea's finance minister will convene an emergency meeting on the economy on Sunday afternoon, the ministry said.\n\nThe country's foreign minister met with the U.S. ambassador while other senior diplomats met with the ambassadors from Japan and China to reassure them that South Korea's foreign policy would remain unchanged, the foreign ministry said.\n\n(Reporting by Ju-min Park, Joyce Lee and Hyonhee Shin; Additional reporting by Josh Smith, Hyunsu Yim, Jack Kim, Jisoo Kim and Daewoung Kim; Editing by William Mallard and Ed Davies)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/07/scotus-already-influencing-midterms-look-liz-truss-5-things-podcast/8009394001/", "title": "SCOTUS already influencing midterms, a look at Liz Truss: 5 Things ...", "text": "On today's episode of the 5 Things podcast: How the Supreme Court is already influencing the November midterm elections\n\nSupreme Court correspondent John Fritze explains.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 7th of September, 2022. Today, the Supreme Court's impact on midterm elections, plus a suspect remains at large in Canada's stabbing massacre, and more.\n\nHere are some of the top headlines:\n\nFour people were killed in California wildfires over Labor Day weekend. Some 4,000 firefighters are battling 14 large fires around the state amid record breaking high temperatures. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Chinese president, Xi Jinping, will meet at a summit next week in Uzbekistan. It'll be Xi's first foreign trip in two and a half years. And Alabama remains on top of college football's USA TODAY Sports AFCA coaches poll this week. Defending national champion, Georgia, moves up to No. 2 after destroying Oregon in its opening game.\n\n♦\n\nFrom rulings on voting restrictions approved after the 2020 election to rethinking the Voting Rights Act, federal courts are having a big impact on voting. Supreme Court Correspondent John Fritze, explains how the courts are already influencing the November midterm elections.\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nSo a lot of the focus right now is on 2024 and these big cases that are coming down the pike, but there's also, not the Supreme Court, but lower courts are having an impact on the election we're about to have here in a few months. And the way that that's coming up is you remember after the 2020 election, there were all these laws that were passed about restricting access to the ballot, things like reducing the use of drop boxes, making it more difficult to file an absentee ballot and so forth. Supporters of these policies say that, look, things got out of hand and it opens up the election process to fraud and they want to make sure people have integrity or feel like they have confidence with the voting system. Opponents say that that's bunk and that there really isn't any evidence of fraud and that what's really going on here are people trying to depress turnout and specifically depress Democratic turnout.\n\nSo that's the debate around that, but what's happening is that a lot of the litigation that came after these laws were passed is basically being put on hold. And that's because the Supreme Court handed down this idea many years ago that courts should not get involved with changing the rules of an election close to the election, which I think that makes sense. I think everybody can understand the court shouldn't be coming in at the last minute changing the rules that confuses everything. The challenge is, and where the debate is, is what is the last minute? And courts are saying that, \"Hey, November is still a few months off here, but that basically the last minute is upon us.\" And that is because of poll training and all sorts of reasons why they say that the court should not be ruling against these restrictions.\n\nThe bottom line is that you have a lot of these states that pass these controversial restrictions, those restrictions will be in place for the midterm elections in a lot of cases, even if the courts, at some point in the future say, Hey, you can't do that. It's unconstitutional or it's against the law. It appears like they'll be in place for the midterm election. And this is things like, you talked about drop boxes, it's also in a number of states, this idea of line warming, which is handing out water bottles and food to long lines at polling places.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFor John's full story, you can find a link in today's show description.\n\n♦\n\nAuthorities said yesterday they still have not found the remaining suspect in Canada's stabbing massacre. Canadian police surrounded a house on the same indigenous reserve where some of the Sunday morning attacks took place in Saskatchewan, and an emergency alert yesterday warned the suspect might be in the area. But police said, later in the day, that Miles Sanderson was not in the community. He's one of two brothers believed to have killed 10 people and injured 18 in the stabbings. His older brother, Damien, was found dead on Monday near one of at least 13 locations where the stabbings took place. Attacks happened in James Smith Cree Nation, an indigenous community, and the nearby town of Weldon, both in the central part of the Western Canadian province.\n\nAuthorities say that Miles Sanderson, the last remaining suspect, was last seen in the city of Regina, about a hundred miles north of the US border. Police say he should be considered armed and dangerous. Police had already been looking for him since May when he skipped a parole meeting. He has dozens of convictions for assaults in other violent crimes. A manhunt has also extended across neighboring provinces, Alberta and Manitoba. Each is close to the size of Texas. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, said he's offering federal resources to Saskatchewan in the wake of the tragedy.\n\nJustin Trudeau:\n\nIt's why it's so important that everyone follow the instructions of the local authorities to do everything they can to keep safe. The federal government, we're ensuring whatever resources are needed by the police of jurisdiction are received to be able to put an end to this situation and to allow people to grieve without fear. To start the healing process it will take an awfully, awfully long time because this was an incredibly horrific and traumatic event.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nCBC news in Canada is reporting that the country's parole board is reviewing its decision to release Miles Sanderson from prison. A motive for Sunday's killings is still unclear, but Indigenous leaders and others in the community have said they could be drug related.\n\n♦\n\nThe UN Atomic Watchdog Agency urged Russia and Ukraine, yesterday, to create a so-called nuclear safety and security protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia power plant. Days after leading an inspection trip to the facility, International Atomic Energy Agency Chief Rafael Grossi told the UN Security Council that the international community is playing with fire.\n\nRafael Grossi:\n\nHits that this facility has received, and that I could personally see and assess together with my experts, is simply unacceptable. We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place. This is why in our report, we are proposing the establishing, the establishment, sorry, of a nuclear safety and a security protection zone limited to the perimeter and the plant itself.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nRussia took over the plant during its invasion of Ukraine, though, it's still being run by Ukrainian engineers. Global leaders have expressed concern of potential nuclear disaster with shelling around the facility. The IAEA found evidence of that on its trip and said it should stop immediately, something UN Secretary-General António Guterres echoed. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for violence near the plant, but when asked by reporters about establishing a de-militarized zone, Russia's UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said the proposal is not serious and that there is not currently any Russian military equipment at the facility.\n\nUkrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, called for the IAEA to back his push for Russian forces to withdraw from the area. The plant was, again, knocked off Ukraine's electrical grid this week. It typically relies on power from the outside to run critical cooling systems that keep its reactors and spent fuel from overheating. A loss of those systems could lead to a nuclear meltdown.\n\nThe IAEA did not blame either side for Zaporizhzhia shelling, but it expressed serious concerns about power outages. It also warned that Ukrainian staff working there under Russian military occupation is under constant high stress. Its report also confirmed it saw Russian military on the property. Two inspectors from the IAEA mission have remained at the facility.\n\n♦\n\nBritain has a new prime minister. First Boris Johnson, yesterday, formally left the position.\n\nBoris Johnson:\n\nLet me say that I am now like one of those booster rockets that has fulfilled its function and I will now be gently reentering the atmosphere and splashing down invisibly in some remote and obscure corner of the Pacific.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nTaking over is the Conservative Party's Liz Truss, Britain's former foreign secretary.\n\nLiz Truss:\n\nWe will transform Britain into an aspiration nation with high paying jobs, safe streets, and where everyone everywhere has the opportunities they deserve.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nShe becomes the country's third female prime minister after Margaret Thatcher, who governed from 1979 to 1990 and Theresa May, who did so from 2016 to 2019. It's also Britain's third prime minister in just over three years. Producer PJ Elliott, spoke with international reporter, Kim Hjelmgaard, to find out more about the UK's new leader.\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nLiz Truss is, she's a long time conservative party politician. She's served in the outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. First as an international trade secretary, and then most recently as foreign secretary, so equivalent to the secretary of state in the US. And she's been a pretty high profile voice on the world stage in terms of pushing for aggressive action on Russia's war in Ukraine. And beyond that, I think it's probably fair to say that she's someone whose career is, as I said in one of my stories about her, is full of ideological u-turns. So she's tacked back and forth on different issues over the years. She actually started, mean this when she was in college as a Liberal Democrat, which is one of the smaller opposition parties in the UK and now, but is like anathema to the Conservative Party in terms of all the big hot button issues.\n\nShe was against Brexit, initially, which is one of the Brexit being the UK's exit from the European Union is one of the dividing lines that people fall on or down and around here in the UK. And suddenly when it became obvious that Brexit was going to happen and there was no turning back, she pushed for it with zeal. I think probably fair to say that she's a pretty experienced cabinet minister, she's on the, by American standards, she's on the young side, she's 47. She's Britain's third female prime minister. Most famous, of course, is Margaret Thatcher. After Thatcher there was Theresa May, who was directly preceded, Boris Johnson. But just to sum up her beliefs, she mainly sees herself in the mold of Thatcher, which is someone who wants to cut taxes, who believes in a smaller state, who is on the right politically, gets frustrated with red tape and all those tropes that are familiar to people on the political ride.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nHow commonplace is this for the ruling party to swap out its prime minister?\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nSo in Britain, unlike the United States, when there's a general election the public votes in a party not a specific leader, so not a specific prime minister or a president in US terms. So it's not uncommon for various reasons for the ruling party, in this case the Conservative party, to change leaders. It doesn't happen all that often. It tends to happen when a serving prime minister's hand is forced, as in the case of Boris Johnson who resigned over a series of scandals. But I believe it's only the second time in recent history, anyway, that this has happened, i.e. where it hasn't been an election that has changed the leader. It's been an internal party contest. Now, much of that has to do with the fact that the British constitution is not written down and so these rules can change.\n\n♦\n\nStudents in Uvalde, Texas returned to school yesterday. For many, it was the first day of school since a gunman massacred 19 elementary school students and two teachers in the town in May. Robb Elementary, where the attack took place, is permanently closed and will be demolished. But students flooded into other schools this week, including Uvalde Elementary, where a new eight foot fence was built. Police have also upped their presence across the town despite widespread distrust of law enforcement. Police waited more than an hour before confronting the gunman in the shooting, even as children inside the classroom called 911. Celeste Ibarra daughter was at Robb Elementary during the shooting. She said, she's been dreading this week.\n\nCeleste Ibarra:\n\nI was just scared, so scared that I won't get her back, but we went through drills all summer. I taught them, if y'all hear anything in the hallway, get out the window, run, don't stop. Don't scream. They have phones now, each of them, which I didn't believe in kids that age should have phones, but now I have to.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nOver the summer, more than a hundred students in Uvalde signed up for virtual learning and others transferred to private schools. The school district fired Police Chief Pete Arredondo for the slow law enforcement response to the shooting. And two officers have been suspended with pay.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

The United Nations' top human rights official expressed \"grave concern\" and called on the high court to reverse its decision.\n\nLate in the day, the OAS announced that it would hold an emergency meeting at its Washington headquarters Monday to discuss the situation in Venezuela.\n\nOpposition leaders, long-marginalized the past 17 years of socialist rule, called on other public officials to follow Ortega Diaz's example. They also urged the military, the traditional arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela, to break its silence and defend the constitution drafted by late President Hugo Chavez to which it swore allegiance.\n\n\"You have a new opportunity to show the country and international community if you are with the dictatorship or want your children and grandchildren to grow and live in a country where there's democracy and liberty,\" said David Smolansky, a Caracas area mayor.\n\nAmid the turmoil, the normally ever-present Maduro was conspicuously silent until late Friday. Then he went on state TV to argue that Venezuela's institutions are operating normally and that it is his \"right-wing, fascist\" opponents who are attempting to break the constitutional order.\n\nHe said that in an effort to calm the political impasse he had called an emergency meeting Friday night of the National Security Council, which includes the president of the National Assembly and Venezuela's chief prosecutor.\n\n\"Like all controversy this should be resolved with dialogue,\" Maduro said.\n\nNational Assembly president Julio Borges said late Friday that he would not accept Maduro's invitation, likening it to a circus act put on by the same person that the opposition blames for Venezuela's crisis.\n\nInstead Borges called for the international community to continue putting diplomatic pressure on Venezuela's government and he urged citizens to protest Saturday.\n\n\"In Venezuela the only dialogue possible is the vote,\" Borges said.\n\nMaduro's foreign minister was forced to abruptly cancel a meeting with diplomats in the capital to explain the court's ruling after Colombia, Chile and Peru withdrew their ambassadors. The Mercosur trade bloc, which suspended Venezuela in December, called an emergency meeting for Saturday in Argentina to discuss the crisis.\n\n\"This clearly destroys the most important pillar of any democracy, which is popular representation,\" Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said. In the past, he has been reluctant to criticize Maduro, fearing a backlash against the millions of Colombians who live in Venezuela and in recent months have been flocking home in the face of the worsening economic crisis.\n\nA day after the Trump administration strongly criticized the Supreme Court's move and called on Maduro to free political prisoners, the State Department pointed to the OAS as the best place to address concerns about Venezuela.\n\nOAS Secretary General Luis Almagro called an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis after two previous sessions this week ended with 20 governments led by the U.S. and Mexico voicing deep concern but no concrete actions to hold Maduro accountable.\n\n\"This is a decisive hour for the region,\" said Venezuelan opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who met Friday with Almagro in Washington. Venezuelans will find out \"who is with the people and democracy and who is with corruption and dictatorship,\" he said.\n\nIn Caracas, national guardsmen in riot gear fired buckshot and swung batons at students who gathered outside the Supreme Court. Several protesters were arrested and some journalists had their cameras seized. One journalist, from Colombia's Caracol Radio, was surrounded by a dozen soldiers who swung her around by her arms and legs and appeared to hit and drag her.\n\nDespite sporadic flare-ups of protest Friday, it wasn't clear if critics of the government were in the mood for another street fight after previous attempts fizzled or ended in bloodshed with little to show. Weeks of unrest in 2014 left more than 40 dead and dozens arrested, while a mass protest last September was followed a few days later by authorities cancelling a recall petition campaign seeking to force Maduro from office before his term ends in 2019.\n\nWhat could be different this time is that Venezuela's economy is on its knees. Governments in the region, as well as the Trump administration, seem far more engaged in seeking a solution to the political and increasingly humanitarian crisis that threatens to spill beyond the country's borders.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling and another earlier this week limiting lawmakers' immunity from prosecution capped a feud that began when the opposition won control of the legislature by a landslide in December 2015 and then mounted a campaign to force Maduro from office.\n\nThe leftist leader, who has seen his approval ratings plunge amid widespread food shortages and triple-digit inflation, responded by relying on the Supreme Court to unseat several opposition lawmakers and then issue an order nullifying all legislation passed by the National Assembly.\n\nThe government argues that the latest ruling did not seek to supplant congress but rather to guarantee the rule of law as long as legislators remain obstructionist by refusing to sign off on a budget and key economic decisions like a plan by Venezuela's state-run oil company to form joint ventures with private companies, including Russia's Rosneft.\n\n\"It's untrue that a coup has taken place in Venezuela,\" the government said in a statement Thursday. \"On the contrary, the institutions have taken corrective legal action to stop the distractive, coup-like actions of an opposition that has declared itself openly in contempt of the decisions made by the republic's top court.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Fabiola Sanchez reported this story in Caracas and AP writer Joshua Goodman reported from Bogota, Colombia.

Since then, the country has been “in the midst of one of the world’s most prolonged and acute economic crises”, with more than 80% of the population living in poverty, added the broadcaster.\n\nThe crisis has “pulverized” the Lebanese pound and “wiped out the savings” of many Lebanese, as the banks “ran dry of hard currency”, said France 24.\n\nSalameh has been criticised for borrowing new money to pay existing creditors, a policy that has been compared to a Ponzi scheme. He rejects the comparison, but Alarabiya News said Lebanon is now “nothing more than a spoiled trust-fund baby that refuses to go to work and to acknowledge that living on the past glories does not make a nation”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nLebanon’s government and politicians “have not taken any measures to mitigate or alleviate its impact on the population”, wrote Dalal Mawad in The Guardian, in an extract from her book, “All She Lost: The Explosion in Lebanon, the Collapse of a Nation and the Women Who Survive”.\n\n“Nothing has been done”, she added, “no reforms, no structural changes, no meaningful change of power and no accountability.” The World Bank put it more formally, describing the economic situation in Lebanon as one of the worst crises in the world since the 19th century, with “deliberate inaction” to blame.\n\nA political stalemate\n\nPolitically, Lebanon is in stalemate. The Mediterranean country has been without a president for nine months, and its government has been running in a limited caretaker capacity for a year.\n\nIn June, Lebanon’s parliament failed for the 12th time to elect a president and “break a political deadlock that has gripped the country for months”, said Al Jazeera.\n\nA bloc led by Hezbollah withdrew after the initial round of votes, preventing a second round of voting. This thwarted a bid by their rivals to elect a top International Monetary Fund official as president and meant continued deadlock.\n\nConsequences of the blast\n\nOn the eve of the third anniversary of the catastrophic explosion in Beirut’s port that killed 235 people and damaged more than half of the city, Amnesty International criticised an “unacceptable lack of justice, truth and reparation”.\n\nThe authorities “have had three years to investigate what caused the devastating explosion in Beirut’s port and to hold those suspected of criminal responsibility to account”, said a spokesperson, but “to this day, absolutely no one has been held responsible for the tragedy”.\n\nThe domestic investigation into the blast has been suspended since December 2021, due to a series of legal challenges filed against judges involved in the case by politicians who have been targeted by the investigation.\n\nIn March, the United Nations Human Rights Council expressed concern that the investigation had been “hampered by systemic obstruction, interference, intimidation, and a political impasse”.\n\nWriting for Foreign Policy, David Schenker, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said there is a “pervasive culture of impunity” in Lebanon.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/11/08/catalonia-to-press-ahead-with-independence-vote/18552069/", "title": "Catalonia to defy court, proceed on independence poll", "text": "Donna Leinwand Leger\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAs Spain continues to stagger under double-digit unemployment and a slow economic recovery, one of the country's richest regions is in full-on mutiny with plans Sunday to defy the country's constitutional court by holding an independence poll.\n\nThe president of Catalonia, a region of 7.5 million people that includes the city of Barcelona, says the regional government plans to push forward with an informal, non-binding ballot on whether to secede from Spain and become an independent country.\n\n\"(Catalonia is) absolutely determined and decided. Everything depends on us to carry out the process and everything is ready,\" Catalan President Artur Mas said Wednesday in a breakfast speech at an economic forum in Spain.\n\n\"We should not be afraid because we are defending the basic fundamental rights of an entire people,\" he said.\n\nThe Spanish government contends the vote is illegal and that any such referendum would have to include all Spanish citizens. Spain's constitutional court on Tuesday agreed to hear the Spanish government's case and suspended the poll.\n\n\"The government's position is very clear,\" Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said last month after the constitutional court's initial ruling. \"We are prepared to talk whenever this is within a lawful framework. What neither the government nor anyone else can do, either in Spain or in any other civilized democracy, is try to sidestep the law and violate the wishes of the majority of the people of Spain..\"\n\nSpanish Ambassador Ramon Gil-Casares, in a wide-ranging interview with USA TODAY on Tuesday about Spain's economy, says the fervor for independence, coming on the heels of Scotland's independence vote in September, is fueled in part by Europe's struggle to emerge from one of the worst recessions ever to hit the continent.\n\nThe Spanish government in 2012 instituted a tough fiscal program to turn the economy around. The measures — which Gil-Casares characterized as \"harsh on a population\" contending with nearly 24% unemployment — prompted two general strikes in protest, the recent formation of a new leftist political party called \"Podemos\" or \"Yes, We Can,\" and energized the independence movement.\n\nPodemos, founded in January and led by political science professor Pablo Iglesias, won 8% of the vote and five of 54 seats in Spain's May 25 European Parliament elections. A public opinion poll released early this month by Spain's Center for Sociological Study found 18% of likely Spanish voters favored Podemos compared with 12% for Rajoy's People's Party.\n\nCatalonia, Spain's fourth richest region, says it's paying more into the country's coffers than it gets in return. But the balance had been in Catalonia's favor before 2007, Gil-Casares said.\n\nIndependence, Gil-Casares said, is not the best solution to the economic imbalance. \"Catalonia is a part of Spain,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Spain is seeing signs of recovery. After nine quarters of negative growth, the country has shown a year of positive, though modest, economic growth, he said.\n\nThe European Commission in its economic forecast Tuesday said it expected Spain's economic growth in the next year to outpace growth in the eurozone as a whole.\n\nThe financial crisis and a lack of buying power at home also prodded Spanish companies to seek out new markets elsewhere in Europe, Latin America and Africa, Gil-Casares said. Spain is now exporting Ford cars to the U.S., he added.\n\nAll of Spain's banks recently passed a European Central Bank review of their capitalization, indicating the nation's banking sector is stable.\n\n\"We are creating jobs,\" he said. \"We think we're clearly on the path to recovery.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/08"}]}

Storm surge kills more people during hurricanes than wind. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hurricanes worldwide are caused by drowning in either the storm surges or flooding caused by intense rainfall, according to the Florida Climate Center.\n\n\"The storm surge anticipated in some communities will be to the level of one- and two-story buildings and can reach that level with tremendous force in a matter of a few minutes,\" AccuWeather warned.\n\n➤ Live updates:Get the latest on Hurricane Milton as it approaches Florida\n\n➤ WeatherTiger:Worst case scenario with cataclysmic storm surge beyond Helene\n\n\"Milton will be a surge event unlike any hurricane in living memory for west-central Florida, with only major hurricane strikes in 1848 and 1921 comparable in scope and height of the coastal flooding,\" Truchelut said.\n\n➤Reverse storm surge?

The Hurricane Center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\n➤ Track Hurricane Milton\n\nExcessive rainfall forecast\n\nKey messages from the National Hurricane Center: What you need to know about Hurricane Milton\n\nA large area of destructive storm surge, with highest inundations of 10 ft or greater, is expected along a portion of the west-central coast of the Florida Peninsula. Near the coast the surge will be accompanied by damaging waves. Water levels will rise rapidly as the eye approaches, and strong onshore winds on the backside of the hurricane will also cause a rapid rise in water as the center makes landfall. Devastating hurricane-force winds are expected along portions of the west coast of Florida within the Hurricane Warning area. Life-threatening hurricane-force winds, especially in gusts, are expected to spread inland across the peninsula and to portions of the Florida east coast within the Hurricane Warning area tonight and early Thursday. Residents should be prepared to take shelter in an interior room, away from windows, as the core of the hurricane moves across the central Florida Peninsula. The risk of strong tornadoes will continue into the evening hours across the southern and central portions of the Florida Peninsula. Be prepared to take immediate shelter in an interior room if a Tornado Warning is issued for your area. Heavy rainfall across the Florida Peninsula through Thursday brings the risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding along with moderate to major river flooding, especially in areas where coastal and inland flooding combine to increase the overall flood threat.\n\nHurricane tracker: See the latest on projected path for Hurricane Milton\n\nCurrent forecast: Where is Hurricane Milton going and how strong could it get?\n\nAs of 11 p.m. EDT: 105 mph (inland)\n\n105 mph (inland) 12 hours: 80 mph (over water)\n\n80 mph (over water) 24 hours: 75 mph\n\n75 mph 36 hours: 65 mph (post-tropical/extra-tropical)\n\n65 mph (post-tropical/extra-tropical) 48 hours: 60 mph (post-tropical/extra-tropical)\n\n60 mph (post-tropical/extra-tropical) 60 hours: 45 mph (post-tropical/extra-tropical)\n\n45 mph (post-tropical/extra-tropical) 72 hours: 40 mph (post-tropical/extra-tropical)\n\n40 mph (post-tropical/extra-tropical) 96 hours: 30 mph (post-tropical/extra-tropical)\n\n30 mph (post-tropical/extra-tropical) 120 hours: Dissipated\n\nWhat impacts could Hurricane Milton have and what areas could be affected?\n\nSTORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide:\n\nAnna Maria Island, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...4-7 ft\n\nCharlotte Harbor...4-7 ft\n\nAnclote River, FL to Anna Maria Island, FL...3-5 ft\n\nTampa Bay...3-5 ft\n\nBonita Beach, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft\n\nSebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft\n\nSt. Johns River...2-4 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.\n\nRAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 8 to 14 inches, with localized totals up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of the Florida Peninsula today. This rainfall will continue to bring the risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with moderate to major river flooding.\n\n➤ Excessive rainfall forecast\n\nWIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring within the hurricane warning area in Florida. Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area through midday today. Tropical storm conditions in the tropical storm warning area in Florida and will spread to the Georgia and South Carolina coasts later this morning.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the northwestern Bahamas later today.\n\nTORNADOES: Over 120 tornado warnings have been issued today, although only a few have been verified by the National Weather Service. More tornadoes are likely tonight across parts of central and southern Florida.\n\nSURF: Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to affect much of the Gulf Coast today and along the southeastern U.S. coast during the next day or two. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.\n\nStay informed.

For the latest on recovery efforts, view our live updates file for Tuesday, Oct. 1.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. − President Joe Biden is sure to get a first-hand look at the devastation is Asheville when he visits North Carolina on Wednesday as part of his tour of the Southeastern states ravaged by Hurricane Helene, which caused more than 100 deaths and left nearly 1.6 million customers without power as of Monday evening.\n\nBiden is less likely to see communities like Lake Lure and neighboring Chimney Rock, not only because they're more than 30 miles away and much smaller, but because they're barely there anymore.\n\nChimney Rock was largely submerged, its buildings swept away by the water and their debris blocking entry points into the village of 140 residents, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported.\n\n“What was once a town is now a river,'' said Tracey Stevens, who worked at the Chimney Rock brewery, now also wiped away. \"It’s beyond anything I can imagine.”\n\nLake Lure, a resort town of 1,400 people, also took a severe blow from the storm, which destroyed the town hall, police station and pier while washing away businesses.\n\nThe scene is not much prettier in normally picturesque Asheville, county seat of Buncombe County, or for that matter in much of the Southeast. Hundreds of water rescues have taken place across Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia since Helene's brutal landfall in Florida's Big Bend region late Thursday.\n\nAtlanta totaled more than 11 inches of rain in 48 hours, smashing a record that stood for almost 150 years. Western North Carolina took the brunt of the devastating rains, and more than 30 inches was recorded in some areas. Houses floated away from subdivisions, bridges crumbled, and semi-trucks were tossed into mangled piles. Mud, tree branches and food from local grocery stores flowed into the streets. The Associated Press reported at least 133 people have died because of Helene.\n\nForty of those fatalities have been confirmed in Buncombe County, County Manager Avril Pinder said in a Monday afternoon briefing, raising the total in North Carolina to nearly 50. Officials have received about 600 missing persons reports, although many are expected to be resolved when communications are restored.\n\n\"We don't have water and we do not have power across most of the county,\" Pinder said. \"The roads are still incredibly dangerous.\"\n\nSome supplies were being airlifted because ground transportation was limited with so many damaged roads, and the county planned to begin distributing food and water Monday.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper activated more than 500 soldiers and airmen from the National Guard. More than 200 vehicles and aircraft, including hoist and emergency aviation assets and high-water response vehicles, were feverishly working to save lives.\n\nOn the ground: How flood damage is cutting off North Carolina communities from emergency relief\n\nHurricanes, tornadoes, snow and heat: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter for more weather news and analysis.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ AccuWeather has increased its estimate of the total damage and economic loss from Hurricane Helene to between $145 billion and $160 billion. Helene is expected to be one of the costliest storms in U.S. history because of its overwhelming storm surge, winds and flooding, the weather service said.\n\n∎ Vice President Kamala Harris will cut short a campaign trip and plans a visit to the storm-ravaged Southeast, her office told Reuters. Former President Donald Trump, who said he will visit the region, has criticized Harris for campaigning as the tragedy unfolded. He has also continued to hold rallies.\n\n∎ The South Carolina Department of Public Safety has confirmed 29 storm-related deaths, many involving fallen trees. Impassable roads and lack of stable power has forced several school closures in the state, some lasting through Friday.\n\n∎ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Helene killed a minimum of 25 people in his state. In Tennessee, the state Department of Health has confirmed six weather-related fatalities across four counties, and about 100 people are reported missing. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency noted several county health departments have been closed due to the storm's impact.\n\n∎ Helene is one of the deadliest hurricanes to make landfall on the U.S. mainland in modern history. Since 1950, only eight hurricanes have claimed more than 100 lives in the contiguous 48 states.

As federal and state supply delivery lagged, though it eventually reached the county for its sites, the city spent \"hundreds of thousands\" of dollars to purchase water through a private provider, said City Manager Debra Campbell.\n\n— Sarah Honosky, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nBiden sends FEMA chief to Asheville 'until the situation has stabilized'\n\nBiden sent FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to be on the ground in Asheville, North Carolina, \"until the situation has stabilized,\" the federal agency said Monday.

Taylor Shelton said her husband spent two days cutting through large fallen trees with a chainsaw to open a passageway for the couple and their three children to drive out of their darkened house in Yancey County, which abuts Buncombe County.\n\nThe devastation they saw along the way left them awestruck.\n\n\"It looks like 'War of the Worlds.' Very, very big trees are down everywhere,\" she said. \"We saw houses that are just washed away.\"\n\nShelton said the couple still hasn't been able to get in touch with her husband's parents in nearby Burnside, which was also battered by the storm.\n\nManheimer echoed the sentiment, noting that she was experiencing the same things — no power, no water, no Wi-Fi and limited to no cell reception — as many others in the county.\n\n“We are so lucky. Our house did not get hit,\" she said. \"Our neighborhood looks like a war zone.”\n\nIn the hours after Helene lashed the county, Manheimer and her youngest son donned backpacks and went looking for her dad, who lives a mile-and-a-half away. The scene, she said, was \"unbelievable.\"\n\nThey picked through the wreckage of the neighborhood, navigating fallen trees, and downed lines, shimmying through gaps where they could.

Ron DeSantis ordered rescue teams to mobilize air lifts for people from Florida who may be stranded in western North Carolina in areas with blocked roads and power and cellphone outages.\n\n“Operation Blue Ridge” launched Sunday, an effort similar to one he’d ordered almost a year ago to help Florida residents in Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas, and from Haiti earlier this year amid that country’s political violence.\n\nRecovery efforts are ongoing in Florida in the aftermath of Helene. At least 11 people were killed in the state, including at least nine in Pinellas County − hundreds of miles from where the storm made landfall.\n\nDeSantis said he missed a call from Biden because he was in the air viewing damage. The governor added that the federal government should concentrate its efforts on helping those in western North Carolina, though he said Florida might ask for more federal assistance in the future.\n\n− Gray Rohrer, Tallahassee Democrat\n\n'It's a race against time': Historic town begins digging out\n\nMARSHALL, N.C. − Days after flooding devastated this tiny town of less than 800 people, cleanup crews on Monday worked to remove thick mud and debris while business owners pulled belongings from waterlogged downtown buildings. The historic town, set along the French Broad River north of Asheville, was slammed by a deluge that reached to the first-floor roof of some downtown buildings. It also damaged a water-treatment plant across the river.Most of the town was without power and cellular service. The damage extended to some businesses that in recent years have become part of an artistic renewal in the downtown area.

But the reality on the ground has been harrowing for people stuck without means to reach their loved ones or get help.\n\nCommunications in the region could be impacted for days, weeks or even months, and large companies need to do more to prepare for communication breakdowns triggered by disasters fueled by climate change, said Alyssa Provencio, a professor who oversees the disaster management certificate program at the University of Central Oklahoma.\n\n“Communication failure is not a matter of 'if,' it's a matter of 'when,'” Provencio said. \"We know that extreme events are occurring more frequently and with more intensity, and so whether you're talking about hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes, it's something that will impact you and impact your communications.\" Read more here.\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nWorld Central Kitchen distributing food in Asheville\n\nDisaster relief organizations are providing free food and supplies in the Asheville area amid massive, urgent need.

She is among hundreds of people turning to social media for help to contact friends and loved ones in parts of the Southeast that were battered by Helene. Communication blackouts created by Helene's fury have made obtaining information difficult.\n\nAs the storm approached Florida, Vale and her husband drove from their Burnsville home in the Blue Ridge Mountains to their house in Dunedin, a coastal town west of Tampa. While their Florida home was unscathed, their worry immediately became centered on Burnsville, where washed-out bridges and roads have left residents trapped with no means to communicate with the outside world.\n\n“No one’s been able to get a hold of anyone up there. I’m sure they’re OK, it's just not knowing,” she said, speaking about her friends and neighbors. “It's beyond comprehension what’s happened.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\n'The whole side of the mountain came down'\n\nRED HILL, N.C. – James Waters watched Helene's torrential rains and fierce winds decimate his farm among the hilly slopes of Appalachian North Carolina, snapping trees, ripping out fences and causing a landslide.\n\nIt took him a full day to dig to the main road with a farm excavator. He found windy roads strewn with downed power lines, fallen limbs, thick mud and debris. In some areas, cars were washed into ditches. One neighbor found a dead body near a riverbank, he said.\n\nNo one had cell service or power. People couldn’t find out whether their relatives were alive or dead. Waters knew he had a huge recovery ahead of himself. But his family had survived.

And when they arrived at their places of worship, many structures had holes in walls, shredded roofs and mangled pews. No matter. For the steadfast faithful in Haiti, it was still time to pray and give thanks.\n\nHaiti was the first country in the line of sight when a swirl of angry air exploded into Hurricane Matthew last week. The devastation could be staggering, forecasters warned.\n\nIt was a pang felt around the globe: No, no, not Haiti.\n\n$120M U.N. appeal crucial for Haiti recovery\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe island nation, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, has endured one catastrophe after another: A massive earthquake in 2010 that killed more than 230,000 people; a post-quake cholera epidemic that claimed more than 7,000 lives; a punishing drought that gutted many people's only source of income, their farmland.\n\nCategory 4 Matthew lived up to the forecasters' fears. The storm tore through the southwest tip of the Caribbean island with 145-mph winds, leveling the meager shacks dotting the countryside. Officials say the death toll is about 500; some reports put it closer to 900. Food and water are scarce; a few dozen cases of cholera have been reported; 175,000 people are living in shelters.\n\nFlooded N.C. city: 'Please pray for our community'\n\nHaiti has always had a place near to my heart. The church I belonged to for many years had a sister parish in Cavaillon since 1986 and was heavily invested in outreach to the schools and communities around the Haitian town. There were economic development projects, such as an agriculture co-op or construction of a clinic.\n\nYou could be a Haiti \"godparent,\" and for $150 a year you would pay for a child's tuition and school lunch. Every year our Haitian godchildren would pen letters in careful cursive, thanking us for sponsoring them in school. They would often include a photo: neat little girls in spotless pink dresses and matching bows; boys in short-sleeve cotton shirts and gray pants. Always well-groomed, serious and smiling.\n\nOne week after Matthew, the situation on the ground is grim. Humanitarian relief groups and U.N. agencies are scrambling to get food and medical supplies to areas hit the hardest, particularly in the southwest.\n\nSave the Children's Emergency Health Unit in Haiti says the agency is racing to beat the clock as more cases of cholera are confirmed. \"The number of cases is increasing with every new report,” director Unni Krishnan said.\n\nChristy Delafield, senior spokeswoman with global relief group Mercy Corps, has been working on the island the past few days. She says she has been struck by everyday Haitians who have put aside their own concerns about their livelihoods and are helping in the relief effort.\n\n\"It has been very moving to see people waiting to hear from their family going village to village to try to see who has been affected,\" she said. When roads are washed out, supplies are ferried on foot. \"It is very much a community effort.\"\n\nKevin Novotny, Haiti country director for Save the Children, says he has also seen remarkable acts amid the devastation.\n\nAid reaches Haiti, but desperation grows after Matthew\n\nHaitians are flocking to distribution points, donating truckloads of food and clothes. \"Most of our staff has houses that are damaged or completely gone,\" he said. \"That has not stopped them from jumping in to help.\"\n\nNovotny, whose staff has an office in Beaumont in an area devastated by the storm, says 9,000 of 13,000 people are living in shelters there. \"It looks like a bomb went off,\" he said.\n\nDelafield says her agency is well aware of the long-range impact. \"If we don’t get assistance to people in time to plant their crops this December and recover some form of income, the problems will become much more entrenched in the long term,\" she said.\n\nThe Haitian priests who visited from our sister parish would express their gratitude in soft-spoken and unassuming words. They were thankful for a new water well, new goats for their farm, books for school. I can't stop wondering how they are faring today.\n\nEven in the face of a long string of misery, Haitians somehow summon the resilience to stand up and start over yet again. They are a people who have so little, but whose hearts seem to hold so much.\n\nAs Matthew rolls out to sea and off the front pages, Novotny makes this plea: \"Don't forget the people of Haiti.\"\n\nLooking for ways to help?

Fridnel Kedler, coordinator for the Civil Protection Agency in Grand-Anse, told the Associated Press at least 470 were dead in the hard-hit southwestern corner of the country.\n\nChristy Delafield, a senior spokeswoman with global relief agency Mercy Corps, told USA TODAY on Saturday the real death toll may never be known. \"We may never really understand the toll fully,\" Delafield said. Haitians in remote villages have already begun burying their dead, she said.\n\nHurricane Matthew lashes Charleston as weakened Cat 1 storm\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 750,000 people in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, are in need of humanitarian assistance. Of the 10.3 million people in Haiti, 1.3 million have been impacted by the storm, OCHA says.\n\nAmong the most alarming fallout of the storm was word on new cases of cholera, an infectious and often fatal bacterial disease of the small intestine usually transmitted by tainted water supplies. Haiti has been struggling to recover from a massive earthquake in 2010 and an ensuing cholera epidemic, which killed more than 7,000 people.\n\nDelafield says she is aware of four new cases of cholera. Reuters reported 17 cases were detected in Chardonnieres on the southern coast.\n\nIt has been a struggle for relief agencies to access those in need in remote sections of the island. Matthew slammed the western tip of Haiti on Tuesday with 145-mph winds in an area of rural countryside that soon became cut off from the rest of the nation when a bridge gave out, complicating relief efforts.\n\nHumanitarian agency World Vision said Saturday that access to some areas was starting to improve. Cell service was returning and government officials were starting to hear from the mayors of outlying cities with information about the conditions in their areas. The group delivered relief supplies to 1,000 households on Friday and was gearing up for more relief over the weekend.\n\nPeople keep asking, “When is this going to stop? When are we going to get a break from crisis after crisis?” said John Hasse, national director of World Vision in Port-au-Prince. \"They’re tired and discouraged. And yet, somehow, they just keep getting back up and rebuilding again.”\n\nWorld Vision's Guy Vital-Herne, working with crews in the southern part of the country, said access to clean water is a growing concern. \"Pipes have broken in homes, but people can’t leave their neighborhoods to buy clean water. In some towns, the water sources have been contaminated.\" he said.\n\nHaiti is one of the most deforested countries in the world, making it more vulnerable to windstorms and heavy rain. The sloping, mountainous areas were also at risk of landslides. The area hit hardest by the storm is populated by villages where Haitians live in shacks of wood, corrugated steel and even mud. The storm tore off rooftops and flattened others to their foundations. Hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless, Reuters reported.\n\nHurricane Matthew: Here is the latest forecast for the U.S.\n\nDonna Porstner of Americares said Saturday that the disaster relief agency was \"working non-stop\" and coordinating with the Ministry of Health in Haiti.\n\n\"Americares' emergency response teams in Port-au-Prince and Les Cayes are assessing survivors’ health needs and coordinating aid shipments,\" she said. \"So far we have delivered two shipments of medicine and relief supplies to Les Cayes, and we have more on the way.\"\n\nPorstner said drivers navigated treacherous roads to deliver the medicine and supplies such as oral rehydration salts, wound care treatments and intravenous fluids. Americares has about $1.6 million in aid on the way to Haiti, she said.\n\nThe United Nation's Population Fund said Saturday that it was concerned about the fate of more than 8,400 pregnant women who are expected to give birth in the next three months, as well as 1,200 women who would need cesarean sections. The agency was sending 252 emergency reproductive health kits to parts of the nation.\n\n\"Hurricane Matthew delivered a severe blow to Haiti's health facilities, whether by flooding these centers or blowing off their roofs and putting them out of service,\" said Babatunde Osotimehin, UNFPA executive director. “We will work to help women give birth and live, despite this tragedy.”\n\nOn Saturday, Delafield was en route to Nippes in the southern part of the country on a mission to deliver hygiene kits containing such items as toothbrushes, shampoo and laundry soap. Mercy Corps hoped to deliver 5,000 kits to those in the mountainous areas.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Programme estimates up to 80% of harvest has been lost in many areas in Haiti as well.\n\n\"Haiti has been hit time and again with major disasters,\" Delafield says. \"They just had the most severe drought in 50 years. This was the first year people had hoped for a good harvest.\"\n\nNo matter what the official numbers end up being, Delafield said the losses are overwhelming. \"People lost their homes, all their crops.

Keith Waddell told USA Today his men and women soldiers began fanning out at 4:15 a.m. with aircraft taking off at 6:15.\n\n\"We have aviation rescues going on right now in LaPlace and Jean Lafitte,\" Waddell said late Monday morning. \"We're trying to get as many rescues as we can in southeastern Louisiana.\"\n\nThe good news, Edwards said, is no major levees failed, thanks to a $15 billion hurricane risk reduction system that was built following the Hurricane Katrina disaster in 2005 and was activated Sunday morning for just the second time.\n\nBut electricity is out for more than 1 million Louisiana homes and businesses, including all of New Orleans and neighboring Jefferson Parish, where Entergy said it had “catastrophic transmission damage,” including a massive tower that collapsed into the Mississippi River near Avondale.\n\n\"All eight major transmission lines going into New Orleans failed,\" Edwards said.\n\nJoe Valiente, director of emergency management in Jefferson Parish, told NPR Monday power outages in the parish could last up to six weeks.\n\n\"100 percent of the grid is smashed,\" Valiente said. \"We are estimating six weeks based on numbers that Entergy gave us.\"\n\nNew Orleans City Councilwoman Helena Moreno tweeted: \"Wow…#HurricaneIda has been rough on #NOLA, but we will get through this. The power failures are tough and potentially complicated. The 8 big lines that bring power into the city have all been knocked out, plus many of the smaller lines/wires on polls etc in the city are damaged.\"\n\nA 60-year-old Ascension Parish man was Hurricane Ida's first fatality after he died when a tree fell on his house, but Edwards warned there will likely be more.\n\n\"I don't want to mislead,\" Edwards said on MSNBC. \"I fully expect that count to go up throughout the day.\"\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Monday, there were 2,235 people in 41 Louisiana shelters, but a spokesman said she expected that number to rise into Tuesday.\n\nEdwards said the state will ultimately move the evacuees to hotel rooms. Last year more than 20,000 people displaced from Hurricane Laura that decimated Lake Charles were sheltered in hotels.\n\nGreg Hilburn covers state politics for the USA TODAY Network of Louisiana.

Attorneys typically call a larger-than-normal number of potential jurors for capital cases, and the presiding judge in the county, Ruth Ann Hall, told WHNT-TV the courthouse in Huntsville doesn’t have enough space to allow for proper social distancing in those instances. So capital cases will be on hold until 2021, delaying justice for both crime victims and defendants. “I indicated to the judges that we simply could not try any capital murder cases this year, because you know, we have one courtroom we can get 30 people in for voir dire and jury selection. For capital murder you need three to four times that, minimum,” Hall said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A local man has been handing out $500 tips to restaurant workers hit hard by the pandemic. Jack Little, who works for a telecommunications company, heard about a tip challenge based on the Venmo app and decided to see what he could do for servers in Anchorage. “I have a lot of good friends that are in that industry that have personally been affected by this, and so I just wanted to do something to help them,” he said. Little took to Facebook and Instagram, asking friends to send 50 cents or a dollar, whatever they could spare, to his Venmo account. “My friends have been incredibly generous,” he said. The account to help wait staff has reached nearly $7,000. Little started by giving $500 tips to five separate waiters or waitresses across the city. One of his latest totaled $1,000 – an amount that could cover rent, a car payment or phone bill.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: About 100 people gathered at the Capitol for a pair of rallies on Labor Day, calling to end COVID-19 restrictions on businesses and arguing the pandemic is no longer a threat. Multiple Republican lawmakers and candidates gathered at the Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza, where not a mask was in sight as they criticized Gov. Doug Ducey’s executive orders, protested the use of masks and lamented the economic fallout of the pandemic. “We are here to defend our freedom. We’re here to speak and advocate for workers on Labor Day who can’t work because of regressive, overreaching emergency orders,” said Bill Crawford, a Scottsdale gym owner who organized the rally. Republican State Rep. John Fillmore compared mask mandates to the tattooing of victims of the Holocaust. Tattoos were used in part to dehumanize victims of the Holocaust, while mask mandates are public health measures intended to keep people healthy.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 350 new cases of the coronavirus Monday and 14 additional deaths due to COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. The Arkansas Department of Health said the state’s total number of reported cases so far sits at 65,727. There have been 908 deaths in the state due to COVID-19. The true number of cases in Arkansas is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPalm Springs: A stretch of Palm Canyon Drive will close to vehicle traffic starting Thursday, a move that will allow some downtown Palm Springs restaurants to accommodate outdoor dining while abiding by public health protocols meant to help stop the spread of coronavirus. The road will close to traffic between Tahquitz Canyon Way and Baristo Road, creating more space for restaurants in that area to set up tables 6 feet apart. The new configuration will begin at 7 a.m. Thursday, while restaurants with the proper permits will be able to start their al fresco dining Friday. Palm Springs City Council authorized the plan at its last meeting in late August after having several discussions with downtown restaurant owners and retailers. Earlier ideas centered on closing Palm Canyon to fewer lanes, but the decision to close to two blocks was made after some restaurateurs said they’d prefer to see the street closed to traffic.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Residents of a nursing home may be displaced due to what the operating company calls insurmountable financial losses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The nonprofit Estes Park Health system is projected to lose about $1.4 million this year as occupancy drops and Medicaid reimbursements lag. The financial difficulties may force the 52-bed Estes Park Health Living Center in Fort Collins to close. The center has 29 residents and has never been fully occupied. The health system, partially funded by about $3 million a year generated through a special taxing district, estimates a 20% drop in revenue this year and next year, necessitating about $7.5 million in cuts “to break even,” CEO Vern Carda said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: One of the worst cyberattacks yet against the city forced officials to postpone the first day of school Tuesday, disrupting the day for thousands of families as city computer experts rushed to restore systems vital for school operations. Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said the hacker or hackers indicated it was a ransomware attack but only left an email address to contact and made no specific ransom demand. The problem was discovered Saturday, and numerous systems were affected, including one used to communicate transportation routes and live information to school bus drivers. Tuesday was supposed to be the first day of school for the district of about 18,000 students. Both in-person and remote learning have now been pushed back by the attack, officials said. A new start date has not been announced.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Applications have opened for the first round of grants from a $100 million COVID-19 relief fund for small businesses and nonprofits in the state. The state said in a news release Monday that grants of up to $100,000 will be available. The Division of Small Business will begin accepting applications online starting Tuesday morning at 10 a.m. “These have been unprecedented and challenging times. Delaware’s small businesses have shown resilience in navigating them,” Damian DeStefano, director of the Delaware Division of Small Business, said in a statement. “This program is a way to support them in continuing to serve their customers and help the state’s economy as a whole.” Business owners are urged to have the required documentation ready: a 2019 tax return, a Delaware business license and receipts for qualifying expenses. More details about eligibility and how the money can be used are available online.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. has updated its list of “high-risk states” from which travelers will be required to self-quarantine for two weeks upon arrival to D.C. due to the coronavirus, WUSA-TV reports. The states added to the list are Montana and Ohio. Alaska and Arizona have been removed, according to D.C. Health. Officials added Montana back to the list after removing the state a few weeks ago. The travel order applies to people coming to the district for nonessential activities. Those entering the region for essential travel or after essential travel are urged to monitor any potential symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days. If they have any symptoms, they must self-quarantine and get tested or seek medical attention. The order does not apply to neighboring states such as Virginia and Maryland.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A high school is shutting its doors for two weeks after it had six confirmed cases and one suspected case of the coronavirus. Officials with Orange County Public Schools said over the weekend that Olympia High School’s campus will be closed to students until Sept. 21, and all students will take online classes. There will be no athletic events nor extracurricular activities during the two weeks, the school said on Twitter. The decision to temporarily close the school comes more than two weeks after in-person classes resumed for the Orlando-area school district. More than a third of Olympia’s 3,300 students were taking classes on campus, with the rest of the student body taking online classes. Florida on Tuesday reported more than 1,800 new coronavirus cases, raising the state’s total to 650,092 cases since March. Florida had 12,067 residents and nonresident deaths as of Tuesday, a daily increase of 44 deaths.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: An economic forecaster says the state should expect to see substantial recovery of its tourism industry next year after hotels and other businesses that rely on travelers lost billions to the coronavirus pandemic. Adam Sacks, president of the firm Tourism Economics, made the prediction during a virtual summit hosted by the Georgia Department of Economic Development. His presentation last week showed that travel spending in Georgia dropped $8.6 billion between March and August compared to the same period last year. That’s more than 20% of the $39 billion that visitors spent throughout Georgia in all of 2019. Still, tourism spending has steadily begun to recover in the months since Georgia began lifting its coronavirus lockdown in late April. Sacks predicted that will continue. According to Sacks, Georgia lost 17% of its travel and leisure jobs since February – making it the state’s hardest-hit job sector during the pandemic.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The use of an Oahu hotel to quarantine people will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal coronavirus recovery funds each month, officials said. The cost could run into millions of dollars for the partnership between the 130-room Pearl Hotel Waikiki and the state Department of Health, which manages the hotel quarantine and isolation program, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The 30-day contract cost the city $379,375 for exclusive use of the hotel and includes a minimum of four hotel workers to support the health department, Honolulu spokesman Alex Zannes said. The city will pay for the hotel services from the nearly $400 million allotted by the federal government under the coronavirus recovery program. The city’s contract with the hotel equals about $97 per night per room, whether the space is occupied or not. The nightly room cost at the property is free to those in quarantine or isolation.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An earthquake in March is threatening caves at the Craters of the Moon National Monument, officials said. Two National Forest Service cave experts found two structural concerns in the national preserve after a magnitude 6.5 earthquake near Boise on March 31. Wade Vagias, superintendent of the Craters of the Moon, said one fracture has the potential to collapse. Eric Bilderback, a National Park Service geomorphologist, said the agency must balance intervention with letting nature run its course. He said his office will plan additional evaluations throughout the fall to determine how to proceed, Boise State Public Radio reports. The monument typically hosts public tours but halted them in March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois Department of Public Health on Monday reported 1,381 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, resulting in eight confirmed deaths. The latest reported fatalities bring the statewide death toll due to the virus to 8,179 since the start of the pandemic. There have been 250,961 confirmed coronavirus cases during the same period. Within the prior 24 hours, laboratories reported 28,975 tests of specimens for a total of 4,447,347 tests conducted in Illinois. That brings the seven-day statewide positivity rate for cases as a percent of total tests to 4.2%. Heading into the Labor Day weekend, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci said Illinois and a half-dozen other states with increasing COVID-19 numbers are at risk for a surge in cases over the holiday. As of late Sunday, 1,484 people in Illinois were reported hospitalized with COVID-19.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: Some high school athletic programs are turning to pay-per-view broadcasts of their football games and other fundraising efforts to help make up revenue they’ve lost due to a drop in fan attendance amid the coronavirus pandemic. Athletic directors have had to be resourceful while trying to adhere to health department guidelines. Northern Indiana’s Mishawaka High School, for example, is charging fans $9.99 to view broadcasts of its football games, with the school receiving 60% of the revenue from each purchase. The broadcasts, run by Mishawaka students and faculty, had been free to watch for the past three years. They’re produced by the school’s Mishawaka Network and streamed on the IHSAA Champions Network. Concord High School and LaPorte High School are among the several dozen schools statewide that have partnered with the IHSAA Champions Network to create pay-per-view broadcasts of their home games.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Hundreds of students from Des Moines Public Schools and the Ames Community School District marched to the governor’s mansion Monday to protest the decision to suspend sports and start the school year online. The “Student March for Fairness” comes after the Iowa High School Athletic Association told the schools last week that all in-person activities and sports would be suspended starting Tuesday. “My senior year and my school life should not be a pawn in a political game,” Tabith Keith, a Roosevelt High School senior who has been active in marching band and volleyball, said in a news release. The students say they want fairness and equity to compete in fall and winter activities. The march came as students awaited a court ruling on whether to allow the Des Moines district to temporarily move completely to online classes rather than comply with a state order intended to ensure children return to at least partial in-person classes.\n\nKansas\n\nOlathe: Five high school golfers who sued after their suburban Kansas City districts put the brakes on fall sports because of the coronavirus pandemic have failed to convince a judge to let them play while the case works its way through the courts. The golfers, all girls, and their parents sued the Shawnee Mission and Blue Valley school districts last Tuesday, arguing that they should be allowed to play because golf poses a lower risk of spreading the virus than other sports, The Kansas City Star reports. Blue Valley officials on Friday, though, announced the district would resume high school sports this weekend. Attorney John Duggan, who is representing the families, was not immediately available to comment on how Blue Valley’s decision will affect the lawsuit. Four of the golfers play for Shawnee Mission East High School, which won the Kansas Class 6A state girls golf tournament last year. The fifth plays for Blue Valley West High School team.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State Sen. Gerald Neal, a longtime lawmaker from Louisville, is hospitalized after testing positive for COVID-19, a Senate colleague said Tuesday. Neal, a Democrat who has served in the Senate for 30-plus years, checked himself into the hospital as a “precautionary measure,” said Senate Minority Floor Leader Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville. Neal is upbeat, and his prognosis is good, McGarvey said. “I talked to him three times yesterday, and he is still asking about bills for next session and meetings he’s got this week that he wants to attend virtually,” McGarvey said. “Gerald is a fighter. He’s been fighting for his community and for civil rights for over 30 years, and he is not going to let this slow him down.” Neal is the second Kentucky lawmaker in the past week to contract coronavirus. State Rep. Attica Scott, also a Louisville Democrat, announced Sunday that she tested positive for the virus and will quarantine for 14 days.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Large crowds over the Labor Day weekend prompted city officials to issue a warning that the activity could cause a spike in coronavirus cases and that businesses will face citations for violating rules. “The city is aware of large crowd activity in violation of the public health guidelines, and of the images circulating online. This behavior is unacceptable, and it is dangerous. COVID-19 is not taking a holiday this weekend,” a city hall spokesperson said in a statement. City officials said Friday and Saturday that they had had 36 calls about large gatherings and another 46 calls for businesses not following rules. The city said code enforcement officers would be performing door-to-door checks. Public health officials have expressed concern that Labor Day gatherings could cause a spike in COVID-19 cases, similar to what happened after Memorial Day and July Fourth celebrations.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s seafood industry could get a $20 million boost this fall through funds made available under federal coronavirus relief. Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher said state and federal officials are nearing final agreement on exactly how to allocate the funds. Maine Public reports individual fishing license holders and shellfish growers who qualify will get the same lump-sum payment, no matter how large or small the operation. The funds will go to seafood-sector businesses that lost at least 35% of their revenues compared with the same period in previous years. A document the Department of Marine Resources produced for the federal government shows that commercial fishing license holders, boat-for-hire operations and aquaculture farms that qualify could get more than $2,100 each, while seafood dealers and processors are projected to receive just over $6,000 each.\n\nMaryland\n\nCollege Park: The University of Maryland said Monday that its bus drivers can enforce mask usage, several days after a driver reported two students who were denied boarding retaliated by throwing rocks at the bus, breaking some windows. The university issued a statement Monday to WTOP calling the incident “unfortunate” and saying it fully supports the driver “who put first the health and safety of everyone on the bus.” The statement said drivers can refuse to let people on board if they feel there are too many people on board already or if passengers refuse to wear a mask. The development came after the bus drivers’ union posted a lengthy Twitter thread over the weekend about the incident. The American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Local 1072 said the driver who didn’t let the students on board had been admonished. Under emergency orders from Gov. Larry Hogan, anyone on public transportation must wear a facial covering.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSomerville: This Boston suburb on Tuesday became the last community in the state to allow gyms, martial arts studios, music classes and some other businesses to reopen under the third phase of Massachusetts’ coronavirus recovery plan. While virtually the entire state moved into the third phase in July, Somerville Mayor Joe Curtatone proceeded with caution, twice pushing back Phase 3, citing a rise in the number of cases and the continued dangers of the virus. Businesses reopening Tuesday must meet strict safety requirements and have a city-approved health and safety plan, the mayor’s office said in a statement last week. Museums, movie theaters, and interactive attractions are still not allowed to reopen. Somerville also continues to limit the number of people allowed to gather in one place either indoors or outdoors to 10.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: Graduate students who teach classes were on strike Tuesday at the University of Michigan over in-person instruction during the coronavirus pandemic and other issues. The strikers chanted and held umbrellas while marching in the rain. “I do not want my students and colleagues to get a chronic illness because this university decided it was most important to collect tuition,” Surabhi Balachander said on Twitter. The Graduate Employees’ Organization, which represents more than 1,000 instructors, has called for a four-day strike. The vast majority of classes at the University of Michigan have shifted to online. But the union said the university isn’t doing enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It also wants the campus police budget cut by 50% and an end to cooperation with Ann Arbor police. University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said the strike is illegal under state law and the union contract.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gun dealers in the state attribute a surge in firearms sales to anxiety over the coronavirus, civil unrest and the uncertainties involving the presidential race. The National Shooting Sports Foundation says there were about 21,900 background checks for gun purchases in Minnesota in August of 2019. This year, there were nearly 35,000 in the same month. The surge in gun and ammunition sales began in March, as the COVID-19 pandemic lead to panic buying, as it did with some household supplies, according to gun shop owners. George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police in May and the protests and violence that followed only accelerated gun and ammunition purchases. The coronavirus outbreak has also led to limits on the supply of ammunition. Factories can’t make as many bullets due to COVID-19 shutdowns and social distancing restrictions on the number of employees working at once, Amon said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Eighteen men died in custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections in August, making it the deadliest month on record going back to at least 2014. One inmate has been confirmed dead of COVID-19, and 12 others are presumed to have died of the disease since the pandemic began, said Grace Fisher, a spokeswoman for MDOC. However, she would not say whether the spate of deaths in August is related to the coronavirus. MDOC responded to the pandemic in March by cutting off all visitors except lawyers and halting transfers of prisoners. The agency said it has implemented other measures meant to slow the spread of the disease, including screening employees for fevers, providing masks and hand sanitizer to inmates and staff, and quarantining symptomatic individuals. As of last Wednesday, more than 670 inmates and staff members have tested positive for COVID-19, MDOC reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: One of the state’s largest teacher unions wants the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to track – and publicly report – all the COVID-19 exposures logged in public schools. The Missouri National Education Association called on Gov. Mike Parson to require all districts to track COVID-19 cases and make that information available through a public registry. A letter sent last week to Margie Vandeven, the state’s education commissioner, asks for the state’s education department to collect that information and create an up-to-date public exposure report. “To make the best decision possible, parents and educators must have accurate and timely information about COVID-19 exposures in schools,” Phil Murray, president of the Missouri NEA, wrote in the letter. “However, there is no centralized repository of COVID-19 information for listing COVID-19 incidents in schools, nor is there a requirement for districts to publicly report any COVID-19 information.”\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Laboratory results and law enforcement reports indicate methamphetamine use increased in the state during the first months of the coronavirus pandemic. Millennium Health reported a 34% increase in urine samples testing positive for methamphetamine after President Donald Trump declared a national emergency March 13, The Missoulian reports. The lab company compared results from Jan. 1 through March 12 with results from March 13 through May 31. The report authors analyzed more than 500,000 urine samples from various health care settings, although how many were from Montana was unclear. The samples did not include drug testing done in the workplace or under court order. Meth became more scarce and more expensive as the pandemic disrupted the illegal drug trade, with local prices doubling, U.S. Attorney for Montana Kurt Alme said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Hospitals are asking for more federal aid to help recover from the financial toll the coronavirus pandemic has taken. Nebraska Hospital Association officials say it has meant increased costs and a decline in revenue for hospitals, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The revenue drop happened partly because Nebraska temporarily banned elective procedures to save hospital resources when the virus first hit the state. Some patients also avoided hospitals out of fear of catching COVID-19 there. Increased costs for hospitals included protective gear, COVID-19 testing sites, and medical equipment and medicine to treat the virus. Outpatient surgeries dropped by 70% in April vs. the same time last year, according to data from 80% of the association’s members. Emergency room visits declined by 44% in April. Hospitals have already received some federal aid. But the association’s vice president for advocacy, Andy Hale, said it’s not enough.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The Carson City School District is temporarily suspending student bus transportation after employees of the transportation department were advised to isolate because of a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the department. According to a release from the district, transportation services will resume after the isolation period – Sept. 15 at the earliest but possibly later if more employees test positive. The district said it is working with Carson City Health and Human Services on contact tracing and will follow the enhanced cleaning protocol in all schools including additional cleaning and disinfecting of the transportation facilities and all buses. Families are being asked to arrange their own transportation for students on their in-class learning days. Students whose families are unable to arrange transportation will be able to take fully remote online classes until transportation resumes, the district said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: More than 10 cases of COVID-19 have been traced to a fraternity party where people did not follow public health guidelines, the president of the University of New Hampshire said. In a Sunday letter to the university community, UNH President James Dean said more than 100 students and nonstudents attended the Aug. 29 party at the Theta Chi fraternity. “Let me be clear: this is reckless behavior and the kind of behavior that undermines our planning and will lead to us switching to a fully remote mode,” Dean said in the letter. He called the party “reprehensible” and said student conduct charges would be pursued against the organizers of the party and all students who attended the event. The fraternity was placed under interim suspension, and Dean ordered a moratorium on any in-person gatherings of any size within the fraternity, or sorority system or other social groups.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEnglewood Cliffs: Holy Name Medical Center’s nursing school saw 380 applications this year – a 90% increase over last year’s number – amid the coronavirus pandemic. The school’s freshman class typically has 70 or 80 students, but this year the school accepted 90. Holy Name’s Teaneck hospital was at the epicenter of the pandemic when COVID-19 first reached New Jersey in March. A few miles away, Bergen Community College also played a central role when the pandemic began: A line hundreds of cars deep snaked around campus when a testing site there opened in March. “They had all the COVID testing right here,” said Darlene Zales-Russamano, who leads the college’s nursing program. “Students and faculty volunteered. We did a lot of community work.” BCC’s nursing program had high application rates before the pandemic, so Zales-Russamano said it’s hard to tell just how much of the interest stems from the pandemic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials approved the start of production work by film crews in a sign the industry could soon be back in business after a suspension because of the coronavirus. Film companies will follow specific guidelines created by an industry task force as they resume, The Santa Fe New Mexican reports. The companies will also be required to adhere to public health rules for all businesses in the state, including a face mask mandate, social distancing and frequent hand-washing. “You’re going to start to see some activity” at studios statewide, said Liz Pecos, president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local 480. Pecos said “several hundred” of the 1,500 crew members in the film workers union have returned to work. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has not yet announced when public health restrictions will be eased to allow filmmaking to fully resume.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state marked a milestone of progress in fighting coronavirus infections Monday, with a full month of less than 1% of virus tests coming back positive. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the 30-day stretch of good news while urging people to remain cautious during Labor Day weekend get-togethers. He attributed the state’s progress to its statewide mask mandate and an approach to reopening that’s been slower than in many other states. “It took the work of all of us to get here, and to protect this progress we will need to all continue to wash our hands, wear our masks, remain socially distant and above all, stay New York tough,” Cuomo said in a statement. There is concern that case counts could rise as schools, college campuses and more businesses reopen. Throughout New York’s 64-campus state university system, more than 900 students and employees have tested positive on campuses over the past two weeks.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: The University of North Carolina at Wilmington said Tuesday that it is splitting roommates in on-campus housing in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. A news release from the school said its housing and residence staff is contacting first-year students living on campus with a roommate about arranging for one of them to move into a single-occupancy room. The school says the new student assignment will be to another residence hall or apartment on the UNC-Wilmington campus, and it will be their assignment for the remainder of the academic year. About 800 students will be affected by the move, the school said. The move comes after the school was approached by the New Hanover County Health Department because it said 18- to 24-year-olds represent the largest source of new COVID-19 cases in the county.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State health officials said Tuesday that the number of active COVID-19 cases has dropped for two straight days, including 301 fewer cases in the past day. Active cases in the state reached a record number of 2,653 on Sunday. That has been reduced by 389 in the past two days, for a total of 2,264. Hospitalizations have dropped by five in the past day, to 63, and for the second straight day there were no new deaths. North Dakota ranks first in the country in the number of new cases in the past two weeks, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Officials on Tuesday confirmed 75 positive tests for the coronavirus, for a total of 13,877 cases. The number of tests that have been processed took a dip over the holiday weekend. After more than 7,300 tests were recorded Saturday, the numbers fell to about 4,800 on Sunday, 2,400 on Monday and 1,400 on Tuesday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: State Rep. Reggie Stoltzfus, R-Paris Township, said he has introduced a bill that would allow an uncapped number of immediate family members of participants to attend high school games. He said at least 10 people have contacted him out of frustration because the entire family of athletes can’t attend, and local school districts are often effectively limiting the number of family members of participants to two to four per game. They are only issuing two to four tickets to each participant, he said, as part of their efforts to comply with state health orders to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Stoltzfus declined to identify the school districts. If passed, the bill would apparently set aside state health order limits on the number of spectators allowed at the games. According to the health order issued last month, any school athletic contest can not have more than 15% of the capacity of the venue.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state prison inmate being treated for the illness caused by the coronavirus has died, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections said. The inmate at the Eddie Warrior Correctional Center in Taft died Saturday at a hospital, the department said Monday. The woman, whose name wasn’t released, suffered other, undisclosed, health issues, and the state medical examiner will determine whether COVID-19 was a factor in her death, the DOC said. The department said it hasn’t gotten any reports from the medical examiner citing COVID-19 as the cause of a prisoner’s death. Meanwhile, Saturday’s football game between Oklahoma State University and the University of Tulsa was postponed for one week. Tulsa’s athletic director said they weren’t physically prepared after canceling practice for nine days due to multiple positive coronavirus tests.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The Oregon Republican Party did not gather enough signatures by the deadline to recall Gov. Kate Brown – its second failed recall of the governor in less than a year. Republicans have accused Brown of abusing her power and destroying the state’s economy through shutdowns imposed in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The governor has said shutdowns were in keeping with the advice of public health experts and intended to save lives. For the recall to proceed, the state GOP needed to gather and submit 280,050 valid signatures to the Secretary of State’s office by Aug. 31, 90 days from when the recall effort was initiated. Oregon GOP Chair Bill Currier said their campaign gathered 277,254 signatures, just short of the required number. The Oregon GOP also did not gather enough signatures for its recall that ended in October 2019.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Restaurants will be allowed to seat more patrons inside after Gov. Tom Wolf announced Tuesday that he is relaxing restrictions on indoor dining, providing some relief to an industry that’s been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis. Eateries may increase indoor occupancy from 25% to 50% of capacity starting Sept. 21, more than two months after the Wolf administration imposed a new round of restrictions on the state’s beleaguered hospitality industry, citing rising infection rates in some virus hot spots. “The move to 25% … was an attempt to flatten the curve in Pennsylvania. We were starting to see a troubling rise,” Wolf said at a news conference in Lancaster. “Now I think we’re at a point where we are ready to lift that, partially.” Bar and restaurant owners have said they were unfairly blamed for rising virus case numbers, challenging the Wolf administration to provide evidence.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Two key indicators of how well the state is containing the coronavirus are heading in the right direction, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The seven-day rolling average of daily new confirmed cases in the state dropped over the past two weeks, going from about 104 on Aug. 24 to 42 on Monday. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Rhode Island fell over the past two weeks, going from 1.71% on Aug. 24 to 0.89% on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins. The state Department of Health on Tuesday reported 180 new confirmed cases of the disease over the past four days and four additional coronavirus-related deaths. There have now been nearly 22,600 known cases in the state as well as 1,059 fatalities. The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 fell to 73 as of Sunday, down from 82 on Friday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State senators will likely consider whether to restore the annual raises most teachers get each year to the state budget when they return to Columbia next week for a special session amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Senate Finance Committee is working on a proposal to spend $40 million out of about $775 million saved up over the past two years on what are called step increases – pay raises of usually about several hundred dollars a year given to teachers as they gain experience. Lawmakers suspended the raises in the spring because of the uncertainty of what the COVID-19 pandemic might do to the economy. Senators also will likely consider setting aside $15 million in federal COVID-19 relief money for hazard pay bonuses for state workers who make under $50,000 a year and whose jobs are more risky during the pandemic.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nWatertown: When the coronavirus began taking its toll on Americans in March, Brooks Jacobsen at Lake Area Technical College took note of the use of 3D printers to produce personal protective equipment, items in critically short supply across the U.S. Jacobsen initiated the idea of creating face shields and received approval from LATC officials. Health care workers at Prairie Lakes Healthcare System gave him input on the type of face shield they preferred. “I put out an email to our 3D printing community here in town,” Jacobsen told the Watertown Public Opinion. He linked up with Mark Iverson at Watertown Middle School on the project. Five months later, the volunteers had created 37,000 to 40,000 face shields that went to the front-line heroes of the pandemic. “It’s a surreal thing,” Iverson said. “It’s a hobby of mine that I teach to students, and then it turns around to be something that’s saving lives.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: From people throwing massive house parties and not wearing masks to bars staying open late and “transpotainment” vehicles operating with alcohol, Metro Nashville police issued 61 health department citations and made three arrests downtown over Labor Day weekend. According to police, officers cited 12 people Friday evening for not wearing face masks. About 2,500 others were reminded of the requirement by police and safety ambassadors hired by the police department. People in Davidson County are currently mandated by the Metro Public Health Department to use face coverings or masks in public settings in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Residents and business that want to host concerts, political fundraisers, sporting events or other private gatherings can potentially have up to 125 people in attendance if they get approval by city officials, according to a public health order that took effect last week.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott has extended the state’s disaster declaration in response to the coronavirus pandemic as the state approaches nearly 13,500 deaths. The extension of the disaster declaration came as three of the state’s largest school districts experienced technical problems Tuesday as their students started the new school year virtually because of concerns about the pandemic. When Abbott first issued his emergency order March 13, state officials hadn’t yet reported any confirmed deaths. Abbott has renewed his order every 30 days since and did again Monday. Although hospitalizations for COVID-19 have steadily declined since a peak in mid-July, Abbott said Texans should remain vigilant in helping to prevent virus spread. “I urge Texans to take precautionary steps to protect their health by wearing a mask, social distancing and sanitizing their hands,” Abbott said.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: A group filed a lawsuit against the governor and Department of Health alleging that restrictions imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic infringe on “their most sacred and fundamental rights.” The lawsuit was filed in Utah’s 4th District Court in Provo on Sept. 3. It lists 29 ways Gov. Gary Herbert has deprived the group of their rights, including denying children of their right to education, depriving residents the right to worship freely, and preventing citizens their rights to “human contact and touch.” Morgan Philpot, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, has asked a judge to nullify all state executive orders related to the coronavirus. The governor’s office could not be reached Monday to comment on the lawsuit, the Standard-Examiner reports. Utah has experienced 55,033 confirmed cases, 3,225 hospitalizations and 423 deaths as a result of the coronavirus, the state Department of Health reported Monday.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Monday started offering $30 to Vermonters to spend at local businesses to help residents and businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. The Legislature allocated $500,000 in federal coronavirus relief funds for the Buy Local Vermont program, and awards will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. As of midday Tuesday, more than 10,000 Vermonters were trying to get signed up, and the website was having some trouble, said Commerce Secretary Lindsay Kurrle. “The system is working, but I understand that the codes are a still little delayed, but we’re just asking for folks’ patience, and hopefully those codes will be coming your way very shortly,” Kurrle said. When the offer is activated, residents are matched with local businesses where they can use the funds.\n\nVirginia\n\nStafford: An analysis of sewage in Stafford County indicates it has 10 times as many people walking around with the coronavirus as test results suggest. The Free Lance-Star reports the county has been conducting experimental testing at two wastewater plants since April. The Stafford facilities are among more than 100 wastewater treatment plants across the country that are participating in a no-cost pilot program. Sewage can provide an early indicator of a disease spreading before people start seeking health care. Sampling of households hooked up to the county sewer system showed that up to 18% of North Stafford’s population may have the virus. “That means 1 out of every 5 people in Stafford may be infected,” Deputy County Administrator Michael Smith wrote in a letter to the county’s board of supervisors. Smith stressed that the number is still in the testing phase.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: COVID-19 spread quickly throughout Kitsap County’s primary hospital to at least 65 people in August, a state Department of Health report said, and its springboard may have been certain procedures that swelled the air with lingering particles of coronavirus-carrying respiratory fluid. Suctioning or intubating a patient’s airways, CPR and other “aerosol generating procedures” at St. Michael Medical Center are being zeroed in on as the culprit for transmission – all while a growing body of research by scientists says aerosols may be the most effective way to spread COVID-19. At St. Michael, state health officials said some staff did not wear N95 masks during aerosol-generating procedures, limiting their protection to just surgical masks and eye protection. They were performed in rooms without key ventilation known as negative air pressure, a violation of the hospital’s policy.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: In-person classes were canceled at West Virginia University on Tuesday, with nearly all undergraduate classes moving online Wednesday through at least Sept. 25, according to a news release. The changes at the Morgantown campus are a response to a recent increase in positive coronavirus cases among students and a concern that cases may increase even more following reports of parties over the holiday weekend when groups should have been in quarantine. WVU placed 29 members of a fraternity house on suspension for not following health and safety orders related to the pandemic. A Theta Chi fraternity member, who tested positive for the virus and had been ordered into isolation, attended a party at the fraternity house Friday, the university said in a statement. The school also is investigating photos and videos from a large party hosted by another non-school-recognized fraternity, Alpha Sigma Phi.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The chancellor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on Monday canceled all in-person social events and ordered undergraduate students to restrict their movements for the next two weeks in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. The order from Chancellor Rebecca Blank comes as the number of coronavirus cases among students has continued to rise. Among the restrictions, from now through Sept. 21, all student gyms and recreational facilities will be closed, dining halls will offer carryout only, and visitors will not be allowed in dorms. Blank also warned that the campus might shut down if the situation gets worse. In-person classes have not been canceled, and study spaces remain open. The restrictions also don’t apply to graduate students, faculty or staff members. The number of cases among students at UW-Madison has grown daily for the past five days.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The United States’ largest coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin, is on pace to produce less than 200 million tons of coal for the first time in three decades, The Gillette News Record reports. The Wyoming basin has experienced a nearly 25% decrease in production from this time in 2019, according to the Energy Information Association. Last year, the U.S. produced its lowest amount of coal since 1975. So far this year, 568 jobs have been lost in the basin, or over 12% of the workforce. Rob Godby, director of the Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy at the University of Wyoming, said lower natural gas prices and the coronavirus pandemic are to blame for the decline in coal production. The pandemic in particular has exacerbated a trend of declining demand for coal, Godby said. Public health restrictions and economic concerns from the pandemic have reduced the demand in electricity.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/07/11/bidens-press-conference-gaza-pier-and-boysober-thursdays-news/74298136007/", "title": "Biden's press conference, Gaza pier, and 'boysober': Thursday's news", "text": "President Joe Biden faces a big moment tonight.

The press conference, part of the NATO summit taking place in Washington, is Biden's first since his debate against Donald Trump two weeks ago, which raised concerns about the president's fitness for a second term. Several Democratic lawmakers and big donors have called on him to step aside − in favor of who remains a huge, unresolved question − although others continue to support him and Biden has repeatedly said he is staying in the race.

The pier was plagued with problems from the start, as rough seas tore it from the shore multiple times. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan suggested the pier is no longer essential for getting humanitarian aid into Gaza because other Israel-controlled border crossings have reopened. But a group of experts earlier this week said the deaths of several children from malnutrition shows that famine has spread throughout the territory.

At least 400 people showed up for the unveiling of the statue at the downtown site where Parks got on the bus the day she was arrested, a key moment in the civil rights movement. The unveiling was part of several tributes to the day Parks was arrested for refusing to give her seat to a white man on a city bus on Dec. 1, 1955. Her arrest was one of the events that sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott that challenged segregation on public buses. Along with the Parks memorial, the city presented two historic markers for the plaintiffs of Browder v. Gayle – the landmark case that ruled segregation on Montgomery buses was unconstitutional. Fred Gray, the attorney who defended Parks and many other civil rights heroes, sat in the second row for the unveiling. The civil rights memorials are a partnership between the city of Montgomery, Montgomery County, the Alabama Department of Tourism and the Montgomery Area Business Committee for the Arts. Clydetta Fulmer was the artist commissioned to complete the statue of Parks.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Anchorage Assembly approved funds to study how the city would build a waste-to-energy incineration plant to contend with its landfill limits, officials said. The assembly approved $100,000 from its Solid Waste Services budget Tuesday to fund a plan to be completed in 90 days, The Anchorage Daily News reported Thursday. The $300 million to $400 million plant would require seven to 10 years of work before opening, officials said. The landfill in Eagle River has an estimated 42 operational years left, and an incineration plant would increase that lifespan to 177 years, Anchorage Solid Waste Services Manager Mark Spafford said. Other options include sending trash north to the Matanuska-Susitna Valley or removing it by water using a barge, although neither are economically viable, Spafford said. The study does not commit the city to build the plant, but would give officials a better idea of costs, time needed and benefits, Spafford said. While burning the city’s garbage, the plant would produce 20 to 30 megawatts of power at peak capacity. Anchorage now produces 7.2 megawatts from methane captured at the landfill, officials said. The plant could also burn sludge from Anchorage Water & Wastewater Utility, eliminating the need for a new $100 million incinerator for the utility, Spafford said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Three tornadoes touched down in the metro Phoenix area early Friday morning, according to the National Weather Service. “I can tell you that even getting one (in Phoenix) is pretty rare and getting one from this type of weather system is not too common,” said Andrew Deemer, a meteorologist with the weather service. The first confirmed tornado occurred about 4 a.m. in the Gilbert area of Williams Field Road and the Loop 202, the agency tweeted about 7 p.m. Friday. The second tornado occurred about the same time in the Queen Creek-area while the third occurred in the Paradise Valley-area, it added. Although they were estimated to be weak tornadoes, the agency said each caused damage ranging from downed trees and power poles to damaged roofs. Two tornado warnings were briefly in effect early Friday morning when the rain hit the Valley and snow caused freeway closures and power outages in the high country. The agency tweeted that on May 4, 1976, and Feb. 13, 1992, three tornadoes touched down in Maricopa County each day. Deemer said in 2010, the Flagstaff/Bellemont area had three strong tornadoes around the same time. The Valley last had a tornado in September when one touched down around New River.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home:Sgt. Ken Grayham of the Baxter County Sheriff’s Office rescued an adult barred owl that had been hit by a vehicle on state highway 5 a few miles north of Midway. Grayham responded to the call because there were no Game & Fish Commission officers nearby. Taking a dispatcher’s recommendation, Grayham dropped his raincoat over the bird and after a brief struggle, was able to get the owl into his patrol car. He took the owl to All Creatures Veterinary Hospital in Mountain Home. Dr. Darcy Stephenson, he hospital’s avian expert, said the owl will lose sight in its eye and that the incident caused its brain to swell. That’s the primary concern now for the bird’s health. “We’ll keep an eye on him pretty closely today to monitor the swelling,” Stephenson said. “But he’s already flying around in his cage in the isolation room so that’s a good sign.” Once the bird heals from its injuries, it will be released back into the wild, despite losing sight in its eye. “Owls don’t hunt by sight,” Stephenson said. “They hunt by sound and by smell so the loss of the eye will not impact his ability to feed himself.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nOxnard: Authorities said a garage fire has displaced three people and a large number of reptiles. The Ventura County Star reported Sunday that firefighters found a dozen or two dozen reptiles after battling an electric fire in a detached garage on Saturday. Oxnard Fire Department Battalion Chief Steve McNaughten said the animals included a boa constrictor and a 6-foot-long lizard. He said several animals died in the blaze in the city about 60 miles west of Los Angeles. McNaughten said the Red Cross typically helps with displaced house pets but additional help was sought because of the large number of reptiles.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Housing Catalyst, an agency that helps provide affordable housing, will be able to provide housing for 34 more nonelderly residents with disabilities through a $300,000 grant from U.S. Housing and Urban Development. Housing Catalyst is one of seven public housing agencies in Colorado and 325 across the country to share in a $131.3 million grant. The grant is part of HUD’s Mainstream Housing Choice Voucher Program that provides funding to agencies to help people with disabilities, particularly those who are homeless, previously homeless, at risk of becoming homeless, transitioning out of institutional or other separated settings, or at serious risk of institutionalization, according to a press release from HUD announcing the grant. Housing Catalyst had to get other partner agencies to commit to providing things like home modifications, housing search assistance and tenancy support to win the grant, said Michele Christensen, chief operating officer of Housing Catalyst. The agency is still evaluating the best way to notify those who meet the eligibility criteria and create an application process, Christensen said. HUD has not released the funds yet, so it is unlikely the vouchers would be given out before the new year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: It’s unknown whether efforts next year to make the seasonal flu vaccine more accessible to children will get any traction. Given the anticipated debate about whether to end Connecticut’s religious exemption from certain childhood vaccinations, the CEO of the Connecticut Pharmacists Association said his group doesn’t plan to push for a bill in the next regular legislative session that would allow young people to get a flu shot from a pharmacist. Nathan Tinker said concerns raised by parents skeptical about the safety of vaccines could impede efforts to make the flu vaccine more accessible. Groton Sen. Heather Somers, a Republican, said she still plans to resurrect the bill when lawmakers return in February. She said the legislation will save lives. Currently, pharmacists can only administer flu shots to adults.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle:Firefighters worked Thursday afternoon to control a blaze that tore through a home near New Castle. Multiple fire companies responded to the incident at a one-story house on the 20 block of Jay Drive. Smoke poured out of a broken front windows and crews were seen tearing through the roof and garage walls. At about 4:30 p.m., the fire was under control, a dispatcher said. He could not provide information about the extent of the damage or if anyone was injured. Neighbors who were gathered around the scene said residents of the house did not appear to be home on the holiday. Andrea Flores, who lives around the corner, said she and other neighbors called the fire department when they saw smoke at about 3:30 p.m. There were no cars in the driveway.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:An annual event that features some of the district’s top chefs is back to help support a local foundation's commitment to empowering communities in rural India, WUSA-TV reported. The Vicente Ferrer Foundation USA is holding its annual Recipe for Empowerment Gala on Dec. 7. The foundation is celebrating 50 years of work in India. The event will feature Indian, American and Spanish cuisine from area chefs. Some of them include: K.N Vinod from Indique, Rahul Vinod from RASA, Carlos Gomez from La Taberna del Alabardero and Danny Lledó from Slate Wine Bar and Xiquet, among others, the foundation said. There will also be a silent and live auction. For decades, the organization has focused on supporting women, people with disabilities and marginalized farmers in health care, agriculture, education and rural infrastructure with a grassroots approach, the foundation said.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: Glenn Pitts lived a quiet life after World War II as a laundry manager, building contractor and landlord, but a friend’s tip led to the 94-year-old to receive the Legion of Honor for his part in liberating France. On Nov. 22, the French government named Pitts a knight of the Legion of Honor, its highest distinction, for his part in liberating France from Nazi occupation 75 years ago. “We know what we owe you and your brothers,” Laurent Gallissot, France’s consul general in Miami, told the 94-year-old Army veteran during a ceremony at Jacksonville City Hall. France decided in 2004 – the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landing – to award the medal to any U.S. veteran who had fought on French soil and requested the honor. Drafted when he was 18, Pitts, a native of Eastman, Ga., learned to operate a water-cooled .30-calibre machine gun that could fire hundreds of rounds per minute. He was a private in the Army’s 63rd Infantry Division when he was deployed to Marseilles in December 1944. He was still in Germany when the Nazi government surrendered in May 1945 and was reassigned to a Signal Corps unit where he finished out his service.\n\nGeorgia\n\nLawrenceville: One of Georgia’s largest counties has created a special jail unit just for military veterans. “The Barracks” is aimed at giving veterans behind bars a better chance of success when they’re released, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Gwinnett County’s program joins a broader trend of finding creative ways to help veterans caught up in the justice system. It is among more than 120 U.S. prisons and jails that have separate cell blocks dedicated to military veterans, according to the National Institute for Corrections. Most of them have been added in recent years. Gwinnett County’s program launched in November, and it’s still getting ramped up. There will soon be extra programs and services to help incarcerated veterans, the newspaper reported. The Barracks was the brainchild of Chief Deputy Lou Solis, a retired Army Ranger who joined the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office about two years ago.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: State officials have announced plans to expand the Big Island’s only jail by adding a $12.8 million medium-security building amid concerns about overcrowding. West Hawaii Today reported Friday that the Hawaii Community Correctional Center was designed to hold 226 inmates across two Hilo campuses, but recorded more than 400 inmates last month. Jail warden Peter Cabreros said the jail processes about 5,000 inmates a year. Officials said construction of the new unit is about a year away. Officials said an environmental assessment anticipates room for up to 144 inmates, but funds allow 48 beds in two-bed cells and an optional expansion for another 32 beds. Some neighbors opposed the expansion saying the jail is too close to nearby schools less than 500 feet from the facility.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in downtown Boise has been delayed because the tree fell over. The Idaho Statesman reported that the 45-year-old evergreen toppled sometime Thursday night. The ceremony, which brings a crowd to the Grove in downtown Boise every year, had been set for Friday night. The Downtown Boise Association said it will reschedule the event and that more information will be available next week. It’s not clear why the tree fell. Meanwhile, the annual Idaho Capitol Christmas tree lighting ceremony is scheduled for Monday between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. in front of the Capitol building.\n\nIllinois\n\nSavoy: More than $20 million in construction is planned at Willard Airport in central Illinois during the next two years. The News-Gazette reported that the work includes reconstruction of a runway, and added taxiway and a redone entrance road to the University of Illinois-owned airport in Savoy. Airport officials also expect a new U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility to be completed and opened early next year. Airport Executive Director Tim Bannon said that means private international flights can arrive direct, rather than stopping elsewhere to clear customs. Long-term, airport officials hope to secure federal funding to renovate the terminal that was built in 1988 and add an air control traffic tower. But Bannon said requests for that funding through the Federal Aviation Administration can take time.\n\nIndiana\n\nGary: Blast furnace operations are expected to be restored at U.S. Steel’s Gary Works mill several days after flooding at the facility. The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported that the company hopes to bring its steel-making operations back online in the coming days. U.S. Steel spokeswoman Amanda Malkowski said a service water leak was reported Wednesday near blast furnace operations and, as a precaution, the company stopped the furnaces and steel production. United Steelworkers District 7 Director Mike Millsap said the leak was from a massive pipe that brings Lake Michigan water into the mill to cool furnaces and other steel-making equipment. Crews worked over the Thanksgiving holiday to remove the water.\n\nIowa\n\nAmana: State officials are hoping to reduce water pollution by addressing problems in the small waterways that zigzag throughout the state, and they believe something as simple as name awareness can help. The Cedar Rapids Gazette reported that the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Transportation have partnered since 2014 to install more than 900 creek name signs across the state. Stephen Hopkins of the DNR said the focus is on areas with past watershed improvement projects, ongoing work or assessments that might lead to future projects. One project is at Price Creek, a 13-mile stream that passes through Amana before flowing into the Iowa River. Price Creek Watershed project coordinator Rose Danaher has been leading efforts to reduce manure flow into the creek. Price Creek signs were installed on Highway 151. The creek, named after early settler Abraham Price, is on Iowa’s list of impaired waters because of high bacteria levels. The signage is a small part of the effort to make it cleaner. Efforts include fencing out cattle, helping farmers manage manure and replacing failing septic tanks. The $50,000 spent so far on the creek sign program comes from a grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designed to clean up waterways impaired by nonpoint source pollution, which can come from sources including agriculture and industry. Part of the money is to be used for raising awareness, such as through signage.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The toll of massive flooding in Kansas is proving to be high for the agency that operates state parks. KCUR reported that the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism will lose millions of dollars as a result of park closures, property damage and washed out park roads. In much of the state, heavy rains began in early spring and flooding was widespread into the summer. High water levels at reservoirs, where many state parks are located, inundated campgrounds, boat docks and roads. Parks Director Linda Lanterman said the timing was especially bad because May through August are the “Million-Dollar Months,” when revenue is at its highest. This year, state park revenue fell short in those four months. Even now, parts of a few state parks in eastern Kansas remain flooded, preventing the department from fully assessing the damage. Most parks opened by mid-July. Repairing damage will be a daunting task. Floodwaters cracked boat docks, washed away gravel from roads, filled restrooms with silt and removed chunks of land underneath concrete campsites and picnic table pads. Flooding also is killing many trees, preventing the roots from getting needed oxygen.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: Fort Boonesborough State Park is offering a glimpse of Christmas past with an event this week. The “18th Century Christmas at the Fort” is set for Dec. 6 and 7. Admission is $8 for adults, $6 for ages 6 to 12 and free for anyone under 6. Admission includes refreshments, entertainment, crafts and photos with Father Christmas. Guests at the Friday event will be able to see the fort lit with candle lanterns and bonfires. Cabins will be decorated and occupied by living history interpreters. Period music and refreshments will be available in the Blockhouse Tavern with displays of foods from the time period. Children will have a chance to make a toy. Hours are 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Dec. 6 and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Dec. 7.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Anglers can now fish for red snapper seven days a week. State Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Jack Montoucet signed a declaration of emergency this week to expand the season from weekends-only. The Courier reported the bonus season took effect Thanksgiving Day and will continue through noon Dec. 31, or when the state’s remaining catch quota of 27,582 pounds is reached. The red snapper season ran seven days a week from May 24 through mid-August. It switched to weekends-only after the state’s data-collection program determined fishermen had neared the 816,439-pound limit federal officials had set for Louisiana. The daily catch limit for snapper is two per person with a minimum total length of 16 inches. For more information on the extended red snapper season, visit www.wlf.louisiana.gov/red-snapper.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Two studies by Maine-based scientists suggest the U.S. lobster industry is heading for a period of decline, but likely not a crash. Lobster fishermen have brought in record hauls this decade. The new studies were published by University of Maine scientists. They showed a fishery in which warming waters have changed the dynamics of the lobster population. Noah Oppenheim is the author of one of the studies. He said his model projects the lobster catch in the Gulf of Maine “will return to previous historical levels.” That means tens of millions fewer pounds of lobster per year. Oppenheim and colleagues based their opinion on a finding that temperature and the number of young lobsters populating shallow coastal areas allow scientists to predict what lobster catches will look like in four to six years.\n\nMaryland\n\nAllegany County: A State Police helicopter hoisted an injured hiker to safety. Police said the helicopter was used Friday to rescue a hiker with a leg injury from a ravine in Allegany County. Police said the helicopter maneuvered into position about 200 feet above a steep ravine. A rescue technician was lowered down to help the hiker and the pair were lifted back up into the helicopter. The hiker was then transported to a local hospital.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston Pops Brass Ensemble will entertain travelers for free at Logan International Airport this week. The ensemble is scheduled to perform holiday hits at Logan’s Terminal B on Monday. The Pops will have a special giveaway and hot chocolate, coffee, tea, cold drinks and holiday treats including candy canes will be handed out to passengers. The festivities start at 11 a.m. The full Pops has just started its annual Holiday Pops on Tour schedule, which takes it to venues across the Northeast, as well as its home at Symphony Hall in Boston.\n\nMichigan\n\nHannahville: An Upper Peninsula nonprofit organization is supporting a program that educates young people in the Hannahville Indian Community about the dangers of e-cigarettes. The Marquette-based Superior Health Foundation awarded an $11,518 grant to the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan for the Anishinaabe E-cigarette and JUUL Health Education Project. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the use of e-cigarettes is unsafe for children and young adults. Health educator Kelly Hansen of the Hannahville Indian Community said JUUL products also pose risks. JUUL is a battery-powered e-cigarette that generates a nicotine-laced aerosol. Hansen said the tribal project will use a curriculum called “Catch my Breath” to provide teachers, parents and health professionals with information about e-cigarettes and help children make wise choices.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBloomington: Recently released data from Syracuse University showed that pending immigration cases have increased 70% since last year in Minnesota’s Bloomington federal immigration court. The court handles cases from North Dakota and South Dakota in addition to Minnesota. Minnesota Public Radio reported that six immigration judges handle the cases for the three states. Minnesota has 13,703 pending cases, according to the data. It concludes that the backlog of cases is at a record high. More than a million cases are pending nationally. New York, California, and Texas have some of the highest numbers. North Dakota and South Dakota don’t have any pending cases. An immigration attorney attributes the rise in cases to stricter enforcement and not having enough judges to handle the caseload.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: During a university course about the civil rights movement, Mississippi streets became classrooms where civil rights activists and local historians were teachers. University of Southern Mississippi Associate Professor Rebecca Tuuri said Mississippi was ground-zero for the movement. The university’s main campus is in Hattiesburg, where as many as one-third of the black residents participated in civil rights activism during the 1960s. Tuuri said in an interview that the real teachers were the people who lived through that time or preserved their memory and were willing to let students ask them questions. Graduate student Dani Kawa of Richmond, Virginia, said in a school news release that she was amazed by the resilience of civil rights activists, especially in Mississippi.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The longtime leader of the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis has died. Relatives of James Buford said he died Friday at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis after a brief, undisclosed illness. He was 75. Buford was known for his work to try and bridge racial gaps between blacks and whites in St. Louis. He served as president of the St. Louis Urban League for nearly 30 years before retiring in 2013. Mayor Lyda Krewson called Buford a “strong leader of change” in the community. Buford was born in St. Louis in 1944. His father was one of the city’s first black police officers. Details about a memorial service have not yet been released.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The University of Montana has announced a new course entitled “The Art and Science of Happiness,” joining other universities in adding the emotion to the curriculum. The Missoulian reported Wednesday that psychologists John and Rita Sommers-Flanagan are expected this spring to teach about the traits and habits that enable people to flourish. University professors said the course aims to make the research applicable to students’ lives by using contemporary approaches from mindfulness to emotion-monitoring phone applications. Professors said the students will be graded on knowledge-based assessments not on their state of being in the course. Officials said 28 students have registered as of Monday. Officials said a Harvard University course on the topic drew 900 students in 2006 and a similar course at Yale drew 1,200 students in 2018.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Eight months after massive floods washed out chunks of one of the nation’s longest stretches of trail, crews are still trying to repair the scenic pathway used by hikers, bikers and horse riders. The 195-mile-long Cowboy Trail through northern Nebraska was severely damaged during the March floods, and repair costs are estimated to top $7.7 million, according to a recent state budget request submitted to Gov. Pete Ricketts. At least 10 points along the trail were hit, including one 100-foot-long section blown out by the water. Most of the money will come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but state officials might have to cover $1.9 million of the expense. State officials might be able to cover some of the cost with other federal trail grants, but it’s not clear how much money Nebraska might receive. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission has requested $187,000 from lawmakers in a budget request unveiled last month. Ricketts and lawmakers will decide whether to authorize the funding in the next legislative session that begins Jan. 8. State officials created the trail from an old, abandoned railroad line, a practice many local governments and nonprofits have adopted to brighten their communities. The trails are a big draw for bicyclists, runners, dog-walkers and others, and some small towns have used them to attract visitors. The Cowboy Trail stretches from Norfolk in the state’s northeast corner to Valentine, in the middle of remote, north-central Nebraska. State officials eventually hope to extend it to Chadron in northwest Nebraska, making it the nation’s longest rail-trail. Once completed, the full trail will run 321 miles through a scenic region of grass-covered sand dunes known as the Nebraska Sandhills.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Southern Nevada water officials said six trees and a dozen other plants commonly found in Las Vegas-area landscaping could see extreme heat stress in the warming climate. The Las Vegas Sun reported the water authority wants to warn people about some desert flora planted now with the hope of relying on its cooling properties in the decades to come. The Southern Nevada Water Authority has identified nonnative species like the purple leaf plum tree, the ash tree and elm trees, all of which were not well-suited for desert life. The authority’s conservation manager, Doug Bennett, said the plants are not certain to die but will be under increasing stress. Other trees like the palo verde and desert willow have a high heat tolerance and are expected to fare well.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Holiday shoppers paying with $100 bills in downtown Concord should be prepared for some extra scrutiny after a spate of transactions involving counterfeit money. The Concord Monitor reported that at least two store owners have stopped accepting $100 bills, and others will be taking a closer look or only accepting newer versions that have more security features. Authorities said at least three local businesses took in false $100 bills earlier this month and didn’t find out until they tried to deposit them at the bank. Cashiers at The Works Cafe and Gibson’s Bookstore have stopped accepting the bills.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWall Township: Officials said a clown sign that has smiled on motorists at a now-demolished drive-in for two-thirds of a century will be preserved. NJ.com reported that developers of a strip mall at the Wall Township site said they will donate the Circus Drive-In sign for preservation and display elsewhere. The Route 35 drive-in, a vestige of car culture with a white-and-red striped roof resembling an old-fashioned circus tent, closed in 2017. Developer Circus Partners LLC bought the site and demolished the building last year, and last week won planning board approval for the strip mall. But attorney Tim Middleton said the red, yellow, green and white sign featuring a smiling clown’s face will be offered to the township in hopes that it will be placed on public view.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s airport is getting international attention for its display of art. The Sunport’s Lowriders and Hot Rods Car Culture exhibit has landed a spot on the latest list of top airport exhibits in the world by the quarterly publication ArtDesk. The exhibit features an array of photos and a 1964 Chevrolet Impala. The airport also has a permanent collection of more than 100 pieces that include Native American, Hispanic and Southwestern works overseen by Max Baptiste, who has taken on the airport’s newly added role of art curator. Baptiste told Albuquerque television station KRQE he’s not surprised about the recent recognition since New Mexico is what he describes as “an amazing arts community.” He said the goal is to create a sense of pride and that airports are a great spot for doing that.\n\nNew York\n\nSaranac Lake: An Adirondack Mountain village that was put on the map as a cure center for tuberculosis is honoring its novel legacy. Saranac Lake was once a mini-metropolis of medical care, but the boom ended with the rise of antibiotics. Now, a local history group has purchased the old home and medical office of TB treatment pioneer Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau for museum space. And developers bought Trudeau’s old sanitorium with plans to refurbish and reuse it.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMcAdenville: A longtime yarn manufacturer is getting out of the textile business. Pharr announced last week it’s selling three of its five divisions early next year. News outlets reported Pharr Fibers & Yarns and Phenix Flooring will go to Mannington Mills, based in Salem, New Jersey. Pharr High Performance will be purchased by London-based Coats Group. Terms weren’t disclosed. The changes will leave McAdenville-based Pharr with its Belmont Land & Development real-estate arm and Strand Hospitality Services, which manages hotel properties. Privately owned Pharr has manufactured textile-mill yarn since 1939 and employs 1,200 workers. CEO Bill Carstarphen said Mannington Mills and Coats Group will retain Pharr’s workforce and operations in McAdenville and Dalton, Georgia. He said Pharr also will continue its annual “Christmas Town USA” light display in McAdenville.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A bill meant to help law enforcement investigate cold cases of murdered and missing indigenous women that has floundered in Congress for two years might have the missing ingredients to become law – money and muscle. The money comes from an appropriations subcommittee chaired by Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who told the Associated Press that for the first time funding is being directed specifically to murdered and missing indigenous people. The muscle comes from the White House and specifically the Department of Justice, which last week unveiled a plan that would investigate issues raised in the bill like data collection practices and federal databases. It adds up to a strong outlook for Savanna’s Act, which was originally introduced in 2017 by Murkowski, Democratic Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Mastro and former North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. Murkowski and Heitkamp, longtime allies on issues affecting indigenous people, also created the Commission on Native Children, which recently held its first meeting. The bill is named for Savanna Greywind, a Native American North Dakota woman who was killed in 2017 when her baby was cut from her womb. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, chaired by North Dakota Republican John Hoeven, earlier this month advanced another version of the bill to the full Senate for consideration.\n\nOhio\n\nPowell: The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium said a polar bear cub was born early Thursday morning to 13-year-old Aurora. The zoo said polar bear newborns have a low survival rate in their early weeks. Employees are monitoring the cub’s care using cameras in a private den area. Officials said the cub has been nursing, and Aurora is attentive. The bears are expected to remain out of public view until the spring. Aurora has three surviving offspring from previous litters. Those bears now live at zoos in Utah, Maryland and Wisconsin. The newest cub was sired by a 20-year-old bear named Lee. He was moved to Columbus from the Denver Zoo a year ago under a species survival plan recommendation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The nation has a high demand for skilled workers, and industry experts and employers in Oklahoma said a worker shortage has made it difficult to find qualified employees, the Oklahoman reported. Over the next 10 years, it’s expected Oklahoma’s economy will have nearly 7,000 annual openings in construction and extraction occupations, according to an Oklahoma Works study. Construction occupations include electricians, plumbers and some maintenance workers. In general, many of those jobs require some sort of training or education beyond high school, but only about 42% of the current workforce qualifies, the study said. Efforts are underway, though, to increase education and promote the good wages and steady employment opportunities found in these blue-collar careers.\n\nOregon\n\nPort Orford: A small earthquake hit Port Orford on the southern Oregon coast, shaking the small community. The U.S. Geological Survey said the 4.5-magnitude earthquake struck at about 5:45 p.m. Friday, with its epicenter about two miles inland. The Oregonian/OregonLive reported that it differs from earthquakes in October that struck far off the coast. No damage was reported from the most recent earthquake.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Municipalities that are paying to clean up water contaminated with toxic industrial compounds from military installations such as Willow Grove Naval Air Station will get more state help. Legislation signed Wednesday by Gov. Tom Wolf allows municipal authorities to get permission to redirect a portion of state tax revenue generated from the reuse of former military installations contaminated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. The money could be used to eliminate surcharges that local ratepayers have been paying. The legislation also directs a state water infrastructure agency, the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority, to create a program to help clean up the chemicals. The state thus far has marshaled more than $20 million in aid to fight contamination in towns near Willow Grove and the former Naval Air Warfare Center.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Student musicians from across the state will again be featured in a series of concerts at the Statehouse to celebrate the holiday season. The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts announced that the concerts begin Monday and will run through Dec. 20. The concerts are free and open to the public. The arts council organizes the series. Executive Director Randall Rosenbaum said more than 2,600 student musicians from 59 schools throughout the state are expected to perform, and the council is pleased to continue the holiday tradition. The series opens with morning performances by high school singers from Cumberland, school bands from North Providence and elementary school guitarists from Providence. The concerts are held on weekdays.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenwood: A second school district in South Carolina wants to change to a year-round calendar. The Greenwood County District 50 School Board approved the calendar change last month to start at the beginning of the 2021-22 school year. The Greenwood Index-Journal reported the calendar greatly shortens the summer break but also includes at least a two-week break every nine weeks. State Education Department spokesman Ryan Brown said McCormick County schools are the only other district in South Carolina operating year-round, but several individual schools have similar calendars. Brown said the agency has heard from several other districts considering the change as they seek community input. Greenwood County District 50 will need approval from the state to make the calendar change.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Police are raising money along with a radio station to buy Christmas gifts for homeless and at-risk children. The Cops ‘N Kids program aims to raise $11,500 to give $100 each to 115 children, and they’re halfway to their goal. Donations currently stand at $5,656. Power 107.1 KSLT is helping. The Rapid City Journal reported the program is run by Black Hills Badges for Hope. The group was formed by two police officers who lost two fellow officers in a 2011 shooting in Rapid City. Last year the Cops ‘N Kids program helped 34 children and the goal this year is to triple the number.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state is projected to have between $345 million and $408 million in new general fund revenue when lawmakers begin setting the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. According to The Times Free Press, the State Funding Board announced last week that the state budget is expected to grow between 2.7% and 3.1% for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, which takes effect July 1. The budget estimate is the lowest the board has set in five years. It’s also below what economic experts had previously suggested. The general fund covers most Tennessee expenditures, including K-12 education funding, state prisons and state trooper pay. This year’s general fund is $34.6 billion and has already seen a $225 million surplus.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Five of the seven people who died in a small plane crash in Kingston, Ontario, were members of a Houston-area family, according to friends of the family. A spokeswoman for the Ontario chief coroner’s office said the victims’ names likely won’t be released for several days. Mehmet Basti, a Toronto college instructor, told local news outlets that five of those killed were his friend Otabek Oblokulov of Missouri City, Texas, his wife and his three children, ages 3, 11 and 15. Basti also said the other two on board were a young couple from Toronto. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said the U.S.-registered, single-engine, six-seat Piper PA-32 airplane crashed about 5 p.m. Wednesday in a wooded area of Kingston, about 90 miles southwest of Ottawa on the Ontario-New York border. The plane had taken off from an airport in Markham, Ontario, a Toronto suburb and was on approach to Kingston’s airport when officials said it took a steep dive into the wooded area. Kingston Police Constable Ash Gutheinz said the area was under a wind advisory at the time, and although winds might not have been as bad as predicted, it was “blustery.” The aircraft did not have a flight data recorder, nor was it required to have one, said lead TSB investigator Ken Webster.\n\nUtah\n\nLehi: A tractor-trailer rig carrying butane was leaking the flammable gas from a tank after overturning on a freeway Saturday, causing evacuations in the area. The Utah Highway Patrol said the double-trailer rig overturned on northbound Interstate 15 in Lehi and that the freeway was closed in both directions as a precaution pending cleanup. Lehi is 26 miles south of Salt Lake City. Assistant City Administrator Cameron Boyle said the area in a quarter-mile around the crash site was evacuated, with residents of an apartment complex relocated to a church building. Information on the cause of the crash wasn’t immediately available. No injuries were reported.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: Workers at a hospital have again reported a mysterious odor, a month after more than a dozen got sick on the job. WCAX-TV reported that seven employees at UVM Medical Center’s Fanny Allen hospital in Colchester were evaluated this week for symptoms similar to those experienced by17 workers in mid-October. Officials said they have taken precautions, and that air quality in the building has tested safe. Surgeries planned for next week have been rescheduled.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: A Confederate statue in Charlottesville that became a rallying point for white nationalists has been vandalized again, this time with graffiti that read, “Impeach Trump.” News outlets reported that the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee was also spray-painted Thursday night with “This is Racist.” Tarps were put over the graffiti and city officials expect a clean-up effort to start Monday. The statue was vandalized earlier this year with an expletive directed at President Donald Trump. White nationalists seized on a city plan to remove the statue and flocked there in 2017 for a rally that turned violent and deadly. The city’s effort to remove the statue has been prevented by a judge amid ongoing litigation. The statue has been vandalized several times previously\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Two small areas of northwest Washington likely will be sprayed with an insecticide to stop an outbreak of gypsy moths, including a type native to Asia never before detected in the U.S. The Capital Press reported the Washington State Department of Agriculture said it tentatively plans to release Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki over a small city on Puget Sound called Woodway, and an Everett neighborhood called Boulevard Bluffs. Officials said a Hokkaido gypsy moth trapped in Woodway this summer was the first Hokkaido moth caught in the U.S. Three hybrid Asian gypsy moths were caught in Boulevard Bluffs. Gypsy moths native to Asia are more mobile than European varieties and are considered more of a danger to spread. Before completing plans to spray next spring, the department will conduct environmental reviews and consult agencies including the USDA. Washington has sprayed for gypsy moths for most years since 1979.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBeckley: Raleigh County’s only animal shelter has launched a fundraising effort to save it from closing at the end of the year. The Register-Herald on Thursday reported the leaders of the nonprofit Humane Society of Raleigh County said they need $80,000 to keep from shutting down. The organization said it’s struggling to pay utilities and outstanding taxes after an increase in animal medical emergencies left it with a $150,000 veterinarian bill. The shelter said it has raised $14,000 so far. They’re hoping for large fundraising hauls at their Santa Paws event at the Plaza Mall on Dec. 7 and during the Beckley Art Center’s Giving Tuesday Open House on Dec. 3. The Humane Society of Raleigh County has been open since 1979. It has taken in about 1,300 abandoned, neglected or stray animals this year. County Commissioner Ron Hedrick told the newspaper he wants to help the shelter find funding. Hedrick has invited the humane society’s board members to a meeting next month to talk about shelter finances and possible fundraising solutions, humane society officials said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nHartford: A woman who began sending care packages to her two sons deployed in the Middle East is now doing the same for hundreds of troops overseas in time for Christmas. Hartford resident Leann Boudwine said the soldiers she sends packages to “are like my kids,” even though she has never met them. After first sending packages to her sons, she sent a few more for the soldiers with whom they served. WITI-TV reported that the list grew into the hundreds when Boudwine collected names of soldiers, airmen, sailors and marines all over the world. The care packages include snacks, soap, and boxed mac-and-cheese. The care packages travel thousands of miles to reach their destination, and Boudwine packs, labels and ships each one. Family, friends, businesses and veterans’ groups have begun to help her. She said her nonprofit “Support the Troops” will have shipped 14,000 packages by early next year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A wild horse facility is looking to make its home in eastern Laramie County, but residents near the proposed site have some major concerns. The facility would hold wild horses captured by the Bureau of Land Management, and the BLM would pay South Dakota-based Equine Elite an amount for each horse it houses. But the project hit a snag when it came to gaining approval from neighbors within a 3-mile radius. Because of concerns ranging from water quality to increased traffic, the neighbors didn’t give their approval for the project. In Laramie County, any Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation needs the consent of property owners within 3 miles of the proposed site. At the request of Equine Elite, the Laramie County Commission is considering lowering the distance to 1 mile. Although the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality only requires approval from property owners within one mile, the county commissioners changed its rules to 3 miles years ago when a swine CAFO attempted to situate in Laramie County.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/03/27/freak-hailstorm-hit-space-coast-latest-unusual-event-brevard-county-residents/3287238002/", "title": "Freak hailstorm that hit Space Coast is latest unusual event for ...", "text": "No, this isn't ancient Egypt.\n\nAnd yet to some observers, the Space Coast seems to have become a magnet for unusual events that, on the surface, might bring to mind Bible stories about the Ten Plagues that devastated the ancient African kingdom.\n\nIn less than six months, Brevard County has seen fish kills caused by red tide; a large meteor that on Feb. 12 trailed across night skies before exploding over the Atlantic; a mysterious, earthquake-like rumble that rattled residents from Cocoa to Merritt Island and then Wednesday, freak hailstorms that pounded homes, yards and roadways with chunks of ice.\n\nStatewide, the Florida-Alabama line in the Panhandle has experienced a cluster of five earthquakes this month.

Netflix promised the season, set \"against the backdrop of Mel and Jack’s romantic spring wedding season,\" would be full of \"fresh twists and turns, escalating love triangles (and a) delightful wedding drama.\"\n\nAnnette O'Toole, who plays Virgin River mayor Hope McRae in the series, told USA TODAY, the season is \"the happiest season certainly, and the shortest (one).\"\n\n\"It was nice to have a core event. The wedding is this the culmination of the whole town's hopes and dreams. We have a lot of problems along the way, but it's a nice, positive, happy season for the most part,\" O'Toole said.\n\nRecapping Season 6\n\nMuch of \"Virgin River's\" latest season was centered around Mel and Jack's much-awaited wedding and the lead up to it. At the same time, the season also delved deeper into Mel's relationship with her long-lost father and her parents' past.\n\nHowever, Mel and Jack's wedding was not the only thing that happened during the season. Doc's medical license has been suspended, and his clinic is under scrutiny by the California State Medical Board after a malpractice case was opened against him. Brie found herself in a love triangle with Mike and Brady after Mike popped the question and Brady told her he would not be able to love anyone like he loved her.\n\nThe season, meanwhile, ended on a major cliffhanger when Jack goes to check up on his ex-girlfriend and local hairstylist Charmaine after she is a no-show on the wedding. Charmaine was being threatened by her baby daddy Calvin and was looking into getting a restraining order against him. At the end of the finale, Jack enters her home to find it ransacked and her and the babies possibly missing.\n\nBased on Robyn Carr's novels of the same name, \"Virgin River\" premiered on Netflix in 2019. It was developed by Sue Tenney, who served as showrunner until Smith took over in Season 5.\n\nWith so much left unanswered, here's what we know so far about Season 7 of \"Virgin River\" including release date, cast and trailer.\n\nWill there be 'Virgin River' Season 7?\n\nYes. Netflix, on Dec. 5, announced \"Virgin River\" has been renewed for Season 7.\n\n“There’s a lot more to go here with these characters,\" showrunner Patrick Sean Smith told Tudum.\n\nSmith added viewers have \"only just begun to see Mel and Jack function as a married couple, which is exciting,” and Season 7 will “explore the honeymoon phase for them as they’re building their lives on the farm, which can come with its own obstacles.”\n\nWhat will happen in 'Virgin River' Season 7?\n\n\"Virgin River\" will pick up from where Season 6 ended, \"like two hours later,\" Smith told Deadline, adding there would be no \"time jump this time.\"\n\nSmith promises Charmaine's babies will be safe and Season 7 will be \"more about characters that are reacting to the circumstances that result from the cliffhanger that are brought back into our story.\"\n\nDespite building up several couples in series, Smith says there are unlikely to be more weddings.\n\n\"We are a little weddinged-out after Season 6, but it felt like, at weddings, sometimes the idea finds its way into couples, so exploring it felt like even more of a way of bringing our supporting characters into the event itself by them evaluating or reevaluating their own individual or couple relationship to marriage,\" Smith told Deadline.\n\nWhile viewers should not expect any weddings, Smith says he \"can guarantee at least one baby in Season 7, potentially two.\" The season finale saw Marley asking Mel to adopt her unborn baby after a local couple who promised to adopt the child backed out.\n\nO'Toole, meanwhile, told USA TODAY she is excited to see where Smith takes the season, especially with her character and Doc's given the clinic's future is now uncertain.\n\n\"I haven't talked to Sean about any of the storylines for next season,\" O'Toole told USA TODAY. \"I know as much as you guys, really.\"\n\nHowever, she added she \"applauds\" the creators for weaving current events into the storylines.\n\n\"I think that's really smart of them,\" O' Toole said. All this health care stuff and big conglomerates coming in and taking over private medical practices, that's happening. So that's something I know Sean wants to pursue. Real life story lines and put it in the world of Virgin River. I applaud that. I'm all for it. I hope that they really explore that (but) I don't know how deeply they'll go into it.\"\n\nSmith told Deadline he is \"curious about seeing a little of the current state of medical healthcare and our realities of it seeping into\" the world of \"Virgin River.\"\n\nJoin our Watch Party!

Seasons 3 and 4 both had summer releases in July 2021 and 2022 respectively. Season 5 came in two parts with the first part releasing at the end of summer in September 2023 and the second part, with two Christmas-themed episodes, dropping in November 2023. While the probability of Season 7 arriving in the summer or winter is equal, Deadline reported the series' early renewal \"would make for a shorter gap between seasons, potentially keeping the romantic drama a holiday fixture after December releases.\"\n\nWill 'Virgin River' Season 7 be its last?\n\nNetflix has not made any indication on whether Season 7 will be the last one. Smith told Deadline he has no \"plans to wrap up the series anytime soon.\"\n\n\"As long as people keep coming back for it, we’re proud and happy to keep telling these stories,\" Smith said.\n\n'Virgin River' Season 7 cast\n\nNetflix has not yet announced details for Season 7 of \"Virgin River,\" but it is likely many of Season 6's cast members will be reprising their characters in Season 7, including:\n\nAlexandra Breckenridge as Mel Monroe\n\nMartin Henderson as Jack Sheridan\n\nTim Matheson as Dr. Vernon Mullins\n\nAnnette O'Toole as Hope McCrea\n\nColin Lawrence as John \"Preacher\" Middleton\n\nJohn Allen Nelson as Everett Reid\n\nBenjamin Hollingsworth as Dan Brady\n\nZibby Allen as Brie Sheridan\n\nMarco Grazzini as Mike Valenzuela\n\nLauren Hammersley as Charmaine Roberts\n\nTeryl Rothery as Muriel St. Claire\n\nKandyse McClure as Kaia\n\nKai Bradbury as Denny Cutler\n\nSarah Dugdale as Lizzie\n\nJenny Cooper as Joey Barnes\n\nElise Gatien as Lark\n\nMark Ghanimé, who played Dr. Cameron Hayek for three seasons, will not be returning for Season 7, the actor revealed on Instagram.\n\nSmith told Deadline, “Cameron will always be part of our world, and I would love to see his character come back again,\" but “he unfortunately won’t be a series regular in Season 7.\"\n\n'Virgin River' spinoff\n\nNot only has \"Virgin River\" been renewed for another season, but the series is also getting a prequel spinoff, according to Variety. The spinoff will focus on the romance between Mel's parents Sarah Jensen (Jessica Rothe) and Everett Reed (Callum Kerr) and the origins of Virgin River in the 1970s, Smith told the media outlet.\n\nSmith told Deadline the spinoff is still in development and that he \"personally sees it a little bit like 'Queen Charlotte' to 'Bridgerton'.\"\n\nIs 'Virgin River' real?\n\nLike Lawrence (Preach) says: \"It's as real as you want it to be.\"\n\nBut alas, the small town of \"Virgin River\" with lush green mountains, babbling brooks and serene trails does not exist outside the world of Netflix, much to our disappointment. While the fictional town is said to be located in Northern California, somewhere between Sacramento and the Oregon border, filming for the series takes place all the way in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and its surrounding mountainous areas, as per Netflix.\n\nO'Toole told USA TODAY the cast and crew have \"worked really hard to make it a seem like a real place.\"\n\n\"I think we've made it real,\" O' Toole said. \"I think it inspires community and goodness in people.\"\n\nLooking for reliable options to stream “Virgin River” on Netflix?

President Cal Bradford (James Marsden) and his team conclude this is Versailles, the disaster they’ve been preparing for. Agent Xavier Collins (Sterling K. Brown) and his children head for the bunker city in Colorado, but his wife, Teri (Enuka Okuma) is stranded in Atlanta where flights have been grounded.\n\nSeries creator Dan Fogelman (“This Is Us”) says “a tremendous amount of research” went into designing the earth-shattering catastrophe. He and his writing staff “spent weeks meeting with experts ‒ everything from architects to sociologists to environmentalists ‒ really gathering a lot of information and creating a scenario that was plausible and terrifying,” yet “out-there enough that … you could engage with the TV series,” he says.\n\nBefore evacuating the White House, Cal records an optimistic message for the country, vowing that “When the dust clears from the tragic day, we will go forward, as Americans, as a beacon of strength in a sometimes dark world.” But he soon decides he can’t stomach the split with reality. He decides to go live from the Oval Office with an honest message about the “imminent worldwide disaster.\n\n“I’m telling you this so that you can make decisions based on where you want to be right now and who you want to be with,” Cal tells his fellow Americans. As Marsden sees it, his character is “very flawed,” but “at the end of the day, when it really matters, he's a man of good character and integrity who's going to try to do the right thing.”\n\nMarsden predicts in that unthinkable situation he would mirror the president’s actions. “The Purgatory, the worst feeling, a personal prison that I could be in is one that's steeped in regret and knowing that you've made a selfish choice at the cost of others,” he says.\n\nFacing his final hours, Marsden says he'd want to be with the loved ones who make up his world.\n\n“The definition of my life is my family, my kids (Jack, 24; Mary, 19; and William, 12) and my friends, and there's not much that matters outside of that,” Marsden says. “Because at the end of it all, that is the most important thing to me and the relationships that you have fostered and been lucky enough to be a part of the memories that you accrue through life. I'd want to be with the people that I did all of that with.”\n\nIn the final minutes of the episode, Xavier comforted Teri in what he worries are her final moments when a missile heads for Atlanta. Little does he know that Cal activated a system to disarm such threats midair. Back in the present day, menacing tech genius Sinatra (Julianne Nicholson) plays Xavier a message from Teri, in which she says she’s looking for her husband and kids. Sinatra orders Xavier to restore Paradise to its former glory if he wants to see his wife and kidnapped daughter again.\n\nLuckily for viewers, Fogelman says next week's finale should resolve any lingering mysteries.\n\n“Now there's one question left, which is 'Who killed the president?' And that gets answered by the end of our season,” Fogelman says. “We wanted this to be a complete meal for people who sat and watched eight episodes of the show where if they had a question at the end of Episode 1, it gets answered by the end of the first season.\n\nFogelman says the series’ second season, that Hulu green-lit Thursday, will send the audience “on a little bit of a new journey.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2024/03/22/dan-schneider-nickelodeon-quiet-on-set-subject/73066216007/", "title": "Who is Dan Schneider and what was he accused of in 'Quiet on Set?'", "text": "Buzz has continued to swirl around several big names in Hollywood since the premiere of the Investigation Discovery docuseries \"Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV\" early this week.\n\nReleased in two parts on Sunday and Monday evening, the tell-all documentary shocked viewers with behind-the-scenes stories of some of Nickelodeon's biggest television shows, revealing the allegedly toxic and abusive environment that was cultivated behind the scenes by adults at the network, including Brian Peck, who served jail time for his sexual abuse of teen star Drake Bell.\n\nShowrunner Dan Schneider was one of the primary focuses of the documentary, as both former child stars and adult coworkers recounted tales of alleged racism, sexism, harassment and verbal abuse at his hands. Described as Nickelodeon's \"golden boy,\" Schnieder was behind some of the most successful live-action shows in the network's history, a level of success that some of his former coworkers say enabled his bad behavior.\n\nWhat allegedly happened behind the scenes of some of Nick's most beloved shows and how was Schneider involved? Here's what we know.\n\nWho is Brian Peck: Ex-Nickelodeon coach convicted of lewd acts with minor back in spotlight\n\nWho is Dan Schneider?\n\nDan Schneider is a television producer, screenwriter and actor best known for his work in children's television.\n\nSchneider and his production company, Schneider's Bakery, are behind some of Nickelodeon's most well-known shows, including \"The Amanda Show,\" \"Drake & Josh,\" \"Zoe 101,\" \"iCarly,\" and others.\n\nSchneider dabbled in acting early in his career, landing a few small roles and a recurring spot on the 1980s sitcom \"Head of the Class\" as Dennis Blunden.\n\nHe began working as a writer and producer for Nickelodeon in the 1990s and continued to work with the network until the two parted ways in 2018.\n\nWhat was Dan Schneider accused of?\n\nAlleged gender discrimination\n\nSchneider was one of the most common subjects of discussion in the documentary, which was inspired by an investigative report by Kate Taylor.\n\nSchneider was accused of engaging in unprofessional and inappropriate behaviors in the workplace, one of the most common of which included frequently asking female employees to massage his neck while on set.\n\n\"The Amanda Show\" writers Jenny Kilgen and Christy Stratton accused Schneider of blatant displays of discriminatory behavior, saying he made them share a salary as the only two women in the writing room and often made inappropriate comments and demands of them. They eventually went on to sue the network for gender-based discrimination.\n\nRacism allegations\n\nTwo former actors on \"All That,\" Bryan Hearne and Giovonnie Samuels, said they experienced racism on set, alleging they were cast in stereotyped roles and treated poorly by the showrunner.\n\n\"Someone said the skin tone should be charcoal. I started to get teary-eyed,\" Hearne recalls in the docuseries while discussing costuming for a skit in which he was assigned to play a rapper named \"Lil' Fetus.\" At another point, his mother pointed out the implications of her son, the only Black male on the cast of the show at the time, being cast to play a character that behaved like a drug dealer.\n\nSchneider's shows of the era frequently featured only one or two Black cast members. In the documentary, he and other writers were accused of tokenizing those characters on his shows.\n\nAlleged inappropriate behavior\n\nAdults who worked behind the scenes at the time, including Kilgen and Stratton, said in the doc that Schnieder had a propensity for incorporating too-adult humor into his kids shows. They said Schneider acknowledged at multiple points that he found incorporating innuendo into his children's programming to be funny.\n\nIt was alleged he pushed for short skirts, bikinis and costuming that some actors found to be not age-appropriate. Scenes ranging from pickles being slid through holes in the wall to Jamie Lynn Spears having a gooey substance shot on her face were shown and subject to scrutiny.\n\nSchneider denies the claims\n\nSchneider denied these claims. In a statement, his spokesperson argued: \"Remember, all stories, dialogue, costumes, and makeup were fully approved by network executives on two coasts. A standards and practices group read and ultimately approved every script, and programming executives reviewed and approved all episodes. In addition, every day on every set, there were always parents and caregivers and their friends watching filming and rehearsals.”\n\nSchneider was also accused of verbal and emotional abuse in the form of screaming, yelling, threats, insults and other \"toxic\" behaviors. He has not been accused of any form of physical abuse, sexual or otherwise.\n\nWhat shows did Dan Schneider work on?\n\nSchneider worked in the entertainment industry from the '80s until 2018, wracking up a long list of credits along the way. However, he is best known for his work in family and children's television, especially with Nickelodeon.\n\nSome of his most popular shows include:\n\n\"Good Burger\"\n\n\"Kenan & Kel\"\n\n\"All That\"\n\n\"The Amanda Show\"\n\n\"What I Like About You\"\n\n\"iCarly\"\n\n\"Drake & Josh\"\n\n\"Zoey 101\"\n\n\"Victorious\"\n\n\"Sam & Cat\"\n\n\"Henry Danger\"\n\n\"Game Shakers\"\n\nWhat has Dan Schneider said about 'Quiet on Set?'\n\nSchneider responds: Dan Schneider addresses allegations of a toxic workplace on his Nickelodeon TV shows\n\nIn a statement previously given to USA TODAY, a representative for Schneider said, in part:\n\n\"Everything that happened on the shows Dan ran was carefully scrutinized by dozens of involved adults, and approved by the network. Had there been any scenes or outfits that were inappropriate in any way, they would have been flagged and blocked by this multilayered scrutiny.\"\n\nAnother part of the statement read, \"In a career spanning 30+ years, Dan worked with thousands of people, many of whom still tell him how much they enjoyed and appreciated working on his shows. But he also knows some people did not have a positive experience, and he is truly sorry for that. Dan knows he should have done better and feels awful about anyone who saw him at his worst, instead of his best.\"\n\nSchneider also posted a video response to his YouTube channel on Tuesday following the release of \"Quiet on Set.\" In it, he speaks to BooG!e, the actor who played T-Bo on iCarly.\n\n\"The main thing that I would change is how I treat people and everyone. I definitely at times didn’t give people the best of me. I didn’t show enough patience. I could be cocky and definitely overambitious and sometimes just straight-up rude and obnoxious, and I am so sorry that I ever was,\" Schneider said.\n\nHow to watch 'Quiet on Set'\n\n\"Quiet On Set: The Dark Side Of Kids TV\" premiered on Investigation Discovery (ID) on Sunday, March 17 at 9 p.m. ET. The four-episode series aired in two parts, the second of which was released the following day on Monday, March 18, also at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nThe ID channel is available through some cable subscriptions and via live TV streaming services including Fubo, DirecTV, Philo and Sling.\n\nIt will also be available to stream after its release on Max, Prime Video, Apple TV, and The Roku Channel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/11/22/christmas-in-the-spotlight-taylor-swift-lifetime-movie/76502386007/", "title": "'Christmas in the Spotlight' Lifetime movie inspired by Taylor Swift", "text": "Bryan West\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK\n\nLast year, Eirene Tran Donohue watched Taylor Swift at Arrowhead Stadium cheering on Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce and thought, \"This could be a rom-com.\"\n\n\"I've done a bunch of Lifetime Christmas movies,\" Donohue says.\n\nThe writer was texting her friend and Lifetime movie executive Tia Maggini about the potential of a movie about a ubiquitous singer falling in love with a grounded professional football player.\n\n\"(Maggini) said, 'Do you want to do it?'

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThis happens once every few Lifetime movies\n\nAlthough the Kelce and Swift love story played out on NFL broadcasts, grainy Eras Tour livestreams and sporadic paparazzi photos, the Lifetime film is merely inspired by them.\n\nThere are key differences between the main characters of Bowyn Sykes, a global pop star on the verge of releasing her highly anticipated Christmas album, and Drew \"Gonzo\" Gonville, a wide receiver for the Bay Spring Bombers.\n\nFor starters, the pop star's father is deceased, and her mother is not in the picture. The brother of the football player is on the same professional team. And the lovebirds cross paths at a meet-and-greet after Sykes' show. (Kelce famously put Swift on blast on his \"New Heights\" podcast after her team wouldn't let him meet her at a Kansas City show.)\n\nBut it's easy to see why Donohue is in Spotify's top 0.1% of Taylor Swift fans. The script includes innumerable Easter eggs. Gonzo's football jersey is No. 13. There are quips like, \"Let the games begin,\" \"I'm sorry Uncle Gonzo can't come to the phone right now … he's dead,\" and, \"Why they have to be so mean?\"\n\nWhen news broke of the movie project, Reddit lit up with comments ranging from the lighthearted to the defensive.\n\n@luvlyyung wrote, \"I mean i love their story so far and i love these type of movies so yeah i think i will give it a try.\"\n\n@spirited-acadia4769 said, \"I find this to be extremely weird and invasive but also i realise its just a movie and idk im the weird one.

I think that Swifties will enjoy it and understand that it was made with love and that it is not an attack on her and it's not trying to be exploitative.\"\n\nThere are many nods that will fly over the average non-Swiftie's head, but ardent followers will appreciate one-liners like \"you are the best thing at this party\" and \"you look like you’re having the time of your life\" as well as the names of the opinionated sportscasters, Chad Marcus and Aimee Hannah.\n\nDonohue hopes Swift and Kelce like it.\n\n\"I hope they think it's fun and funny and understand that it's coming from a place of love and celebration,\" she says. \"There is also a deep Kelce Easter egg that most might not catch.

He says he heard through mutual sports contacts that Kelce is aware of the movie and planning to see it.\n\n\"Apparently he's going to have a watch party and watch it, so that's cool,\" Wallschleger says. \"You heard it here first.\"\n\nHis onscreen chemistry with Lord is undeniable, and at times the two characters face difficult conversations that may have come up in the Swift and Kelce relationship: dilemmas like the superstar wanting to privately date before going public, the legitimacy of their relationship being questioned as a PR stunt and how the two find normalcy amidst perpetual public scrutiny.\n\n\"We did a table read on Zoom, and after that we had an hour phone call going over how we feel about everything and getting to know each other,\" Lord says. \"Right off the bat, we connected, and I think that really set the tone throughout the entire shoot for us to have this really high level of respect of each other.\"\n\nLord and Wallschleger met in-person during the two weeks of shooting in Toronto — which is coincidentally where Swift will play her final show at Rogers Centre on Saturday.\n\nWallschleger is still crossing his fingers for a last-minute invite to the Kelce screening, \"My schedule is wide open.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he and Lord are encouraging fans to check it out. \"I just hope it makes someone laugh,\" Wallschleger says. \"There's so much negativity and hatred in the world.\"\n\n\"I think it's an easygoing, heartwarming holiday movie,\" Lord adds. \"I do think there's some nice inspiration in there to just really persevere and fight for what you want, especially when it comes to love and family and your dreams.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/22"}]}

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/12/09/first-right-whale-calf-of-the-season-is-born-offering-new-glimmer-of-hope/69714637007/", "title": "'It's become an event': Season's first right whale calf is born, bringing ...", "text": "Just in time for the holidays, a special gift has arrived for the North Atlantic Right Whale community: a newborn calf.\n\nThe whale population's version of \"baby new year\" was recently born to Medusa, a North Atlantic Right Whale who frequents the waters of Massachusetts and Cape Cod bays in winter and spring before summering in the Gulf of Maine.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/21/arthur-ashe-missing-marilyn-pacifier-eating-pup-news-around-states/39609687/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: A man wanted on drug and weapons charges has posted a video denying he fed methamphetamine to a so-called attack squirrel that he considers a pet. Mickey Paulk posted the video on his Facebook page Tuesday night as authorities continued searching for him. It shows him stroking a rodent that he indicates was the same one seized during a search and then released by authorities. “You can’t give squirrels meth; it would kill ’em. I’m pretty sure, (but) I’ve never tried it,” he said. Paulk said the squirrel was safe and not a threat to anyone. “The public isn’t in danger in any kind of way from the methed-out squirrel in the neighborhood,” he said with a laugh. He also said Wednesday that he was working with an attorney and relatives on a plan for turning himself in to authorities. Paulk said he had “a few loose ends to tie up,” including getting the squirrel to a temporary home in Tennessee.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Federal marine biologists for the first time have recorded singing by one of the rarest whales on the planet, the North Pacific right whale. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researchers used moored acoustic recorders to capture repeated patterns of calls made by male North Pacific right whales. It’s the first time right whale songs in any population have been documented, NOAA Fisheries marine biologist Jessica Crance says. She spoke to southern right whale and North Atlantic right whale experts to confirm that singing had not previously been documented. Researchers detected four distinct songs over eight years at five locations in the Bering Sea off Alaska’s southwest coast, Crance says. Only about 30 of the animals remain. Whalers nearly wiped out the slow-moving whales, which remain buoyant after they are killed.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State test scores are improving, but only by a few percentage points. Early AzMERIT standardized test results show small increases in the percentage of students passing the test in most grade levels in reading and math. But the scores still show more than half the students in most categories, including in third-grade reading, aren’t passing the test. Arizona’s education leaders introduced AzMERIT, an attempt at a reinvigorated state standardized test, in 2015. Schools have a lot riding on test scores. School letter grades are largely decided by test scores, and high-achieving schools get extra funding under the results-based funding program. This is also the first year high schools were able to opt out of the AzMERIT test and choose a different assessment over AzMERIT, such as the ACT and SAT exams.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: Hickory Park will get a splash of color this weekend thanks to Care Center Ministries of Mountain Home. Volunteers with the ministry will meet at 9:30 a.m. Saturday at the downtown park to paint the pavilion, park benches, some of the playground equipment and sidewalks. Anyone is welcome to come lend a hand Saturday morning, pastor Ty Cotter said. “We’ll have extra gloves, glasses and paint. They just need to show up,” he said. On June 1, Care Center Ministries representatives and civic leaders gathered at Hickory Park for a ceremony where the nonprofit “adopted” the care and upkeep of the facility. Saturday’s event will be the official kickoff of Care Center Ministry’s park stewardship, but volunteers have already been inside the park performing some landscaping work.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Officials say someone climbed a more than two-story-tall Hollywood public art piece and stole a statue of Marilyn Monroe. The statue depicting Monroe in her iconic pose from the 1955 film “The Seven Year Itch” went missing early Monday from the “Four Ladies of Hollywood” gazebo. Los Angeles Councilman Mitch O’Farrell says a witness saw someone climb the gazebo on the Hollywood Walk Fame and saw off the statue. Los Angeles police say investigators have recovered fingerprints from the gazebo. The gazebo, erected in 1994, pays tribute to women in film, with depictions of Dolores Del Rio, Dorothy Dandridge, Mae West and Anna May Wong making up the structure’s pillars. Monroe, whose real name was Norma Jeane Mortenson, died in 1962.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A report indicates the Mile High City had the highest increase in the nation in its violent crime rate last year, but crime remains low compared with the most violent large U.S. cities. The Denver Post reports the city recorded 629 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, resulting in a 9% increase between 2017 and 2018. The report by the Brennan Center for Justice shows the rates of homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults in the 25 most populous U.S. cities dropped 4% on average last year. Denver Police Deputy Chief Barb Archer says the department didn’t find a specific cause driving the violence. The department says all categories of crime have declined or stayed level for first five months of 2019.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed legislation that increases the minimum age to purchase cigarettes and other tobacco products to 21. The bill signed into law Tuesday by the Democrat also prohibits the sale of electronic cigarettes and vaping products to anyone under 21. The new law takes effect Oct. 1. Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, says such “Tobacco 21” laws are “more important than ever” given the increase in youth e-cigarette use. He says adolescents and young adults are uniquely vulnerable to the effects of nicotine and nicotine addiction, making Connecticut’s legislation “an important, life-saving measure.” The law also bans smoking on the grounds of child care centers and schools. Critics say it violates the rights of adults ages 18 to 21.\n\nDelaware\n\nBethany Beach: As thousands of people flock to Dover for Firefly Music Festival, one of the world’s rarest fireflies is battling for survival at beaches in the state. The Bethany Beach firefly, a rare species found in only seven unique habitats along Delaware’s southern coast, lost one this year to new residential construction, according to a local scientist who has studied the species. At that new development, beach houses are being built on million-dollar lots in a wetland that had been identified as home to the state’s most dense population of the fireflies. “Imagine if you start losing the species, but you still have a Firefly Festival. That connection is lost,” said Tara Cornelisse, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “I look to it as a beacon of hope, if we can protect it.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: District of Columbia lawmakers voted to add $47 million in excess reserves from the Washington Convention and Sports Authority to the city’s fiscal 2020 budget. The Washington Post reports $24 million will go toward fixing the city’s dilapidated public housing complexes. The rest will upgrade 911 dispatch centers. Tuesday’s approval came after a weeks­long dispute over whether the funds could be redirected from the reserve. The District’s chief financial officer, Jeffrey S. DeWitt, argued that using the funds would violate obligations to bondholders who invested in the convention center. He threatened not to certify the budget if the council redirected the money. However, a spokesman for DeWitt said the issue had been resolved Monday evening. Advocates said the money would cover renovating at least 400 units.\n\nFlorida\n\nHolmes Beach: Police trying to find the rightful owner of a prosthetic ear that washed up on their beach got a happy phone call from South Carolina on Thursday. Holmes Beach Police Sgt. Brian Hall said a woman called saying the rubber ear that police posted on Facebook belongs to her husband. Hall said the Beaufort couple was vacationing in the Tampa Bay area when the man went swimming. She said he was trying to put the ear in his pocket for safekeeping when “a wave knocked it off his hand.” The police department posted a photo of the left ear, saying a local resident found it in the sand Saturday after the “World’s Strongest Man” contest on Anna Maria Island. Prosthetic ears can cost thousands of dollars. Hall said the department will mail it to South Carolina. “We will put it in box. I hope nobody sees it and freaks out,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is shifting its presidential primary to late March, leaving the group of states that vote on Super Tuesday. The primary has been set for March 24, three weeks after Super Tuesday is held March 3, which Georgia has joined in past election cycles. The date announced Wednesday by Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger could relegate the state’s voters to a less influential position in deciding each party’s nominee. But it will also give state and county election officials a bit of breathing room in a tight timeline to replace the state’s outdated touchscreen voting machines. New touchscreen machines are in the process of being acquired, and a vendor has yet to be selected.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. Navy will christen a new guided missile destroyer, the USS Daniel Inouye, during a ceremony this weekend. U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii will speak at Saturday’s ceremony in Bath, Maine. Inouye’s widow, Irene Hirano Inouye, will be the ship’s sponsor. The Arleigh Burke-class ship is being named after the war hero and politician who broke racial barriers in Congress. Inouye represented Hawaii in the U.S. Senate for a half-century until his death in 2012. He played key roles in congressional investigations of the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals and served as chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. He received the Medal of Honor for bravery in World War II with the mostly Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team. He lost his right arm.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: The University of Idaho has ordered a student who owns a beverage company to stop using the name “Vandal Beer.” The Moscow-Pullman Daily News reports university officials sent the letter, citing trademark infringement, to Vandal Beer owner R. Austin Nielsen earlier this week. The school’s mascot is the Vandals. Nielsen announced plans last week for his company to start producing the gold pale ale in Coeur d’Alene next month, with plans to release it in north-central Idaho retail stores in August. Nielsen said he pitched the Vandal Beer idea to the University of Idaho a while ago, but school officials told him he wasn’t allowed to use the Vandal name. He said he came up with the idea while he was a student in the university’s Idaho Entrepreneurs program. Nielsen has said he will donate a portion of all Vandal Beer sales to University of Idaho scholarships.\n\nIllinois\n\nWauconda: A Civil War reenactment at a northeastern Illinois forest preserve is back on after the event was temporarily canceled by a county official over questions of its value, as well as the use of the Confederate flag. The (Waukegan) News-Sun reports Lake County Forest Preserves District President Angelo Kyle announced Wednesday that Civil War Days will still be held July 13-14 at Lakewood Forest Preserve in Wauconda. Kyle noted contractual obligations for the event that’s been held for 27 years and can draw up to 3,000 people. The announcement comes two days after Kyle canceled the event over concerns about the reenactment not telling the victims’ perspective and featuring many Confederate flags. Wayne Carle, who helps plan the event, says the reenactors put on the show to keep history alive.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University is planning several events commemorating the upcoming 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing commanded by school alumnus Neil Armstrong. The university says events begin July 18 with a presentation on the landing by Apollo 11 flight director Gene Kranz, followed by a July 20 screening of “Armstrong,” a new documentary film featuring home videos shot by Armstrong and unseen footage from NASA. Purdue will host a special exhibition of items from its Armstrong archives July 19-20. Other July 20 events include children’s activities on the Purdue Mall and a lunar module landing celebration timed around the 4:17 p.m. touchdown ahead of Armstrong becoming the first person to walk on the moon. Armstrong, a 1955 Purdue graduate, died in 2012 at age 82.\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City: A company that’s been fined thousands of dollars for the stink coming from its plant has lost its lawsuit targeting the city’s odor ordinance. The Sioux City Journal reports Judge Leonard Strand of the U.S. District Court in Sioux City granted the city of Sibley’s motion for a summary judgment. Strand disagreed with Iowa Drying & Processing’s contention that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. Iowa Drying & Processing had said the city’s enforcement unfairly targeted the company and interfered with its efforts to sell the plant, which had drawn residents’ complaints for years. One resident, Josh Harms, sued Sibley after city officials threatened legal action against him for saying on a website that Sibley smelled like “rancid dog food.” Strand ruled against the city in Harms’ case.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Hutchinson Zoo director Ryan VanZant says last month’s flooding covered more than one-third of the zoo. The Hutchinson News reports the zoo – except for the gift shop and train – has been closed since May 21 after consecutive storms caused water to rise at the zoo. VanZant said in a Facebook post Wednesday that five buildings and two playgrounds were affected by flood waters. He said staff moved animals to safety ahead of the rising water and built temporary housing where the animals are being kept while waiting for the water to recede and the cleanup to begin. A Facebook fundraiser has been started to help cleanup costs. The Hutchinson Friends of the Zoo says the goal is to raise $10,000 before Family Fun Day on Aug. 17.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A state agency says it has secured another $5 million federal grant to continue a program providing youth-support services. Kentucky’s Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities says the latest grant will continue the program through March 2024. The Transition Age Youth Launching Realized Dreams program allows youth ages 16 to 25 to easily access quality, developmentally appropriate, youth-driven support services. Officials say the goal is to help participants achieve their goals and transition into adulthood successfully. Officials say available services include expedited assistance in locating housing, mental health services and substance-abuse treatment. Since 2014, the program has helped more than 1,900 youth. Officials say youth and young adults can visit one of Kentucky’s 20 drop-in sites to access behavioral health services.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Billions of mosquito lookalikes are showing up in the area, blanketing car windshields, littering the ground with little bodies and even scaring some folks. They’re aquatic midges, often called “blind mosquitoes.” They don’t bite, and they’re good for the environment, but they’re a nuisance. Entomologist Nick Delisi of the St. Tammany Mosquito Abatement District says that “they tend to emerge in the billions.” Sloshing down bug-spattered windshields has become such a chore that the manager of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway says Motorist Assistance Patrol trucks on the 24-mile-long bridge have had to replenish their water almost daily. Mosquito control officials say they don’t plan to do anything to control the swarms because they die in less than a week and their larvae clean up waterways.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Legislature sent a proposal to the governor Wednesday to ditch the state’s presidential caucuses for a primary system that would be the nation’s first to allow voters to rank candidates. The Democratic-led Senate approved funding the bill, which had already passed the House. It now heads to Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who hasn’t taken a position. As the 2020 presidential primary season nears, Maine is among an increasingly small handful of states that still have caucuses, including Iowa, Nevada and Wyoming. If primaries are approved, Maine voters will use ranked-choice voting to indicate which candidates they want delegates to support. That could get hairy in the Democratic primary, where more than 20 people are running.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A memorial dedication, gun violence forum and moment of silence are among the events scheduled for the one-year anniversary of the attack on The Capital Gazette newspaper that killed five employees. Police say a man with a history of harassing people at the paper shot and killed the journalists June 28, 2018, in its Annapolis newsroom. The Capital Gazette reports the attack will be formally remembered next week with a concert, the unveiling of a memorial garden, a forum on gun violence and a moment of silence. The events also coincide with Maryland’s first statewide observance of Freedom of the Press Day. At 2:33 p.m. June 28 – the time the gunman entered the newsroom – Tribune properties across the country will take a moment of silence for the victims.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A veterinary hospital got quite a surprise recently when a family brought in their bulldog after he stopped eating. The Angell Animal Medical Center found 19 baby pacifiers in the dog’s stomach. It started in April when the Wellesley family noticed that their 3-year-old dog, Mortimer, started getting nauseated before meals. His owner, Emily Shanahan, brought Mortimer to the vet, who prescribed medicine to take care of the issue. But it didn’t help, and Mortimer eventually stopped eating entirely. Shanahan went to Angell, where they took an X-ray and discovered the pacifiers. Vets think Mortimer had been taking the pacifiers from Shanahan’s two children over the course of months. The pacifiers were removed without surgery, and Mortimer has fully recovered and is back at home.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has ordered state agencies to step up efforts to reduce phosphorus pollution and otherwise improve water quality in Lake Erie. Whitmer signed an executive directive Thursday instructing three state departments to support the initiative. The departments of Agriculture and Rural Development; Environment, Great Lakes and Energy; and Natural Resources will submit annual progress reports. Michigan adopted guidelines last year for making Lake Erie healthier, including cutting phosphorus loading into its western basin 40% by 2025. Whitmer’s directive puts a focus on lessening nutrient inflows from the Detroit River, the River Raisin and the Maumee River.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Peter: An invasion of gnats is presenting a risk to the health and lives of livestock in this southern Minnesota town. The Mankato Free Press reports that gnats cause weight loss and stress for any animal with their bites and by gathering around eyes and in airways. Brooke Knisley, who runs an organic produce farm with her husband in St. Peter, says one of her friends has lost 16 chickens to the gnats this year. Knisley says she’s trying to reduce the risk for her own flock by running fans in the chicken coop, hanging fly strips and placing vanilla-soaked rags near where the gnats congregate. Gnats are also an irritant for cattle and horses, and many owners are keeping their animals inside until the invasion passes.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Persistent flooding across wildlife management areas has decimated some wildlife habitats and food supplies, leading the state to allow supplemental deer feeding in Issaquena and Warren counties. The executive director of the state Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks says the deer stuck on a flooded levee have depleted their resources. Russ Walsh says the stressed deer are in bad shape. Resident Melissa Lyons raises two cattle on the levee and says that “the only things thriving are the buzzards.” She says the deer are starved and weak, and her husband recently removed 20 dead deer from their hay field. Supplemental feeding requires a wildlife agency permit that expires this fall.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: McDonald’s has started a trans-Atlantic barbecue feud with the introduction of a Kansas City-themed hamburger in the U.K. Outgoing Mayor Sly James said Tuesday that the fast-food chain should “stay in your lane” in a tweet that included a picture of what he says a “real” burger looks like. Kansas City is known for its style of dry-rubbed, slow-cooked meats drizzled in tomato-molasses sauce. Other Twitter users rushed to join the mocking after McDonald’s proclaimed “Yeehaw” as it promoted its “Kansas City Stack” on social media. Barbecue powerhouse Q39 kidded “Yeehaw, mate!” while Joe’s Kansas City Bar-B-Que retweeted a scathing critique of the burger along with a slew of various laughing emojis. McDonald’s says the bacon-topped burger is available until June 25, but not in America.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: AT&T has started dropping cellphone customers in the state’s northeast, citing customers’ regular data use outside its service area. The Billings Gazette reports the company began notifying customers earlier this year that they would lose their mobile coverage. AT&T spokeswoman Suzanne Trantow says the company can no longer be the primary provider for a “small number of customers who live or have a billing address outside our owned network coverage area.” She declined to give the specific area or the number of customers dropped. Verizon dropped the rural Montana customers in 2017, citing the costs of customers using data while roaming off its network. Scobey-based Nemont Telephone Cooperative has become the only provider for some parts of the region, but T-Mobile has been expanding operations.\n\nNebraska\n\nMcCook: Family Fun Nights have been scheduled for the summer at Red Willow State Recreation Area. The state Game and Parks Commission says a typical Family Fun Night begins at 6 p.m. with a meal provided by the park. Events start at 7 p.m. and include kayaking, fishing and archery. All equipment is provided. Just before dark, everyone heads back to the campfire to finish off the evening with s’mores. Family Fun Nights are scheduled for June 26, July 5 and 19, and Aug. 2. The park sits about 11 miles north of McCook, just west of U.S. Highway 83. A park entry permit is required. Go online at Calendar.outdoornebraska.gov for more information.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: City officials have activated a program that lets people settle fines for parking tickets with donations of school supplies. The Las Vegas City Council approved the program in 2016 and voted Wednesday to activate it for a month. Anyone who is issued a fine between June 19 and July 19 can clear it by taking new, unwrapped school supplies to the city’s parking services offices on Main Street. The donation has to be made within 30 days of receiving a parking ticket. The supplies must be of value equal to or greater than the fine. A receipt also is required. The supplies will be given to the Teacher Exchange, which serves about 390 schools in southern Nevada. It’s part of the Public Education Foundation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A committee of lawmakers has reached a compromise on changes to the state’s new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The rules, which are just starting to take effect, require most recipients to spend at least 100 hours a month working, going to school or participating in community service. The House and Senate passed different versions of a bill to broaden the allowed exemptions and end the work requirements entirely if 500 people lost coverage. A committee reached a compromise Thursday to suspend, but not eliminate, coverage for noncompliance. The state would have until July 2021 to waive the requirements in several scenarios, including if the state is unable to contact all participants to explain the rules. The full Legislature will vote on the amended bill next week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy has signed legislation requiring ride-hailing services to show additional identification after the March death of a University of South Carolina student who police say got into the car of an Uber impersonator. Among the new requirements is that ride-hailing services must issue two identifying markers to each driver. They must be displayed on the front windshield and rear window. Murphy, a Democrat, signed the legislation Thursday in Robbinsville, the hometown of Samantha “Sami” Josephson. The act is known as Sami’s Law. Police say Josephson got into the car of an Uber driver impersonator in Columbia, South Carolina. She was killed and her body dumped in the woods 65 miles away. A man has been charged with kidnapping and murder in the case.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLovington: Lea County has approved more than $5 million in upgrades to an airport in the heart of the state’s booming oil region. The Hobbs News-Sun reports the county commission gave the green light last week to improvements to the Lea County Regional Airport – most funded by federal and state grants. The improvements call for doubling the expansion of the holding area for flight patrons and renovating the apron area on the airside of the terminal. They also including upgrading a runway safety area and extending the primary runway. Officials say increased ridership is spurring the recommended improvements. The Lea County Regional Airport is located in Hobbs – a key city in the booming Permian Basin.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Artist Kehinde Wiley will unveil his first monumental public sculpture in Times Square this fall in response to Confederate statues nationwide. Times Square Arts, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and gallery owner Sean Kelly announced Thursday that the bronze “Rumors of War” sculpture features a young black man dressed in urban streetwear mounted atop a horse. The project originated when Wiley saw Confederate Gen. J.E.B. Stuart’s monument in Richmond, Virginia. Wiley is known for his paintings of black Americans and his commissioned portrait of President Barack Obama, displayed at the National Portrait Gallery. He says the new statue’s inspiration is war and “an engagement with violence.” “Rumors of War” will display in Times Square from Sept. 27 to December before finding a permanent home at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOak Island: Advocates for sea turtles say a hefty fine is in store for whoever dug into a nest of loggerhead sea turtle eggs. The Oak Island Sea Turtle Protection Program says the nest was tampered with Monday. Sand was displaced from the covered hole, and it was burrowed into. The News & Observer reports none of the eggs were broken or harmed. But the group wants beachgoers to know that disturbing sea turtle nests carries a federal fine up to $50,000 and possible prison time. Last week, a woman was arrested in Miami after police said she stomped on sea turtle nests and poked them with a stake. Loggerhead turtles are protected under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s female prison population has reached capacity, leaving some inmates in the custody of counties. The Bismarck Tribune reports that the state’s female prison population reached capacity for the first time in May. Under 2017 legislation, county inmates are transferred to state prisons based on the severity of crimes, medical needs and other factors. Last week, only six of 12 inmates intended for movement from county to state were admitted. The statewide system for women has a daily average capacity of 224 inmates. Donnell Preskey, who represents the North Dakota Association of Counties, says a mechanism must be established to reimburse counties for the cost of holding inmates who should be in state facilities.\n\nOhio\n\nBrecksville: A national park that protects about a quarter of the Cuyahoga River is preparing to celebrate the river’s health 50 years after it infamously caught fire. A ceremonial torch traveling the length of the 85-mile-long river will make a stop in Cuyahoga Valley National Park on Friday afternoon on its way to Cleveland. The public event comes one day before the 50th anniversary of the June 22, 1969, fire. It will feature the passing of the Xtinguish Torch Fest torch along with music, poetry and the unveiling of a new sculpture. Speakers, including a regional director of the National Park Service, will outline efforts to restore the river from its abysmal earlier condition to a vibrant place for wildlife and outdoor recreation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney has announced plans to expand its operations at Tinker Air Force Base. Pratt & Whitney Vice President Kevin Kirkpatrick, Gov. Kevin Stitt and Mayor David Holt announced what is called a “multimillion-dollar investment” to expand its military aftermarket services at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex based at Tinker. The project is also expected to add more than 100 jobs. Pratt & Whitney is a division of Farmington, Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp. and performs engine services and maintenance for the Air Force at Tinker.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown deployed the state police Thursday to try to round up Republican lawmakers who fled the Capitol in an attempt to block a vote on a landmark climate plan that would be the second of its kind in the nation. Minority Republicans want the cap-and-trade proposal aimed at dramatically lowering the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to be sent to the voters for approval instead of instituted by lawmakers. Negotiations with Democrats fell apart late Wednesday, prompting conservatives to pursue a walkout, said Kate Gillem, a spokeswoman for Senate Republicans. Some members have even left the state to avoid a vote, Gillem said. State police don’t have jurisdiction beyond state lines. Democrats have an 18-to-12 majority in the chamber but need 20 members present for a quorum.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A mural by the artist who painted the official portrait of Michelle Obama is being dedicated in the city. Amy Sherald’s overall body of work represents everyday lives of black Americans. So it’s fitting that the 6-story-tall mural dedicated Thursday portrays Najee Spencer-Young, a 19-year-old participant in Philadelphia’s Mural Arts education program. Sherald tells the Philadelphia Inquirer she chose Spencer-Young during a class trip to her studio. The artist saw it as an opportunity to boost the self-esteem of the teenager and those who look like her. The mural depicts Spencer-Young in a black-and-white flower print trench coach and mustard yellow hat, looking confident and composed – and very imposing – against a bright blue background.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo signed a bill Wednesday to preserve federal abortion protections in state law. The Senate passed the bill and immediately transmitted it to the House, which resumed its session to pass it. Raimondo signed it in her office, calling it an “important, consequential bill.” “Fundamentally this bill is about health care,” she said. Rhode Island is one of the Democratic-led states taking steps to enshrine the right to an abortion should the U.S. Supreme Court ever overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Raimondo said she wanted to sign quickly, in light of the uncertainty across the nation. The new law says the state will not restrict the right to an abortion prior to fetal viability or afterward if an abortion is necessary for the health or life of the mother.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A zoo plans to send off two African elephants in order to bring in Southern white rhinos. Riverbanks Zoo and Garden of Columbia announced Wednesday that 48-year-old Robin and 37-year-old Belle will soon join a larger herd. The zoo says the public can attend special activities before the elephants leave. The destination for the elephants hasn’t been determined. Zoo officials say 13 elephants have lived at Riverbanks since 1973. The zoo says there is a chance elephants will return in the future. Director of Animal Care and Welfare John Davis says the zoo hopes to add more space and manage a breeding group one day. Southern white rhinos haven’t lived at the zoo since 1989. The new exhibit is scheduled to open next year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Sioux Falls Freemasons and Architecture Inc. opened a time capsule Wednesday afternoon, revealing multiple artifacts the Masons had placed downtown nearly a hundred years ago. Lisa VandeVoort, business manager at Architecture Inc., said the time capsule – placed on June 6, 1924 – was opened as renovations were being done to the building. The Masons never specified a date to open the capsule, VandeVoort said, “so doing it during renovations made sense.” Dozens of items were removed from a box set in the building’s cornerstone, including a Masonic Bible, several editions of the Argus Leader and a typewritten copy of the address read during the time capsule ceremony 95 years ago. The capsule also included a sealed envelope with stamps from the time, as well as a handbook for new owners of telephones.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The three new eagles at Radnor Lake State Park’s Barbara J. Mapp Aviary Education Center are finally ready to meet the public. After months of park staff working to acclimate the eagles to their new environment, Radnor hosted a free open house Thursday, for American Eagle Day, for bird lovers to get at least a glimpse of the majestic creatures. “One of the long-term goals has been to have captive bald eagles (that could not be released back into the wild due to their injuries) in the aviary where visitors could interact with them,” Radnor Park manager Steve Ward said. The two bald eagles are housed in the park’s new $110,000 flighted aviary, a 38-foot-tall netted enclosure that gives the birds freedom of movement and protects them from other predatory wildlife within the natural area. The golden eagle has its own enclosure.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A federal law enforcement official says the FBI received a call three years ago about the 22-year-old man who opened fire on a courthouse downtown. Brian Isaack Clyde was shot and killed Monday by security officers at the Earle Cabell Federal Building. There were no other serious injuries or deaths in the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says a member of Clyde’s family called a national tip line to say he was suicidal and had a fascination with guns. The official said the July 1, 2016, call expressed concern for Clyde but did not contain a specific threat and was therefore not investigated. It came while Clyde was enlisted in the U.S. Army. Clyde’s mother, Nubia Brede Solis, told The Dallas Morning News that his half-brother had called the FBI with concerns.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A state commission has agreed to provide a $21.4 million grant to a multicounty coalition for a proposed new 80-mile rail route to haul crude oil from eastern Utah to existing Union Pacific tracks northwest of Price in Carbon County. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the Community Impact Board last week approved the funding for the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition for planning and environmental reviews. Supports say the planned Uinta Basin Railway would help Uintah and Duchesne counties develop their energy-dependent economies and reduce tanker traffic on highways. The coalition has contracted with the investment bank Drexel Hamilton, which will commit between $5 million and $15 million of its own funds, to raise private capital, commercialize the project and secure a partner to operate the rail line.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state Department of Fish and Wildlife is reminding people not to release aquarium fish into the wild. It is illegal to release the fish into Vermont waters. While most tropical fish are unlikely to become established in Vermont waters due to the cold weather, biologists say that if the aquarium fish survive and reproduce in the wild, they can be difficult – if not impossible – to control or eradicate. They can also cause changes in the native aquatic environment by competing with native species and introducing exotic parasites and diseases. Vermont biologists recently discovered goldfish, which are native to China, living in the sewer drains of Williston, which connect to public waters. Aquarium plants can also pose a threat if they are released into the wild.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state plans to mark four centuries of black history with a new exhibit and a tribute to tennis star Arthur Ashe Jr. The exhibit begins with the 1619 arrival in Virginia of the first enslaved Africans in English North America and continues all the way to the present day. “Determined: The 400-Year Struggle for Black Equality” will open Saturday at the Virginia Museum of History & Culture in Richmond as the city officially dedicates Arthur Ashe Boulevard. Renowned civil rights activist Rep. John Lewis of Georgia will be the keynote speaker. The exhibit features dozens of artifacts to tell the story of black Virginians, including slavery-era restraints, an African-inspired banjo and a stool from a Richmond lunch counter where students held a sit-in to protest segregation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The proof is in the pee. A new federally funded study has confirmed, not surprisingly, that marijuana use went up in the state after its first legal pot stores opened in 2014. In fact, consumption doubled over three years – a conclusion scientists reached after performing the decidedly unglamorous work of analyzing raw sewage. The researchers tested wastewater from Tacoma, a city whose drug-use trends tend to mirror those of Seattle, for a substance that is produced when people metabolize the active ingredient in pot. It is excreted in urine. The researchers said they can’t tell whether the increase in metabolites means more people are using weed or the same old users are consuming more of it. Another possible explanation is that the THC products sold legally in stores are more potent than what was commonly available on the black market.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State agricultural officials are warning about a fungal disease that attacks boxwood shrubs. The Department of Agriculture says in a news release that boxwood blight has been detected on residential and commercial landscapes throughout the state. Boxwood blight produces dark brown leaf spots and causes rapid defoliation that sometimes kills young boxwoods. It’s found in more than two dozen states and was first detected in West Virginia on plants shipped from out-of-state nurseries in 2015. The statement says residents should buy shrubs from reputable nurseries and only buy plants that appear healthy. Gardeners and landscapers should sanitize gardening tools between different plantings of boxwoods.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Assembly has approved a bill that would require online vendors like Amazon to collect and remit sales taxes from third-party sellers in perpetuity, a move that would trigger income tax cuts. Under the bill, revenue from the tax collections would be used to cover reductions in the lowest- and second-lowest income tax brackets. According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, taxpayers could expect an average reduction of $27 for tax year 2019 and an average reduction of $59 in tax year 2020 under the new rates. The Assembly passed the bill Thursday afternoon on a voice vote. The measure goes next to the state Senate. Coupled with an income tax cut plan Republicans inserted in the state budget, taxpayers could expect a total annual reduction of $91 in 2019 and $124 in 2020.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Some rodeo circuit cowboys say they will boycott this year’s Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo because of the new, tournament-style format the “Daddy of ’em All” adopted in roping and steer wrestling events. Under the new format, slack will now become a qualifying round to make it into the rodeo performances in steer roping, tie-down roping, team roping and steer wrestling. Each performance will see event winners and money paid out, and the contestants will start with a clean slate in the finals. Tie-down roper Hunter Herrin tells KGAB-AM the change means cowboys will compete more for less money. Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo Chairman Chad Mathews tells the Wyoming Tribune Eagle the new format means a better spectator experience and payouts to more contestants.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/17/china/china-yangtze-river-climate-change-endangered-species-scn-intl-hnk-dst", "title": "China lost its Yangtze River dolphin. Climate change is coming for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThey called it the “Goddess of the Yangtze” – a creature so rare that it was believed to bring fortune and protection to local fishermen and all those lucky enough to spot it.\n\nBut overfishing and human activity drove it to the brink of extinction and it hasn’t been seen in decades.\n\n“The baiji, or Yangtze River dolphin, was this unique and beautiful creature – there was nothing quite like it,” said Samuel Turvey, a British zoologist and conservationist who spent more than two decades in China trying to track the animal down.\n\n“It was around for tens of millions of years and was in its own mammal family. There are other river dolphins in the world but this one was very different, so unrelated to anything else,” Turvey said. “Its demise was more than just another species tragedy – it was a huge loss of river diversity in terms of how unique it was and left huge holes in the ecosystem.”\n\nExperts have expressed grave concern that other rare native Yangtze animal and plant species are likely to suffer a similar fate to the baiji river dolphin as worsening climate change and extreme weather conditions take their toll on Asia’s longest river.\n\nChina has been grappling with its worst heat wave on record and the Yangtze, the third longest river in the world, is drying up.\n\nWith rainfall below average since July, its water levels have plunged to record lows of 50% of their normal levels for this time of year, exposing cracked river beds and even revealing submerged islands.\n\nParts of the Yangtze River have dried up from the extreme heat. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe drought has already had a devastating effect on China’s most important river, which stretches an estimated 6,300 kilometers (3,900 miles) from the Tibetan plateau to the East China Sea near Shanghai and provides water, food, transport and hydroelectric power to more than 400 million people.\n\nThe human impact has been enormous. Factories were shut to preserve electricity and water supplies for tens of thousands of people have been affected.\n\nLess talked about, experts say, is the environmental impact that climate change and associated extreme weather events have had on the hundreds of protected and threatened wildlife and plant species living in and around the river.\n\n“The Yangtze is one of the world’s most ecologically critical rivers for biodiversity and freshwater ecosystems – and we are still discovering new species yearly,” said conservation ecologist Hua Fangyuan, an assistant professor from Peking University.\n\n“Many of the little (known) and unknown fish and other aquatic species are most likely facing extinction risks silently and we simply do not know enough.”\n\nA Chinese alligator at a zoo in Shanghai.

Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHundreds of species at risk\n\nOver the years conservationists and scientists have identified and documented hundreds of wild animal and plant species native to the Yangtze.\n\nAmong them are the Yangtze finless porpoise which, similar to the baiji, faces extinction due to human activity and habitat loss, and critically endangered reptiles like the Chinese alligator and Yangtze giant softshell turtle – believed to be the largest living species of freshwater turtle in the world.\n\nExperts have also noticed a drastic decline of many native freshwater species of fish, like the now extinct Chinese paddlefish and sturgeon.\n\nAt high risk is the Chinese giant salamander, one of the largest amphibians in the world. Wild populations have crashed, Turvey the zoologist said, and the species is “now on the verge of extinction.”\n\n“Although they are a protected species, Chinese giant salamanders are under greater threat from climate change – increasing global temperatures and droughts will definitely do it no good when it is already extremely vulnerable,” Turvey said.\n\nA Chinese giant salamander pictured at a local breeding facility. Imaginechina/AP\n\n“They have for a long time faced threats like poaching, habitat loss and pollution but when you add climate change into the mix, their chances of survival become drastically thin,” he added.\n\n“They can only live within freshwater environments and lower water levels would inevitably place greater pressure on their numbers across China.”\n\nA problem for the world\n\nNature conservation groups like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) say the Yangtze’s plight is a major concern not only for the Chinese people and government, but also for the wider international community.\n\n“Rivers around the world, from Europe to the United States, have declined to historically low flow levels that are negatively impacting ecosystems,” said its lead scientist Jeff Opperman.\n\nEU, Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery EU, Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery Slide right to see the Yangtze in August, 2021, and slide left to see it in August, 2022.\n\n“Reduced river flow and warmer waters in the Yangtze are a threat to freshwater species and increase pressure on already critically endangered animals like the remaining Yangtze finless porpoises and Chinese alligators left in the wild.

To the northeast, a Cape Cod beach was temporarily closed after a white shark sighting. In Northern California, one man was hospitalized in serious condition last month after being bitten by a shark while swimming near Grey Whale Cove State Beach.\n\nBut even as encounters with sharks make headlines this summer, the risk of being attacked by the often misunderstood creatures remains low, and plenty of other phenomena are far more dangerous.\n\nCows and bees kill more people every year than sharks do, according to conservation group Defenders of Wildlife.\n\n“Your chances of being bitten are kind of like your chances of winning the Powerball,” said Marine Biology Professor Christopher Lowe, who is director of the Shark Lab at California State University Long Beach.\n\nIn other words: It’s not likely to happen.\n\nAlso, humans are a far greater danger to sharks than the sea creatures are to us. On average, sharks kill five people per year in unprovoked attacks. Meanwhile, humans kill tens of millions of sharks every year.\n\nThings more likely than a shark to kill or injure you\n\n“You have a much bigger risk driving to the beach, or even getting caught in a rip current than you ever would from being bitten by a shark,” Lowe said.\n\nTo shed light on just how slim the odds of being attacked by a shark are, the Florida Museum of Natural History has a list of phenomena more likely to result in deaths and injuries.\n\nSo before you swear off going into the water on your next beach trip, here’s what to know:\n\nIn Florida, where the majority of US shark attacks happen, people were nearly 21 times more likely to die in a tornado (125 deaths) than a shark bite (six deaths) between 1985 and 2010.\n\nResidents of Florida and five other states with alligators were also more likely to die of a bite from the reptile (18 deaths) than a shark bite (nine).\n\nThere were 15,011 US bicycle fatalities compared to 14 shark fatalities between 1990 and 2009, which means Americans were over a thousand times more likely to die in a biking accident than a shark attack.\n\nLightning strikes killed nearly 76 times more people (1,970 deaths) than sharks (26) did between 1959 and 2010 in the Coastal US.\n\nSince 2004, rip currents were responsible for 45 times more deaths than sharks were.\n\nDogs killed more than five times the number of people (349) than did sharks (65) in the US between 2009 and 2018.\n\nInanimate objects have even killed more people than sharks have. In 1996, toilets injured 43,687 people, ladders injured 138,894 people, and 198,849 people were hurt by nails, screws, tacks, and bolts. In comparison, there were only 13 shark injuries and deaths during the same year.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, there were 441 hunting fatalities, compared to seven shark bite deaths in the US and Canada.\n\nThese numbers aren’t meant to incite fear at the sight of dogs, toilets or ladders, but are instead meant to demonstrate just how uncommon shark attacks are.\n\nHas there been an increase in shark attacks?\n\nEven though the risk of being bitten by a shark remains extremely low, there was an increase in attacks in 2021, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History.\n\nAfter three years of declines, the number of reported shark bites went up in 2021, with a total of 73 unprovoked incidents reported worldwide, according to a January 2022 report by the museum’s International Shark Attack File.\n\nThe incidents included nine deaths globally, including one death in the US. A surfer was killed in a shark attack in California on Christmas Eve last year.\n\nThe numbers are on par with the five-year international average of 72 attacks annually, but represents an increase from the 52 attacks reported in 2020, when Americans hunkered down at home amid COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nIt is common to see annual fluctuations in shark-human interactions, and despite a spike in fatalities in 2021, long-term trends show the number of annual shark bite deaths are decreasing, according to the Shark Attack File.\n\nThe US leads the world in the annual number of documented shark bites, with a total of 47 reported in 2021. Most of those attacks were in Florida, according to data compiled by the museum. Surfers and boarders made up more than half of reported shark bite victims.\n\nLowe said the increase can be attributed to climate change and rising temperatures driving more people to the beach just as shark populations are recovering and possibly swimming closer to shore to feed.\n\n“The country is warmer than it’s ever been. And that’s going to drive more people to the water than ever before, which just simply increases your probability of somebody getting accidentally bit,” the professor explained.\n\nStill, when taking into account just how many people are going into the water, the probability of being attacked by a shark is very low.\n\nWe’re not on their menu\n\nResearchers don’t really know for sure why sharks sometimes bite people. It’s possible they do it because they feel threatened and are just trying to defend themselves, Lowe said.\n\n“The number one thing people have to remember is that it is the shark’s home, and we’re guests in their home, and quite often, we’re not good guests,” the professor added.\n\nIt’s also possible sharks sometimes mistake swimmers and surfers for food. Sharks could see a hand or a foot in the water and mistake it for a small fish. A tiger shark or a white shark could even mistake a human for a seal or sea turtle.\n\nSome attacks are “cases of mistaken identity,” occurring under conditions of poor water visibility, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History.\n\n“People are bitten but rarely consumed, and that tells us that we are not on the shark’s menu,” Lowe said.\n\nSharks just don’t care about us\n\nLowe and his team at Shark Lab have been using drones to study how sharks behave around humans along the California coast.\n\n“After two years of looking at hundreds of hours of footage, basically, our conclusion is that sharks ignore people,” Lowe said.\n\nDrone video from Shark Lab shows sharks peacefully swimming near unsuspecting paddleboarders, at times close enough for the humans to lean down and touch them.\n\n“People have been taught to fear sharks, thinking that if the shark’s nearby it’s going to bite, and we know that is not true,” Lowe said.\n\nStill, shark attacks can happen on rare occasions, so it is good to remember if you ever encounter a one, turn towards it, so it knows you can see it, and slowly back away.\n\n“The ocean is a wild place. It’s not Disneyland, your safety is not guaranteed,” Lowe said.\n\nWe hope you enjoy your next summer beach trip!

Bite marks indicated that the majority of its dorsal fin had also been chewed off.\n\nKiller whales attack and kill blue whale\n\nThe orcas – referred to in the study as “killer whales” – continued to attack their prey for 20 minutes, while the adult blue whale was “slapping and swiping its tail,” as a defense mechanism, the research said.\n\nThe pack killed the whale within an hour of being spotted. More orcas proceeded to join the pack as they fed off the carcass, making the total headcount about 50. They tore off pieces of flesh and dispersed into feeding groups, with almost 30 orcas still feeding when the crew left the scene.\n\nIn the second predation, which took place 16 days later, the blue whale calf appeared to be dead after the crew had been observing the attack for 15 minutes. Scientists identified 26 whales that also participated in the third hunting episode.\n\nThe final hunting episode lasted for nearly three hours, and the number of orcas present ranged from about 50 to 75.\n\nAt least 16 of the same orcas took part in all three attacks.\n\nAdult female killers could be more likely to start attacks because they have young to feed, and therefore require sustenance more often than adult males.\n\nThe first predation attracted numerous seabirds, including flesh-footed shearwaters, Wilson's storm-petrels, white-faced storm-petrels and at least one black-browned albatross. CETREC\n\n“These guys are ferocious with a preference for squid, fish and beaked whales. In recent years recordings of the number of beaked whales taken have increased, in this region they are known to also predate on humpback and minke,” John Totterdell, a researcher at the Cetacean Research Centre who was involved in the research, said.\n\n“It’s suggested that killer whale predation has impeded gray whale population recovery in the Northwest pacific, yet in Australia, with many whale species known to be targeted by killer whales, the impact of their predation on these populations remains unknown.\n\n“This study, combined with our recent research, highlights the need for increased understanding of killer whale population ecology so we can better determine their impact on the marine ecosystem in Australian waters.”\n\nOrcas are the biggest member of the dolphin family, but were dubbed “killer whales” by ancient sailors who noticed groups of orcas preying on larger whale species, according to Whale and Dolphin Conservation, a non-profit organization.\n\nBlue whales are the largest animals on Earth, and can weigh up to 33 tons – that’s about 33 elephants, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

An American agave's job is to flower once and then die.\n\nOne of the plants that called the University of Michigan home for an unexpectedly long 80 years accomplished the former last year.\n\nOn April 8, its life came to an end.\n\nMike Palmer, the horticulture manager at the university's Matthaei Botanical Gardens, used a hand saw to bring down the agave's 20-plus-foot-tall stalk.\n\n\"It was time,\" Palmer said after he and some workers carried the fallen stalk away, leaving a stump where it once stood. It's sad. Many people have said to me though they enjoyed the whole flowering that they were anticipating the sadness of its final days.\"\n\nStill, \"the agave lives on,\" said Palmer, who added new plants will be grown from its seedlings and eventually sold. Plus, university music professor Michael Gould plans to make a flute from the stalk.\n\nOnce the new instrument is created, Gould and a colleague who plays the shakuhachi, or Japanese bamboo flute, plan to perform a concert at the botanical gardens \"to give the plant a life again.\n\n\"There are instruments that are hundreds and hundreds of years old, so the agave can live on,\" Gould said.\n\nAnd a couple getting married this weekend at the botanical gardens have requested a seedling so they can use it as part of their wedding ceremony.\n\nThe agave had called Ann Arbor home since 1934. It grew to 28 feet after a rapid growth spurt in the spring of 2014 that preceded its flowering, which ended later in the year. The agave then went into rapid decline, which is normal for the species, Palmer said.\n\nAlthough it is known as the century plant, the American agave typically lives up to 30 to 35 years. Palmer, who cared for the plant during the past 15 years, said he doesn't know why it took this agave so long to bloom.\n\nRegardless, \"it was time to take it down. It was the natural process for the agave to die after it flowers and sets seeds,\" he said.\n\n\"We have seedlings now, so they will create the circle of life.\"\n\nPuppy rescued after falling 50 feet into old well casing\n\nFRESNO, Calif.

Fatai Campbell/AP\n\nNigeria’s flood crisis has been disastrous this year, killing at least 300 people and affecting more than half a million people, NEMA said last month. NEMA warned of more catastrophic flooding for states located along the courses of rivers Niger and Benue, explaining that three of Nigeria’s overfilled reservoirs were expected to overflow.\n\nThe Anambra tragedy follows the devastating aftermath of a flood that swept through swaths of neighboring north-central Kogi state a week ago, leaving buildings submerged under water that rose to levels not seen in a decade, according to officials of the Kogi Red Cross Society.\n\nAt least six people, including a toddler, were reported to have died in Kogi’s worst-hit Ibaji district, which the state Governor Yahaya Bello said was “100% underwater.”\n\nBello described the flooding as a “humanitarian tragedy” in an October 1 address.\n\nKogi is located around 200 kilometers from Nigeria’s capital, Abuja.

Elisabeth Jacobs is a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and deputy director of WorkRise. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nEach day seems to bring new headlines of low-wage workers coming together to start a union. A historically tight labor market has given rise to a new era of worker power, although the conditions workers are protesting are far from new. Low wages, minimal benefits, hazardous working conditions and unpredictable schedules are the byproduct of trends that are decades in the making.\n\nThe right to collectively bargain is one we need to protect and strengthen for workers to increase their wages and gain upward mobility. Yet, our research shows that there is another important avenue for strengthening worker power: making it easier for them to find new, better-paying jobs.\n\nHigh employer demand has already enabled workers to upgrade to better jobs, but this hot labor market might not last much longer – especially with the possibility of a recession on the horizon. Policymakers have the tools to empower workers to find new jobs even when market conditions aren’t tilted in their favor. Here are some measures the government could consider:\n\nPromote competition\n\nAntitrust laws and enforcement have traditionally focused on increasing competition for products or services such as oil, health care or telecommunications. But it’s important that our labor markets are sufficiently competitive, too. In a competitive labor market, employers must compete with one another for workers through pay, benefits or working conditions. Research shows that when jobs are concentrated among a small number of employers, workers are more likely to earn lower wages.\n\nAmazon Labor Union organizers hold signs outside of the LDJ5 Amazon Sort Center on April 25, 2022 in New York City. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images/FILE\n\nPolicymakers could start by more closely scrutinizing corporate mergers for signs they could decrease competition for workers. Regulators should keep a close eye on mergers of large companies that compete for the same workers in a specific labor market. One study found, for instance, that hospital mergers resulted in lower wages for nurses and pharmacy workers.\n\nPresident Biden signed an executive order last year aimed at stimulating competition across the economy — including labor markets. Among its directives, the order encourages the US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission to step up enforcement of antitrust measures that prevent employers from sharing wage and benefits data with each other and potentially colluding to suppress wages.\n\nLimit or eliminate non-compete agreements\n\nNon-compete agreements prevent workers from leaving their current employer for a competitor or even starting their own business. These agreements can be particularly harmful to low-wage workers, who are more likely to see an increase in pay by switching employers rather than through an internal promotion. Non-compete agreements diminish earnings and job mobility and exacerbate racial and gender wage gaps. And they’re not uncommon in low-wage industries, where more than one in 10 low- or moderate-income workers are bound by a non-compete.\n\nSeveral states have banned non-compete agreements for low-wage or hourly workers — and some have banned them entirely. Bipartisan support is emerging at the federal level for limiting non-compete agreements to cases when they are required to dissolve a partnership or sell a business. Policymakers should more broadly consider banning any agreement that impedes an individual worker’s ability to change jobs or careers.\n\nReform occupational licensing laws\n\nOccupational licensing requirements have grown considerably over the decades: In 1950, about 5% of the workforce was required to be licensed, compared to about one-quarter now. The laws are designed to protect consumers in fields such as health care or construction where an unlicensed practitioner could inflict serious harm to public health and safety. They also signal to consumers that a practitioner meets a minimum standard for quality and skills.\n\nYet licensing also limits opportunity and geographic mobility for workers, since the requirements vary considerably from state to state. Further, workers often have to pay the upfront costs for obtaining a license and continued costs for renewing it. Since licensing serves as a barrier to entry, it can diminish employment opportunities and depress wages of unlicensed workers with similar levels of training and experience.\n\nOn the flip side: Because they limit labor supply, licenses are incredibly valuable for workers who obtain them. Licensed workers typically earn higher wages than their unlicensed counterparts, and in certain cases, provide workers with guidelines around professional development and training. Licenses have also been found to reduce racial and gender wage gaps.\n\nThe solution here is not to eliminate occupational licensing completely, but rather to reform laws in ways that make licenses more portable across state lines and limit licensing to fields with legitimate risks to public health and safety.\n\nCorrect the information asymmetry between workers and employers\n\nEmployers often know much more about workers than workers know about jobs or employers. When workers apply for jobs, they often encounter an information vacuum about wages, benefits, scheduling or workplace culture, which has real consequences for their wages and ability to advance their careers. A study from Germany found that workers earning low wages were more likely to believe that other jobs also paid low wages, even when it wasn’t the case.\n\nHaving access to more information about employers and specific jobs could empower workers to apply for more open positions — or at least equip them with the information to decide whether to apply at all.\n\nAt the same time, giving workers the right to withhold information such as their own salary history could give them leverage when negotiating wages. Dozens of states and cities have enacted salary history bans, leading to higher than average wage increases for women and nonwhite workers.\n\nOf course, unions are an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to worker empowerment, but not the only piece. Policymakers should support a worker’s chances to have abundant outside job offers — even when the market turns, as it inevitably will.", "authors": ["Todd Greene Ioana Marinescu Jake Rosenfeld", "Todd Greene", "Ioana Marinescu", "Jake Rosenfeld"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/12/02/nissan-volkswagen-trump-tennessee-electric-vehicles/76430297007/", "title": "Nissan, VW: Trump policies may impact Tennessee-made electric ...", "text": "Tennessee's booming electric-vehicle industry appears to be facing a setback as U.S. auto buyers hesitate to embrace EVs.\n\nBeyond lower-than-expected demand, anticipated cuts to industry regulations and tax incentives under incoming President Donald Trump are expected to reshape the electric vehicle market.\n\nWhat does that mean for General Motors' production and electric battery plants in Spring Hill, Ford's Blue Oval City — home of the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center, Nissan's Leaf-manufacturing Smyrna Assembly Plant and other auto makers and suppliers statewide?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/energy/2017/03/27/california-shattering-solar-records-bill-could-take-renewable-energy-next-level/99536342/", "title": "California is shattering solar records. This bill could take renewable ...", "text": "Sammy Roth\n\nThe Desert Sun\n\nA month ago, California broke its all-time solar record, with nearly 8,800 megawatts of solar power flooding the state's main electric grid on a Friday afternoon. The record stood until the following Wednesday, when more than 9,000 megawatts of solar powered the Golden State, according to the California Independent System Operator, which runs the grid.\n\nThat record didn't even last 24 hours.\n\nWith the costs of solar continuing to fall, and wind still one of the cheapest sources of new electricity around, California should have no problem hitting its 50 percent clean energy target by 2030.\n\nTHE CURRENT: Subscribe to The Desert Sun's energy and water newsletter\n\nBut getting to 100 percent — the goal floated by Senate leader Kevin de León in a bill last month — would be more complicated. That's because solar panels only generate electricity when the sun shines, which doesn't always match up with when people use energy. As a result, officials have increasingly been forced to shut down solar farms in the middle of the day, when they're producing more energy than people need. At the same time, solar falls short in the evening. The sun goes down just as electricity demand goes up, forcing the state to fire up polluting, gas-fired power plants.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nREAD MORE: Warren Buffett is rushing to build hundreds of wind turbines to power the West\n\nA new bill in the state Legislature could help solve those problems.\n\nIntroduced by Assemblymember Kevin Mullin, D-San Mateo, the bill would create a \"clean peak energy standard\" for California utilities. By 2029, utilities like Southern California Edison, PG&E and SDG&E would be required to get 40 percent of their energy from clean sources during \"peak demand\" periods — the handful of hours each day when homes and businesses use the most energy — on at least 15 days each month.\n\nThat requirement would encourage the development of battery storage systems, which could soak up excess solar generation during the middle of the day and release that energy onto the grid after sundown, reducing the need for gas plants. The bill could also speed the adoption of energy efficiency and conservation programs that reduce electricity use during peak periods. Geothermal power plants, which are more expensive than solar and wind but provide clean electricity at all hours of the day and night, could also be a winner.\n\nCalifornia's push for renewable energy has been driven by a desire to limit greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, which are the primary driver of climate change. State lawmakers have set an ambitious target of reducing emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, then 80 percent by 2050. If California is going to meet those goals, policymakers need to think about how clean energy can run the power grid without help from fossil fuels, rather than just mandating higher and higher levels of renewables, said Andrew Zingale, Assemblymember Mullin's legislative director.\n\n\"We can't just load up on more renewables that are happening at the middle of the day, and just keep loading up on (gas-fired) peaker plants to run at the end of the day,\" Zingale said.\n\nREAD MORE: Why fighting climate change won't destroy the economy\n\nIs Mullin's bill the wrong approach?\n\nCalifornia having \"too much solar\" during the middle of the day is far from a crisis at this point, but it's getting worse as more solar comes online — and officials are trying to figure out how to deal with it. Stephen Berberich, president of the California Independent System Operator, said recently the grid operator may have to \"curtail,\" or turn away, as much 8,000 megawatts of power at times this spring, most of it solar.\n\n\"We've been seeing the oversupply increasing faster than our forecast said it was going to increase,\" said Steven Greenlee, a spokesperson for the independent system operator.\n\nRELATED: California Senate leader's new bill: 100% clean energy\n\nCalifornia will need to solve that problem, but some experts say Mullin's bill is the wrong approach.\n\nAmong them is Eric Hittinger, a public policy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, and an expert in the economics of clean energy. If policymakers want to fight climate change, he said, they should mandate reductions in emissions, or increases in renewable energy. Encouraging the development of energy storage, he said, is a strangely indirect way to address climate change, especially when storage is still relatively expensive.\n\nIn some ways, Hittinger's argument is classic economic theory: The government should set the end goal, then let the market figure out the cheapest way to solve the problem. Incentivizing utilities to pay for energy storage before it's needed could raise electricity prices unnecessarily, Hittinger said.\n\n\"The market will correct itself. If the (over-generation) problem gets worse — and it will — storage will become a natural solution, and people will naturally put storage on the grid,\" he said.\n\nArne Olson, a partner at the San Francisco consulting firm Energy + Environmental Economics, made a similar point. As more solar and wind farms are built, and the mismatch between supply and demand grows, the economic case for battery storage will improve.\n\n\"These kinds of questions really come down to economics. If there’s a binding (renewable energy) target, or a binding (greenhouse gas) target, then you can work out from there what the most cost-effective, optimal way is to meet that,\" Olson said.\n\n'They don't have time to let the market figure it out'\n\nMullin's bill — and a similar measure in the state Senate, introduced by Sen. Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley — were inspired by a white paper from Strategen Consulting, a Berkeley-based clean energy policy firm. While the paper was commissioned by government officials in Arizona, its lessons apply to California, according to Strategen's Lon Huber, the paper's lead author.\n\nREAD MORE: Salton Sea geothermal plant would use lithium tech that caught Tesla's eye\n\nHuber pushed back against the idea that utilities will start buying energy storage the moment it makes economic sense.\n\n\"I'm a markets guy more than anything. But the way that California is going, they don't have time to let the market figure it out and have years of committees and everything,\" Huber said. \"They're already experiencing a massive amount of curtailment (of solar power), and every year it gets substantially worse because they have to meet the 50 percent target by 2030.\"\n\nBatteries are still too expensive for widespread adoption. But California has a long history of incentivizing technologies that aren't quite ready for prime time, said Sonia Aggarwal, vice president of Energy Innovation, a San Francisco-based policy research group. Legislative action to encourage batteries could spur further cost reductions, leading to benefits down the road, Aggarwal said.\n\n\"You're paying for future possibilities. It's not like everything needs to pencil out in the very first year,\" she said.\n\nMore than just batteries\n\nThe U.S. added a record 221 megawatts of energy storage in 2016, according to a recent report from the clean-tech consulting firm Greentech Media and the Energy Storage Association, a trade group. A big chunk of that growth was in Southern California. In Los Angeles County, utilities scrambled to bring new storage online to make up for the loss of the Aliso Canyon gas field, which has been shut down since it sprung an enormous leak in late 2015. In the desert, the Imperial Irrigation District debuted a 30-megawatt lithium-ion battery, one of the largest such facilities in the country.\n\nREAD MORE: In Southern California, a giant battery comes to life\n\nZingale, Mullin's legislative director, said the energy storage industry has a significant presence in the assemblymember's Silicon Valley district. He said Mullin's office learned about Strategen Consulting's \"clean peak\" proposal from people in the storage industry. But he expects Mullin's legislation, Assembly Bill 1405, to do more than just encourage storage.\n\nIndeed, there are plenty of ways for California to increase its reliance on clean power during periods of high demand, from reducing overall energy use to using electricity at different times of day. Aggarwal mentioned demand response programs, which can pay people to shift their energy use toward times when solar and wind are plentiful. Companies are developing creative ways to automate those shifts, so that individual homes and businesses don't have to think about them.\n\n\"Batteries are coming down in price extremely quickly, but they're not the cheapest flexibility resource at the moment,\" Aggarwal said.\n\nSammy Roth writes about energy and the environment for The Desert Sun.

The Greene County Partnership is the initiative lead.\n\nOver a course of nine months, participating communities are completing community ecosystem maps, performing innovation capacity assessments and engaging in hours of interactive working sessions to identify a critical community challenge and incubating a solution that would solve it and in turn positively affect their local economies.\n\nThe Academy will culminate on October 21 in Nashville, TN with a pitch presentation by each participating community outlining an innovative solution to a proposed problem within their community. Teams will be seeking resources (i.e. feedback, introductions, connections, program funding) from the pitch event judges and audience members to strengthen their solution pathway.\n\n“TVA’s Community Innovation Academy provides participating Valley communities the opportunity to explore fresh and transformational approaches to competitiveness in the economic development industry,” said Heidi Smith, TVA General Manager, Global Business. “We are proud to partner with the Greene County Partnership and Greene County to help prepare the community catalysts for industry disruptors and support innovative solutions to foster economic growth.”\n\n“Cities and their community networks are incredible vectors to solve complex economic development problems. The growing rate of global change and unpredictable business environments present a profound challenge to our ability to plan, manage and grow our communities these days. Companies and talent alike are increasingly looking to locate or grow in communities that welcome change, embrace creativity and build innovative environments. Challenges accelerated by the Covid 19 pandemic like workforce availability, small business readiness, corporate growth/expansion and inequality have grown exponentially more complex. How communities effectively respond to those challenges requires new thinking, new models and new collaborations. By applying community innovation, we can help places like Greene County positively impact their long-term economic future,” said Guillermo Mazier, Founder Collective Intelligence and VP Global Innovation at Conway, Inc.\n\n“We’re both proud and excited to be apart of this remarkably innovative program” said Jeff Taylor, President and CEO of the Greene County Partnership. “By partnering with the First Tennessee Development District and Greeneville Light & Power, we can identify common community problems, and with the help of the Community Innovation Academy, we’ve been able to develop appropriate solutions that are conducive to expanding and diversifying Greene County’s economy.”\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority is a corporate agency of the United States that provides electricity for business customers and local power companies serving 10 million people in parts of seven southeastern states.

Earlier this month, Nokian Tyres won the Tennessee Governor’s Environmental Stewardship Award for Sustainable Performance for its environmental efforts in Dayton.\n\nNokian Tyres began producing tires 24/7 at its Southeast Tennessee campus on July 12. The global tiremaker has hired nearly 150 team members since the start of 2021 and added a third production shift in mid-May. The creation of a fourth shift is in line with Nokian Tyres’ long-term ramp-up plans at the factory, where it plans to make as many as four million tires annually and employ up to 400 workers once the facility reaches full capacity.\n\n“Adding third and fourth production shifts allows us to keep pace with production goals that will help us grow our presence in North America,” said Dayton Factory Operations Director David Korda. “We’re pleased with the quantity and quality of workers we’ve added this year, and we’re eager to help them thrive as our company grows.”\n\nNokian Tyres started production at the Dayton Factory in January 2020 to serve rising demand for its products in the North American market. It crafts all-season and all-weather tires at the facility in line with its core values of safety and sustainability. All three of Nokian Tyres’ global factories hold ISO 14001 certification.\n\nNokian Tyres aims to use the factory to reduce delivery lead times to North American customers and build tires tailored to the needs of drivers in the region, such as the Nokian Tyres One, an all-season passenger tire it launched in North America in January.\n\nKnoxville’s annual entrepreneurship week returns in-person, celebrates new accelerator programs\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn., July 15, 2021 – The Innov865 Alliance announced today Innov865 Week 2021 will return with an in-person annual pitch competition and other special events.

The firm earned the No. 4 spot on the list of Best Workplaces for Millennials from FORTUNE magazine and Great Place to Work®, just as it did in 2020. In April 2021, Pinnacle was named the overall No. 26 Best Company to Work For in the United States and No. 8 Best Workplace in Financial Services and Insurance.\n\n“The pandemic changed people’s expectations of how work fits into their lives,” said Sarae Janes Lewis, Pinnacle’s director of associate and client experience. “Many of today’s millennials are parents of young children and even approaching middle age, and they expect a work-life dynamic that will let them be at their best in all roles. That’s always been Pinnacle’s value proposition for associates. They’re given the freedom to do what they love at work and the flexibility to take care of their family and personal needs so they never have to compromise. We were built for this moment.”\n\nDuring the height of the pandemic, associates gave glowing reviews of Pinnacle’s response and business continuation plan, which gave them room to prioritize caring for themselves and their families.\n\n“From Day One, I felt like my health and my family’s health was important… I appreciate being a part of the Pinnacle family now more than ever.”\n\n“The constant support and requests for our input makes me feel valued as a person and a member of this Pinnacle family… We are all able to do what works best for our individual situations and offices.”\n\n“I feel that every decision took my family into consideration, as well as my ability to continue performing my daily duties with all the resources necessary to do so.”\n\n“The flexibility for us to take care of our family and kids really helped us. I don’t know what we would have done without that support.”\n\nEven with a hiring philosophy that seeks out seasoned professionals with at least 10 years of experience for most roles, nearly a quarter of Pinnacle’s associates are 40 years old or under. With an average retention rate of 95 percent – unheard of in the financial services industry – they are more likely to stay and build their careers at Pinnacle.\n\nRankings for this list reflect feedback representing more than 5.3 million employees at Great Place to Work-Certified organizations. Great Place to Work, a global people analytics and consulting firm, evaluated more than 60 elements of team members’ experience on the job. Eighty-five percent of the evaluation is based on what millennials say about their experiences of trust and reaching their full human potential as part of their organization, no matter who they are or what they do. The remaining 15 percent of the rank is based on an assessment of millennials’ daily experiences of innovation, the company’s values and the effectiveness of their leaders, to ensure they’re consistently experienced.\n\nBest Workplaces for Millennials is one of a series of rankings by Great Place to Work and FORTUNE based on employee feedback from Great Place to Work-Certified™ organizations.

American Banker recognized Pinnacle as one of America’s Best Banks to Work For eight years in a row and No. 1 among banks with more than $10 billion in assets in 2020.\n\nPinnacle owns a 49 percent interest in Bankers Healthcare Group (BHG), which provides innovative, hassle-free financial solutions to healthcare practitioners and other licensed professionals. Great Place to Work and FORTUNE ranked BHG No. 1 on its 2020 list of Best Workplaces in New York State in the small/medium business category.\n\nThe firm began operations in a single location in downtown Nashville, TN in October 2000 and has since grown to approximately $35.3 billion in assets as of March 31, 2021. As the second-largest bank holding company headquartered in Tennessee, Pinnacle operates in 14 primarily urban markets across the Southeast.\n\nAdditional information concerning Pinnacle, which is included in the Nasdaq Financial-100 Index, can be accessed at www.pnfp.com.\n\nAbout the Best Workplaces for Millennials\n\nGreat Place to Work based its ranking on a data-driven methodology applied to anonymous Trust Index™ survey responses representing over 5.3 million employees at Great Place to Work-Certified organizations.

The donations resulted in the record-setting awarding of student scholarships, the establishment of a student emergency fund, and the founding of the Big Orange Pantry to alleviate food insecurity.\n\n“The way our alumni and friends have stepped up to support UT students during a difficult year has been nothing short of amazing,” said Chancellor Donde Plowman. “I continue to be inspired all the time by the selflessness, courage, and leadership that define Volunteers of all ages and backgrounds.”\n\nThis record year has enabled another generation of students to gain access to the Volunteer experience. More than 7,400 students were awarded more than 9,500 privately funded scholarships for a disbursed total of over $21 million.\n\n“I am the first person in my entire family to finish high school, let alone a college degree,” said senior Alexis Moreno, a statistics major. “Thanks to the generosity of donors, finances were not one of the obstacles. This is something I will always remember and be grateful for.”\n\nMoreno completed his UT education with support from the Tri-Star Scholarship program, an area that saw significant growth this year. Comprising three scholarships (UT Promise, Tennessee Pledge, and Flagship), the Tri-Star provides pathways for Tennessee residents to receive an affordable UT education.\n\nOne of the proudest achievements of the year was the way Volunteers stepped up to establish the university’s Student Emergency Fund. The initial goal of raising $250,000 using VOLstarter, UT’s crowdfunding platform, was quickly exceeded, and funds were distributed to nearly 830 students by May. For Heath Allen, a geography major, the emergency funding helped him find an apartment in Knoxville, giving him reliable internet service and a pathway to complete his semester virtually.\n\nThe Big Orange Pantry was established after a study on campus revealed that one in three students identified as food insecure; the isolation and economic upheaval of COVID-19 increased the problem. A collaborative cross-campus effort created and stocked the pantry, where students can receive assistance in a stigma-free environment that is like a shopping experience.\n\nThe pantry was made possible by seed funding given by Donnie and Terry Smith (’80), whose philanthropy centers around agriculture and food.\n\n“It’s really hard to ace a math test when you’ve got an empty stomach,” Smith said. “Our hearts are with that kid who needs that bit of extra help to do well in school and not get discouraged. It’s hard to raise your hand and say, ‘I’m hungry.’”\n\nTwo transformative moments during the year were a gift from the Haslam family to the Haslam College of Business and the Zeanah family’s gift to create the Zeanah Engineering Complex. Other highlights included the Big Orange Give, the annual day of giving, which raised $2.5 million in just 24 hours for hundreds of areas across campus; significant growth in alumni chapter and council scholarships; and a gift from Randy and Jenny Boyd (both ’79) to secure a historic replacement of the Carousel Theatre, which will be named the Jenny Boyd Carousel Theatre.\n\nUT raises funds through the University of Tennessee Foundation, an independent nonprofit corporation that seeks to enrich the lives of UT students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends through alumni engagement, financial stewardship, and private investments. The foundation is the preferred channel for all private contributions benefiting faculty and students throughout the University of Tennessee System.\n\nOle Red Gatlinburg to hold hiring event July 20th\n\nOle Red Gatlinburg—the popular restaurant, music venue, and retail space inspired by country superstar Blake Shelton—will welcome job seekers during a one-day hiring event.

The mural will be located on the concrete block wall of the Smyrna Ready Mix plant.\n\nKeep Knoxville Beautiful has partnered up with local artist Megan Lingerfelt to bring some greenery to a drab wall at the entrance to the Marble City neighborhood and steps away from the Third Creek Greenway. Lingerfelt was inspired by the lush and flourishing spirit of the Third Creek Greenway. The mural will consist of a pattern of a spade-shaped leaf with a sheen that would reflect light and give a sense of the dappled sun and shade experienced on the greenway. Additionally, a nod to the neighborhood's namesake and history is included with \"Marble City\" woven through the leaves in a light pink broken line to abstractly reference the color and character of Tennessee pink marble.\n\nExecutive Director of Keep Knoxville Beautiful, Alanna McKissack, says “we are excited to bring beautification through the creative lens to this historic neighborhood of Knoxville. Beautiful spaces help promote clean and thriving communities. We hope this will be a start to more projects along Sutherland Avenue.”\n\nKeep Knoxville Beautiful is hoping to raise $5,000 to help pay for the new mural. The organization is asking for donations of $11 on Facebook to help cover the cost of one square foot of the mural. Donations can be made at https://www.facebook.com/donate/245831440413963/.\n\nPrep and painting of the mural will begin in August.\n\nKCDC secures 63 emergency housing vouchers to help stem homelessness in pandemic\n\nKnoxville’s Community Development Corporation (KCDC) has been awarded 63 emergency housing vouchers to help prevent homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic with funding authorized by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) allocated additional emergency housing vouchers (EHVs) to public housing authorities in areas where populations have the greatest need while also considering housing authority capacity and the requirement to ensure geographic diversity, including rural areas.\n\n“These vouchers will help KCDC get more people into housing who need it the most right now,” KCDC Executive Director and CEO Ben Bentley said. “The pairing of resources through HUD’s Continuum of Care (COC) programs with these EHVs will enable the delivery of rapid housing and support for individuals and families experiencing homelessness.”\n\nThe EHVs will help assist individuals and families who are homeless; recently homeless; at risk of homelessness; or fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking or human trafficking.\n\nKCDC’s Section 8 program is seeking additional landlords within Knoxville and Knox County to help provide affordable housing to lower-income families. Benefits to landlords include a guaranteed rent subsidy via direct deposit on the first working day of each month; lower vacancy rates; criminal background checks on applicants; and inspections on units to identify any possible problems.

Attendance is free by registering online.\n\nREAP provides guaranteed loan financing and grant funding to agricultural producers and rural small businesses for renewable energy systems or to make energy efficiency improvements. REAP grant application submissions are due by October 31, 2021, and many types of businesses are eligible.\n\n“There is a big misconception that grants to fund solar installations to offset energy costs are reserved for agricultural producers or working farms, and that is simply not the case,” noted Harvey Abouelata, vice president of commercial solar for Knoxville-based Solar Alliance. “We’ve helped businesses of all types and sizes apply for and receive grants for solar solutions that have a huge impact on energy costs and their bottom lines. The main prerequisite is that the business be in an area deemed rural and they are classified as a small business. The USDA definition of “small business” is actually broader than most people realize, so we encourage business owners to get in touch with us so we can help them navigate the process and determine what support is available,\" said Abouelata.\n\nApplying for the USDA REAP energy grant can be time-consuming and intimidating, so Solar Alliance offers a turnkey program to help businesses in rural communities. “Solar Alliance has secured millions of dollars in tax incentives/credits and grants for customers to help offset project costs. The REAP grant can be combined with the investment tax credit (ITC) and the modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) depreciation which makes for an attractive payback,” noted Abouelata.\n\n“The savings from our solar installation are a critical part of our cost-cutting strategy, and our customers appreciate our commitment to the environment. The turnkey approach Solar Alliance took to handling both the REAP grant and the total installation made everything easy,” said Alex Miller, CEO of Lick Skillet Farm in New Market, Tennessee. “It’s a rare occasion when a business can drive down a fixed-cost,” said Ted Wampler, Jr., president of Wampler Farm Sausage in Lenoir City, Tennessee. “We installed several solar projects through the grant process since 2009 and have been recognized as an innovative business in our industry. I highly recommend going for a REAP grant,” he said.\n\nAccording to the USDA website, this program helps increase American energy independence by increasing the private sector supply of renewable energy and decreasing the demand for energy through energy efficiency improvements. Over time, these investments can also help lower the cost of energy for small businesses and agricultural producers.\n\nRandy DeBord, an entrepreneurial businessman involved in the revitalization of downtown Morristown, Tennessee utilized a REAP grant to install solar at McFarland Pharmacy where he is president and owner. “Grants to help reduce energy costs aren’t just for farmers,” noted DeBord. “Many small, for-profit businesses qualify, regardless of the type of business.”\n\n“Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s been a tough 16 months for small businesses, especially those located in rural areas,” said Abouelata. “We are here to help navigate the application process through construction so small businesses can become energy independent and control their costs.”\n\nSolar Alliance charges a nominal fee for its grant writing services which can be applied in the form of a credit during the construction phase.\n\nFor information, contact Harvey Abouelata at habouelata@solaralliance.com\n\nAbout Solar Alliance\n\nSolar Alliance is a purpose-driven company whose mission is fostering energy independence and promoting sustainable solutions that preserve the environment. The company partners with businesses, utilities, contractors, and other entities to propel economic development, promote environmental stewardship, and spur energy independence.\n\nCBCW’s Christa Rosenberg handles lease of new downtown Knox co-working space for female entrepreneurs\n\nJuly 13, 2021 | Knoxville, Tenn — Coldwell Banker Commercial Wallace announces the lease of an office space at the Langley Building, 520 W.

Summit Circle in West Knoxville, one of Knoxville’s most affluent neighborhoods. Located within five miles of Downtown Knoxville and the University of Tennessee, the neighborhood’s elementary, middle and high schools are among the most highly rated in Knox County.\n\nDespite the numerous demand drivers, the eight-acre wooded property has suffered from a lack of institutional-quality ownership and has largely remained unimproved since being constructed in 1974. This has impacted both rent growth and occupancy, which was 88 percent at closing, according to Magma Equities Founder and Managing partner Ryan Hall.\n\n“We will immediately address deferred maintenance issues as well as bring on Elmington Property Management, which manages all of our properties in Tennessee, to improve property-level operations,” said Hall, whose Los Angeles-based investment firm owns more than 700 units in Tennessee. “We will then embark on a thoughtful renovation program in the Fall.”\n\nWhen completed, Hall believes The Abigail will be well positioned as a high quality, yet more affordable alternative to the higher-priced rental product in the West Knoxville submarket.\n\nDennis Harris of The Kirkland Companies represented both parties to the transaction.\n\nAbout Magma Equities\n\nManhattan Beach, CA-based Magma Equities (http://www.magmaequities.com) is a diversified real estate organization focused on re-positioning Class A & B apartment communities throughout the country. We strive to maximize returns for investors while providing our residents with homes that are environmentally friendly, efficient, and state-of-the-art.

It features gourmet, made from scratch coal-fired pizzas including favorites like the Pizza Party, pepperoni drizzled with Mike’s Hot Honey Sauce, and the Boggey Bomb, meat lovers style with local bacon jam.\n\nDiners can watch the axe throwing activities from “Almost Heaven,” a special mezzanine that overlooks the rest of the venue.

This will benefit the neighborhood. We’ll clean the streets and parking lanes – everything from dirt and leaves to litter to oil drippings.”\n\nThe weekend work will occur July 17-18 on north-south streets and on July 24-25 on streets running east-west in the Fort Sanders area.\n\nTraffic is expected to continue to flow on the affected streets during the project. However, temporary short-term closures may occur as needed due to safety protocols. During the project dates and times, parking will not be allowed, and towing will be enforced on the affected streets.\n\nNorth of Cumberland Avenue, the north-south streets included in the project are those between Cumberland Avenue and Grand Avenue, including 12th through 23rd streets and including James Agee Street.\n\nEast-west streets are those parallel to Cumberland Avenue from White Avenue to Grand Avenue, including Clinch, Laurel, Bridge, Highland and Forest avenues, and on Grand Avenue between 11th and 23rd streets.\n\nSouth of Cumberland Avenue to Lake Avenue, a smaller but similar area is being cleaned, between Volunteer Boulevard and Melrose Place.\n\nBoth weekends’ project hours will begin Saturday at 6 a.m. and will end Sunday at 6 p.m.\n\nTemporary no-parking signs will be posted at least 48 hours in advance of the street maintenance work.\n\nAttached are maps showing the affected streets and the dates when they will be cleaned.\n\nCity celebrates $4.8 million grant for additional electric buses\n\nThe City of Knoxville has been awarded a $4.8 million federal grant for additional electric transit buses.\n\nThe Low and No Emission Vehicle Grant Program supports transit agencies in purchasing or leasing low- or no-emission buses and other transit vehicles that use advanced technologies to provide cleaner, more energy efficient transit service in communities across the country.\n\n“This will go a long way in helping KAT transition to an all-electric fleet,” Mayor Indya Kincannon said. “With each new electric bus, we are reducing our carbon footprint. We are moving closer toward our goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions associated with City operations by 50 percent by 2030 – and a communitywide reduction of 80 percent by 2050.”\n\nAs KAT's oldest diesel buses age, they are being replaced with state-of-the-art electric buses that, according to the Argonne National Laboratory, are about three times more fuel-efficient than a standard diesel bus (13 MPGDE vs. 4.4 MPG).\n\nKnoxville Area Transit plans to use these federal funds, coupled with some local dollars, to add six additional electric buses to its fleet. This means the City could have 18 electric buses on area routes by the end of 2022.\n\n“We are so grateful for this opportunity to improve our fleet and help meet the City's sustainability goals with this continuing transition to all electric vehicles,” said Isaac Thorne, the City’s Director of Transit. “Our KAT passengers are excited about this move to all-electric, and so are we.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Bill Hagerty and Rep. Tim Burchett supported the City’s application for this grant.\n\n“Knoxville Area Transit provides an important service for folks in Knoxville, which is why earlier this year I asked the Federal Transit Administration to give KAT’s Low-No application grant full consideration,” Rep. Burchett said. “I’m glad this grant was awarded to our community so KAT can modernize its fleet to be more efficient and environmentally friendly.”\n\nKAT's goal is to have the entire 71-bus fleet running on electricity in about eight years.\n\nFor more information on the Low and No Emission Vehicle Grant program, visit www.transit.dot.gov/lowno.\n\nFood City continues to grow and expand hiring 1,200 new associates\n\nFood City is proud to have celebrated the opening of several new store locations and store expansions this year, along with the continued growth of their GoCart curbside pick-up and in-store food service options, such as to-go meals.

Based in Knoxville, Tennessee, Three Roots will use these funds to make loans and investments across East Tennessee and greater Central Appalachia, helping support job-creating small businesses, place-making commercial real estate projects and community facilities.\n\nIn total, the U.S. Treasury awarded $1.25 billion to 863 community development financial institutions (CDFIs) in 48 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. These CDFI RRP grant funds will help recipients build capital reserves and loan-loss reserves, along with providing financial products, financial services, development services and other operational activities in their communities. Three Roots received the maximum award amount given and will use the capital to increase the size of the Three Roots Capital Impact Fund, which is a pool of capital from which it will make equity investments in addition to loans.\n\nThree Roots has a history of providing access to capital for small businesses, entrepreneurs, and projects in rural or low-income areas of East Tennessee and Kentucky. Since its founding in 2016, the CDFI has deployed over $74.5 million of capital, which has created or retained 1,564 jobs and developed 528,732 square feet of real estate. With Three Roots’ support and guidance, small businesses like Southeastern Packaging Technologies have thrived in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and rural, job-creating companies have continued to have positive impacts in their communities like Outdoor Venture Corporation in McCreary County, Kentucky.\n\n“I founded Three Roots in direct response to the chronic need for more investment capital in central and southern Appalachia and in the broader Southeast. This award allows us to continue to support small businesses and entrepreneurs in low-income and economically disadvantaged communities throughout the region,” said Three Roots Capital Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer Grady Vanderhoofven. “CDFIs play an integral role in helping to lift economies, especially in times of need like this pandemic. We are honored to receive the maximum amount of this CDFI RRP award. Receiving these funds helps us continue to do what we do best: providing capital, connections, business coaching and collaboration in our region.”\n\nThree Roots anticipates the CDFI RRP funds could be used to help address an access to capital gap identified by Techstars in their Assessment of the Entrepreneurship Ecosystem of the Greater Knoxville Metropolitan Area. Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the University of Tennessee recently announced the upcoming launch of a Techstars Industries of the Future Accelerator in Oak Ridge-Knoxville, which will foster the growth of 30 startups over three years.\n\nAbout Three Roots Capital\n\nThree Roots Capital (Three Roots) is certified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) and as a Community Development Entity (CDE). Because Three Roots is a CDFI, banks that make loans to, grants to, or investments in Three Roots may be eligible to receive Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) credit. Three Roots maintains its CDFI certification by making loans and/or investments to companies and projects located in low and moderate income (LMI) census tracts and by providing operational and technical assistance to companies and projects located in such areas. As a CDE, Three Roots is eligible to receive an allocation of federal New Markets Tax Credits (NMTCs) and to participate in and facilitate NMTC transactions.\n\nGreen Llama introduces new line of plastic-free, eco-friendly household cleaners\n\nJOHNSON CITY, TN—June 3, 2021--Green Llama, LLC, a startup out of Johnson City, TN, is on a mission to reduce single-use plastic and carbon emissions with effective, non-toxic cleaners. The company launched online sales on May 1, 2021.\n\nThe difference in Green Llama is in its form. Instead of selling cleaners in a plastic bottle, the company provides all-purpose, glass, and bathroom cleaners in pod form. Simply drop the pod in a spray bottle and add water from the tap. The ingredients are biodegradable, non-toxic and naturally occurring or naturally derived. They are scented with essential oils for a touch of aromatherapy. It’s a truly eco-friendly cleaner that eliminates the need to purchase more throw-away plastic bottles.\n\nThe idea for Green Llama was born more than a year ago when Kay Baker, an occupational therapist, was cleaning her home. Baker was tired of buying new plastic bottles every time she ran out of cleaner; a light went on. After a lot of research, testing and many different recipes, she created the formulas for Green Llama.\n\n“I am passionate about the environment and reducing waste,” Baker said. “I love our products because they make it simple to cut out plastic in the home.”\n\nPlastic pollution is a worldwide problem with an estimated 46,000 pieces of floating plastic per square mile of our oceans. This wreaks havoc with an estimated 1 million sea bird and 100,00 marine mammal deaths annually directly from plastic. With increased awareness, individuals can make a big difference, starting in their homes.\n\n“We are trying to reduce the amount of single use plastic while also decreasing the energy cost of shipping water around the country,” Baker explained. “Each ready-made cleaner you buy from the store is more than 90% water. Since you already have water in your home, I removed it.”\n\nGreen Llama estimates if each household in the United States bought one single pod instead of a single-use plastic bottle, we would save 128 million plastic spray bottles from the landfill.\n\nGreen Llama currently sells kitchen, bathroom and all-purpose cleaning pods; sample packs are also available. The company also sells reusable glass bottles for those who have already recycled their plastic bottles.\n\nTo learn more or to purchase, visit greenllamaclean.com.\n\nKindred Healthcare, Tennova Healthcare and UT Medical Center announce opening of Knoxville Rehabilitation Hospital\n\nKNOXVILLE, TN (June 22, 2021) – Kindred Healthcare, Tennova Healthcare and The University of Tennessee Medical Center (UTMC) today announced the opening of Knoxville Rehabilitation Hospital, located in the new Tennova Health Park at 1250 Tennova Medical Way.\n\nThe new 57-bed hospital, with all private rooms, will focus on acute rehabilitation for patients who suffer from stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, complex neurological disorders, orthopedic conditions, multiple trauma, amputation and other injuries or disorders.

This initiative reinforces our mission with our focus on excellence in quality, service and access,” states Tony Benton, Tennova East Market Chief Executive Officer. “Through this joint venture, we are now able to better serve this population with advanced therapies and resources to help them regain quality of life. It has been an honor to work alongside Kindred and The University of Tennessee Medical Center. We are excited to see the continued growth at this location.”\n\n“It is truly rare and unique when competitors can come together to create a collaborative solution that better serves the needs of our patients and the East Tennessee community,” said Joe Landsman, president and chief executive officer of UTMC. “Our patients will directly benefit from this enhanced coordinated delivery of the high-quality, efficient healthcare services throughout the care continuum from when they first enter our system at our medical center through their rehabilitation at Knoxville Rehabilitation Hospital and throughout their recovery.”\n\nKnoxville Rehabilitation Hospital expects to serve more than 1,200 patients each year. The average length of stay for patients is approximately two weeks.

The 1920s-era building, originally a car dealership, is now a state-of-the-art logistics headquarters from which the movement of goods is coordinated across the U.S. as well as in Canada and Mexico.\n\n“The new facility has helped our team with renewed energy,” said Axle cofounder Jon Clay. “Just as importantly, it has helped us recruit. We’ve added 70 new positions already this year.”\n\nCofounder Drew Johnson put it this way: “The new space and the amenities it offers us creates the proper setting for our growing team. It fits our culture perfectly”\n\nThe project was given a 15-year payment in lieu of taxes incentive, commonly called a PILOT from both the City of Knoxville and Knox County. It was also approved by the Industrial Development Board.\n\n\"We appreciate Axle Logistics selecting Knoxville, creating jobs here, and adding to the vibrancy of our city and our neighborhoods,\" Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon said. \"It's an added bonus that Axle shares our love of historic places and has brought back into reuse a century-old building that has long sat vacant.\"\n\n“Knox County is a great place to live, work, and raise a family,” said Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs. “Axle Logistics saw that when they chose to open their new headquarters here and I know they will help us prove that to the many qualified logistics students graduating from the state’s flagship university. I hope their success and growth continue.”\n\nWith an eye to the future, Axle has already purchased an adjoining building.\n\nAxle Logistics is a growing Knoxville company with a focus on providing safe, reliable, advanced logistics services.

The “balancing act” between continuous growth, high-quality care, cost containment, and streamlining operations is a daunting task. In the midst of these challenges, many health systems, physician practices, and other providers overlook the significant potential for strategic and financial opportunities that lie within their real estate portfolios.\n\nReal estate continues to be, and will always be, a critical component in the delivery of healthcare. With most healthcare providers owning or leasing hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of square feet of real estate, it comes as no surprise that real estate and facilities typically equate to one of the largest assets on the balance sheet and one of the largest expenses on the income statement. Transitioning from the tactical, day-to-day operational approach to real estate property management, to a more holistic approach rooted in organizational strategy can empower healthcare leaders to utilize a more strategic, business-minded approach to leverage real estate to achieve broader strategic objectives.\n\nWhile traditional healthcare property management functions like maintenance and work orders, vendor coordination, and building rules and regulations, are certainly imperative to the successful management of a healthcare facility, they are often tactically focused without consideration of bigger picture strategic and operational considerations across the overall portfolio of properties. Expanding to an all-encompassing portfolio management approach to assess strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats offers a competitive advantage in a versatile environment to those who capitalize on critical operational and strategic opportunities related to real estate.\n\nThere are a number of key elements in effective portfolio management including strategic alignment, portfolio tracking and reporting, relationship management, enterprise facility management, and regulatory compliance.

As the number of Americans living with Alzheimer’s increases, so does the need for healthcare providers, caregivers, research and education.\n\nTMDF will seek to aid in meeting those challenges.\n\n“First, TMDF will train and mentor students, healthcare professionals, and community advocates to become future providers and leaders in memory disorder care,” said Cheryl Rice, President of the TMDF board of directors. “Second, the non-profit will promote health through raising awareness of the need for research and participation in research trials designed to shed light on these devastating diseases that disproportionally affect older Americans. In addition, TMDF – through its charitable clinic – Genesis Neuroscience Clinic, will provide direct patient care on a sliding fee basis.”\n\nAccording to Crane, TMDF will use its donations to compensate interns while promoting the non-profit’s mission into every step and decision made regarding the mentoring program.\n\n“Genesis Neuroscience Clinic’s mentoring program allows a diverse group of undergraduates a direct pathway into medical school,” said Crane. “The clinic gives opportunities by providing these paid leadership roles with the goal of giving students the best hands-on clinical experience they can have in addition to guidance on how to apply and be admitted into medical school.”\n\nTo donate to TMDF, visit tmdf.org/donate/ or mail to 1400 Dowell Springs Blvd #340, Knoxville, Tenn., 37909.\n\nETMAC, Knoxville Chamber release 2021 Military Economic Impact Report\n\nThe Knoxville area’s military installations and activities generate an estimated $2.98 billion in economic impact each year, according to a study conducted by the East Tennessee Military Affairs Council (ETMAC), in cooperation with the Knoxville Chamber. Data for this study was collected in 2019 and updates the previous study completed in 2017 which showed an impact of $1.8 billion.\n\nThe study calculated the monetary impact of the active duty, guard, and reserve components of the US Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The study takes into account the annual payroll of active duty, guard, reserve, and civilian personnel, expenditures for construction, supplies, services and materials, indirect jobs resulting from military personnel and military contracts given to area businesses and other factors like retirees’ pay and veterans’ benefits.\n\n“ETMAC completes this economic analysis to provide business and civic leaders a discernable look at the significant contribution that the military and defense programs make to the economy of East Tennessee,” said BG Geoff Freeman, US Army, retired, and President of ETMAC. “Because the military is one of the major drivers of economic activity in our area, in terms of direct and indirect jobs, supplies and services, and costs to maintain, train and operate facilities, our hope is that business and civic leaders will consider policies and actions that support and help retain this valuable resource in East Tennessee.”\n\nThe economic impact – measured for the year Fiscal Year 2019 is as follows:\n\nVeteran’s Benefits: $816,460,118 million\n\nActive Duty/Guard/Reserves: $327,057,646 million\n\nDept. of Defense Contracts: $1,378,009,000 billion\n\nMilitary Retirees: $458,373,672 million\n\nTotal: $2.98 billion\n\nThe analysis uses the U.S. Department of Defense methodology to measure activity within 50 miles of Knoxville. The largest installations from an economic standpoint were the McGhee Tyson Tennessee Air National Guard Base and the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment, TN Army National Guard. Also, more than 9,000 + military retirees live within the 50-mile radius. Several organizations rank Tennessee in the “top ten” most desirable places for military retirees, based on such factors as: the state's cost of living, taxes imposed by the state, city, and county, the availability of a military base and veterans administration facilities, primary care facilities, dentists, shopping stores, banking services, senior citizen services, as well as having a variety of recreational activities.\n\n“It is always important to recognize and honor the contributions of our local military units,” said Freeman. “We hope this report will encourage local businesses to take special care of the many men and women who serve our country, and recognize how important they are to our national defense, as well as our local economy.”\n\nGovernor Lee, Commissioner Rolfe announce Flex-N-Gate to expand Blount County operations\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. – Tennessee Gov.

The 35-year-old, who is based in Sydney, made the decision to leave her job at the consultancy EY last August.\n\nTwo years since Covid-19 disrupted lives around the planet, the United States doesn’t have a monopoly on the factors driving “The Great Resignation.” Dissatisfaction with working conditions, uninspiring jobs and bad bosses has gone global, as has a desire to seek out a better deal from companies short on staff.\n\nThe data for other markets often lags. But the latest figures now show that resignations have jumped in the United Kingdom, Australia and France, too. And while experts say a wave of quitting hasn’t materialized in countries like Germany and Singapore, surveys indicate workers there are also eying the exits.\n\nA December survey by jobs site Indeed of roughly 1,000 workers in Singapore found that almost half of respondents were unsure if they’d stay in their current positions over the next six months. Nearly a quarter intended to leave their employer in the first half of this year. LinkedIn data for January showed a notable increase in the number of workers switching industries in Spain, the Netherlands and Italy compared to early 2021.\n\nAnd in a study of workers commissioned by messaging company Slack, which covers Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Japan and France, openness to looking for a new job has ticked up every quarter since June.\n\nPeople walk through the lobby of an office building in London in June 2021. Hollie Adams/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“It’s this recalibration that people have had where they’re rethinking the role of work in their lives,” said Brian Elliott, a senior vice president at Slack who heads up the Future Forum initiative. “They’re rethinking — not only in terms of things like compensation — but also, clearly, things like flexibility, purpose, balance.”\n\nWhere’s the wave?\n\nAnthony Klotz, a professor of business administration at Texas A&M University who’s credited with coining the phrase “The Great Resignation,” identified trends in late 2020 that he thought could catalyze a transformation of the US labor market.\n\nThere was a backlog of people who wanted to leave their jobs, since people largely stayed put during the initial phase of the pandemic. Reports of burnout were widespread. People were asking big questions about the purpose of life while sitting on large piles of savings. And there was the potential for friction as those who had been working remotely and now prioritized flexibility were called back into the office.\n\nThe theory was spot on: In 2021, 47.8 million workers in the United States left their jobs voluntarily, the highest number since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started tracking full-year data in 2001. The number of quitters remained elevated in January and February of this year.\n\nIn some cases, people left the labor market to care for children or elderly relatives. Shortages of workers in industries like retail and hospitality boosted demand for labor, encouraging people to leverage a competitive market for a role with better benefits or pay. People in desk jobs, who were tired of long pandemic hours and Zoom meetings, started to decide they’d had enough.\n\n“I was wearing way too many hats for one person,” said Bobbi Conclin, who quit her job in purchasing and sales at Cintas last month. The 25-year-old, who is based in New Jersey, said she was burned out from working 10- to 12-hour days, and started a new role at an e-commerce company days later.\n\nThe factors Klotz identified aren’t exclusive to the United States. But debate has been heated over whether the Great Resignation has arrived in other job markets.\n\nMorning commuters in the business district of Singapore in February 2022. Lauryn Ishak/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“We are seeing a ‘Great Reshuffle’ rather than a ‘Great Resignation,’” Josh Frydenberg, Australia’s treasurer, said in a speech last month.\n\nIn a Facebook post earlier this year, Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower said that despite “speculation that Singapore could see a similar ‘Great Resignation’ wave,” its “statistics show otherwise.” The country’s resignation rate was 1.7% at the end of last year, slightly below pre-Covid levels. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has emphasized that EU countries are not “experiencing anything like The Great Resignation.”\n\nIn Europe, many governments made extensive use of short-time work programs, which encouraged struggling companies to retain tens of millions of employees but reduce their working hours. The state then subsidized a portion of their pay. This differed from the approach in the United States, where workers received benefits after they were fired or were mailed stimulus checks that padded their savings regardless of employment status — and may have helped reduce turnover.\n\n“Across Europe, for the most part, people stayed with the employers they had,” said Guillaume Menuet, the head of investment strategy and economics for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Citi Private Bank.\n\nBut there have been signs of churn. In France, the number of resignations during the third quarter of 2021, the most recent data available, was the highest on records dating back to 2007.\n\nAustralia’s government said last month that 1 million workers began new roles in the three months to November 2021. The rate of job switching is almost 10% above the pre-pandemic average.\n\nAnd in the United Kingdom, the rate of employed people aged 16 to 64 moving from job-to-job was at an all-time high of 3.2% between October and December.\n\nYet Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, thinks claims that the Great Resignation has crossed the Atlantic are overdone, noting this rate is only slightly higher than it was in the early 2000s.\n\nDiscontent is growing\n\nIt’s clear Americans aren’t the only ones thinking differently about work.\n\nJoan Pons Laplana, a 47-year-old in Sheffield, England, quit his job as a senior nurse in the National Health Service nearly a year ago. He’s now working as a teacher, training people from disadvantaged backgrounds so they can find jobs in the NHS.\n\nLaplana said he felt guilty leaving a profession he loved at a time when hospitals were facing a huge shortage of resources. But when he was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder after working in intensive care during the first two Covid waves, he knew it was a decision he had to make to preserve his mental health.\n\nJoan Pons Laplana, who lives in Sheffield, England, quit his job as a senior nurse in the National Health Service in April 2021. Joan Pons Laplana\n\n“The idea of your mortality — that you could be next — was very present,” he said. On top of that, he was often the only person to care for dying patients and communicate with their grieving families. “Day by day, it had a toll.”\n\nThibault Prat, a 28-year-old in Paris, France, has given notice and is leaving his job buying and selling electricity in May after almost five years. He said he’s been working long hours, especially as the price of electricity has soared.\n\nHe also became frustrated that he wasn’t producing anything in his job, and didn’t want to plug numbers into Excel spreadsheets as society struggled with issues like the pandemic and the climate crisis.\n\n“There was a growing gap between my beliefs and my job that I couldn’t live with any more,” he said.\n\nPrat said he plans to take a few months off before looking for a job in another part of the industry such as the nuclear sector.\n\nSurveys of workers indicate that Prat won’t be alone in evaluating his options. The Future Forum report published in January found that 53% of workers in France and 55% in Germany and Japan are open to looking for new jobs in the next year. That number rises to 64% in Australia and 60% in the United Kingdom.\n\nChange on the horizon?\n\nThis willingness to seek out new opportunities comes as job openings remain elevated, and employers in a number of industries are willing to pay more to recruit workers. In the United Kingdom, where a reformation of the labor market related to Brexit is also unfolding, there are now 4.4 vacancies for every 100 jobs — an all-time high.\n\n“With such a big talent shortage in the UK right now, people are fairly confident and prepared to move jobs,” said Mark Cahill, UK and Ireland managing director of the staffing firm ManpowerGroup.\n\nSingapore’s Ministry of Manpower also indicated that it’s bracing for more resignations in the coming months.\n\n“In sectors with lower-paying jobs, people could move out due to better opportunities. In growth sectors where there is strong demand for labor, recruitment and resignation rates will be expectedly higher,” the agency said in January.\n\nIn Australia, the government said workers who moved jobs typically got pay bumps of between 8% and 10%.\n\nMariano Mamertino, senior economist for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at LinkedIn, said the labor market in Europe is also expected to get stronger this year, which could give more people the opportunity to change roles. About 58% of Europeans say they’re considering changing jobs this year, according to a LinkedIn survey of approximately 9,000 workers — though it was completed before Russia invaded Ukraine, which economists have warned could push the region into a recession.\n\nCommuters wait on the platform at Auber RER train station in the financial district in Paris in January 2022. Nathan Laine/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“When the labor market gets really tight, it’s when there’s more opportunity available,” said Mamertino.\n\nIn professions like nursing, especially, there are signs that burnout is reaching unsustainable levels. A survey of more than 9,500 nurses by the UK’s Royal College of Nursing published late last year found that 57% of respondents were thinking about leaving their jobs or actively planning to leave. The top reasons given were feeling undervalued and feeling exhausted.\n\nMing Buckley, the Sydney-based worker who left EY — one of the “Big 4” accounting firms — said mental health also played a big role in her decision to depart.\n\n“I just started to feel like I was part of a big machine,” she said. “I never saw myself as someone who would be part of the race to climb the corporate ladder.”\n\nShe took a few months off and recently started interviewing. This time, she’s looking for a part-time role at a nonprofit — something that aligns more closely with her values, and will allow her to launch a coaching and mentoring business on the side. It’s an epiphany — helped along by the pandemic.\n\n“I don’t think people woke up one day and were super unhappy with their jobs,” Ming Buckley said. “I think it’s been building for years and years and years.”", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/03/12/coronavirus-vermont-live-updates-cases-closures-covid-19/5023835002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Vermont: Latest news and impact", "text": "Free Press Staff\n\nAs the situation surrounding the COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus continues to evolve in Vermont, here are updates and information.

As a result, grand list increases were less than initially estimated.\n\nThe new rate is set to $0.2750, meaning that for every $100,000 in property value, municipal taxes will be $275, the town said. The deadline for the first property tax payment has been postponed from Aug. 15 until Sept 15.

Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15.

The airport has added thermal imaging that can pick up abnormally high body temperatures, indicating a fever, in groups of up to 20 people. Richards said if someone is “running warm” a red square shows up on her image rather than a green square.\n\nRichards explained that a person who possibly has a fever is notified and advised to check with a physician, but no further steps are taken. “We don’t want to get into people’s personal business at this point,” Richards said. “It’s very voluntary.”\n\nRichards said about 4,000 people are passing through the airport weekly, up from a low of 800 at the start of the pandemic. Normally, Burlington International Airport would be seeing as many as 17,000 people passing through weekly at this time of year, before the coronavirus struck the nation.\n\nThursday, July 9, 2020\n\nThe Vermont Cheesemakers Festival announced it is canceling the 12th annual event planned for Sunday, Aug. 9 at Shelburne Farms.\n\n\"We have been pondering what to do – postpone the festival, offer alternative events, etc. – and found is that there really is no alternative to the festival given the current conditions and our interest in keeping both our vendors’ and attendees’ safety prioritized,\" reads a note on the festival's website.\n\nThe Vermont Cheese Council, which plans the event, has had to focus in recent months \"trying to help cheesemakers keep their doors open, helping them find grant and other emergency funds, redirecting and identifying new sales strategies to try to make up for the 25-75% losses most of them have experienced, helping them navigate the changing regulations related to operating within our industry at this time, and marketing their products as widely as possible,\" according to the website.\n\n_________\n\nVermont Humanities and the Vermont Arts Council have wrapped up their Cultural Relief Grant Program that distributed nearly $750,000 in emergency relief grants to 122 Vermont cultural organizations, including museums, libraries, performing-arts venues and other cultural centers, the council announced in a news release.\n\nThe program, which concluded May 31, supported humanities and arts organizations struggling to survive through resulting economic fallout from the pandemic.

Phil Scott this week to write letters to bar owners in the state to remind them of COVID-19 compliance rules.\n\nThis comes after four Burlington bars received written warnings accusing them of breaking rules put in place through an executive order signed by Scott. These rules were set to ensure health and safety within bars during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nScott's letter also informs bar owners that the Department of Liquor and Lottery would be conducting compliance checks to ensure they are following the rules, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a news conference Wednesday.\n\nWeinberger has expressed concern about these violations, saying that COVID-19 transmission can easily occur in bars. He said the guidelines are restrictive, but they must be followed to ensure patrons' safety.\n\n\"I want to be clear: these are important businesses for Burlington,\" Weinberger said. \"They've been an important part of Burlington's economic successes, they're a part of the vibrancy of Burlington.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday. It is unclear whether the inmate was in contact with others in the general population. Health Department officials are conducting contact tracing.\n\nCorrections officials have been testing inmates for COVID-19 upon intake to facilities throughout the state, Smith said. All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159. No additional deaths were reported, which keeps the state's total at 56.\n\nThere are no people hospitalized with the disease but 11 are currently under investigation. An additional 817 people have been tested statewide, bringing the total to 57,845.\n\nThe number of people being monitored for symptoms stands at 1,018 and the number who have completed monitoring is 1,209.

The grant comes from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. COVID-19 has disrupted many services of support and recovery for Vermonters struggling with mental health issues and substance abuse.\n\n________\n\nStarting tomorrow, June 19, Vermont will begin the opening of long-term care facilities, according to the Vermont Department of Health. These facilities can allow two guests per resident per day, so long as those visits occur outside and follow social distancing protocols.\n\nVermonters over 65 will no longer be required to stay home. The Health Commissioner suggests that those individuals do continue to take safety precautions if they choose to leave their homes.\n\n________\n\nOne new death related to COVID-19 was reported Thursday by the Vermont Department of Health. The state's total fatalities related to the coronavirus now stand at 56.\n\nSix new cases of the disease were reported in the department's mid-morning update, for a cumulative total of 1,135. Three of the cases are in Chittenden County. Addison, Bennington and Rutland counties each had one new case.\n\nStatewide, about 917 people have recovered from the virus and 54,745 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are hospitalized for the disease, the department said; nine people are hospitalized and under investigation as possible cases.\n\n________\n\nU.S. and state flags will be lowered to half-staff on Friday at all state facilities as part of a monthly observance of Vermonters who have died due to COVID-19, Governor Phil Scott announced.\n\nVermont's first fatality from the new coronavirus took place March 19, 2020. A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed.

All tests came back negative for the virus.\n\nThe Springfield-based prison was the sixth and final facility to undergo mass testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only facility to have inmates test positive for the virus since it was first detected among members of the prison population, the Corrections Department said.\n\n__________\n\nWednesday, June 10, 2020\n\nA total of 74 cases of COVID-19 are thought to be associated with the recent outbreak that emerged in Winooski, according to Vermont Department of Health data from Tuesday evening.\n\nAbout 80% of those cases are in Winooski and most of the rest are in Burlington, the Health Department said. Only one in five people associated with the outbreak are reporting symptoms — the number of asymptomatic individuals is thought to be a contributing factor to the spread of the virus in the community.\n\nThere have been no deaths associated with the outbreak, the state reported.\n\n__________\n\nGuidance is underway to prepare Vermont schools across the state to tentatively open by Labor Day, announced Gov. Phil Scott in a press briefing Wednesday.\n\nHealth and safety measures for school districts are being developed by the state's Agency of Education and the Health Department, in collaboration with other Vermont educational organizations and pediatricians, and will be formally announced by next week.\n\n\"it's critical we finalize a plan now so we can reopen in the fall,\" said Scott.\n\nAmong the objectives of the guidance is to decrease the risk of COVID-19 entering school, being transmitted between staff and students, and ensuring students with certain needs are \"addressed in a fair and equitable measure\".\n\nProvisions could include social distancing on busses, daily temperature screenings at bus stops and school entrances, increased testing and tracing capacity, and mandatory dismissals if students or staff display any symptoms.\n\n\"It's likely we'll have to change or amend this guidance in the coming months,\" said Dan French, secretary of the Agency of Education.\n\n\"We're also preparing to improve our ability to provide remote learning as a contingency.\"\n\n__________\n\nRegistration is open for Vermonters seeking meals from distribution sites across the state this month.\n\nPick up sites are scheduled on these days in these areas , with more sites to be added for the remainder of June:\n\nMiddlebury area: June 10\n\nBrattleboro area: June 11\n\nMorristown area: June 12\n\nLyndon area: June 15\n\nGrand Isle County: June 16\n\nRandolph area: June 17\n\nDover area: June 18\n\nChittenden County: June 19\n\nPeople can register online at humanresources.vermont.gov/food-help or over the phone via 2-1-1.

Here are seven of those ideas, along with accompanying analysis from experts, lawmakers and state agencies about their potential feasibility:\n\nAllow more families to receive state child care subsidies\n\nChristie Mahl, Acorn Child Development Center\n\nProvider, Lapeer\n\nChristie Mahl’s day care has a waiting list of more than 100 children. Those long lists are not uncommon in Michigan, particularly with centers like hers, which has a 5-star rating from Great Start to Quality, Michigan’s rating and improvement system for day cares. Hers is the only 5-star center in 90,000-person Lapeer County.\n\nAt $46 a day, Mahl’s day care is markedly cheaper than comparable centers in urban areas, which can charge up to $70. Some parents don’t pay anything if their income level is low enough to qualify for a state child care subsidy. But many of her parents make too much to qualify. These “borderline” families pay for child care out of necessity, even if it takes a bite out of their annual budget.\n\n“Imagine making $50,000 and having to pay $1,000 a month,” Mahl said. “It’s a hardship.”\n\nTemporarily increasing the subsidy income brackets was one of the first pandemic relief measures deployed by the state, which pushed the subsidy qualification from 150% to 185% of Michigan’s poverty line.\n\nBut the success of that effort has been mixed, according to researchers from the University of Michigan. They have found fewer applications for the subsidy despite more families becoming eligible — likely because of a lack of available spots at day cares statewide.\n\n“There were over 100,000 more families that became eligible for the subsidy as a result of increased funding for the program, but we really didn’t see pickup rates improve to a great extent,” said Karen Kling, strategic projects manager with University of Michigan’s Poverty Solutions program. “They were pushing families toward spots that didn’t exist.”\n\nMahl also suggested instituting a new tier of center for 18-children facilities. Currently, the state licenses six- and 12-children facilities and much larger centers for dozens of children, but nothing in between. Zoning requirements could also be relaxed. Currently, she’s unable to expand her center without a commercial zoning variance from her county.\n\nProvide options for flexible, at-work child care\n\nHillary Rose\n\nParent, Carleton\n\n15 months into parenthood, Hillary Rose is already on her 10th nanny. When her child was born, the two day cares in her area were full. Nannies and babysitters have cost her about $1,200 a month, she estimates, but she pays it because it gives her precious hours of breathing room to focus at her job.\n\n“I do feel like it’s kind of a requirement if I want to continue to work,” Rose said.\n\nRose teaches U.S. history at a virtual school, which she can do remotely, but not with a toddler on her lap. The nannying solution isn’t perfect either: She’s often searching through Care.com, a networking site for services, in search of affordable babysitters. She said the more qualified sitters can charge $25 an hour, which is more than she makes teaching. More realistic options for her have been high school graduates without qualifications, but who occasionally fail to show when she needs them most.\n\nRecently, Rose has toyed with the idea of opening a drop-in care center for remote working parents. She describes it as a kind of child care WeWork, where parents who just need a few hours of time at a desk each day could easily switch between work and care. She thinks parents need more flexible options, given the popularity of working from home. It’s an idea born from the immense challenge of balancing a full-time job and raising a kid.\n\n“I really wasn’t expecting it to be this difficult,” Rose said.\n\nThe principal roadblock to Rose’s idea is Michigan’s long history of strict zoning regulations for child care facilities. Legislation passed in June loosened some of those zoning requirements, opening the door for child care facilities in commercial-use zones.\n\nFactor outstanding debts into child care subsidies\n\nMonica Rosen\n\nParent, Mount Pleasant\n\nMonica Rosen feels like she made all the right choices: She went to college, got a good job at the University of Michigan, bought a house and had a family. But lately, she feels like she’s being crushed, she said, as she stares down the prospect of paying nearly $19,000 a year for a slot at the university’s Towsely Children’s House day care.\n\n“I don’t qualify for the grants they offer because you have to be in poverty, but they don’t count my student loans and other financial considerations when calculating who gets grant money,” Rosen said. “I feel like once I pay for preschool, I am now in poverty.”\n\nRed tape around the subsidies often hindered their use, said William Lopez, assistant professor at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health. Qualifying requires parents to prove that they are working. Parents also must regularly reapply, as well as have their taxes in order − all of which contributes “to a very low proportion of children who are eligible receiving vouchers,” Lopez’s team found, according to forthcoming research they shared.\n\nProvide affordable health care for child care workers\n\nKaren Lumsden\n\nProvider, Troy\n\nIn 2020, Karen Lumsden’s child care center in Troy ate a $110,000 loss. Some of it was recouped by $70,000 in one-time grants from the state, but she’s only just recovering from the pandemic shutdowns. Her Montessori center, which is licensed for 70 kids, is still below its capacity mark by 20 children.\n\nStaffing challenges means she can’t open a third room and come fully online.\n\n“Had the grant money not come, I would be totally screwed,” Lumsden said. “It was a godsend.”\n\nWhat would further help Lumsden, she said, is an affordable health care option for her staff. Of eight employees, seven are on their spouses’ health care plans and the eighth pays heavily out of pocket for a policy via the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLumsden said day cares that offer health care have an easier time hiring. But she can’t offer it now because her business would dip into debt.\n\n“That’s just the reality,” Lumsden said. “They’re going into a business that can’t sustain them. If they had an insurance option for child care workers, ‘Whoa.’ Insurance would be such a boon.”\n\nCompanies could subsidize tuition to attract workers\n\nTea Shong\n\nProvider, Lenawee\n\nOn average, Tea Shong’s teachers stay on staff for just 18 months. Some find child care isn’t for them, while others love the work but decide to pursue higher pay in K-12 school systems, which offer benefits as well.\n\n“Some of our best employees move onto the K-12 system,” Shong said.\n\nShong thinks the state does enough to support parents and providers. Her teachers should make more, but she thinks that, in today’s economy, employers looking to attract workers should be footing more of the bill – offering child care pay as a benefit.\n\nIf that were more common, Shong would be able to charge more knowing that employers are splitting the bill with parents, and then be able to bump wages for her teachers. As it stands, her teachers make $12 to $14 an hour.\n\n“I believe more workplaces should offer child care support, like they offer insurance,” Shong said. “These teachers do some of the most important work and their pay does not reflect it.”\n\nThe Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, which regulates and investigates complaints about child care facilities, has found more than 9,000 child care staff vacancies across the state and is now letting some facilities apply for rule exemptions to hire younger staff who are finishing required coursework and are awaiting final certifications. A survey the agency sent out this spring found that staffing turnover affected a majority of facilities and ranked as the No. 1 factor affecting the number of available child care openings.\n\nAnd the No. 1 reason why Michigan child care facilities said they couldn’t attract new staff? Low wages and nonexistent benefits.\n\nHelp from the private sector is one of the flagship ideas implemented by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration. The program, known as Tri-Share, splits child care costs among an employer, employee and the state. But it only serves families that make between 200% and 325% of the federal poverty line — $34,840 to $60,970 for a single mother, for example — a population that isn’t served by the subsidy.\n\nIn a statement, Whitmer’s office said it is proud of the work of Michigan Tri-Share but, as of now, the program has enrolled just 57 children since its inception more than a year ago in June 2021.\n\nTri-Share reports cite a number of reasons for the program’s low uptake, including the number of child care deserts in Michigan.\n\nBuild a web portal for parents and providers\n\nLouise Stoney\n\nExpert, child care finance\n\nTo keep centers profitable, they need full enrollment. That’s why for years, Louise Stoney has argued that tech could provide answers for child care facilities across the country.\n\nWith an app, centers could give real-time enrollment numbers and post to a marketplace for anxious parents shopping for care. Instead of calling every center in their ZIP code, they could quickly see when and where openings come online, saving parents time and keeping providers' classrooms full.\n\n“We need to create some scale and stability so that they’re not just out there trying to do everything by themselves,” said Stoney, an independent consultant specializing in early care and education. “Technology is a big part of that.”\n\nIn Michigan, no such digital platform exists. The closest alternative is Care.com, a website that helps parents shop for caregivers.\n\nBetter software would also relieve child care providers of another headache: the amount of paperwork required by state regulators, such as attendance logs. And it would provide better child care data to the state, which currently relies on out-of-date and inaccurate licensing numbers.\n\nStoney said that real-time systems like these have already been deployed. Pilot programs exist in Colorado, where counties have invested in a platform called BridgeCare. Another platform, LegUp, offers similar real-time data sharing and operates in Wisconsin and several other states.\n\nCreate universal pre-K in Michigan\n\nState Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor\n\nFor Michigan state Rep. Yousef Rabhi, the problem is clear: Child care isn’t funded in the same way as the state’s K-12 public school system.\n\nRabhi’s solution would be to fold Michigan’s nearly 8,000 child care facilities into a statewide universal pre-kindergarten system. Rabhi thinks universal pre-K would stabilize the child care workforce by adding benefits, such as health care.\n\nIt would also remove the cost barrier for hundreds of thousands of Michigan parents with a free public system. Universal pre-K has already been implemented in Florida, Vermont, Oklahoma and the District of Columbia, as well as in more than 30 cities across the country.\n\n“This isn’t a far-fetched idea. It’s not like we’re doing something completely brand new,” Rabhi said. “It’s just that we arbitrarily cut the system off at kindergarten.”\n\nIn 2019, Whitmer said she wanted to achieve such a system by the end of her first term. And a bipartisan mood around child care reform has put universal pre-K on the table, Rabhi said, even if the price tag would be significant.\n\nUsing federal estimates, the annual market cost of a universal pre-K system for Michigan’s 3- and 4-year-olds comes out to $972 million per year — an estimate built using a $6,600 per capita figure used to vet President Joe Biden’s American Families Plan. That’s just for tuition, however.\n\nModeling experts at the Children’s Funding Project, a policy group that provides cost estimates to government bodies, said that a “true cost” – one which includes infrastructure investments and a living wage for workers – would likely double that estimate. “It would range somewhere from $14,000 or $15,000 to $18,000 to $20,000 for a preschooler,” said Kate Ritter, an adviser with the organization who specializes in finance and cost modeling.\n\nThe Children’s Funding Project has actually begun work modeling revenue for child care programs in Michigan. In the past, the group has provided states with memos identifying how states can find cash to pay for broader child care programs, such as by raising corporate income tax.\n\nReinvest in in-home centers\n\nState Rep. Jack O’Malley, R-Traverse City\n\nFor Michigan state Rep. Jack O’Malley, state involvement in child care has historically been the problem, rather than the solution. Before a recent changing of the guard at Michigan’s state licensing agency, small, in-home providers reported being harangued by licensing consultants.\n\nThese consultants would often write up small, mom-and-pop day cares for minor violations, and fed-up providers would call it quits, as O’Malley describes it.\n\nSimply put, safety concerns and a preoccupation with testing have pushed the state to overregulate and ask child care providers for too much documentation, O’Malley said.\n\n“When you are requiring that employees have certain levels of degrees — do we need that?” O’Malley said. “Are our center-based day cares becoming pre-kindergarten kindergarten? Are we now having them reading the classics?”\n\nFinancially, the argument for more in-home centers goes both ways.\n\nIn-home centers are more geographically and financially accessible, sometimes charging half as much as larger centers. But they can quickly become losing business propositions for their owners, who need a critical mass of children to be profitable.\n\nA survey sent out to child care providers this spring by the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs found that in-home facilities reported loss of income as the No. 2 impact of staffing shortages, just behind the inability to enroll more children. And in-home providers overwhelmingly supported the idea of reducing staff-to-child ratios, compared with larger child care centers, the survey found.\n\nIn June, O’Malley won passage of legislation increasing the ratio of children in-home centers could serve. One employee can now care for up to seven kids, up from six, and a two-employee center can now care for up to 14 kids, up from 12. (Some states, including Washington, allow one employee to care for up to 10 preschoolers, ages 30 months to 5 years old, while other states, such as Indiana, Louisiana and New Jersey, don’t even license in-home child care.)\n\nO’Malley said the bill has been met with “hurrays and cheers.”\n\nBut child care experts worry that such hands-off policies won’t fix much — and could endanger children. Linda Smith, executive director of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Early Childhood Initiative, a think tank in Washington, D.C, described the legislation as “looking for a quick fix.”\n\n“The answer is not just put a couple more kids in and that’ll fix anything,” Smith said. “It’ll only make it worse, because it’ll drive more staff out. We should not go down the road where we just relax the regs.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/local/2024/11/05/live-updates-texas-election-results-2024-austin-tx-travis-county-bastrop-hays-williamson/75846411007/", "title": "2024 Texas general election live updates: See unofficial results.", "text": "Election Day is finally here.

Unofficial results from Travis, Hays and Williamson counties show Watson has secured 50.01% of the vote — barely above the 50% threshold needed to win the five-way race outright.\n\nWhile that includes the vast majority of ballots cast, a spokesman for the Travis County Clerk said the office can accept military and overseas ballots through next week. Totals could also change during the certification process.\n\nIn case of a runoff, Watson would have to face off against the second-highest vote-getter, community organizer Carmen Llanes Pullido, who received 20.1% of the vote.\n\nDistrict 2\n\nAustin City Council incumbent Vanessa Fuentes, whose District 2 opponent did not actively campaign, secured a second term in a landslide on Tuesday, complete but unofficial results show.\n\nFuentes received 85.65% of the vote while her opponent, Robert Reynolds, received 14.35%, Travis County election results show.\n\nDistrict 4\n\nIncumbent City Council member José “Chito” Vela, who faced four challengers, won reelection Tuesday with 58.5% of the vote, according to the unofficial final results.\n\nThe most promising challenger, community organizer Monica Guzmán, came in second with 27.72% of the vote.\n\nDistrict 6\n\nKrista Laine is leading conservative incumbent District 6 City Council Member Mackenzie Kelly by around 2.5 percentage point, according to unofficial final results from Travis and Williamson counties. The final results have yet to be certified, and the clerk can accept overseas and military ballots until next week.\n\nDistrict 7\n\nCivil rights lawyers Mike Siegel and Gary Bledsoe are headed to a runoff to represent the north Austin district. District 7’s current representative, Leslie Pool, could not seek reelection because of the city’s term limits.\n\nSiegel won 39.83% of the vote and Bledsoe received 19.29% support, but, with four other candidates in the race, no candidate cleared the majority threshold needed to avoid a runoff. They will face off at the ballot box again on Dec. 14.\n\nDistrict 10\n\nBusiness owner Marc Duchen is barely leading the District 10 race with 50.62% of the vote.

The other $130 million will go to the state as part of a decades-old program called recapture. The program functions as a “Robin Hood,” taking tax revenue from districts that collect more than their state-determined need for education funding and redistributing it to those that collect less in revenue than their state-determined need.\n\nThe district has pledged to spend $17.8 million of the new revenue to raise salaries for teachers and other staff members, particularly for those who are mid- to advanced-career level. Another $3 million will go to hiring instructional aids and the rest will be used pay down the district’s deficit.\n\nSchool board races\n\nIn the District 2 school board race, LaRessa Quintana beat out Sarah Ivory with 60.9% of the 20,479 votes, according to complete but unofficial results.\n\nFernando Lucas de Urioste and Lindsey Stringer will face off in a runoff election for the District 8, at-large seat after no candidate won a majority but whittled down the six-person field of contenders.\n\nDe Urioste was the top vote-getter with almost 32.5% of the 200,412 votes cast, according to complete but unofficial results.\n\nStringer narrowly slid into the runoff with almost 26% of the votes, beating Amy Moore, who got 23.7%. The remaining candidates — Dylan “Sky” MacAdams, Nathaniel Hellman and Nick Franke — received 8.7%, 5.7% and 3.6% of the vote, respectively.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n1:55 a.m. update: Democrats fail to flip San Antonio seats in school voucher fight\n\nIn close and wildly expensive races, Republicans maintained control of two San Antonio seats that Democrats had sought to flip in the Texas House.\n\nIn a 52-48 victory, state Rep. John Lujan, a former sheriff's deputy and firefighter, won a third term representing House District 118. Lujan defeated Kristian Carranza, a Democratic legislative staffer who made abortion rights and public school funding central to her campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, criminal defense attorney Marc LaHood secured a 6 percentage point margin of victory against Laurel Jordan Swift for House District 121, according to the final but unofficial election results. He became the GOP nominee after Abbott helped him oust incumbent Rep. Steve Allison, R-San Antonio, in the primary. Allison, who encountered Abbott's wrath for opposing school vouchers, endorsed Swift.\n\nLaHood also took donations from the Texans for a United Conservative Majority, a political action committee funded by Christian nationalists Tim Dunn and Ferris Wilks.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n1:30 a.m. update: GOP nominee Adam Hinojosa ousts state Sen. Morgan LaMantia\n\nIn the only competitive race in the Texas Senate, Republican Adam Hinojosa ousted Democratic state Sen. Morgan LaMantia in District 27 in the Rio Grande Valley, according to the final but unofficial results.\n\n“The people of this district have rejected the woke absurdity of the left — open borders, boys playing girls sports, sex change operations, and fiscal insanity,\" Hinojosa said in a statement declaring victory just before midnight Tuesday.\n\n--Bayliss Wagner\n\n1:15 a.m. update: Voters pick ACC board trustees\n\nSherri Lynn Taylor has secured the Place 7 seat on the Austin Community College Board of Trustees, a seat left vacant by Barbara Mink, a founding member of the district and current board chair who is retiring after 24 years on the board, according to the complete but unofficial election results from eligible parts of the six counties who elect the seats at-large.\n\nTaylor came out ahead with 57.55% of the vote against ACC alum Cole Wilson, who has campaigned since January and secured endorsements from the Travis County Democratic Party, multiple council members and state senators. Taylor does not have a searchable campaign website or campaign email.\n\nIn the race for the Place 9 seat, incumbent Julie Ann Nitsch, another ACC alum who has served on the board since 2016 pushing for holistic student support and resources, was handily ahead of challenger Joseph Sefton, the newly retired ACC chief information officer who ran on a platform of adding a greater tech focused perspective to the board. Nitsch secured 70.6% of the votes, according to the unofficial results.\n\nIncumbent Stephanie Gharakhanian, an attorney who has held the seat since 2018, ran unopposed for the Place 8 seat.\n\nACC seats are elected at-large. Trustees are tasked with representing the district and meeting the community’s needs. Results are not official until the counties and ACC trustees certify them.\n\n-- Lily Kepner\n\n1:10 a.m. update: US Rep. Henry Cuellar reelected despite indictment\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a 20-year congressional veteran who is considered among the most conservative Democrats in the U.S. House, defeated Republican retired naval officer Jay Furman in a district anchored by the border city of Laredo in South Texas.\n\nCuellar, a proven vote-getter who was elected to the Texas House eight times before winning his first election to Congress in 2004, was made vulnerable after a federal indictment in May accused him and his wife of accepting $600,000 in bribes and money laundering.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges the money came from Azerbaijan’s state-operated oil and gas company. The Cuellars have insisted that they are innocent of the charges, but Furman had run late-campaign ads accusing Cuellar of using his office “to enrich himself and empower cartels.”\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n1 a.m. update: Travis County's Proposition A set to pass, final results show\n\nTravis County is poised to become the first county in Texas to help low-income families pay for childcare after voters showed overwhelming support for Proposition A on Tuesday.\n\nThe measure, which is set to pass with about 60% of the vote (provisional ballots still need to be counted), calls for a 2.5-cent property tax rate increase to cover the cost of early childhood, after-school and summer care for more than 9,000 children.\n\nProp A will cost the average county homeowner about $125 more per year in taxes and generate $75 million to fund the effort. It is expected to launch in late 2025 or early 2026, officials have said.\n\n-- Bianca Moreno-Paz\n\n12:15 a.m. update: Lockhart ISD voters approve ACC annexation\n\nVoters in the Lockhart school district approved joining the Austin Community College's taxing district Tuesday night, providing residents with in-district tuition and a path to a permanent ACC facility in the city, according to the final but unofficial election results.\n\nWith 24 of 24 precincts reporting, 61.21% of voters supported the annexation and an ad valorem tax, while 38.79% came out against the proposal.\n\nIn exchange for a property tax rate of $0.1012 per $100 of property valuation, the Lockhart school district will officially be part of the Riverbat community, with access to all educational resources and in-district tuition, including benefiting from ACC’s free tuition pilot program which launched this year.\n\nThe Austin, Del Valle, Elgin, Hays, Leander, Manor and Round Rock school districts are in-district.\n\nThe Greater Lockhart for ACC PAC said being annexed into the college district would provide the necessary accessible and affordable educational infrastructure to support the growing workforce opportunities in the region.\n\nThe last ACC annexation vote — of Pflugerville — failed in 2018. The last annexation proposal that passed before the Pflugerville vote was in 2010.\n\nThe results will not be official until they're certified by ACC board members at a Nov. 14 special meeting.\n\n-- Lily Kepner\n\n11:50 p.m. update: Some Travis County Democrats leave disillusioned with Election Day results\n\nAs the clock approached 11 p.m. and the crowds thinned at the Travis County Democratic watch party at the Driskill Hotel in downtown Austin, friends Heather Westmoreland, 47, and Monica Holland, 42, remained in a row of mostly empty chairs watching the MSNBC feed on a small television. The two had arrived together about 7:30 p.m. excited to join the cheering crowds. Their hopes for the night took their first blow when they saw how quickly incumbent Ted Cruz was declared the victor in his Texas U.S. Senate race against Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Colin Allred.\n\nThen, news networks declared Republican former President Donald Trump had won North Carolina. Their despair grew. The two watched the number of red seats in the U.S. House and Senate widgets on the corner of the TV screen grow and grow.\n\n“I’m honestly getting sick to my stomach. I’m getting flashbacks of the last time,” Westmoreland said as the two prepared to leave the watch party for the night. They were not optimistic.\n\nA transplant from Illinois six years ago and a Cedar Park resident, Westmoreland said she came into Election Day heavily focused on the loss of women’s reproductive protections. But as she sat through the night, she also found herself thinking: “Regardless of who wins, the biggest concern is what’s going to be of our country — with the civil unrest.”\n\nBoth women said they see “MAGA supporters” as verbally and physically threatening in their politically diverse neighborhoods of suburban Austin. Their unease with those they view as politically opposite has altered their life decisions for many years. Westmoreland has thrown out previous dreams of moving out to the Texas countryside with her partner and kids, opposed to the idea of moving farther into what she sees as the heartland of those she deeply disagrees with. Holland has lost close friendships with Round Rock neighbors since 2016. The rare conversations that occur, she said, quickly turn into political rambling.\n\n“I believe Trump for what he’s saying. That he’s being very literal,” Holland said. “But so many of his supporters say that’s not true, that he’s just saying that. And that’s what’s scary for me”\n\nWestmoreland nodded in agreement.\n\n“That last thing I want to hear from someone who voted for Trump is them saying, ‘Gosh, I didn’t see that coming.’” She grimaced. Holland did too, nodding. A Democratic Party employee stood in front of the television to announce the end of night’s watch party.\n\n-- Emiliano Gomez\n\n11:40 p.m. update: Texas Court of Criminal Appeals expected to have three new GOP judges\n\nTexas' highest court for criminal matters will have three new Republican judges come January, cementing Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's effort to remake the court in his image.\n\nPresiding Judge Sharon Keller, who became the first woman elected to the Court of Criminal Appeals in 2000, will be replaced by Dallas state Appeals Court Judge David Schenck. Schenck previously served under Gov. Greg Abbott when Abbott was Texas' attorney general.\n\nGina Parker, a former city, county and district attorney with no judicial experience, ousted Judge Barbara Hervey in the GOP primary and will take her seat on the bench in January.\n\nLee Finley, an attorney in private practice who also has not previously served as a judge, will replace Republican Judge Michelle Slaughter. Finley is from Collin County, Paxton's home turf.\n\nAs the American-Statesman reported in February, Paxton, a Republican, targeted the GOP incumbents over a 2021 Appeals Court opinion that maintained that the attorney general's office does not have the authority to prosecute voter fraud cases.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n11:40 p.m. update: GOP takes US Senate majority, and Texas Sen. John Cornyn wants to take charge\n\nWith the Republicans taking control of the U.S. Senate, the spotlight now turns on the Texan who was not on Tuesday's ballot: John Cornyn, the state's senior senator.\n\nCornyn has been spending much of the election year courting the votes of returning and incoming GOP senators in hopes of becoming the upper chamber's majority leader. Current leader Sen. Mitch McConnell is retiring from the top post but not from the Senate.\n\nCornyn told reporters last week in Austin that he expects the vote to take place in the next few days or weeks, and that his experience in the GOP leadership under McConnell positions him well to take charge.\n\n\"I'm confident our new conservative majority can restore our institution to the essential role it serves in our constitutional republic,\" Cornyn said in a statement late Tuesday.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n11:20 p.m. update: GOP incumbents on path to keep Texas Supreme Court seats\n\nRepublicans on the Texas Supreme Court will hold on to all three seats up for grabs this cycle, with incumbents defeating their Democratic challengers who targeted them over their votes on two major abortion cases.\n\nJustices Jane Bland, Jimmy Blacklock and John Devine each led their opponents by at least 15 percentage points as of 11:20 p.m., with roughly 75% of all votes reported. The victories extend Republicans' unbroken, 28-year winning streak on the state's court of last resort for civil cases.\n\n10:40 p.m. update: Republican Rep. Caroline Harris Davila on path to reelection to Texas House\n\nState Rep. Caroline Harris Davila, R-Round Rock, is poised to comfortably win a second term, as she lead her Democratic opponent Jennie Birkholz by 12 percentage points as of 10:40 p.m. Tuesday. Gov. Greg Abbott endorsed her in the race.\n\nIn 2022, she won the seat for House District 52, encompassing Hutto and a small portion of Round Rock, by 10 percentage points.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n10:35 p.m. update: Austin Mayor Kirk Watson poised to win reelection, avoid runoff\n\nIncumbent Kirk Watson, the perennial local politician who first served as Austin's mayor more than two decades ago, secured 51.4% support in his bid for reelection during early voting in Travis, Williamson and Hays counties. With 36 of 176 precincts reporting in Travis, his lead weakened slightly to 51.1% but remained safely above the 50% majority threshold needed for victory.\n\nEven before some Election Day results posted, Watson was optimistic.\n\n\"It looks to me very much like we're going to prevail in this race, but you can't call an election with just early vote(s),” he told supporters Tuesday night.\n\n-- Ella McCarthy\n\n10 p.m. update: Incumbents in competitive U.S. House races in Texas take early lead against opponents\n\nEarly voting totals show the three competitive U.S. House races in Texas, both in the Rio Grande Valley, are still tight, but the chances for flips are getting smaller.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of McAllen is leading his challenger, former U.S. Rep. Mayra Flores of Los Indios, by four percentage points in the race for District 34. Just over 75% of the vote in that district has been reported.\n\nU.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Edinburg, who is seeking a second term, has an eight-point edge against challenger Michelle Vallejo, 54% to 46%, with about 65% of the vote counted.\n\nIn District 28, longtime U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, is up 52% to 48% against GOP opponent Jay Furman with roughly 58% of the vote reported. Cuellar is facing a federal indictment over charges that he took foreign bribes.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\nAustin ISD declares victory on Proposition A; Election Day ballots still being tallied\n\nWith early votes counted, Austin school district administrators and board members declared victory Tuesday night on the district's proposed property tax rate increase to raise an additional $41 million in revenue.\n\nEarly returns showed almost 59% of people who voted early supported Proposition A, which would raise the school district's property tax rate by 9.1 cents. Travis County is still counting Election Day totals.\n\nA group of district administrators and board members, who gathered for a watch party at Punch Bowl Social on Congress Avenue, erupted in cheers and started chanting, \"Prop A! Prop A!\"\n\nSuperintendent Matias Segura thanked the community, his eyes tearing up. The district, which faces a $119 million budget deficit, will need to cut at least $90 million from its budget over the three years. This increased revenue means the district can stave off the most painful cuts, he said.\n\n\"There are things that we were going to have to consider that we're no longer going to have to consider,\" Segura said.\n\nBoard President Arati Singh vowed to spend the additional tax revenue in a way that will benefit students and teachers.\n\n\"We are going to spend this money in a way that is strategic, in a way that is going to increase student outcomes, that's going to give our kids the education they deserve,\" Singh said.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n9:45 p.m. update: Austin City Council District 7 race appears headed to runoff\n\nA six-way race to represent District 7 on the Austin City Council is likely headed to a runoff.\n\nMike Siegel, a civil rights lawyer and former Democratic nominee for congress, secured the most votes by far in early voting — 42%. But he must secure more than 50% of the vote to avoid a runoff but that could prove difficult with five challengers. Texas NAACP President Gary Bledsoe, the second-highest vote getter so far, received nearly 19% of the early vote.\n\nAs of 9:42 p.m., the Travis County Clerk had not posted Election Day results.\n\n-- Ella McCarthy\n\n9:20 p.m. update: Three of four Round Rock ISD bond proposals take early favor\n\nThree of four Round Rock measures in a $1 billion bond package appear on track to pass, according to early but incomplete voting totals.\n\nProposition A is passing with 63.8% of the early votes. This $798.3 million proposal contains facility upgrades, replacements to equipment that is at the end of its life, safety upgrades and additional classrooms.\n\nProposition B is passing with 60.5% of the early votes. The $125.3 million proposal would upgrade technology. Proposition C, an $8.6 million proposal to upgrade fine arts, is passing with 56.2% of the early votes.\n\nThe $65.9 million Proposition D, which would construct a multipurpose athletic field and improve athletic facilities, is failing with 60.2% of voters coming out against the measure during early voting.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n9:20 p.m. update: Round Rock school board races show early leaders\n\nIn the Round Rock school district, incumbent Estevan \"Chuy\" Zárate is leading with 59.4% of the early votes against challenger Joshua Escalante in the Place 1 race, incomplete and unofficial results show.\n\nMelissa Ross is leading with 64.7% of the votes against April Guerra for the Place 2 seat.\n\nIn Place 7, Mingyuan \"Michael\" Wei is leading with 67.6% of the early votes against Jim Steele.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n9:15 p.m. update: Travis County voters poised to pass Proposition A\n\nTravis County Proposition A, the measure that would raise property taxes to help low-income families pay for childcare, appears poised to pass after receiving overwhelming support during early voting, unofficial and incomplete results show.\n\nAbout 60% of the voters who weighed in ahead of Election Day supported the measure. Travis County Judge Andy Brown and Precinct 1 County Commissioner Jeff Travillion, who attended an election night watch party hosted by the local Democratic Party, told the American-Statesman they were optimistic. \"We hoped that it would pass resoundingly,” Travillion said as the crowd around him cheered and booed the presidential results being aired on TV. He called childcare a “clear pocketbook issue.”\n\n-- Emiliano Gomez and Bianca Moreno-Paz\n\n9:10 p.m. update: Texas House: Republicans favored in competitive seats\n\nEarly voting totals are painting a dim picture for Texas Democrats who hoped to flip seats in the state House and hold off the possible passage of a school voucher bill in the next legislative session.\n\nWhile state Rep. Mihaela Plesa, D-Dallas, is leading her GOP challenger Steve Kinard 52% to 48% in Collin County, according to early voting results, five other competitive races are trending slightly in favor of Republicans.\n\nIn San Antonio, state Rep. John Lujan earned 52% of the vote in early unofficial results, while his Democratic opponent Kristian Carranza snagged 48%. Republican Marc LaHood is up by the same margin against Laurel Jordan Swift, according to the unofficial Bexar County early voting results.\n\nEarly voting results in three other House seats presently held by Republicans:\n\nDenise Villalobos vs. Solomon Ortiz: 57% to 43% in Nueces County, early voting results show.\n\nState Rep. Angie Chen Button, R-Richardson, vs. Averie Bishop: 54% to 46% in Dallas County, early voting results show.\n\nState Rep. Morgan Meyer, R-University Park, vs. Elizabeth Ginsberg: 59% to 41% in Dallas County, early voting results show.\n\nIn addition, former Uvalde mayor Don McLaughlin is poised to flip a seat formerly held by a Democrat in the state House. He led opponent Cecilia Castellano by 40 percentage points as of 8:05 p.m., though Election Day ballots were still being tallied.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n9 p.m. update: Fuentes takes commanding lead for District 2 Austin council seat\n\nAustin City Council incumbent Vanessa Fuentes declared victory Tuesday night after taking a commanding lead over her competitor for the District 2 seat anchored in Southeast Austin.\n\nFuentes received 86% of the early vote, while her competitor Robert Reynolds took in 14% of the 20,670 votes that were cast before Election Day in this race.\n\nIn a post on X, Fuentes thanked residents of her district for “entrusting” her with a second term.\n\n“Together, we will keep fighting for good-paying jobs, complete and connected neighborhoods, and high-quality city services that make a difference in people’s lives,” Fuentes tweeted. “The next four years are about what WE can achieve together, building a city that works for everyone.”\n\nReynolds did not respond to a Statesman request to comment.\n\n-- Skye Seipp\n\n8:50 p.m. update: Rep. Michael McCaul will return to Congress for 11th term\n\nIncumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul of Austin outdistanced his Democratic challenger Theresa Boisseau in the race for the 10th Congressional District.\n\nAn inside player in the GOP caucus, McCaul will return to Congress for an 11th term in January. He was besting the Democrat by 19 percentage points, racking up nearly 65% of the vote, according to the incomplete and unofficial returns. Libertarian Jeff Miller was drawing about 2%.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n8:45 p.m. update: 'Our work continues': Travis County DA José Garza poised to win reelection\n\nTravis County District Attorney José Garza appears headed to a landslide victory in his bid for a second term. The Democrat captured 69% of the early vote, according to unofficial and incomplete results. His challenger, Republican Daniel Betts, received 31%. About half of the county's 925,858 registered voters cast ballots early.\n\nIn an interview with the American-Statesman shortly after 8 p.m., Garza thanked county residents for their “vote of confidence.\"\n\n“It means that our work continues,” he said.\n\nThat work will include expanding the county’s sexual assault response team, as well as continuing to grow a unit that investigates wrongful convictions. Garza said when he was first elected in 2020, the conviction integrity unit had only one staff member.\n\n\"Over the last four years we’ve built a team,” he said. \"We’re just getting our sea legs.\"\n\n-- Skye Seipp and Emiliano Gomez\n\n8:30 p.m. update: Incumbent Kirk Watson takes early lead in five-candidate race for Austin mayor\n\nIncumbent Austin Mayor Kirk Watson has taken an early lead in his bid for reelection with 51.4% of the early vote in Travis, Williamson and Hays counties, according to unofficial vote totals.\n\nNo precincts have yet reported Election Day tallies in the three counties, however 52% of registered voters in Travis County cast their ballots early. Watson, who first served as Austin's mayor from 1997-2001, was again elected to the city's highest office in 2022. His mayoral term is shorter term than usual, slated at two years, after Austin voters in 2021 opted to move the mayoral election to be in line with the U.S. presidential race.\n\nWatson is facing four challengers. For a candidate to win the election outright, they'll need to secure more than 50% of the vote or the race will go into a runoff between the top two vote-getters.\n\nCommunity organizer and executive director of Go Austin/Vamos Austin Carmen Llanes Pulido is in second place with 18.8% support, according to early voting totals in the three counties. Coming in third place is former Austin City Council Member Kathie Tovo with 17% of the vote.\n\nTrailing further behind in early voting numbers are small business owner Jeffery L. Bowen who clinched around 7.9% of the early vote and the former director of Central Texas Interfaith Doug Greco received 4.5%.\n\n-- Ella McCarthy\n\n8:10 p.m. update: Donald Trump wins Texas, CNN and NBC News report\n\nFormer President Donald Trump won the general election in Texas for the third time, as well as in Florida and Tennessee, according to NBC News and CNN.\n\n7:50 p.m. update: Kamala Harris, Colin Allred take early leads in Travis County\n\nPresidential nominee Kamala Harris and U.S. Senate nominee Colin Allred, both Democrats, take early leads in Travis County and in the county's immediate neighbors to the north and south, the incomplete and unofficial returns show. Election Day ballots are still being counted.\n\nStatewide, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and incumbent U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz were clinging to narrow leads. The early returns showed Allred running slightly ahead of Harris.\n\nAs expected, the GOP strength is anchored in rural Texas while the Democrats were riding high in the urban and some suburban centers. A notable exception is Tarrant County, the state's most purple urban/suburban enclave where Trump and Cruz have small leads.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n7:45 p.m. update: Democrats Doggett, Casar sail to reelection\n\nU.S. Rep.s Lloyd Doggett and Greg Casar, both of Austin, cruised to reelection Tuesday.\n\nDoggett, who has been in Congress since 1995, easily defeated Republican Jenny Garcia Sharon and Libertarian Girish Altekar in District 37. Casar won his second term over Republican Steven Wright in District 35.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n7:40 p.m. update: Manor ISD tax rate election gets early boost\n\nThe Manor school district's property tax rate election is narrowly pulling ahead with 52.9% of the vote, according to the early but incomplete results.\n\nIf voters approve Proposition A, they’d accept a school district property tax rate of $1.0814 per $100 of property valuation for the 2024-25 school year, 3 cents higher than $1.0514 per $100 valuation, which is the rate without the increase. If Proposition A is approved, the district expects to collect an additional $4.8 million in additional revenue.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n7:35 p.m. update: Austin ISD Proposition A takes early lead\n\nAlmost 59% of early voters approved the Austin school district's Proposition A, which officials said will provide employee raises and cut back the district's $119 million deficit, according to early voting results released by Travis County. About 52% of eligible Travis County voters cast early ballots. Election Day ballots are still being counted.\n\nIn the District 2 school board race to replace Ofelia Zapata, LaRessa Quintana has pulled ahead of Sarah Ivory with 60.2% of the early votes.\n\nFor the District 8, at-large, seat Fernando Lucas de Urioste is leading the crowded six-candidate race with 33.8% of the early votes. Lindsey Stringer and Amy Moore follow with 25.6% and almost 24% of the early votes, respectively. Nathaniel Hellman, Dylan \"Sky\" MacAdams and Nick Franke are also running for the seat.\n\nTrustees Lynn Boswell and Kevin Foster are running unopposed for reelection.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n7:20 p.m. Early election results show tight US Senate race in Texas\n\nWith a smattering of counties, some big and some small, reporting early election results, the race between Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Colin Allred is about even. Keep in mind, the polls have been closed less than 20 minutes as of this update and Election Day votes are still being tallied.\n\nAllred is running comfortably ahead in his home base of Dallas County, as per the incomplete and unofficial returns. In neighboring Tarrant County, narrowly won by President Joe Biden four years ago, Cruz has a slim early lead.\n\nIn Williamson County, north of Austin, it's Allred with the slim lead, and he is also carrying Travis and Hays counties, early results show. So far, all of the rural counties reporting numbers show Cruz well ahead.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n5:20 p.m. update: Ken Paxton declines to join other attorneys general in calling for election peace\n\nThe National Association of Attorneys General is calling for and orderly election, and post-election, as the country prepares to elect it's 47th president. One state attorney general's name was conspicuously absent from the list of those who signed the open letter.\n\nTexas' own Ken Paxton.\n\nRecall that in the presidential election four years ago, and the weeks that followed, Paxton went to court seeking to nullify the results of the election in four of the battleground states that went for Democrat Joe Biden over incumbent Donald Trump.\n\nHere's what the attorneys general from the other 49 states and two U.S. territories had to say on the subject:\n\n“Regardless of the outcome of Tuesday’s election, we expect that Americans will respond peacefully and we condemn any acts of violence related to the results. A peaceful transfer of power is the highest testament to the rule of law, a tradition that stands at the heart of our nation’s stability. As Attorneys General, we affirm our commitment to protect our communities and uphold the democratic principles we serve.\"\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n4:45 p.m. update: 'I don’t have a voice': Austin voter turned away after missing key deadline\n\nJeff Dukett thought he had done everything he needed to vote — but he left the Austin Oaks Church polling site without casting a ballot Tuesday afternoon because election workers told him he hadn’t updated his address in time.\n\nTo vote in the Nov. 5 election, a voter who moved would have had to update their address with the elections office by Oct. 7. Dukett, who moved from San Marcos to Southwest Austin, updated his address in late October, not realizing the deadline.\n\n“This is why people don’t get out to vote,” Dukett said, fuming. “It’s just frustrating because I know (the presidential race is) going to be close and I don’t have a voice.”\n\nAccording to the Texas Secretary of State’s website, voters have few options if they miss the deadline to update their address 30 days before Election Day. If the voter still lives in the same city or county, they can return to their old precinct to vote — an option that doesn’t help Dukett, having moved one county to the north.\n\nTexas has a path for people who moved from one county to another to vote a “limited ballot,” which would include only those races that appear on the ballots for both the voter’s old address and their new one. That would include races such as president and U.S. Senate, but not mayor, for instance.\n\nBut that option didn’t help Dukett, either: Limited ballots are available only during early voting, not on Election Day.\n\n“I waited all day to do this,” Dukett said, frustrated as he left without voting. “I’ll never vote again.”\n\n-- Bridget Grumet\n\n4:30 p.m. update: Abbott appears bullish on school vouchers, even before polls close\n\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott aggressively campaigned during the March primaries against several GOP Texas House members who stood in the way of the Legislature last year enacting a school voucher program. And after he helped many of them get defeated, the governor expressed confidence he'd get his way when lawmakers return to Austin for a new legislative session in January.\n\nThat prediction is predicated on the outcome of a handful of state House races that will be decided when the votes are tallied Tuesday night. But Abbott's confidence showed no sign of waning even with a few hours left before the polls closed in Texas. His office put out an afternoon advisory that the govenor will hold \"a media availability on the importance of passing school choice for all Texas families\" in Tyler early Wednesday.\n\nDepending on how the voting goes, look for the governor's confidence level to flow over the brim, or for him to defiantly challenge the House to get with his program.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n4:15 p.m. update: Parents turning out for AISD Proposition A\n\nSome parents who came to Davis Elementary School in Northwest Austin to vote Tuesday decided to support the Austin school district’s proposed 9.1-cent tax rate increase. The district pledged to use the $41 million it will collect in additional revenue to give employees raises and pay down its $119 million deficit.\n\nJoyce Tseng, who has two children and is pregnant with a third child, said she wants her children’s teachers to have higher pay and access to better resources and thus supported Proposition A wholeheartedly.\n\nAmanda Armond didn’t have to think about whether to vote for the tax rate election. Her daughter goes to fifth grade at Davis and she wants to ensure teachers and students have the resources they need, she said.\n\n“If I have to pay more in taxes for the benefit of schools, teachers, what have you, I will, always,” Armond said.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n4 p.m. update: Voters in Austin suburbs contribute to changing demographics\n\nJust north of Austin, Williamson County is one of several diverse and rapidly-growing suburban Texas counties that has moved from being safely Republican to purple territory in recent years.\n\nElected officials from the county are a mix of Republicans and Democrats, unlike those in deep-blue Travis County. And voters there slightly preferred President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in 2020, but they also chose to reelect Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn and a number of other GOP candidates that year.\n\nTwo residents who are part of that blue shift are Bryon Curtis and Keizhia Carlyle. Both see women’s and abortion rights as critical issues this year.\n\nLaw enforcement administrator and Hutto dad Bryon Curtis was emphatic about his opposition to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, whom he feels is “racist” and “a horrible person.”\n\nThe main reason Curtis voted for Trump's opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, is her stance on abortion rights. “I have daughters,” he said. “I want them to have access to health care.” He also opposes mass deportation.\n\nWhile knocking on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee in Hutto, Curtis says he met numerous women who said they’re voting for Harris.\n\n“I've had a lot of women go, ‘I used to vote Republican, or my husband votes Republican, but I'm voting for Harris,’” he said. “It's the abortion issue … I think you'll have more women voting Democrat than you did traditionally.”\n\nKeizhia Carlyle said women's rights are at the top of her priorities. She also cited border issues as a top driver for her, saying she feels Republicans' statements about migration through the U.S. southern border exaggerate the problem.\n\n\"I just I think they're using (the border) as a hot-topic issue to get voted in, to scare people. ... And I don't think you should go to the polls in fear. You should know the truth and vote your beliefs.\"\n\nIn Hutto, she added, \"Jobs aren't being taken. People aren't, like, breaking into my home. ... This fear-mongering on TV and all that, I just feel like it's a lie.\"\n\nCarlyle, a Black woman, said the candidates' rhetoric on race and ethnicity was a major reason she chose to vote on Tuesday.\n\n\"The negative talk about women, people of color, minorities — I'm just tired of hearing the same old thing from Republicans,\" she said. \"It's like minorities don't matter. And I'm just trying to show through my voting that we do matter, and we do have a voice.\"\n\nOf the election in general, she said, \"I'm glad it's going to be over.\"\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n3 p.m. update: Why all politics are local for this Texas voter\n\nLeaving the polling place after casting her vote at Deer Creek Elementary School in suburban northwest Travis County, Nikki Cherniak saw nothing to be gained by adding her voice to the almost deafening cacophony that has become the soundtrack to modern national politics.\n\nA retired teacher of 23 years, Cherniack said it was the school board races that motivated her Election Day decision to vote.\n\n\"I'm more interested in what's happening in my community than anything else,\" she said, adding that there's no shortage of opinions in the race for president and the contest for U.S. Senate.\n\n\"We need people on the school board who really understand the needs of the children and the teachers.\"\n\nCherniack declined to say which candidates running for places on the Leander school board best fit that bill because she didn't want to add to that white noise there, either.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n12:45 p.m. update: US Senate candidates in Texas sprint to finish\n\nCampaigning in the tantalizingly close U.S. Senate race in Texas continued as Election Day voting was underway Tuesday.\n\nAt least in the virtual sense. Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz’s team, just before lunchtime, posted side-by-side images of his Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Colin Allred and former U.S. House Speaker (and still California congresswoman) Nancy Pelosi suggesting that his opponent would be in lockstep with the nation’s most prominent San Francisco liberal.\n\n\"Colin Allred's 100% voting record with Nancy Pelosi shows that he's too extreme for Texas,\" said the message posted on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAround the same time, Allred, a three-term congressman from Dallas, reminded voters that country music legend Willie Nelson was in his corner. In addition to Nelson, Allred's post also featured Cruz's 2018 opponent former Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke and former Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis, plus some national figures, repeating the message \"All in for Allred.\"\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n12:35 p.m. update: Voters 'hopeful' at University of Texas\n\nOn a sunny Election Day afternoon, Dalton Pastorius, a University of Texas sophomore majoring in government, said he has “never felt hope like this before.”“I’ve never been as hopeful as I am today,” he said. Standing outside the Texas Union in a 2008 T-shirt of former President Barack Obama on coins under the banner “Real change,” Pastorius handed out flyers with voting information, beaming with genuine excitement. Pastorius feels personally connected to Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president. In 2019 during the primaries, he had a poster of her on his wall. “I’m just so ecstatic to vote for her,” he said, encouraging people to vote and research the candidates up for office.\n\n-- Lily Kepner\n\n12:20 p.m. update: Austin voters weigh in on AISD Proposition A\n\nThe Austin school district, facing a $119 million budget deficit, is proposing a higher tax rate to raise revenue to help cut the shortfall and give teachers a raise.\n\nProposition A proposes to raise the school property tax rate from 85.95 cents per $100 of property valuation to 95.05 cents, which would raise $41 million for local schools and send another $130 million to the state as part of a decades-old program called recapture, which takes tax revenue from districts that collect more than their state-determined need for education funding and redistributing it to those that collect less in revenue than their state-determined need.\n\nOutside the Gus L. Garcia Recreation Center in Northeast Austin on a blustery Tuesday morning, Jose Brownlee, who has lived in Austin since 1996, stood in line with a group of other voters to cast his ballot.\n\nBrownlee said he voted against the district's tax rate proposal because his taxes are already too high.\n\n\"We're already struggling out here and everything's already tough,\" Brownlee said.\n\nHowever, Roy Spinoza sees Proposition A as an economic boon to the city.\n\nSpinoza, who has lived in Austin for 42 years, has three grandchildren in local schools. His desire to put Republican former President Donald Trump back in the White House drove him out to the polls Tuesday.\n\nThough he isn't excited about paying more in taxes, Spinoza thinks people need to invest in their city, which includes the schools, he said.\n\n\"I don't want to see Austin go down and get ruined just because no one wants to pay into it,\" Spinoza said.\n\nLikewise Lynette Cox, who moved to Austin six months ago, decided to vote in favor of the Austin school district tax rate election. Cox doesn't have children, but to her, investing in public education is a matter of principle.\n\n\"You have to invest in the future of the U.S.,\" Cox said.\n\nAustinite Trey Pasquariello also voted for the district's proposal, he said.\n\n\"Raising money for any schools is a good thing,\" Pasquariello said.\n\nHe also sees the investment as a return for his own home because if schools improve, then his home value will likely increase, he said.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n10:15 a.m. update: At the polls, Texas voters express opposing views on immigration, abortion\n\nThe line to vote on Tuesday morning snaked around the Wilco Hutto Annex building, a polling location in Hutto, a rural town about 30 miles north of Austin, with the wait to cast a ballot exceeding 45 minutes. It’s been this way since the polls opened at 7 a.m.\n\nWhile Hutto residents are mostly Republican, voters of all stripes were out on Election Day casting their ballots.\n\nAunchelle Weeks, 42, a Hutto business owner and mom, came to the polls with her daughter. She cast her vote for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, a Democratic congressman from Dallas who is running to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\n“I just don’t feel like Trump has the country’s best interests at heart,” she said. “I think he’s in it for himself.”\n\nWeeks' three top issues: the economy, taxes and abortion rights. She feels Harris’ economic plan is more developed. GOP nominee Donald Trump’s plan, she feels, “has been tried and it hasn’t worked.”\n\nAsked what shapes her views on abortion, she said, “I got pregnant right after they turned over Roe v. Wade, and I had never been so frightened in my life for something to go wrong. And it really made me think about my girls going forward. I don’t want them to have that fear when their time comes to carry.\"\n\nTexas has one of the most restrictive abortions bans in the country, with no exceptions for rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies. Weeks said she’s hopeful that Harris will win.\n\n“I think that she’ll come through in the end and hopefully get things back on track,” Weeks said.\n\nFor professional firefighter Jason Oltman, 44, a dad to grown children, he turned out to support Republicans up and down the ticket though he said he voted for some Democrats in local races.\n\nOltman voted for Trump because he said the former president is \"not a politician.”\n\n“He can pretty much tell PACs to kiss his ass,\" he said. “He doesn’t have to depend on them, or he chooses not to listen,” he said, while acknowledging that Trump still takes donations from them.\n\nThe first reason Oltman gave for voting to reelect Cruz: he opposes sex change procedures for children. He also said voters “can’t just go off what they hear on TV,” referring to the political ads that have inundated the airwaves. “Everybody’s throwing knives.”\n\nAt the same polling place — Wilco Hutto Annex — Hutto resident Al Artus cast his votes for Trump, saying concerns about the former president's rhetoric are overblown.\n\n“I totally get his sense of humor,” he said of Trump. “They say, you know, ‘Orange man bad.’ They just don’t understand.”\n\nThe biggest concerns for him are immigration, inflation and the economy. Artus said he is deeply concerned about human trafficking, which occurs at the border, and feels Trump will crack down on those responsible.\n\n“We're standing on a gold mine of prosperity and wealth, but (they’re like), ‘No, let's just make everything more expensive and make it harder for people who are on fixed incomes,’” he said. “And why are we allowing women to be abused in such a way, children (to be abused) in such a way?”\n\nAs for abortion, it isn't a major concern for Artus.\n\n“I think if you have a problem with it, you just go to another state,” he said. “I don’t think we should have this one giant, powerful arm over everybody.”\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\nWhat time do polls open on Election Day?\n\nIf you're voting on Election Day, polls in Texas are open from 7 a.m. through 7 p.m. local time.\n\nAs long as you're in the line by 7 p.m., you will be allowed to vote even if you haven’t been admitted inside a polling place. You have the right to stay in line as long as it takes to be able to cast your ballot.\n\nWhere can I vote on Election Day 2024?\n\nWhat do I need to bring to vote in Texas?\n\nVoters should come prepared to present one of seven acceptable forms of photo ID:\n\nTexas driver's license\n\nTexas personal identification card\n\nPassport\n\nTexas handgun license\n\nMilitary ID card\n\nCitizenship certificate\n\nTexas election identification certificate\n\nA student ID, even from a public school or college, is not an acceptable ID for voting under state law.\n\nAny otherwise qualified voter who cannot reasonably obtain one of the approved forms of photo ID can fill out a \"Reasonable Impediment Declaration\" at the voting location and present an alternative form of identification, such as a utility bill, bank statement, government check or voter registration certificate.\n\nWhat's on the ballot in the November 5 election?\n\nAlong with voting for the next president, eligible Texans can vote for other officials running on the local, state, and federal levels.\n\nHere is a look at what's on the ballot according to the Texas secretary of state website:\n\n1 U.S Senator (the seat currently held by Ted Cruz)\n\n1 of 3 Railroad Commissioners\n\n15 State Senators\n\n7 State Board of Education members\n\n3 members of the Texas Supreme Court\n\n3 members of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\n\n5 Chief Justices and various justices for Texas Courts of Appeals\n\nLower-level judges and local county offices will also appear on the ballot:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/05"}]}

The consequence, outlined next to the text bubble: “If your personal texts aren’t end-to-end encrypted, it’s not private.”\n\nIn a TV commercial, a mailman hands already-opened letters and packages to outraged recipients, before telling them that “every text you send is just as open as your letters.”\n\nThose warnings are courtesy of WhatsApp, the mobile messaging service acquired by Facebook in 2014. While WhatsApp has grown into a formidable force since then, used by more than a quarter of the world’s population, the platform’s reach in its home market remains comparatively small.\n\nData shared with CNN Business by research firm eMarketer indicates WhatsApp had less than 63 million users in the United States as of last year, or around 19% of the country’s population. That’s far behind its audience in countries such as India, Brazil and Indonesia where it is among the most popular modes of communication. India alone has nearly 500 million WhatsApp users according to eMarketer, which is more than a third of its population and over half its internet user base.\n\nThis is the first time WhatsApp, which declined to share stats on how many users it currently has in the United States, has run an ad campaign in the country.\n\n“Over time, we’ve seen more people in the US turn to WhatsApp,” Eshan Ponnadurai, the platform’s head of marketing who spearheaded the ad campaign, said in an emailed statement to CNN Business, though he acknowledged the gap with the rest of the world. “We’re just introducing ourselves in the US in a way.”\n\nThe stakes could be high for Facebook, now known as Meta, to grow the reach of WhatsApp. Even as it makes a large-scale pivot to virtual reality, Meta’s social media platforms still form the core of its business. And that business has been flagging — Facebook’s user growth has slowed as it saturates the world and faces increased competition from other platforms such as TikTok, particularly for younger users. Meta’s advertising business has also been hit by Apple’s privacy changes around tracking user activity.\n\nWhile apps such as Facebook and Instagram are already widely used in the United States and don’t have much room to grow, the potential for WhatsApp is much larger. The messaging app cost Facebook $19 billion almost a decade ago but generates little revenue. Meta is now trying to change that.\n\nBoosting WhatsApp in the United States could have positive ripple effects on its other platforms and create new monetization opportunities in a lucrative market. But to get there, WhatsApp must fight an uphill battle to change how Americans text and, perhaps, how they view WhatsApp’s parent company.\n\nThe fight to change how Americans text\n\nWith more than 2 billion users globally, WhatsApp has become the dominant messaging service in many parts of the world, including much of Asia, Europe and Latin America.\n\nThat’s not the case in the United States, where more than half the country uses iPhones and their default iMessage app. For non-iPhone users, traditional text messaging, also known as SMS (or MMS for sharing pictures) is still the go-to. More than 2.2 trillion text messages were sent in the United States in 2020, according to CTIA, a trade group for the US telecommunications industry.\n\n“The only common denominator is SMS, a 30-year-old technology,” said Inderpal Singh Mumick, CEO of New Jersey-based communications company Dotgo, which helps businesses communicate with customers through various messaging apps.\n\nGoogle, whose Android operating system is Apple’s biggest smartphone rival, is in the process of replacing SMS with a system known as Rich Communication Services (RCS) for its default messages app. Google describes RCS as a “a modern, more secure industry standard” that gives users a safer, more interactive way to message each other.\n\nBut the rollout has been slow, and SMS remains popular. Mumick estimates that there are around 40 million RCS users in the United States, out of 500 million globally.\n\nWhatsApp, which works the same regardless of the device it is being used on, has seemingly settled on a strategy to convince Americans to make the switch — by appealing to their desire for data privacy.\n\nThe privacy playbook\n\nWhatsApp has long touted its use of end-to-end encryption, which means only the sender and recipient of a message can see its contents. While several other competitors including iMessage and Signal also offer end-to-end encryption, WhatsApp is by far the biggest in terms of user base.\n\nPonnadurai said WhatsApp saw the growing conversation around data privacy as “an opportunity to educate Americans that are missing out on having secure conversations because they’re still using SMS.”\n\nThere is merit to the argument that SMS is unsafe, according to some privacy experts.\n\n“SMS is definitely insecure,” said Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at the Stanford Internet Observatory who focuses on encryption and privacy issues. The telecom architecture that enables text messages to be transmitted, known as the SS7 protocol, has vulnerabilities that “leave Americans’ calls and text messages unprotected against malicious snoops,” she added.\n\nWhatsApp's new ad campaign warns against using unencrytped text messages. Rishi Iyenger/CNN\n\nWhatsApp’s privacy push comes as lawmakers in the US and around the world are also floating legislation that would dilute encryption, citing the technology’s potential use by malicious actors. But critics of the legislation say doing so would have dangerous implications for online privacy.\n\n“From an encryption policy standpoint, now is an important time to mount a public relations campaign touting the benefits of an encrypted chat app,” Pfefferkorn said. “Americans recognize that they need and deserve privacy and security for their communications, but they may not know that end-to-end encryption is a great way to achieve those needs, or realize that WhatsApp is [encrypted] by default.”\n\nBut the biggest challenge WhatsApp faces in convincing Americans to switch may come from its own parent company.\n\nTrust issues\n\nIn recent years, Facebook has faced scandal after scandal when it comes to protecting its users’ privacy and security. A series of damning leaks from a Facebook whistleblower late last year may have only tarnished trust in the company further. Even guaranteed encryption may be a difficult sell.\n\n“The company’s many privacy screw-ups have bred a general atmosphere of distrust,” said Pfefferkorn. “People just don’t believe that Facebook actually respects their privacy, and many people don’t even believe that Facebook [and] WhatsApp truly can’t read their WhatsApp messages.”\n\nWhatsApp has faced its own backlash over privacy. The company was forced to delay an update to its privacy policy last year, after confusion over how much user data it shares with Facebook prompted a mass exodus to rival messaging platforms such as Signal.\n\nShould its US push succeed, the opportunities for WhatsApp are significant. The company has rolled out business communications and digital payments in some of its biggest markets, attempting to monetize what has traditionally been a free service. And the United States is considered among the most lucrative markets in the world terms of revenue per user of online services.\n\nBut entrenched texting habits and its own parent company’s missteps will likely make that an uphill battle.\n\n“Facebook has totally blown it on public trust, and so if the PR strategy in the US doesn’t work, Facebook will have themselves to blame,” Pfefferkorn said.", "authors": ["Rishi Iyengar"], "publish_date": "2022/03/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/19/tech/facebook-rebranding-problems", "title": "Facebook is rebranding everything but faces the same old problems ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nNearly four months ago, amid a firestorm of critical coverage stemming from a whistleblower’s leaks, Facebook shifted its strategic focus to building an immersive version of the internet it calls the “metaverse” and changed its company name to Meta.\n\nThis week, the company continued with its rebranding campaign. The News Feed, for years the centerpiece of the Facebook user experience and also central to some of its controversies, was rebranded simply as Feed. Its employees, previously known as Facebookers, became Metamates. And its corporate values got a refresh, too.\n\nGone are corporate maxims like “be bold.” Instead, the company introduced guidelines such as “focus on long-term impact” and “be direct and respect your colleagues.” Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s cofounder and CEO, said the changes were needed because “we’re now a metaverse company, building the future of social connection.”\n\n“We’ve already built products that are useful to billions of people, but in our next chapter we’ll focus more on inspiring people as well,” Zuckerberg wrote in an explanation of the new value “build awesome things.”\n\nThe changes this week once again hint at the company’s eagerness to turn the page and refocus its employees, and arguably the general public, on a new era of its business — one less tarnished by years of controversy.\n\nZuckerberg himself appears eager to turn away from some of the recent turmoil, announcing this week that Nick Clegg, formerly Meta’s vice president of global affairs and communications, has been promoted to president of global affairs. Clegg’s promotion will free up time for Zuckerberg to focus on the company’s efforts to build new artificial and virtual reality products, Zuckerberg said.\n\nBut despite Zuckerberg’s and Meta’s apparent effort to “live in the future,” as one of its new values dictates, the social media giant still has to wrestle with many of the same old problems that have plagued it for months or, in some cases, years. If anything, some of its challenges only seem to be getting worse.\n\nMeta’s core advertising business faces threats from other Big Tech giants. Facebook (FB) whistleblower Frances Haugen has filed two new complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the company’s handling of misinformation. And the company continues to grapple with regulatory scrutiny.\n\n“At the end of the day, Mark can run, but he can’t hide from the regulatory pressure,” Katie Harbath, a Facebook alum who helped lead the company’s global election efforts until her departure last year, said of his making Clegg effectively the company’s most public face on policy issues.\n\nFor a long time, it seemed like Zuckerberg and Facebook could at least find some comfort during the company’s various PR crises in the resiliency of its stock. But that’s no longer the case. Meta’s shares have fallen more than 40% over the past six months, with much of the loss in value following a rough holiday quarter earnings report which showed, among other things, a rare lapse in user growth.\n\n“Wall Street and the investment community [have] caught up with [the fact that] that the core business at Facebook is no longer growing, it may even be in decline at some point, and therefore Facebook has had to make an enormous pivot into a tangential, and really unrelated, space,” said Gil Luria, technology strategist at investment firm D.A. Davidson.\n\nAsked for comment about this story, Meta directed CNN Business to Zuckerberg’s post about the company’s changing values.\n\nFacebook’s problems continue\n\nWhile Meta’s announcements this week center on its vision for a new, virtual world, the company’s problems continue to pile up in the real world.\n\nOn Friday, the Washington Post broke the news that two new whistleblower complaints against Meta were filed with the SEC. Andrew Bakaj, a lawyer for Whistleblower Aid, which filed the complaints, confirmed to CNN Business that they were filed on behalf of Haugen. Haugen is the former Facebook product manager who left the company last May and took with her a trove of internal documents that would later be disclosed to Congress and inform the blockbuster Facebook Papers reporting that fueled the company’s prolonged PR crisis.\n\nCNN Business obtained redacted copies of the new SEC complaints as part of a consortium of news organizations from a Congressional source, who also provided the internal documents that formed the basis of last year’s Facebook Papers reporting.\n\nThe new complaints accuse the company of misleading investors about its efforts to address climate and Covid-19 misinformation on its platforms. They detail how Facebook had repeatedly touted its efforts to fight misinformation about Covid-19 and climate change and allege that internal documents indicate employees were raising concerns at the same time about such content being easily available on the platform and about shortcomings in the company’s efforts to address it.\n\nFacebook's rebranding to Meta was meant to signal a new direction, but old problems remain. Facebook\n\n“Some investors simply will not want to invest in a company that fails to adequately address such misinformation,” one of the SEC filings states. Haugen previously filed SEC complaints against Facebook related to its handling of misinformation about the 2020 Presidential election and January 6 insurrection, human trafficking on its platforms, the effects of its products on teens and more.\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Meta spokesperson Drew Pusateri said the company has directed two billion people to authoritative public health information and used its Climate Science Center, available in more than 150 countries to provide reliable information about the climate, while working with independent fact checkers to address and remove false claims. “There are no one-size-fits-all solutions to stopping the spread of misinformation, but we’re committed to building new tools and policies to combat it,” Pusateri said.\n\nThe news of the SEC filings followed a slew of other headlines for the company this week. Meta agreed to pay $90 million to settle a decade-old class action lawsuit over a (now long defunct) practice that allowed the social network to track users’ activity across the internet, even if they had logged out of the platform. The agreement, which also involves deleting the data it collected in this manner, is one of the biggest settlements in the company’s history. Pusateri on Tuesday said the settlement “is in the best interest of our community and our shareholders and we’re glad to move past this issue.”\n\nLawmakers this week also added to the slate of proposed legislation that could affect Meta. Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn proposed the Kids Online Safety Act, which would create new responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harms such as sexual exploitation, and require them to create default settings for families to protect their kids from harmful content.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest potential problem for Meta to emerge this week was an announcement by Google that it plans to develop new privacy measures that would remove the ability to track users across apps and limit the sharing of user data with third parties on Android devices.\n\nThe announcement comes after a similar move by Apple (AAPL) caused a huge hit to Meta’s advertising business by giving users the chance to opt-out of being tracked by apps, thereby making it harder for Facebook to target ads. Meta’s ad business is heavily dependent on small businesses “that are relying on the benefits of being able to access a lot of information about users to effectively target advertising … without those details, advertisers are not going to pay as much money,” Third Bridge Group analyst Scott Kessler said. The Apple (AAPL) change is expected to have a $10 billion impact on Meta’s bottom line this year.\n\nWhile Google (GOOG) suggested its new privacy-focused advertising system will work differently from Apple’s — and a Meta executive lauded Google (GOOG)’s “long-term, collaborative approach” to developing it — the change could still ultimately be yet another blow to Meta’s core ad business.\n\nBuilding out its VR efforts might help. Indeed, Meta’s and Zuckerberg’s focus on the company’s metaverse ambitions may be an acknowledgment of the fact that its existing business is in trouble, Luria said. He noted that Zuckerberg’s updates this week may be a way of communicating, both inside the company and externally, “the importance and timeliness of this pivot.”\n\nMeta is working to develop its own tech ecosystem that users will be able to access with its own Quest headsets and where it can run its own app stores, without being at the whim of companies like Apple and Google. The problem: the metaverse, and broad adoption of its related technologies by consumers and advertisers, is still years away, so that solution is unlikely to turn Meta’s fortunes around anytime soon.\n\n“In the meantime,” Luria said, “if their core business is slowing down and will possibly start declining at some point, that will break Facebook’s long streak of fast growth that they’ve had… since they’ve gone public.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/07/tech/elon-musk-twitter-global-free-speech", "title": "How Elon Musk could impact Twitter's battles over speech abroad ...", "text": "San Francisco CNN Business —\n\nSince Elon Musk announced he was buying Twitter last month, the billionaire has sent out tweet after tweet outlining his plans for the platform, touching on everything from new features to security updates to monetization. But Musk’s overarching reason for committing billions of dollars to buy Twitter is to ensure the platform bolsters free speech.\n\n“By ‘free speech,’ I simply mean that which matches the law,” he said in one of his many recent tweets on the subject. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.” Musk has also said he thinks Twitter should be more “reluctant to delete things” and “very cautious with permanent bans.”\n\nMusk’s rhetoric has already raised some concerns in Twitter’s home market about how it would impact the platform’s approach to handling harassment, misinformation and content moderation broadly. But Musk’s posture could also create new uncertainties for Twitter’s platform if applied to markets abroad, which account for the vast majority of Twitter’s user base. That’s because definitions of free speech, and the laws governing it, often look very different around the world than they do in the United States.\n\nIn some markets, like the European Union, Twitter and its peers are facing growing regulatory pressure to bolster content moderation against hate speech and misinformation. In other markets, Twitter has faced pressure to restrict speech that is critical of local governments. Whatever Musk’s personal views on content enforcement may be, Twitter risks substantial fines and other penalties for not complying with local laws in various countries. In some cases, Twitter has even been banned or threatened with bans.\n\nSome digital rights advocates say they are unsure how much thought Musk has given to the complex regulatory environment Twitter faces abroad and how much a Twitter owned by Musk would be willing to push back against government pressure in other countries, as it has done in some countries recently.\n\n“I am not sure how much Musk is concerned about the Twittersphere outside the US,” Yaman Akdeniz, a professor of law at Istanbul Bilgi University and founder of the UK-based organization Cyber-Rights & Cyber-Liberties, told CNN Business. Turkey is one of several countries that has banned Twitter in the past, briefly blocking the platform in 2014 over anti-government rhetoric.\n\n“I believe Musk’s Twitter will simply not care about such a ban to the effect that they will challenge [or] resist such an attempt,” he said.\n\nDavid Kaye, a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine and former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, said the “concern” is that Musk “talks about free speech in this very simplistic way.”\n\nIt “suggests that all he cares about, really, is the individual speaker and their ability to post as opposed to… the desire to maximize the possibility that everybody has a voice on it,” said Kaye, who also authored the book ‘Speech Police: The Global Struggle to Govern the Internet.’\n\n“I also don’t get the sense that he’s thought through the global part of the platform,” Kaye added.\n\nMusk and Twitter did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nTwitter’s free speech battles with foreign governments\n\nIn recent years, Twitter has fought a number of free speech battles against governments in some of the company’s biggest markets, often leading the charge among social media companies in protecting its users’ rights.\n\nIn India, whose online population of around 830 million is bigger than any country except China, Twitter last year clashed with the government over demands to take down accounts related to protests by the country’s farmers. Twitter complied with some of the requests but refused to take action against accounts of journalists, activists or politicians.\n\nThe Indian government said at the time that Twitter was “welcome to do business in India” but must respect local laws. “In India, we value freedom and we value criticism because it is part of our democracy,” the government added. “But freedom of expression is not absolute and it is subject to reasonable restrictions.”\n\nMonths later, Twitter was banned in Nigeria after it deleted a tweet by the country’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, that was widely perceived as offensive and threatening to some of its citizens. The ban was lifted earlier this year after Twitter agreed to meet all conditions set by the Nigerian government, according to a government statement, which included “managing prohibited publication in line with Nigerian law.”\n\nTwitter must also grapple with repressive regimes around the world such as Russia, Myanmar and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.\n\n“Twitter has, over the years, refused to comply with unjust laws, laws that are not in line with international human rights standards,” said Jillian York, Director of International Freedom of Expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “I am definitely concerned that [Musk] lacks the understanding of international human rights issues, and the ways in which state actors around the world have both placed demands for censorship on these platforms and have used them for the purposes of harm.”\n\nMusk’s other businesses\n\nIf his latest deal goes through, Twitter will become just one more piece of Musk’s growing empire of businesses — including Tesla, SpaceX and the Boring Company — some of which depend on government relationships in the United States and abroad. That, too, could complicate Twitter’s approach to handling certain content battles.\n\nElectric carmaker Tesla (TSLA), in particular, could potentially lead to conflicts overseas, including one large country where Twitter doesn’t even operate: China. Not only is China the world’s biggest car market, but its financial capital Shanghai is also home to one of Tesla (TSLA)’s biggest manufacturing plants. Twitter, notably, has been banned in China for years, though that hasn’t stopped its government officials and prominent citizens from actively using the platform or complaining when their accounts are restricted or labeled in certain ways.\n\nSome people — including Musk’s fellow billionaire and sometimes rival, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — have publicly questioned whether Musk’s ownership of Twitter could give China some leverage over the platform due to Tesla’s need to keep operating there.\n\nKaye says it may be hard to predict how governments might pressure Musk, or how Musk might respond. “But given the fact that he’s got these major economic interests in Tesla and SpaceX and those interests also have real sort of government relationship ramifications, you could really imagine governments saying to him: ‘We’ll give you this on Tesla… if you basically deal with the platform in this way.”\n\nSeparately, a leading official in Europe, which has been particularly proactive about regulating Big Tech platforms in recent years, alluded to the fact that Musk’s experience running Tesla and complying with regulators abroad suggests he should know he will have to do the same with Twitter. (Many European countries also have strict laws against hate speech).\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules – regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner and a leading digital regulator, said in a tweet.\n\n“Mr. Musk knows this well. He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act,” Breton added, referencing a new law passed by Europe recently that imposes new rules on how the tech industry handles misinformation and illegal content on social media.\n\nEven Bezos, after questioning China’s possible new leverage over Twitter and Tesla, acknowledged that “Musk is extremely good at navigating this kind of complexity.”", "authors": ["Rishi Iyengar"], "publish_date": "2022/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/tech/facial-recognition-bans-reversed", "title": "First, they banned facial recognition. Now they're not so sure | CNN ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nOver the past few years, a number of cities and some states enacted rules banning or restricting local police use of facial-recognition software. Now, in a handful of locations around the country, the controversial technology is making a comeback.\n\nThe city of New Orleans, which in 2020 passed an ordinance banning its police department from using facial-recognition software, decided in July to change course and allow its police officers to request permission from a superior to use facial-recognition software for violent crime investigations. The state of Virginia, meanwhile, outlawed local police and campus law enforcement use of facial recognition technology in 2021 and then approved a bill in March allowing its use by police in some situations. And in California, a law that went into effect in 2020 that temporarily forbid state and local law enforcement from using facial-recognition software in body cameras expires at the end of the year (it was enacted as a three-year rule, and an effort to make it permanent failed in the state’s senate).\n\nThere are no federal laws governing the use of facial-recognition technology, which has led states, cities, and counties to regulate it on their own in various ways, particularly when it comes to how law enforcement agencies can use it.\n\nGenerally, there are two types of facial-recognition software: one compares a photo of a person to those in a database of faces looking for a likely match (the kind of software police might use when investigating a crime, such as that sold by Clearview AI), while the other compares a photo of a person to one other image (the kind that is used when you open your iPhone with your face).\n\nThe technology has been used increasingly across the United States in recent years, but it has also been blasted by privacy and digital rights groups over privacy issues and other real and potential dangers: The technology has been shown to be less accurate when identifying people of color, and several Black men, at least, have been wrongfully arrested due to the use of facial recognition.\n\nTo Adam Schwartz, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the bans and subsequent changes represent a “pendulum swing.”\n\nAn NOPD officer stands before an empty Bourbon Street on February 16, 2021 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nRoughly two dozen facial-recognition bans of various types have been enacted in communities and a few states across the United States since 2019. Many of them came in 2020; as Schwartz pointed out, there was a push in favor of limiting police use of surveillance technology surrounding the protests that came in the wake of the fatal arrest of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers in May of that year. Then, in the past year, “the pendulum has swung a bit more in the law-and-order direction,” he said.\n\n“In American politics there are swings between being afraid of government surveillance and being afraid of crime. And in the short term there seems to have been a swing in favor of fear of crime,” he said, adding that the EFF is “optimistic” that the overall trend is toward limiting government use of such surveillance technologies.\n\nReversals in New Orleans and Virginia\n\nWhen New Orleans approved a ban of facial-recognition technology in late 2020 as part of a broader ordinance to regulate numerous surveillance technologies in the city, six of the seven council members at the time voted in favor of it (one was absent). By contrast, when the votes were tallied in July for the ordinance that would allow police to use facial-recognition technology, four council members voted for it and two voted against it (one counsel member was absent).\n\nThe turnabout less than two years later comes after a rise in homicides, following a decline from 2016 to 2019.\n\nThe new rule lets city police request the use of facial-recognition software to aid investigations related to a wide range of violent crimes, including murder, rape, kidnap, and robbery.\n\nIn a statement applauding the city council’s July 21 vote in favor of facial-recognition technology, New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell said, “I am grateful that the women and men of the NOPD now have this valuable, force multiplying tool that will help take dangerous criminals off our streets.”\n\nYet Lesli Harris, a New Orleans city council member who opposed the July ordinance, is concerned about how the legislation could impact the civil rights of people in the city. “As a woman of color it’s hard for me to be in favor of facial recognition,” Harris said, pointing out that studies that have shown that the technology can be less accurate at recognizing people of color, and women of color in particular.\n\nIn Virginia, legislation that went into effect last July banned local law enforcement and campus police from using facial-recognition technology unless the state legislature first passed a rule allowing it. The state’s 2022 legislation, which became effective in July, essentially reverses that 2021 rule by allowing the use of the technology by local and campus police in certain situations.\n\nScott Surovell, a Virginia state senator who introduced the newer rule, said it is meant chiefly as a “lead generator” that police would have to independently corroborate before arresting a suspect. He also pointed out that, while the 2021 legislation stopped local police from using facial-recognition software, it didn’t prevent Virginia state law enforcement from doing so, or from using it on behalf of local police.\n\nThe 2022 legislation requires police agencies using facial-recognition software to publish a report each year about how it is being used. It also requires that police only use facial-recognition software that has been deemed at least 98% accurate across all demographics measured by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a branch of the US Commerce Department whose functions include measuring the accuracy of facial-recognition algorithms that companies and researchers submit to its lab.\n\nSeeking more guardrails\n\nIt’s still largely unknown how often facial-recognition technology is being used and where in the United States. The US government has embraced it for years and Clearview AI alone has said it counts over 3,100 US agencies among its customers, including the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and “hundreds of local agencies.”\n\nSurovell hopes more rules will be passed to regulate the technology in other states, similar to how law enforcement use of technologies such as radar, breath testing, and substance analysis are already regulated.\n\n“I think it’s important for the public to have faith in how law enforcement is doing their job, that these technologies be regulated and there be a level of transparency about their use so people can assess for themselves whether it’s accurate and or being abused,” he said.\n\nBut if recent developments are any indication, getting there may be a bumpy ride.\n\nIn New Orleans, an amendment that Harris and two other council members supported that would set guardrails regarding how facial-recognition technology can be used by the city’s police department — such as requiring court approval each time it is used and monthly reports about how it has been used — failed in July. Chris Kaiser, advocacy director for the ACLU of Louisiana, said he was concerned about this, in addition to the change in the city’s rules regarding the use of facial-recognition software in general.\n\n“We can’t understand why you would object to these safeguards,” he said.\n\nThe trio of New Orleans council members tried a second time on Thursday: Their proposed amendment — which was modified in several ways, including removing the need for judicial approval before the use of the technology and requiring quarterly, rather than monthly, reports regarding its use — was voted on once again.

We refused,” Clegg, the newly-appointed president of global affairs at Facebook-parent Meta, said in the statement. “Ordinary Russians are using our apps to express themselves and organize for action. We want them to continue to make their voices heard.”\n\nIn the days following that statement, Clegg has announced new safety features for users in Russia and Ukraine, crackdowns on Russian state-media on its platforms, and other steps Meta is taking to address the conflict, including communicating with foreign governments about the issue. Zuckerberg, meanwhile, has not yet publicly commented on the conflict.\n\nThe statements underscore Clegg’s ascent to being the policy face of Meta, following his promotion last month. But they also hint at how Zuckerberg may be trying to pull off a disappearing act of sorts. The CEO and founder, according to former insiders and industry watchers, appears to be attempting to reduce his visibility — and potentially the scrutiny he faces — on the world stage even as he runs a suite of platforms with a collective user base far larger than any country.\n\nClegg, the former UK deputy prime minister who has worked as Meta’s vice president of global affairs and communications since 2018, was already involved in policy matters and routinely served as an aggressive public voice for the company. But with his promotion last month, Zuckeberg said Clegg will now “lead and represent us for all of our policy issues globally.” Zuckerberg also said the change would free up his own time to work on product and technology as the company invests in its vision for a virtual and augmented reality-enabled future, and would let COO Sheryl Sandberg focus more on its business, which currently faces a host of challenges.\n\nAs Meta pushes forward with its multibillion-dollar bet to reshape the company, Zuckerberg will get to focus on his vision for building a (currently still conceptual) “metaverse,” while Clegg will be tasked with explaining and justifying it and the company’s other actions to lawmakers, regulators and the public.\n\n“When I look at this, the promotion of Nick Clegg in a sense doesn’t change anything for his role, but I think the idea is to give him a title so big that Zuckerberg doesn’t have to testify [at government hearings] anymore,” said Roger McNamee, a former Facebook investor and advisor to Zuckerberg who in 2019 published the book “Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe.”\n\nBut, he added, “it’s very clear to me that Mark’s vision is driving the company right now.”\n\nMeta declined to comment on this story.\n\nSome Meta followers say the leadership shuffle seems to mirror similar moves made by other tech founders, including Microsoft (MSFT)’s Bill Gates, Amazon (AMZN)’s Jeff Bezos and Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google (GOOG), all of whom stepped away from public-facing roles as their businesses faced growing scrutiny -— while retaining immense control and influence over the companies. Like those founders, Zuckerberg remains the largest shareholder with tremendous influence over Meta’s business. Unlike those founders, he also remains CEO.\n\nBut in some ways, it also represents an attempt to return to a time when Facebook was less under fire.\n\nA return to simpler times\n\nBefore 2016, the division of labor among Facebook’s top brass looked different: Zuckerberg handled the engineering and product side of the business, and Sandberg handled “everything else,” according to Nu Wexler, who worked as a spokesperson for the company from 2017 to 2018.\n\nBut that changed, Wexler said, following the US Presidential election in 2016. Facebook started facing more questions about its role in democratic processes and society at large, with Zuckerberg called to testify several times before Congress and the European Parliament in the years that followed.\n\nClegg was hired by the company in 2018 against that backdrop. Although his own political career was somewhat ill-fated, Clegg’s political experience and connections were seen as assets to the company, amid growing questions from lawmakers and regulators around the world. Both Zuckerberg and Sandberg were said to have been closely involved in recruiting him to the company.\n\nSince then, Facebook-turned-Meta has faced a slew of new PR and policy crises. A short list includes: its 2018 admission that it didn’t do enough to prevent its role in a genocide in Myanmar, European regulators passing data privacy regulations; US antitrust regulators seeking to break up the company; the January 6 Capitol riot that was organized in part on Facebook; and, most recently, the release of the Facebook Papers, which Clegg was involved in addressing last year.\n\nWith his promotion, Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg has effectively become the company's most public face on policy issues. Harry Murphy/Sportsfile for Web Summit/Getty Images\n\nClegg’s elevated profile, Wexler said, shows how the challenges Meta faces on public policy have grown too large to be housed solely within Sandberg’s department. It also underscores how Sandberg’s own responsibilities — particularly wrestling with the future of Meta’s ad business, which is now under threat due to Apple’s ad tracking changes and competition from rivals like TikTok — have given her less time to devote to policy matters.\n\nClegg’s new role means that in addition to handling Meta’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he’ll also likely take a leading role in some of the company’s most pressing upcoming decisions. Those include how to ensure the platform isn’t compromised by misinformation or foreign actors during the upcoming US midterm elections later this year and how to respond to calls to protect children on its platforms.\n\nAn especially important test will come when Meta must decide in January 2023 whether to permit former President Donald Trump back on its platforms ahead of the next presidential election, said Katie Harbarth, a Facebook alum who helped lead the company’s global election efforts until her departure last year. Whether Zuckerberg plays a role in that decision will send an important signal about who is truly in charge, she said.\n\n‘Mark can run, but he can’t hide’\n\nClegg’s promotion undeniably makes him more visible, particularly in international business forums like Davos where being an official member of the C-suite opens many doors, said Harbath. The change may also mean that Clegg will be the executive Meta tries to put forward for future hearings on Capitol Hill and with other government leaders abroad.\n\n“I think that the company got to the realization that Mr. Zuckerberg does not represent the company well externally, especially not in the political context,” Luria said. “That his appearances before Congress probably did the company more damage than they did good and putting somebody like Mr. Clegg in that position seems like a far better choice whenever they can.”\n\nThe question is whether hostile governments around the world will accept Clegg as a spokesman of authority or whether policymakers will continue to demand Zuckerberg. Watch any high-profile Big Tech hearing where a company is represented by anyone other than the CEO and the annoyance among government representatives is palpable.\n\n“At the end of the day, Mark can run, but he can’t hide from the regulatory pressure,” Harbath said. “I really like Nick. I think he is going to be a really great person to talk to policymakers and relate to them. But I don’t think it’s going to stop people from wanting to talk to Mark.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Brian Fung", "Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/tech/us-chip-manufacturing-semiconductors", "title": "The US is spending billions to boost chip manufacturing. Will it be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States government is pulling out all the stops to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing, injecting billions of dollars into the beleaguered sector and flexing all policy muscles available to give it a leg up over competition from Asia.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, firms initially curtailed orders for these micro building blocks needed for smartphones, computers, cars and many other products. Then, as people began working from home, demand soared for information and communication technology – and the chips that power them. A chip shortage ensued, and auto plants had to stop production because they could not obtain chips. This contributed to skyrocketing new and used vehicle prices, a major driver of the painful inflation Americans were feeling.\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo dubbed the semiconductor shortage a “national security” issue because it exposed the dependency of US manufacturing on imports of semiconductors from abroad. Chips also serve critical military applications and are necessary for cybersecurity tools.\n\nThe Biden administration and lawmakers rallied in response, passing the CHIPS and Science Act into law in August. The legislation includes $52 billion to strengthen semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Of this, $39 billion is earmarked for manufacturing incentives, $13.2 billion for research and development and workforce training, and $500 million for international information communications technology security and semiconductor supply chain activities.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, several prominent companies have announced significant investments in US manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a powerhouse in the industry committed at least $12 billion to build a semiconductor fabrication plant in Arizona, with production expected to begin in 2024. At the start of the year, Intel said it planned to build a $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio, and groundbreaking for the new chip plant took place just last month. And this month, Micron said it would invest up to $100 billion over the next two decades to build a massive semiconductor factory in upstate New York.\n\nIn a flurry of tweets earlier this month President Joe Biden pledged: “America is going to lead the way in microchip manufacturing.”\n\nBut the US has much catching up to do. US-based fabs, or chip manufacturing plants, currently only account for 12% of the world’s modern semiconductor manufacturing capacity, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association trade group. Some 75% of the world’s modern chip manufacturing is now concentrated in East Asia – a majority of that in geopolitically-vulnerable Taiwan. And even with these renewed efforts, the United States does not currently have the same talent and supply chain pipeline as some Asian markets do to support a robust homegrown industry.\n\nA chip by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is seen at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference in Nanjing in China's eastern Jiangsu province on August 26, 2020. STR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTo complicate matters, the surge in public and private investments comes at a questionable time, as concerns over the global chip supply shortage have eased. Pandemic-related supply chain blockages are letting up somewhat and a worsening economic outlook has hampered demand.\n\nIn an earnings call last week, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei warned it expects the “semiconductor industry will likely decline” in 2023. “TSMC also is not immune,” Wei added, but said it expects “to be more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry.”\n\nPromoting semiconductor manufacturing in the United States now may risk leading to overcapacity and excess supply. And with demand weakening, it isn’t immediately clear if government subsidies will be enough to overcome other obstacles the country faces in developing a competitive semiconductor manufacturing hub.\n\nUnderstanding the US problems\n\nTo understand the latest US efforts, it’s important to be clear on where the country stands – not just in the overall chip industry, but in relation to specific, valuable pockets of it.\n\n“The US is very unlikely to increase its share of global production because even as the US brings online more fab capacity; TSMC, Intel and others are announcing fabs in other places and building them even more quickly,” said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n“But I don’t necessarily think that’s really a huge problem,” he added. He noted that measuring manufacturing based on pure output lumps together the lower-end chips and the cutting-edge, higher-end chips that are a more realistic and significant measure of chip manufacturing success. “The US does need to expand chip production for a specific kind of chips, that are directly related to American national security,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration last Friday imposed sweeping new export curbs designed to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors made with US equipment, in a move that targets the manufacturing of advanced weapons systems.\n\nWhile only “about 10% to 14% of chips sold [globally] come from US manufacturing facilities,” according to Columbia Business School professor Dan Wang, the United States does have other strengths. “In terms of design expertise, a lot of that still resides in the U.S.”\n\nTechnicians inspect a piece of equipment during a tour of the Micron Technology automotive chip manufacturing plant Feb. 11, 2022, in Manassas, Va. Steve Helber/AP\n\nStill, the shortcomings are real. “When it comes to foundries, which are the manufacturing side of semiconductors, the U.S. has not really been a major player for many, many years,” said Wang. While it very much used to be, manufacturing began migrating to Asia during the 1980s and ’90s, Wang said. “One of the big reasons for this is that the cost of labor is lower, and it’s just far cheaper to produce at a very massive scale, integrated circuits and chips, in those parts of the world,” Wang added. Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, said that it costs 50% more to manufacture chips in the U.S. than in Taiwan.\n\nNow, simply having the facilities already set up to produce or expand chip manufacturing gives Asia a big advantage. Wang said he thinks that might be why you see the U.S. “axe-throwing so much money at companies to set up plants in the United States.” It’s not just to respond to demand and become more self-reliant, “but also because you need to get these things up and running very, very quickly, in order to even be in the race at all.”\n\nWhat it takes to build up a domestic chip industry\n\nBuilding new chip fabs itself is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. “A modern fab is something like half a million square feet,” said Bob Johnson, an analyst at Gartner, and requires “monstrous clean rooms that have massive air handling capabilities.” He added that these massive buildings require “exceptionally strong foundations.” As he put it, “you cannot have any vibration in the fab because it can wreck the manufacturing process.”\n\nIn addition, a single extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, required to map out the circuitry of chips, costs about $150 million, and Reuters reports “a cutting-edge chip plant needs 9-18 of these machines.”\n\nMoreover, the manufacturing of semiconductors requires a range of specialized inputs, including pure chemicals such as fluorinated polyimide, and etching gas, chip etching machines, and more. In places like Taiwan and Fukuoka, Japan, supply chains have developed where the providers of these products are located close to the semiconductor factories. There are also one or two companies that produce vital inputs and that have been trustworthy suppliers to companies in Asia for a long time. This is not yet the case in places like Arizona and Ohio, where plans to build massive chip manufacturing plants are already underway.\n\nYou also need a labor force willing and able to do the work.\n\nIn the United States, there is both a shortage of new graduates and experienced workers with the technical and engineering knowledge necessary to manufacture semiconductors. Many of those who might have the right experience instead prefer to work in trendier industries, according to Kennedy.\n\n“If we were to today, snap our fingers and have ten new fabs with the world’s leading chips, we probably wouldn’t have enough people to staff them,” Kennedy said. “That’s the biggest bottleneck to the expansion of America’s fab capacity, not capital.”\n\nIntel has tried to establish close relations with Arizona State University to recruit engineers, but it is unclear whether it and other companies building fabs in America will be able to hire enough trained engineers and technicians. If not, even the billions of dollars committed by the private and public sector may not be enough to reshore semiconductor manufacturing.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/tech/discord-teens", "title": "The dark side of Discord for teens | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nWhen a mother in Washington state learned her teenage daughter was on Discord, a popular social media platform, she felt reasonably comfortable with the idea of her using it to communicate with members of her high school marching band.\n\nBut in September, the mother discovered the 16-year-old was also using the audio and chat service to message with someone who appeared from his profile picture to be an older man. The stranger, who said he lived in England, entered a group chat that included her daughter and members of the band, according to the mother. They struck up a friendship in a private thread. He asked for nude pictures; her daughter obliged.\n\n“I went through every chat they ever had but the most disturbing thing, beyond the nudes, was that he asked her to send a picture of our house,” said the mother, who, like other parents of young Discord users, asked to remain anonymous, citing concerns about their family’s privacy. “My daughter went on Zillow, found our home and sent it, so he knew where she lives. He then asked what American school buses looked like, so she took a photo of her bus and sent it.” He then requested pictures of her friends, and she sent those, too.\n\nThe mother worried the Discord user was manipulating, tracking and planning to exploit her daughter. After shutting down her daughter’s Discord account, an effort she said took six weeks for the company to complete, she installed outdoor security cameras around the home. The mother never reported the incident to Discord, and the conversations are no longer available to flag because the account was deleted. “There’s lots of things we should have done in hindsight,” she said.\n\nIn recent months, large social media companies have faced renewed scrutiny from lawmakers over the negative impacts their platforms can have on teens. Executives from Facebook (FB), Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat’s parent company were called to testify before the Senate after leaks from a Facebook (FB) whistleblower pointed to Instagram’s potential to harm one’s mental health and body image, especially among teenage girls.\n\nLawmakers are now weighing legislation to protect kids online – a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate last month which proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harms. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nDiscord, however, has not been part of that conversation. Launched in 2015, Discord is less well-known among parents than big names like Instagram, even as it surged to 150 million monthly active users globally during the pandemic. The service, which is known for its video game communities, is also less intuitive for some parents, blending the feel of early AOL chat rooms or work chat app Slack with the chaotic, personalized world of MySpace. While much of the focus from lawmakers with other platforms has been on scrutinizing more sophisticated technologies like algorithms, which can surface potentially harmful content to younger users, parents’ concerns about Discord recall an earlier era of the internet: anonymous chat rooms.\n\nDiscord is less well-known among parents than big names like Instagram, even as it surged to 150 million monthly active users globally during the pandemic. Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDiscord’s users, about 79% of which are located outside of North America, engage in public and private chats or channels, called servers, on varying topics, including music interests, Harry Potter and Minecraft, and homework help. Some, like a room for memes, can have hundreds of thousands of members. But the vast majority are private, invite-only spaces with fewer than 10 people, according to Discord. All servers are private by default, and only channels with more than 200 members are discoverable in its search tool if the administrator wants it to be public, the company added.\n\nStill, it’s possible for minors to connect with people they don’t know on public servers or in private chats if the stranger was invited by someone else in the room or if the channel link is dropped into a public group that the user accessed. By default, all users – including users ages 13 to 17 – can receive friend invitations from anyone in the same server, which then opens up the ability for them to send private messages.\n\nCNN Business spoke to nearly a dozen parents who shared stories about their teenagers being exposed to self-harm chats, sexually explicit content and sexual predators on the platform, including users they believed were older men seeking inappropriate pictures and videos.\n\nOne mother from Charlotte, North Carolina said her 13-year-old daughter’s mental health was impacted after a Discord chat room involving her interests took a turn. “The group eventually started talking about cutting themselves, shared tips on how to hide it from parents, and suggested advice on how to run away from home,” the mother told CNN. “I later found out she was actively engaging in self-harm and had planned to run away to Alabama to visit a friend she made on Discord.”\n\nA father outside Boston, who initially didn’t think much of his 13-year-old daughter downloading Discord last summer “because she’s a gamer,” later discovered she had been talking with a man in his 30s who was looking for photos of her and wanted to engage in “naughty cam” activities, in messages reviewed by CNN Business.\n\nThe father said he also later learned some of his daughter’s classmates actively use Discord throughout the day unbeknownst to the school.\n\n“The school actively blocks apps such as Snapchat and Instagram when they log onto the school network on school devices, but teens are using other platforms like Discord that aren’t on their radar,” the father said. “It is the wild west of social media.”\n\nCNN Business reported several of these cases to Discord – with the parents’ permission – ahead of this article’s publication. After launching a series of investigations, the company said it took action against some accounts but said it does not publicly comment on specific cases or user accounts.\n\nMany of the parents CNN Business spoke with said they did not enable any of the offered parental controls at the time, mostly because they were in the dark about how the platform works. If enabled, those parental control tools, including one that prohibits a minor from receiving a friend request or a direct message from someone they don’t know, likely could have prevented many of these incidents. Some parents also expressed frustration with how Discord responded to their incidents once they were reported and struggled with the fact that audio chats on Discord don’t leave a written record and can prove to be more difficult to moderate.\n\nData on the frequency of such incidents is hard to come by. One recent report from Bark, a paid monitoring service that screens more than 30 apps and platforms, including emails and personal messages, for terms and phrases that could indicate concerns for the nearly 6 million children it protects, said Discord ranked among the top five apps or platforms for content flagged by its algorithms for severe violence, bullying, sexual content and suicidal ideation.\n\nIn its most recent transparency report, Discord said it removed more than 470,000 non-spam accounts between January and June 2021, a significant rise from 266,075 account deletions during the second half of 2020. “Exploitative content made a particularly large contribution to this overall rise,” said the report, which describes it as an umbrella category which encompasses sexually explicit material. The category went from around 130,000 removals in the second half of 2020 to 238,000 in the first half of 2021, and the removal of exploitative content servers – which Discord defines as non-consensual pornography and sexual content related to minors – nearly doubled to more than 11,000.\n\nHowever, Discord told CNN Business that child sexual abuse material and grooming — a term that refers to an adult forging an emotional connection with a minor so they can manipulate, abuse or exploit them — makes up a small percentage of activity on the service.\n\nIn response to questions about the incidents parents shared with CNN Business, John Redgrave, the company’s VP of trust and safety, said “this behavior is appalling, unacceptable, and has no place on Discord.”\n\n“It’s our highest priority for our communities to have a safe experience on the service, which is why we continuously invest in new tools to protect teens and remove harmful content from the service, and have built a team dedicated to this work,” Redgrave said in a statement. “We also invest in education, so that parents know how our service works and understand the account controls that can contribute to a positive, safe experience for their teens.”\n\nRedgrave added: “We built Discord to foster a sense of belonging and community, and it’s deeply concerning to our whole company when it is misused. We must and will do better.”\n\nBut some experts argue the concerns that parents raised with Discord are innate to its design model.\n\n“With Discord, you subscribe to channels and engage in private chat, which is a veil of privacy and secrecy in the way it is constructed,” said Danielle Citron, a law professor at University of Virginia who focuses on digital privacy issues. While some larger social networks have faced scrutiny around harassment and other issues, much of that activity is “public facing,” she said. “Discord is newer to the party and so much of it is happening behind closed doors.”\n\nA gaming tool goes mainstream\n\nDiscord started with aspirations to become a game developer studio called Hammer & Chisel but shifted to focus on its communication tool after a multiplayer game it created never caught on. Its use of voice-over-video and screen sharing was a draw for gamers, allowing them to interact with friends or others while playing video games. In June 2020, the company announced a rebranding effort to grow beyond gaming; now about 80% of active Discord users report they either use the service mainly for non-gaming purposes, or use it equally for gaming and other purposes, according to the company.\n\nThe company, which employs 600 people globally, said it makes its money through a subscription service called Nitro, which provides an enhanced Discord experience, such as customizing profiles with unique tags, accessing animated emojis, uploading large files and “boosting” users’ favorite servers. In September 2021, Discord announced it raised $500 million in a funding round, placing its valuation at around $15 billion. Earlier in the year, the Wall Street Journal reported it walked away from a deal to be acquired by Microsoft for at least $10 billion. The company is widely expected to be moving toward a potential initial public offering.\n\nLike other social platforms, Discord said it saw a jump in usage as people were stuck at home during the pandemic, going from 56 million monthly active users in 2019 to 150 million in September 2021. Like other platforms, it has also had to confront extreme content, including from far right and conspiracy groups. And while users must be 13 years of age or older to join, problems exist with age verification, just as on other platforms.\n\nAmanda Schneider said an older man pursued an inappropriate relationship with her 13-year-old son on Discord. \"It was just awful; there was no help at all.\" Courtesy Amanda Schneider\n\nSimilar to Reddit, there are moderators for channels who are responsible for enforcing the company’s community guidelines and their own chat room rules. They are directly able to investigate a situation and then warn, quarantine, or ban users from channels. Discord also has an in-house Trust & Safety team of full-time employees who investigate and respond to user reports. According to Discord, they can rely on a mix of proactive and reactive ways to keep the platform safe, including automated search tools that scan photos and videos for exploitative content.\n\nThe company said it’s made an increased effort around boosting its safety protocols across its platform in the last year, working to scale reactive operations and improve methods to proactively detect and remove abuse. It continues to roll out more account controls through its Safety Center, which includes the ability to block offensive users, restrict explicit content, control who messages you and set up server rules and permissions within communities. It has also partnered with ConnectSafely, a nonprofit dedicated to internet safety, to create a parent’s guide to Discord of recommended safety settings for teens, and is hosting “listening sessions” with National Parent Teacher Association chapters to increase awareness and usage of Discord’s safety features and practices.\n\nDiscord said parents can request that their child’s account be deleted by sending an email associated with the account to confirm they are the child’s guardian. This process may require some back and forth with the Trust & Safety team to help the parent through the process, according to the company.\n\nDiscord also said it plans to turn off the default option for minors to receive friend invitations or private messages from anyone in the same server as part of a future safety update.\n\nThe company recently updated its terms of service and privacy policy to take into account the off-platform behaviors committed by its users to assess violations of its community guidelines, including for sexualizing children. (Other large platforms, including Twitter and Twitch, began taking into account a user’s activity off their platforms several years ago, such as being affiliated with a violent organization, as part of their efforts to crack down on abusive behavior.)\n\nBut problems persist. Many of the parents CNN spoke with said they believe Discord is not doing enough to protect its young users.\n\n‘There was no help at all’\n\nOne mother from Los Angeles who submitted a report to Discord said the company was unable to help her after a man struck up a conversation with her 10-year-old daughter who started sending her links to BDSM pornography. (Discord requires users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with other social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.) The mother received an automated email from its Trust and Security team.\n\n“We’re sorry to hear that you came across this type of content, and we understand that this can be extremely concerning,” said the Discord response, reviewed by CNN Business. “Unfortunately, we’re unable to locate the content with the information you’ve provided. We understand this may be uncomfortable but, if possible, please send us the message links to the reported content for the team to review and take appropriate action.”\n\nAfter the mother sent Discord the requested links more than a year ago, the company never responded. Although the company told CNN Business it does not comment on specific reported cases, it said it reviews all reports of inappropriate content with a minor, investigates the behavior and takes appropriate action.\n\nRich Wistocki teaching people about social media safety practices. As with other social platforms, parents with kids on Discord should abide by age restrictions and enable parental controls, he said. Courtesy Rich Wistocki\n\nAmanda Schneider, who lives outside Phoenix, said she was also disappointed with how the platform handled her concerns when she said a man in his late 20s pursued an inappropriate relationship with her 13-year-old son, asking the teenager to masturbate and tell him about it afterward.\n\n“Discord told me I couldn’t do anything unless I had specific links to the text thread that showed my son verifying his age — such as typing ‘I am 13,’ which was shared through a voice [chat] — and the other person verifying his age before an incident happened,” said Schneider.\n\n“It was just awful; there was no help at all,” she said. After she reported the incident to law enforcement, she learned he was a registered sex offender and had been arrested, according to Schneider.\n\nThe company told CNN Business the reason it requires links to the chat and cannot use screenshots or attachments to verify content is to prevent users from potentially falsifying information to get others in trouble. It added that parents have the ability to use its report form to flag specific users to the Trust & Safety team.\n\nAccording to Citron, the law professor at the University of Virginia, voice-to-voice chats on Discord make reporting even harder for parents. “Unlike text conversations, predators thrive in the voice space because there isn’t a record,” she said. “When a parent goes to report that a kid has been engaging with someone [inappropriately] or that they’re being groomed by a sexual predator, there’s often no proof [because audio isn’t saved].”\n\nDiscord said its rules and standards around audio are the same as its text and image policies. But it told CNN Business that like other platforms, audio presents a different set of challenges for moderation than text-based communication. Discord said it does not store or record voice chats, but its team investigates reports of misuse and looks at information from text-based channels as part of that process.\n\nWhat parents can do\n\nSome parents like Stephane Cotichini, a professional video game developer, believe Discord can be a positive platform for young users if the right parental controls are in place. His teenage sons who use the site for gaming have a handful of Discord’s features enabled, such as restricting direct messages to only friends.\n\n“I know Discord can be problematic, but it’s important for me as a parent to not simply prohibit these things because of the dangers but teach my kids about how to navigate them and balance limiting it,” he said. “To my knowledge, I’ve never had an issue with any of my boys.”\n\nCotichini, who uses Discord to chat with his own team at work, said the platform is a valuable place for other gamers to drop into his servers and weigh in on what they’re developing in real time. He also attributes the platform to encouraging his sons’ love of gaming; two have already made their own programs, including one who won an award at the XPrize Connect Code Games Challenge in 2021.\n\nThe Discord app as seen on an iPhone Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\n“If at a young age I can get them to spend a percentage of their time creating content as opposed to consuming, I feel like I’m somehow succeeding,” he said.\n\nAs with other social platforms, parents with kids on Discord should abide by age restrictions and enable parental controls, said Rich Wistocki, a former detective in Illinois who now runs Be Sure Cyber training to help parents, school administrators and law enforcement learn more about the dangers of social media. In the event of an incident, he said parents should take screenshots of the chat, pictures, video, user ID and save links to the text in the channel when reporting it.\n\n“Parents often don’t think these things will happen to their kids,” he said. “More can be done to prevent these incidents from continuing.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/tech/social-media-response-russia-ukraine", "title": "Here's how social media platforms are responding to Russia's ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nUkraine’s official Twitter account wants @Russia to be removed from the platform. YouTube is facing scrutiny for allowing a Russian broadcaster who is widely viewed as part of the country’s propaganda machine to continue making money from ads on the video site. And TikTok, a service that didn’t even exist during the 2014 crisis in Ukraine over Russia’s annexation of Crimea, is now offering an unprecedented close-up of the front lines through videos — some authentic, others not.\n\nSocial media companies have in recent years grappled with how to handle misinformation and conspiracy theories about a pandemic, a fraught US presidential election and an insurrection, often while facing intense criticism from lawmakers for doing too little or too much. Now, the platforms are scrambling to confront a growing list of challenges, some of which appear to be almost unheard of in their histories, as war unfolds in Europe.\n\nOn Thursday, Twitter faced a new kind of moderation decision when the verified account for the country of Ukraine posted: “hey people, let’s demand @Twitter to remove @Russia from here … they should not be allowed to use these platforms to promote their image while brutally killing the Ukrainian people @TwitterSupport.” Twitter spokesperson Trenton Kennedy declined to comment on whether Twitter might remove the official Russian account referenced in the tweet, or the Kremlin’s verified account, from the platform.\n\n“That question of should we let state actors that prevent their own citizens from seeing the free expression on these [Western social media] platforms have the right to use those platforms as mouthpieces for their own propaganda is a really nuanced and complex topic,” Renee DiResta, technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, told CNN Business\n\nOther challenges from the conflict are familiar to the major platforms, such as how to prevent the rapid spread of misinformation. But given the life-or-death circumstances and Russia’s history of deploying propaganda and covert online manipulation, the stakes are heightened.\n\nAfter Russia’s invasion of Ukraine officially began, social media was flooded with photos of bombed out buildings, first-person accounts from Ukrainian civilians fleeing their homes, and even videos purporting to be from soldiers engaged in the fighting. Users were left to sort through what might be real or old, fake or manipulated content meant to sow confusion and discord in a conflict that is being waged in part through the use of propaganda.\n\nIn one instance, a video appearing to show a soldier parachuting into the conflict went viral on TikTok Thursday morning, racking up millions of views. But the video had originally been posted to Instagram about seven years ago, NBC disinformation reporter Ben Collins noted on Twitter. In some other cases, clips from video games or videos from old conflicts recirculated on the platform, purporting to show what was happening in Ukraine.\n\nThe social media companies should be “making sure there’s no overt manipulation on their platforms, and then trying to surface accurate information, particularly within trends, to help the public understand what’s going on,” DiResta said. “In these moments, there is always going to be something that gets through unfortunately, so I think … the platforms being as transparent as they can be is very important.”\n\nTwitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB) parent company Meta both told CNN Business that they have teams monitoring for misinformation, coordinated inauthentic behavior and other potential issues related to the conflict. TikTok did not respond to requests for comment about its response to the war on their platforms.\n\nEven with those preparations, there have already been some missteps.\n\nTwitter faced backlash in the days leading up to the invasion for having briefly removed the accounts of open source researchers who had been sharing information on the platform about the movement of Russian troops and equipment. Twitter’s head of site integrity, Yoel Roth, said on Twitter Wednesday that the removals were due to a “small number of human errors” made as part of an effort to enforce the company’s policies against manipulated media. Twitter said the accounts were quickly restored.\n\n“Twitter’s top priority is keeping people safe,” Twitter spokesperson Trenton Kennedy said in a statement. “As we do around major global events, our safety and integrity teams are monitoring for potential risks associated with the conflict to protect the health of the service, including identifying and disrupting attempts to amplify false and misleading information and to advance the speed and scale of our enforcement.”\n\nTwitter on Thursday and Friday had its executives promoting live audio discussions on Twitter Spaces about the conflict being held by reporters at major news outlets. The company also shared a series of safety tips for users on the ground in Ukraine or Russia, and curated a Twitter “moment” where it is compiling the latest updates from reliable sources. Twitter also launched a feature allowing users to affix a sensitive content warning to photos and videos they tweet, and on Friday paused advertisements in Russia and Ukraine “to ensure critical public safety information is elevated.”\n\nOn Facebook, the war in Ukraine has yet to be added to the platform’s “crisis response” page as an event where users can mark themselves safe. But the company did spin up a new feature that allows users in Ukraine to lock their profiles for “an extra layer of privacy and security protection.” On Instagram, the platform is showing users in the country alerts on how to protect their accounts.\n\n“We have established a Special Operations Center to respond to activity across our platform in real time,” Meta spokesperson Dani Lever told CNN Business Thursday. “It is staffed by experts from across the company, including native speakers, to allow us to closely monitor the situation so we can remove content that violates our Community Standards faster,” Lever said.\n\nOn YouTube, videos from Russian state-funded television network RT continued to run advertisements as of Friday morning. That means the media company whose American arm was forced by the US Justice Department in 2017 to register as a “foreign agent” and that intelligence researchers have said “conducts strategic messaging for [the] Russian government” continues to be able to monetize its presence on the video-sharing platform. YouTube labels RT’s videos with a disclaimer that it is funded by the Russian government.\n\nYouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi declined to comment about RT directly, but said Google is evaluating what new US sanctions and export controls may mean for YouTube and its other platforms.\n\nGoogle Europe said on Twitter it was enhancing security controls for users in Ukraine, and that its intel teams were working to address disinformation campaigns, hacking and “financially motivated abuse.”\n\n“On YouTube, we’re prominently surfacing videos from trusted news sources and working hard to remove content that violates our policies,” Google said. “Over the last few days, we’ve removed hundreds of channels & thousands of videos.”\n\nTaking action on Russian accounts carries its own risks for the platforms, however.\n\nOn Friday, the Russian government moved to “partially restrict” Facebook access in the country after accusing the platform of unlawful censorship. Russia’s ministry of communications claimed Facebook had “violated the rights and freedoms of Russian citizens” when the social network on Thursday allegedly clamped down on several Russian media outlets on its platform.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Meta global affairs president Nick Clegg said Russia had ordered the company to “stop the independent fact-checking and labelling” of four Russian outlets.\n\n“We refused,” Clegg said in a statement. “Ordinary Russians are using our apps to express themselves and organize for action. We want them to continue to make their voices heard, share what’s happening, and organize.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Brian Fung", "Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/tech/facebook-diem-association-dissolving", "title": "Facebook's dream of creating its own global cryptocurrency officially ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIn June 2019, after years of being under scrutiny for the impact its platforms have on society, Facebook unveiled one of its most ambitious projects yet: a cryptocurrency called Libra, which would be backed by an international consortium of companies. The effort had such lofty goals as providing financial services to the underbanked and extending the social media company’s mission of connecting the world into the burgeoning market for digital money.\n\nLibra was originally slated to launch within less than a year. Two and a half years later, the project — renamed Diem last year — has officially unraveled after various setbacks and regulatory pressure made it impossible to get off the ground.\n\nOn Monday, the Facebook-backed Diem Association announced it would dissolve and sell off the intellectual property and other assets related to running its planned cryptocurrency network to Silvergate Capital Corporation, in a deal valued at $182 million. The Diem Association expects to begin “winding down” in the coming weeks, according to the announcement.\n\nThe project was dogged from the start by concerns from regulators, lawmakers and other financial services industry watchers about a cryptocurrency run by Facebook (now called Meta), which has struggled to prevent issues such as crime and abuses of user data on its existing platforms. And Diem’s end is a sign that regulators, who have explored a range of ways to crack down on Meta but have yet to act on much of it, do hold some sway over the tech giant and its ability to expand into new product areas.\n\n“Despite giving us positive substantive feedback on the design of the network, it nevertheless became clear from our dialogue with federal regulators that the project could not move ahead,” Diem Association CEO Stuart Levey said in a statement Monday. He added that the group believes its work on Diem will inform future projects that could “deliver the benefits that motivated the Diem Association from the beginning.”\n\nSilvergate plans to use the Diem assets to continue investing in building a stablecoin and a global payments network built on the blockchain, the company said in a statement.\n\nComplicated from the start\n\nWhen Facebook announced Libra, the plan was to create a universal cryptocurrency that could be accessed by digital wallets — all of which would be built on the blockchain, the technology that underpins other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. In theory, that could make it cheaper and easier to send money and pay for things anywhere in the world. Libra, it said, would be backed by a reserve of fiat currencies, such as the dollar and euro, to help prevent the volatility that has plagued other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe structure and governance of the project was complicated from the get-go, which likely didn’t help garner regulatory support. Though Facebook (FB) launched the project, the company said it would not govern Libra and its reserve; that duty would fall to the Switzerland-based Libra Association, a group initially comprised of more than two-dozen companies and nonprofits that included Facebook (FB) but also PayPal (PYPL), Lyft (LYFT) and others. Facebook (FB) started an internal unit called Calibra, which was to create a digital wallet that people could connect to using their Facebook (FB) accounts to send and receive Libra. But it also said other companies would be able to create Libra wallets.\n\nRegulators and lawmakers in the United States and elsewhere were almost immediately suspicious of a new currency that would be available to Facebook’s billions of users at a time when most countries lack the regulatory infrastructure to effectively oversee digital money. They worried that Libra could threaten national currencies like the US dollar and financial markets, and that it could enable cybercrimes and compromise user privacy. They also worried that the project could give Facebook even more power.\n\n“We need to get the message loud and clear to [Facebook CEO and cofounder Mark] Zuckerberg that he’s not a country on his own and he cannot always have it his way,” Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat, told reporters months after the project was introduced. Some of the Libra Association’s founding partners, including PayPal, Mastercard and Visa, pulled out of the project as regulatory scrutiny ramped up.\n\nHearings, name changes and a key executive departure\n\nFacebook and members of the Libra Association made efforts to engage with regulators, including in Congressional hearings, and made promises to comply with US anti-money laundering and “know your customer” laws, as banks must.\n\nIn his statement Monday, Diem’s Levey said the project had “evolved substantially and improved” as a result of feedback from regulators and governments around the world.\n\nStill, the project dragged on with limited progress. In May 2020, Facebook renamed the Calibra payments unit to “Novi.” About six months later, the Libra Association rebranded as “Diem” to reflect a new, scaled back nature — the coin would now be backed only by the US dollar — and an attempt to distance the effort from Facebook’s early flop in announcing Libra.\n\nIn October 2021, Facebook launched a pilot of its Novi digital wallet, but without Diem. Users could instead send and receive a different digital coin. Shortly after, David Marcus, the leader of Novi who had spearheaded the Libra project, left the company to pursue other projects.\n\nMarcus hinted at the role Facebook’s tainted reputation may have played in the project’s demise in a series of tweets Monday.\n\n“We gave our whole hearts, blood, sweat and tears to what I will always call Libra,” Marcus said. “We were mission driven and in it for the right reasons (that remain as valid today as they were then). Here’s to yet another chapter with a maybe more ‘acceptable’ promoter driving the vision forward.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/03/tech/google-russia-youtube", "title": "Google and Russia's delicate dance | CNN Business", "text": "San Francisco CNN Business —\n\nRussia has spent months either driving out American tech firms or watching them leave of their own accord over its war in Ukraine. But the country now finds itself stuck in a stalemate with one big tech company: Google.\n\nMany of Google’s services, including search, maps, Gmail and, perhaps most importantly, YouTube, continue to be available in Russia at a time when Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are not. The situation illustrates the difficult position both sides now find themselves in and the tenuous current state of Russia’s internet ecosystem. Russia has attempted to wall off its internet from the world but appears to recognize the potential backlash from citizens for banning the most popular services. For its part, Google has spoken out against Russia’s actions but also has strategic and moral incentives to remain.\n\nThe Russian government continues to try to squeeze the Silicon Valley company, opening a new case against Google last Friday for its alleged failure to store data of Russian users inside the country. (Google did not respond to a request for comment on Russia’s move.) Weeks earlier, Google’s Russia subsidiary filed for bankruptcy and paused most of its commercial operations after the government seized control of its bank accounts in the country.\n\n“The Russian authorities’ seizure of Google Russia’s bank account has made it untenable for our Russia office to function, including employing and paying Russia-based employees, paying suppliers and vendors, and meeting other financial obligations,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Business.\n\nHowever, Google has stopped short of pulling out of Russia altogether and Russia has stopped short of forcing it to do so.\n\n“People in Russia rely on our services to access quality information and we’ll continue to keep free services such as Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Android and Play available,” the spokesperson added. (Google has taken some steps to pull back its services in Russia, banning Russian state media channels and preventing them from selling ads while also cracking down on misinformation around the war in Ukraine.)\n\nMeanwhile, Russia’s minister of digital development, Maksut Shadayev, ruled out a total ban on YouTube — one of Russia’s most popular online services. “We are not planning to block YouTube,” Shadayev was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Interfax. “Whenever we block anything, we should clearly understand that no harm will be done to our users,” he added.\n\n‘Last man standing’\n\nFor Google, there is a clear strategic value to keeping its services active in a country with more than 100 million internet users — and a market in which it already has a strong position.\n\n“Various Google services have obtained a significant market share in Russia, which the company may wish to maintain in the hope of an end to the war and lifting of sanctions,” said Mariëlle Wijermars, an assistant professor of cybersecurity and politics at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, whose work focuses on Russian internet policy. “Given Russia’s push towards establishing digital sovereignty, it may be difficult to re-enter the market.”\n\nBut some internet governance experts argue Google’s choice to keep services running in the country may have more of a moral imperative than a business one.\n\n“I think the moral side is a bigger deal,” said Daphne Keller, director of the program on platform regulation at Stanford University’s Cyber Policy Center. “Keeping information flowing to dissidents in Russia, or people who want information from a source other than state media, is incredibly important.”\n\nGoogle did not respond to questions about its motives for keeping its services active in Russia, but YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki last week laid out the role the video platform sees itself playing in the country.\n\n“The reason we are still serving in Russia and we believe that that is important is that we’re able to deliver independent news into Russia,” Wojcicki told an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “And so the average citizen in Russia can access for free the same information that you can access here from Davos, which we believe is really important to be able to help citizens know what’s going on and have perspectives from the outside world.”\n\nYouTube is used by roughly three quarters of Russia’s online population, or more than 77 million people, according to estimates from Insider Intelligence. Despite continued warnings from the Russian government to take down content, YouTube remains one of the few digital links between Russia and the outside world, especially since other global platforms were blocked.\n\n“‪YouTube‬ ‪in‬ ‪particular ‪is‬ ‪kind of the‬ ‪last‬ ‪man‬ ‪standing‬, ‪if‬ ‪you‬ ‪will,” Alina Polyakova, president and CEO of the Washington DC-based Center for European Policy Analysis, told CNN Business. “Google finds itself the last company standing ‪in‬ ‪this‬ ‪broader battle between‬ ‪an‬ ‪authoritarian‬ ‪government‬ ‪and‬ ‪a‬ ‪Western‬ ‪technology‬ ‪company‬ ‪that‬ ‪provides‬ one of the last ‪remaining‬ ‪spaces‬ ‪for‬ free ‪expression in Russia.‬” (Google is one of several companies that CEPA receives “a small part” of its funding from in the form of donations, according to Polyakova.)\n\nWhy Russia blinked with Google\n\nRussia has used the war in Ukraine to step up its effort to wall off its internet from the rest of the world, building what some have described as a digital Iron Curtain. But its decision not to ban Google’s various services shows the limitations of Russia’s more restricted, homegrown internet.\n\nNot only is YouTube popular in the country, but Russian authorities have long used the platform to spread their own messaging, with state media channels such as RT and Sputnik reaching millions of subscribers before they were taken down.\n\n“Russia actively uses YouTube to disseminate propaganda,” Wijermars said. “For reaching younger generations who watch less traditional television, online dissemination of both TV shows and more tailored online formats has been important in order to expand the reach of its narratives.”\n\nUnlike the homegrown social network VK and search engine Yandex, no comparable local alternatives to YouTube exist in Russia (government-backed RuTube has failed to achieve the same level of popularity).\n\n“They don’t have a real domestic alternative, and I do think they fear a backlash because so many Russians use it,” Polyakova said. “And frankly that gives YouTube a lot of leverage.”\n\nYouTube is not the only popular western tech platform Russia has left alone. WhatsApp, the mobile messenger owned by Facebook’s parent company Meta, is still operational, with the Russian government saying it is exempt because it is a private messaging service rather than a public social network. But while Russia’s leniency towards YouTube has thus far extended to Google as a whole, Meta’s other platforms Facebook and Instagram were among the first to be blocked.\n\nYouTube is also just one of a number of Google services that Russians rely on.\n\n“It is unclear what would happen, for example, to its Android operating system, which is widely used in Russia, if Russia forces YouTube out,” said Wijermars. “The long list of technology firms that have announced they will leave the Russian market, together with the impact of sanctions, makes Russia’s digital economy very vulnerable to such disruptions.”\n\nFor the moment, it appears that Russia and Google are both willing to drag their feet and dare the other side to cut the cord.\n\n“I think certainly the Russian government is playing a very delicate game here,” said Polyakova. “There’s obviously a line that they don’t want to cross and force this company out completely.”", "authors": ["Rishi Iyengar"], "publish_date": "2022/06/03"}]}

This action has led to the claim that York is the first capital of the United States. Background posts: Articles of Confederation's 230th birthday celebrated and Events in 1777 helped tip Revolution toward patriots.\n\nI get queries dealing with the claim that York was the first capital of the United States fairly often.\n\nFor example, an e-mailer recently wondered:\n\n\"I'm curious as to whether you consider York to truly be the first capital of the United States, or simply the place where the nation was in essence birthed through the drafting of the Articles of Confederation.\"\n\nIt connects with discussion in a previous post about our fascination with \"firsts.\"\n\nHere's what I've written on the topic in the York Daily Record and in my \"Nine Months in York Town\" with my own views at the end:\n\nYork prides itself on its Revolutionary War past. Parts of such a grand tradition can take on lives of their own. These stories can grow outward and upward from the events that spawned them. (For another wonderful county debate, see Pro/Con: Should York's leaders have surrendered to the rebels?)\n\nThis analysis frames the debate on the question of whether York is the first capital of the United States.\n\nFirst Capital debate explored\n\nThe issue: The Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation, a forerunner of the U.S. Constitution, while meeting in York Town in the fall of 1777 - 225 years ago. The Articles named the colonies \"The United States of America.\" The sum of all this, some contend, is that York is rightfully called \"The First Capital of the United States.\" Those disagreeing with this view believe evidence does not support the claim. The timing: The First Capital concept cropped up in the early 1960s and bloomed during the bicentennial celebration in 1976. Interestingly, a proclamation celebrating the 150th anniversary of Continental Congress' visit in 1927 does not make the claim nor does \"York County's Heritage,\" a publication widely distributed in 1959. The concept made news when a newspaper article, titled \"'First Capital' Tag May Produce Wide Controversy,\" in the early 1960s portended a dispute with other cities. It suggested a series of \"His toric York, Pa.\" stamps might spur the rift. By 1966, W.W. Van Baman, a York attorney, was stating in a book let marking the 225th anniversary of York: \"In actual legalistic form, it is the first capital of the United States. . . . The term United States of America was used for the first time in this provisional form of government.\" Background: \"United Colonies\" started appearing in the \"Journals of Congress\" in June 1775. In drafting the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson changed \"Colonies\" to \"States\" to recognize the intent of the resolution. Congress flirted with \"The United States of North America\" after delegates adopted the Articles of Confederation. The treaties with France in 1778 referred to the \"United States of North America.\" Congress used that name in a resolution involving bills of exchange with commissioners to France in May 1778, but delegates dropped \"North\" on July 11, 1778. The impact: The First Capital claim has helped orient York's view of itself as a Colonial town. Some believe the area's rich Revolutionary War history justifies this emphasis and that York's Colonial heritage should be promoted. As one gauge, about 20 businesses included \"First Capital\" into their names in the year 2002, and more than 30 other businesses used some variation of \"Yorktown.\" Opponents argue that this First Capital emphasis, built on an incorrect premise, has eclipsed other significant moments in York County history. The debate: Those studying York's history in the past 40 years have expressed varying opinions about its First Capital status. The debate intensified in the years around the bicentennial of the Declaration of Independence and has been on-again, off-again since. For example, a nationally distributed Associated Press story on the recent 225th anniversary of the adoption of the Articles of Confederation picked up the claim from York city officials. Generally, the debate has placed some local researchers and historians who question the claim against others in the business community and local government, the primary promoters of the concept. Most re searchers studying and writing about York County history today do not accept York as the first capital of the United States. Comments made 'for' and 'against' Representative comment for \"First Capital\" designation: J.F. Rauhauser Jr., York County Bicentennial Commission president: \"Then it was, on November 15, 1777 that the Articles of Confederation were officially adopted. Then it was that the participating colonies agreed '. . . hereby severally (to) enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for . . . common defense, the security of . . . liberty and . . . mutual and general welfare . . . .' By Article I it was established that 'The stile of this confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.' Until that moment The United States of America did not exist.\" Representative comment against designation: Henry C. Kessler Jr., lawyer and York College business professor, suggested that York's signer James Smith should not be overlooked in bicentennial activities: \"While we argue among ourselves the debatable issue of whether or not this action (adoption of the Articles of Confederation) of the early Congress makes York the nation's first capital (which if true, means that George Washington would not have been our first President), we in York have a genuine hero of the Revolution . . . .\" Arguments for designation The familiar engrossed copy of the Declaration of Independence, signed Aug. 2, 1776, by most of the Founders, uses the lower case \"united States of America.\" This means Congress recognized 13 united states but no United States of America. The Declaration was not a binding document and created 13 in dependent states. Colonies declared themselves \"free and independent\" states with the right retained by each to do \"all acts and things which independent states may of right do.\" It took a plan of federation - the Articles of Confederation - to bring together these newly independent colonies. The Articles did not gain ratification until 1781, but the term \"ratification\" gives approval back to the time of the original signing in 1778. For example, the treaties between France and the United States became effective and aid became available on their adoption date, Feb. 6, 1778, rather than their ratification date, May 4, 1778. The U.S. Constitution in 1787 states that its purpose is \"to form a more perfect union.\" This suggests that the Founders recognized the Articles of Confederation as having established a nation. In the Gettysburg Address delivered in 1863, President Lincoln stated: \"Fourscore and seven years ago, our forefathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty . . . .\" The conception might have taken place, in Lincoln's view, at the time of the Declaration of Independence. But the delivery, the birth, came later with the Articles of Confederation. Arguments against designation The Declaration of Independence, as recorded in the Journals of Congress for July 4, 1776, uses capital letters for the 13 \"United States of America.\" So does the Dunlap Broadside, the original printing of the document the night of July 4, 1776. But capital letters aside, the Declaration of Independence refers to the Colonies as the United States. This controverts the argument, sometimes offered, that the Articles were the first official document that referred to the United States of America. Further, the \"Journals of the Continental Congress\" at times referred to the country as the United States before the Articles were adopted. For example, the Journals on June 11, 1777, state: \"Whereas, by the oppressive Councils and hostile operations of the British King and Parliament, the United States of America, at a time when they were totally unprovided with Fleets or Armies, Military Stores or Finances, have been forced into a War solely for the Defence of their Natural and Political Liberties . . . .\" Continental currency also carried the name \"The United States\" before Nov. 15, 1777. The Articles did not gain the force of law until Maryland's ratification in 1781. At that time, Continental Congress was meeting in Philadelphia. Today, constitutional amendments become law with approval by the 36th state legislature, not when they gain the nod of Congress. And they are not applied to the past. If York Town is the First Capital, Henry Laurens, president of the Second Continental Congress meeting in York Town, would be the nation's first president. The claim does not resonate in most nationally distributed, contemporary Revolutionary War books, both scholarly and popular, that cover the Continental Congress' stay in York Town. Indeed, most do not explore claims by any city for First Capital status. Further, early authoritative county histories do not make the claim. Carter and Glossbrenner's \"History of York County\" is one example. A recent scholarly work by a York County author also omits the claim - York College professor Paul Doutrich's chapter on York County in \"Beyond Philadelphia: The American Revolution in the Pennsylvania Hinterland.\" Lincoln credited the Declaration of Independence as creating a new nation: In the Gettysburg Address delivered in 1863, Lincoln stated: \"Fourscore and seven years ago, our forefathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty . . . .\" In Lincoln's view, the emphasis was on \"brought forth,\" meaning the nation was founded in 1776. Summary comments Pro: Fred J. Bailey, president of Colonial York Tourist Bureau, noted in 1961 that the Declaration of Independence left the real power to govern with the 13 states, not the Continental Congress: \"Though they were acting together, bound by the interest of a common cause, they remained 13 separate nations, as independent of each other as of the British Crown. To call them 'United States' was not enough to make them so. No true United States could be formed until the separate states agreed to sacrifice some of their governing powers. That agreement was reached in York.\" Con: John W. Heisey, director of research, Historical Society of York County, stated in 1970: \"There is in our opinion no valid claim for York to consider herself the 'first capitol of the United States,' but we are in a minority and cannot convince the local tourist bureau and other tourism-minded people to desist from using the slogan. . . .\" For further study: The York County Heritage Trust Library, 250 E. Market St., York, contains a thick file detailing the debate. Author's perspective James McClure's evaluation: York Town gained status as the temporary national capital when the Continental Congress visited for nine months in 1777-78. Robert Fortenbaugh, a former Gettysburg College professor, included York among the capitals in his book, \"The Nine Capitals of the United States.\" Fortenbaugh correctly follows the path of other scholars by not calling York or any other town \"First Capital\" in his book. Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation, ratified the treaties with France and handled many other crucial issues during that time. But in the past 40 years, the First Capital claim has overwhelmed discussions in York County on such landmark events. The arguments against the First Capital status are simply more persuasive. The decades that passed before this claim arose and the fact that respected Revolutionary War historians elsewhere do not address or recognize York's \"First Capital\" status reduce the weight of the local claim.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2007/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/06/20/juneteenth-recognized-in-newport-under-holidayrsquos-flag-at-city-hall/42404541/", "title": "Juneteenth recognized in Newport under holiday's flag at City Hall", "text": "Sean Flynn\n\nsflynn@newportri.com\n\nNEWPORT — About 100 people gathered in front of City Hall on Friday evening to celebrate Juneteenth Independence Day, which gained more attention this year after weeks of national protests over the police killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans.\n\nThe celebration marks June 19, 1865, when Union Major Gen. Gordon Granger landed in Galveston, Texas, to announce the enslaved people in Texas were free. President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, but slavery continued in Confederate states like Texas until the Civil War ended.\n\nThe local celebration was organized by Sankofa Community Connection board members and founding director Niko Merritt. She pointed to the Juneteenth flag flying from City Hall, telling the crowd this was a first in the city’s history.\n\n“We were out here earlier today when Jamie Bova, mayor of Newport, issued a proclamation recognizing Juneteenth as a holiday in Newport,” Merritt said. “We are appreciative of her continued support.”\n\nBova declared Juneteenth in the proclamation as “an official holiday in the City of Newport.”\n\n“The City will recognize Juneteenth by displaying the Juneteenth Newport flag at City Hall from June 19 to June 21 each year,” the proclamation says.\n\nSome of the signs at the gathering said, “Juneteenth is My Independence Day.”\n\nWhen the Declaration of Independence, authored by Thomas Jefferson, was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, it said “all men are created equal” and their “inalienable Rights” included “Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.”\n\nBut speakers pointed out that declaration and those rights left out enslaved Black Americans for almost the next 100 years.\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation applied only to the states in rebellion. Slavery did not officially end until the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution on Dec. 6, 1865, which abolished slavery in all U.S. states and territories.\n\n“It is time Juneteenth is celebrated here and more widely everywhere,” said Ellen Pinnock of Newport, a Sankofa board member. “Not everyone was freed when the Emancipation Proclamation was read.”\n\nShe said pockets of slavery actually continued for decades as plantation owners told Black families they had to continue to work the land to pay off “debt” they supposedly owed.\n\n“The voices stifled for so long can now be heard,” Pinnock said. “To our ancestors, you may have been down, but you were not out.”\n\n“The slaves had no names, except those given to them by their owners,” said Ernest Gibbons. “They could not read or write — where is the freedom in that? George Floyd has sparked a national and international response we hope will continue for years to come.”\n\n“Now 155 years after the end of slavery, we still have a long way to go,” said retired police officer Jimmy Winters, president of the Newport County chapter of the NAACP. Quoting Curtis Mayfield, he said, “We have to keep on pushing. We can’t stop now.”\n\n“The day is so, so important,” said Pauline Perkins-Moye. “By the grace of God, we will continue to be who we are.”\n\nGabby Brown, a rising sophomore at Rogers High School, read a Juneteenth Poem written by Kristina K.\n\n“Skills of art, life, beauty and family/ Crushed by forces we knew nothing of, we rose/ We rose to be you, we rose to be me/ Above everything expected, we rose/ To become the knowledge we never knew.”\n\nSeveral of the speakers talked about the history of Juneteenth and noted at least 45 states and the District of Columbia have declared the day an official holiday.\n\n“Our celebration next year will be bigger and better,” said Merritt, who was wearing a mask like other participants. “Hopefully it will be coronavirus free, so that we can see each other.”\n\nNychole Matthews, a Sankofa board member, said the organization has three main focus areas, beginning with “community events and gatherings to increase our social cohesion.”\n\nCommunity meetings are held to “discuss the impact of institutional racism and racial oppression, and to provoke dialogue and solutions to the issues,” she said.\n\nFinally, Sankofa promotes “historical education to reveal, honor and celebrate the cultural heritage of African Americans of early Newport,” Matthews said.\n\nAfter the Juneteenth celebration, participants were invited to the Community Baptist Church on Dr. Marcus Wheatland Boulevard for a vegetarian meal.\n\nsflynn@newportri.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/10/trump-protests-army-birthday-parade-celebration-heavy-force/84134790007/", "title": "Trump: Protesters on Army's birthday will be met with 'heavy force'", "text": "President Donald Trump is warning any would-be protesters planning to interrupt the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary celebration in Washington, D.C., that they'll be \"met with very big force.\"\n\nThe parade June 14, which coincides with Trump’s 79th birthday and Flag Day, is set to feature thousands of police officers and security measures including metal detectors, anti-scale fencing, concrete barriers and drones overhead surveilling the crowd. It also comes as Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom are locked in a standoff over the use of the National Guard and the U.S. military to help quell protests that have sprung up in Los Angeles against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps carried out at the president's direction.\n\n“This is people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force,” Trump said June 10 in the Oval Office.\n\nBilled as the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday parade, the celebration in the nation’s capital will feature Army equipment, musical performances and thousands of soldiers in uniforms past and present. Fireworks are scheduled to close out the festivities.\n\nTrump's remarks come as opponents prepare their own “No Kings National Day of Defiance\" − or \"No Kings\" protests − at more than 1,800 sites nationwide. Indivisible, a progressive group, alongside a coalition of partner organizations, said it's holding the events to counter Trump’s plans to “hijack” the Army’s legacy to “celebrate himself.”\n\nThere will be no planned \"No Kings\" protests for Washington D.C. Organizers said they intentionally avoided having a protest in the capital to avoid being cast as “anti-veteran.”\n\nThe largest protest is instead scheduled for noon ET in Philadelphia, where the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.\n\n“We made that choice to not feed into any narrative that Trump might want,\" said Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, \"that we're counterprotesting him directly or give him the opportunity to crack down on protesters.\"\n\nLast month, Trump said God had willed his participation in the \"big big celebration.\"\n\nTrump, who lost the 2020 election, would have missed the event had he been elected to a consecutive second term. In his second term, Trump also is expected to preside over the FIFA World Cup in 2026, which the United States will co-host with Canada and Mexico, as well as the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\n“I'm glad I missed that second term.

He met up with the Light Horse of Philadelphia, a volunteer cavalry corps that crossed the Delaware River with Washington, inspiring an iconic Revolutionary War painting\n\n\"The City Tavern was the place to go, practically every day,\" Gordon Lloyd, a professor emeritus at Pepperdine University, told USA TODAY.\n\nLloyd discovered a summary of Washington's tavern bill that night while digging through Independence Hall documents. According to the bill, the soon-to-be first president and 54 other guests did indeed order 54 bottles of Madeira, 60 bottles of Claret, 8 bottles of whiskey, 8 bottles of cider, 12 bottles of beer and seven “large bowls” of punch.\n\nThat would be about two bottles of wine, several shots and a few cups of punch and beer for every guest.\n\nGeorge Washington's night out:\n\nThe Washington Post reported the night’s tab to be estimated at about 89 pounds, four shillings and two pence – the rough equivalent of $15,400 today.\n\nIn addition to the drinks, the tab included dinner for all 55 guests, fees for broken glasses and meals and drinks for musicians and “servants.”\n\nBut the party might not have been all that much fun for Washington, according to Alexis Coe, historian and author of the Washington biography \"You Never Forget Your First.\"\n\n\"Washington really did not want to be there,\" Coe said of the Constitutional Convention. \"He was happy to provide the stable unifying presence that the founders and framers needed in order to sign the Constitution ... but he was exhausted, he was without his wife – who he really liked to be with – and he knew there was no way she would join him.\"\n\nThe future president likely didn't let the party get out of control, either.\n\n\"He was famously self-controlled,\" Coe said. \"If anyone had gotten out of hand, if anyone had done more than break a few glasses or made excessive toasts, he would have put them in place.\"\n\nOur rating: True\n\nBased on our research, we rate TRUE the claim that a bill shows a hefty bar tab for an extravagant 1787 party attended by George Washington.

The same flag was used when the Declaration of Independence was signed to give a flag for the entire country rather than each state having their own.\n\nThere have been a few notable changes to the flag since its original design in 1777 − namely the addition of 37 stars.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson made the observance an official day on May 30, 1916 via a presidential proclamation. The day had already been celebrated prior to that point, but he made it an officially recognized day.\n\nIs there mail on Flag Day?\n\nYes, Flag Day is not a federal holiday and the United States Post Office will operate as normal. In fact, banks and schools will also remain open.\n\nWho designed the American flag?\n\nWhile many were taught in grade school that Betsy Ross made the flag, there is no proof she did so. According to the History Channel, Ross wasn't credited with the creation of the flag until after her death.\n\nWe do know who created the modern American flag we know today. In 1958, Bob G. Heft designed a flag for a class project. In his flag, he added 50 stars assuming the United States would acquire Alaska and Hawaii. After receiving a B- on it for having too many stars, he sent it to the White House. Two years later he received a call from President Dwight D. Eisenhower who invited him to Washington, D.C. for a ceremony adopting his 50-star flag.\n\nWhy is the American flag red, white and blue?\n\nThere is no known reason for the flag being red, white and blue. In 1782, the Congress of the Articles of Confederation gave meaning to the three colors:\n\nRed represents valor and hardiness, white represents purity and justice, and blue represents vigilance, perseverance and justice.\n\nWhat is National Flag Week?\n\nNational Flag Week is the week is celebrated during Flag Day week. In 1966, Congress requested that the president issue an annual proclamation designating the week when Flag Day occurs as National Flag Week. In the proclamation, the president calls upon all citizens to display the flag throughout the week.\n\nPresident Joe Biden made his address on June 7 saying, \"I encourage the people of the United States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, set aside by the Congress, as a time to honor the American spirit, to celebrate our history and the foundational values we strive to uphold, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.\"\n\nWhat is flag etiquette on Flag Day?\n\nTraditionally, the flag can only be flown from sunrise to sunset. It can only be flown at night if it is properly illuminated. When lowering the flag in the evening, it should be done in a ceremonious manner where the flag is honored. During the hoisting or lowering of the flag or when it passes in parade or review, Americansshould stand at attention facing the flag and place their right hand over the heart.\n\nWhat are the American flag rules?\n\nWhile most people know the general idea to not let the flag touch the ground, there are a number of other rules for displaying the flag throughout the year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/06/14/flag-day-history-and-how-to-best-celebrate-the-american-flag/84191102007/", "title": "Flag Day history and how to best celebrate the American flag", "text": "On June 14, we will not only be saluting the Army's 250th year with President Donald Trump's military parade in downtown Washington, D.C., we will also be celebrating America's symbol of freedom: the American flag.\n\nA flag resolution was adopted 248 years ago, on June 14, 1777, that said, \"Resolved: that the flag of the United States be made of 13 stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be 13 stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation,\" according to the Smithsonian.\n\nSince President Woodrow Wilson declared June 14 Flag Day in May 1916, the United States has honored the adoption of the stars and stripes in a number of ways, including carrying the flag in parades, displaying it outside homes and holding other patriotic events. Before 1916, a number of states and cities had started to observe the day.\n\nThough it's observed nationally, Flag Day is not a federal holiday.

The legislation also called upon the president to issue a Flag Day proclamation every year.\n\nPresident Trump born on Flag Day\n\nPresident Trump was born on Flag Day on June 14, 1946. \"I am blessed to have shared my birthday with the Star Spangled Banner and the U.S. Army,\" he said.\n\n➤ US Army's 250th anniversary a celebration that coincides with Trump's birthday. How to attend\n\nIn 2017, he proclaimed not only Flag Day but Flag Week, saying, \"On Flag Day, we honor the symbol that reminds us that we are one Nation under God, united in our pursuit of liberty and justice for all.\n\n\"By honoring our flag, we pay due respect to the patriots and heroes who have laid down their lives in defense of the liberty it represents.\n\n\"The Congress also requested, in 1966, that the President annually issue a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as 'National Flag Week' and call upon citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.\"\n\nWho created the first American flag? What it really Betsy Ross?\n\n\"According to legend, in 1776, George Washington commissioned Philadelphia seamstress Betsy Ross to create a flag for the new nation.\n\n\"Scholars, however, credit the flag’s design to Francis Hopkinson, who also designed the Great Seal and first coin of the United States. Even so, Ross most likely met Washington and certainly sewed early American flags in her family’s Philadelphia upholstery shop,\" according to the Library of Congress.\n\nHow many versions of the US flag have there been?\n\nThere have been 27 official versions of the flag, but the arrangement of the stars has varied according to the flag-makers’ preferences until 1912. That's when President Taft standardized the then-new flag’s 48 stars, according to the Library of Congress.\n\nThat changed when Alaska and Hawaii became states in 1959.\n\nThe current version of the flag dates to July 4, 1960.\n\nFlag trivia: High school student's flag design gets presidential call ... and grade change\n\nThe current American flag was designed by Bob G. Heft, a high school student from Lancaster, Ohio, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.\n\n\"Even though Bob’s history teacher gave him a B- for not knowing how many states the Union had, Bob submitted his design to the White House (unprompted) in anticipation of Hawaii and Alaska joining the Union. To his surprise, President Eisenhower called him! Today, it’s Bob Heft’s 1958 design — showing 50 stars in a field that included five rows of six stars and four rows of five stars — which is now our 50-star American flag.\"\n\nHeft's teacher changed his grade to an A.\n\nWhat do the colors of the American flag mean?\n\nThe Continental Congress left no record explaining why it chose red, white and blue for the country's new flag.\n\nIn 1782, the Congress of the Articles of Confederation chose the colors for the Great Seal of the United States with these meanings:\n\nwhite for purity and innocence\n\nfor purity and innocence red for valor and hardiness\n\nfor valor and hardiness blue for vigilance, perseverance, and justice\n\nHow do you correctly fly the US flag?\n\nThe U.S. Flag Code provides guidelines on how to display and care for the U.S. flag. Flags should always hang freely but never with the stars down, except as a distress signal.\n\nThe U.S. flag flies above any other flag.\n\nNever use the flag for decoration. Use bunting with the blue on top, then white, then red.\n\nIt is the universal custom to display the flag only from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated at night.\n\nWhen a flag becomes unfit to fly, it should be destroyed with dignity.\n\nDo not let the flag touch the ground.\n\nDo not fly flag upside down unless there is an emergency.\n\nDo not carry the flag flat, or carry things in it.\n\nDo not use the flag as clothing.\n\nDo not store the flag where it can get dirty.\n\nDo not use it as a cover.\n\nDo not fasten it or tie it back. Always allow it to fall free.\n\nDo not draw on, or otherwise mark the flag.\n\nDoes the flag fly at half-staff on Flag Day?\n\nNo. The flag should be flown at full-staff, at the top of the pole on Flag Day.\n\nIs Flag Day a federal holiday?\n\nNo, Flag Day is not a federal holiday, but the president traditionally proclaims its observance every year. The date, June 14, remains the same, no matter which day of the week it falls.\n\nHere are 2025 federal holidays:\n\nJan. 1: New Year's Day\n\nJan. 20: Inauguration Day; Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\nFeb. 17: Washington's Birthday.

The Second Continental Congress adopted a resolution on June 14, 1777, that stated: “That the flag of the United States shall be of thirteen stripes of alternate red and white, with a union of thirteen stars of white in a blue field, representing the new constellation.”\n\nLess than a year prior — according to legend — President George Washington had ordered Betsy Ross to make the first flag, according to the National Constitution Center. The day also marks the birthday of the U.S. Army.\n\nFlag Day allows American citizens to celebrate the U.S. flag, which is a symbol of freedom and justice. What to know about Flag Day:\n\nWhen is Flag Day in 2025?\n\nFlag Day in 2025 is Saturday, June 14. The holiday falls on the same date each year.\n\nWhen is the US Army's 250th birthday?\n\nThe U.S. Army will celebrate its 250th birthday on June 14, 2025. The U.S. Army is planning on giving President Donald Trump, 78, and the country an \"Army Birthday Parade\" in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe parade, which will feature Army equipment, flyovers and 6,600 soldiers in uniforms from the past and the present, caps off a week of programming designed to celebrate the Army.\n\nWhat does the US flag design represent?\n\nThe flag's 13 red and white stripes represent the 13 original colonies. Its 50 white stars on a blue background represent the 50 states.\n\nEach of the colors on the flag has a meaning:\n\nRed: valor and bravery\n\nWhite: purity and innocence\n\nBlue: vigilance, perseverance, and justice\n\nA star is added to the flag when a new state joins the United States. The flag was last modified on July 4, 1960, when Hawaii became a state.\n\nHow to properly display American flag\n\nFlag etiquette has long been established to ensure the flag is treated with dignity. In 1942 Congress created the U.S. Flag Code which provides guidelines for the display and care of the flag.\n\nFlags should always hang freely but never with the stars down, except as a distress signal.\n\nNo other flag may be flown above or to the right of the U.S. flag, except at the United Nations headquarters.\n\nCitizens may fly the flag at any time but preferably from sunrise to sunset — except for special occasions or when well-lighted.\n\nWhen a flag becomes unfit to fly, it should be destroyed with dignity.\n\nA flag should never touch the ground.\n\nWhen was the US flag first displayed?\n\nA special committee was assigned to suggest the U.S. flag’s design, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The first flag of this design was carried into battle on Sept. 11, 1777, during the Battle of Brandywine, according to the VA.\n\nWhen was Flag Day first celebrated?\n\nThe first national observance of Flag Day was on June 14, 1877 — 100 years after the Continental Congress adopted the resolution, according to the National Constitution Center.\n\nOther early observances included U.S. schools in the late 1800s that hosted “Flag Day programs to contribute to the Americanization of immigrant children,” according to the VA. Communities then took up and spread the celebration.\n\nAmong the most recognized claims for first observance, according to the VA, happened on June 14, 1889, in New York City. Professor George Bolch, principal of a free kindergarten for the poor, had his school conduct patriotic ceremonies in observance of the anniversary of the Flag Day resolution. The New York Department of Education learned of this and arranged to have the day observed in all public schools.\n\nIs Flag Day a federal holiday?\n\nFlag Day is observed nationally, but it isn’t a federal holiday. Pennsylvania recognizes Flag Day as a state holiday.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson and President Calvin Coolidge each issued presidential proclamations asking for June 14 to be observed as Flag Day, according to the VA. On Aug. 3, 1949, Congress approved the national observance of Flag Day, and President Harry Truman signed it into law.\n\nWhat's the largest Flag Day celebration in Michigan?\n\nThree Oaks Flag Day takes place June 6-8 and claims to be the nation’s largest Flag Day celebration. Three Oaks is located in Berrien County in southwest Michigan near the Indiana border.\n\nThe Three Oaks Flag Day Parade begins at 3 p.m. June 8, in downtown. The parade was founded in 1953 and today features more than 100 units, including veterans, color guards, marching bands, clowns, equestrian groups, drill teams, antique cars and drugs, drum and bugle corps, and antique tractors.\n\nThere are also community events throughout the three-day festival, in addition to live music.\n\n— Contact reporter Evan Sasiela at esasiela@livingstondaily.com.

Gov. Edward W. Cooch Sr., whom News Journal columnist Bill Frank regarded as an eminent Delaware historian and whose book on the battle endures as a state history classic.\n\nFrank called him “a stouthearted defender of the story about the American flag’s having been first subjected to military fire in the vicinity of the Cooch mansion.”\n\nThe prominent columnist admitted he was skeptical.\n\nBut over the years, he wrote, he had “come to believe” the flag story, included in the notable Works Progress Administration’s 1938 classic “Delaware; A Guide to the First State.”\n\n“Tradition declares,” the famed tome says, “that here the Stars and Stripes was first unfurled in battle.”\n\nAnd if the Cooches had their way, it would fly in Lewis’s painting.\n\nDuring the 1986 painting controversy, Richard Cooch told The News Journal, “My father and I pointed out that circumstantial evidence indicates that battle may have been the first one where the Stars and Stripes was flown.”\n\nTag-teamed by Cooches, Lewis added the flag. Placed in the lower right corner of his painting, it dominates the scene.\n\nAnd that, too, lends credence and weight to the tale that continues to evade being proven or disproven.\n\nEvery September, when the anniversary of the battle rolls around, I always wonder about the flag.\n\nSome regular Delaware Backstory readers asked what I think of the ongoing skirmish.\n\nLike generations of Cooches and the late Bill Frank, I guess I want to believe.\n\nHow about you?\n\nDo you have a Delaware Backstory?

However, it would take more than a century from when the flag resolution was adopted for the day to be formally observed by communities across the country.\n\nFlag Day was first celebrated in the late 1800s by educators around the U.S., according to the National Constitution Center, and in May 1916, President Woodrow Wilson declared that June 14 would be forever known as the day of the flag.\n\nFlag Day became a national holiday some thirty years after Wilson left office, which was when President Harry Truman signed congressional legislation into law. Truman also directed, in a proclamation, that the U.S. flag be displayed on all government buildings on that day.\n\nAmerica has honored the adoption of both stars and stripes in several ways since, from displaying the pennant outside of homes and federal buildings to incorporating it in patriotic parades or processions.

Athletes from around the world, including Team USA flag bearers LeBron James and Coco Gauff, floated on boats for the six-kilometer route that traveled east to west across Paris from the Pont d’Austerlitz to the Trocadero.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports brought you live updates from Paris, highlights and more throughout the opening ceremony.

Nadal might as well have honorary French residency after winning a record 14 French Opens. He won four in a row from 2005-2008, five in a row from 2010-2014, another four in a row from 2017-2020 and his final one in 2022. He is 112-4 all-time at Roland Garros. A statue of him was erected outside the stadium in 2021. Nadal has 22 Grand Slams total.\n\nNadal then passed the torch to fellow tennis legend Serena Williams. Three of her 23 Grand Slam titles came at the French Open. Carl Lewis, a four-time Olympic champion at the 1984 Games, and Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci, who scored the first perfect 10 in Olympic history at the 1976 Games, also were part of the torch’s final journey. — Nancy Armour\n\nAmelie Mauresmo passed Olympic torch to Tony Parker\n\nThe tennis theme in the Olympic torch relay continued when Amelie Mauresmo, the only French player to be No. 1 in the Open era, took the torch after it arrived off the boat. Tony Parker, who paved the way for French players in the NBA and won four titles with the San Antonio Spurs, took the handoff from Mauresmo. Parker and Carter continued running with the torch after they passed it over to a trio of French athletes. — Nancy Armour\n\nCeline Dion at opening ceremony dazzled\n\nThe legendary singer Celine Dion performed at the opening ceremony after the Olympic Cauldron was lit.

Flagbearers held their country’s flags aloft as the team boats floated down the Seine while other athletes waved smaller flags. But Gauff and James also took time to pose for photos with others on the boat – including the captain – and take in the sights of Paris.\n\n“Seeing a lot of water, first off,” Gauff said. “But also some amazing people, a lot of amazing athletes and we’re all excited to represent Team USA.”\n\nAsked if the steady rain put a damper on their special moment, James said no.\n\n“The rain can’t stop us,” he said. — Nancy Armour\n\nAxelle Saint-Cirel performs French national anthem on Grand Palais roof\n\nOn the roof of the Grand-Palais and wearing colors of the French flag, Axelle Saint-Cirel, the Choeur and the Maîtrise de Radio France performed the French national anthem, called The Marseillaise. It was composed in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle, who was an officer for the French Engineers. It was declared the national anthem in 1795. As the national anthem was performed, the Republic Guard raised the flag at the Trocadéro. Composer Victor le Masne musically rearranged the national anthem for the opening ceremony.\n\nSteph Curry, A'ja Wilson at Olympics opening ceremony\n\nWomen's basketball forward A'Ja Wilson looks to have added an extra piece of fashion to her Team USA Ralph Lauren outfit — thanks to the help of Steph Curry. The Golden State Warriors guard — who is making his Olympic debut with USA Basketball in Paris — gifted Wilson Olympics-themed sunglasses for Friday's opening ceremony.\n\nWhich country will host the 2028 Olympics?\n\nThe 2028 Summer Olympics will be in Los Angeles.

The United States will have the largest national delegation at the Summer Games in Paris with 593 athletes. Host nation France is second with 573, followed by Australia (460), Germany (427), Japan (404), Italy (403), China (388), Spain (382), Great Britain (327) and Canada (318) rounding out the top 10.\n\nWhy was Australia after Zambia and Zimbabwe at opening ceremony?\n\nThe sight of the Australian team coming after Zambia and Zimbabwe might have taken those who know their alphabet by surprise. But there was a reason for the Aussies being so far out of alphabetical order. Countries that are hosting upcoming Olympics come at the end of the Parade of Nations. Brisbane is hosting the 2032 Summer Games, so Australia was the third-to-last team. The United States was second-to-last, with the Olympics returning to Los Angeles in four years. And France, the host of these Paris Olympics, was the last country in the 85-boat flotilla. — Nancy Armour\n\nOlympics opening ceremony order of countries\n\nThe order of the parade of nations is determined by the French spelling of their country names. Germany is Allemagne in French, for example, so it goes with the As, not the Gs. The only exceptions are the United States, which is Etats-Unis in French but goes second-to-last because it is hosting the next Summer Games, and France, because it’s the host country.\n\nMetal band at Paris Olympics: Who is Gojira?\n\nThe metal band Gojira, who performed at the Olympics opening ceremony, is made up of Joe Duplantier, Mario Duplantier, Christian Andreu and Jean-Michel La- badie. They performed at the Conciergerie, which was the residence of French kings in medieval times. It became a prison during the French revolution and Marie-Antoinette was one of its most famous prisoners. Gojira performed alongside singer Marina Viotti.\n\nAya Nakamura Olympics opening ceremony performance\n\nAya Nakamura is one of France’s most famous pop stars, performing performed \"Pookie, Djadja\" and \"For me formidable, La Bohéme\" at the opening ceremony alongside 60 musicians from the Republican Guard and 36 choristers of the French Army. Nakamura mixes elements of R&B, Afropop and Parisian street slang, and her most famous song is “Djadja.” She’s been compared to Rihanna and Cardi B.\n\nWhy Russia, Belarus are banned from 2024 Olympics\n\nOnce again, Russia is technically banned from appearing at the Olympic Games. Yet once again, Russian athletes will compete under a different name − a handful of them, at least.\n\nAt the 2024 Paris Olympics, which begin this week, 15 athletes from Russia − and 18 from neighboring Belarus − are slated to compete as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" or AINs for short, according to the most recent statistics released by the International Olympic Committee on Saturday. The AIN classification means that Russian and Belarusian flags, national anthems and uniforms will be absent from the Paris Games. This punishment was levied by the International Olympic Committee following its invasion of Ukraine. — Tom Schad\n\nHow many athletes are on Team USA?\n\nThere are 593 American Olympians at the Paris Games. Meet Team USA.\n\nHow many countries participate in the 2024 Olympics?\n\nMore than 200 countries are competing in the 2024 Olympics, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe.\n\nMinions at Olympics opening ceremony\n\nMinions — of the \"Despicable Me\" franchise and its spinoff movie, \"Minions\" — made a digital appearance at the opening ceremony. In a video with the \"unknown\" athlete running with the Olympic torch, the Minions are seen acting out a scene in a submarine submerged in the Seine.\n\nLady Gaga at Olympics opening ceremony gave stunning performance\n\nLady Gaga returned to music at the 2024 Paris Olympics during a performance at the opening ceremony and lit up the City of Lights. Alongside a fleet of dancers, the Grammy favorite performed a French-inspired set alongside the Seine river with a tribute to Zizi Jeanmaire's presentation of \"Mon Truc En Plumes,\" translated to “My Thing with Feathers.” — Jay Stahl\n\nOlympic opening ceremony performers\n\nLady Gaga, metal band Gojira and French pop star Aya Nakamura were among those who have performed at the opening ceremony.\n\nWho made medals for the Paris Olympics?\n\nThe Monnaie de Paris, which has been minting France’s coins since 864. The company also made the medals for the Athens Olympics in 1896, the first modern Olympic Games, and the two previous Summer Games in Paris, in 1900 and 1924.\n\nHow many medals were made for the Paris Olympics?\n\n5,084.\n\nWhy does Greece go first in the Olympics?\n\nGreece goes first at the opening ceremony every Olympics because it is the birthplace of the Olympic Games.\n\nWhy is Peyton Manning wearing an arm band?\n\nNBC opening ceremony co-host Peyton Manning sported an arm band on his right forearm during the opening ceremony broadcast, much like he did during his playing days as an NFL quarterback. He joked he was wearing it because he had notes on all 200-plus countries in the opening ceremomny.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo on being Greece's flag bearer\n\n“That is an honor,” he said. “If I am the flag bearer, great. If I am not, OK. I am just happy that I have a good coaching staff and a good team, I am in the Olympics.\"\n\nWho designed the Olympics flag?\n\nPierre de Coubertin, who is considered the founder of the modern Olympics, designed the rings in July 1913. The Olympics logo was first used on a flag in 1914. That original flag is now at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne. The IOC officially adopted the rings logo and flag in 1914.\n\nAmericans in Paris\n\nRachael Raskovich, Amanda Mason-Sekula and Kelly Holmes arrived at the opening ceremony wearing American flag themed hats, red white and blue glasses and sequin USA jackets with \"Proud American\" stitched on the back.\n\n\"Amazon,\" Raskovich said with a smile when asked about the gear.\n\nThe trio of friends met in law school and said they will spend the next week or so hopping around to events around the city. They have tickets to beach volleyball and equestrian, Raskovich said, among other sports. Their group was just one of the many clad in red, white and blue that lined the southern banks of the Seine River on Friday night. Doris Ng of Chicago was among the U.S. spectators who were still searching for a good spot from which to view the ceremony in the hour before it began.\n\n\"We thought we were going to be on time,\" she said. \"I think everybody else beat us to the punch already.\"\n\nFortunately, she also has tickets to the closing ceremony, she said. — Tom Schad\n\nNot every local was in a festive mood\n\nOne man saw my media credential and wanted to make sure — despite barely speaking English — that he was upset over a rumor Celine Dion had been paid 2 million Euros to perform one song at the opening ceremony. Another woman, an American who has lived in Paris for 15 years, said property taxes went up and yet Parisians were not given much access to events or even public spaces to watch the festivities despite the financial and social burden being put on them.\n\nBut even when the rain began falling, people did not scatter to look for shelter. Instead they powered through, trying to get a better look at the bleu, blanc and rouge streaks being left in the sky by an airplane flyover.\n\nRestaurants, which don’t have televisions here, were generally not busy. If you were going out to eat Friday night, it’s because you didn’t care to watch the show live. But inside one of them in a residential area near the Eiffel Tower, you could hear the singing of La Marseillaise, the French National Anthem. For a few minutes, the din of conversation went completely silent. — Dan Wolken\n\nTeam USA opening ceremony outfit\n\nTeam USA’s opening ceremony outfit is a modern take on a tailored look. On top, a tailored single-breasted wool blazer with red and white tipping is worn over a striped oxford shirt. The bottom is a more casual tapered jean and classic suede buck shoe fit.\n\nRalph Lauren works closely with Team USA and the goal, as always, is to “do something graphic and uniquely American,” chief brand and innovation officer David Lauren said.\n\nTo account for the heat, the company constantly looks at different fabrics and layering systems to keep the athlete’s body temperature in check, Lauren said. All items in both the opening and closing ceremony outfits are manufactured in the United States.\n\nCoco Gauff opens up on being U.S. flag bearer, making Olympic debut\n\nCoco Gauff is making her Olympic debut in Paris and she is one of two U.S. flag bearers. “(Competing) in the Olympics has always been up there with winning a Grand Slam, like top goals,” Gauff told USA TODAY Sports this summer. Read our full feature on Gauff.\n\nOn the opening ceremony red carpet, Serena Williams was asked about Gauff being the flag bearer. \"Isn't that great. I'm so excited to see her tonight. I'm just so happy for her,\" the tennis legend said.\n\nUSA flag bearers 2024\n\nBasketball superstar LeBron James and tennis star Coco Gauff are the flag bearers for the Americans. Gauff is the first tennis player to serve in the role.\n\nWhy is Snoop Dogg at Olympics?\n\nWith his mind on the Olympics and the Olympics on his mind, Snoop Dogg is, indeed, back for the 2024 Paris Olympics. The rapper, who will carry the torch ahead of the opening ceremony, is primed for a bigger role three years after his reactions to the dressage competition with Kevin Hart went viral at the Tokyo Games.\n\nSnoop will appear regularly on “Primetime in Paris,” serving as a “special correspondent” for NBC. During parts of the primetime show, Snoop Dogg will interact with Team USA athletes, their families, or explore Paris and share his experiences and insights with the night's audience. He's also carrying the Olympic torch.\n\nParis Olympics closing ceremony date\n\nThe 2024 Summer Games will hold the closing ceremony on Aug. 11\n\nHow many times has Paris hosted the Olympics?\n\nParis has hosted the Summer Olympics three times: 1900, 1924 and 2024.\n\nAre any U.S. athletes skipping the opening ceremony?\n\nAbout 350 of Team USA’s 592 athletes will march – or rather, float – in today's opening ceremony, according to Nicole Deal, who oversees the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee’s security operations.\n\nThat means about 40% of the U.S. delegation will be absent, though that is not exactly unusual.\n\nMany athletes and teams – especially those competing early in the Games – choose to pass on the opening ceremony because it often runs late into the night and requires them to spend several hours on their feet. U.S. gymnasts and swimmers, for example, regularly skip the ceremony to rest up for their competitions – which, in some cases, begin the next morning.\n\nU.S. swimming star Katie Ledecky said earlier this week that she never planned on going to the Paris opening ceremony for this very reason. She swims the 400-meter freestyle Saturday morning. — Tom Schad\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

The Cruise news, which was first reported on Aug. 1, brought fanfare and shocked the internet.\n\nAccompanied by H.E.R. on electric guitar, the \"Risky Business\" star rappelled off the top of the Stade de France and landed with action-hero flair. Cruise then made his way through the crowd, collected the official Olympics flag and jetted off on a motorcycle.\n\nCruise concluded with a thrilling segment, in which the actor skydived into L.A. and redecorated the iconic Hollywood sign with the multicolored rings from the Olympics logo.\n\nWho were the closing ceremony flag bearers? Meet Katie Ledecky and Nick Mead\n\nTeam USA's pair of flag bearers were swimmer Katie Ledecky and rower Nick Mead. Ledecky, a four-time Olympian who debuted at the 2012 London Olympics at age 15, is the most decorated female Olympian in Team USA history and the most decorated woman in swimming of all time.\n\nLedecky did not attend the July 26 opening ceremony — where NBA legend LeBron James and tennis phenom Coco Gauff were Team USA's flag bearers — because her competition schedule began the following day.\n\nKatie Ledecky, Nick Mead to lead US team at closing ceremony in Paris\n\nMead, 29, is a two-time Olympic rower who earned his first medal as part of Team USA’s gold medal-winning men’s four, the first time an American team has garnered a gold medal in the event since the 1960 Olympic games.\n\nHow did the closing ceremony compare to the opening ceremony?\n\nThe closing ceremony was a more sentimental presentation than the fun-filled opening ceremony, which yielded a series of controversies from an apology from Olympic organizers to Kelly Clarkson and Peyton Manning's panned appearance as NBC opening ceremony co-hosts.\n\nThe parade down the river Seine featured plenty of eye-catching moments that sparked online fervor – including one now particularly infamous scene that outraged many Christians, who lambasted its resemblance to Leonardo Da Vinci's famed Last Supper painting.\n\nIn the tableau, a scantily-clad man painted in blue emerged at the center of a table to sing among dancing drag queens. Conservative and Christian leaders were quick to condemn the scene as an offensive parody of imagery and symbolism at the center of their faith, despite the insistence of ceremony organizers that they took inspiration from an ancient pagan festival.\n\nNBC defends performances of Peyton Manning, Kelly Clarkson on opening ceremony\n\nThat wasn't the only issue that drew Olympic-sized backlash.\n\nThe performance of Manning and Clarkson during NBC's broadcast of the 2024 Paris Olympics opening ceremony drew strong reactions online. But internally, the network was pleased with the broadcast, executives said Thursday during a conference call with reporters.\n\nNBC tabbed Manning and Clarkson as co-hosts alongside Mike Tirico for the once-in-a-lifetime event, but the inclusion was clunky and, overall, not additive, critics said.

How many times can a person be president?", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has already had one term in office and if he wins this election it will be his second. So he can't run again...right?\n\nHow presidential terms work might be a bit confusing since it has been so long since a president has lost a re-election bid after their first term, only to try for the seat again after four years. Essentially, it only allows a person to hold the highest office in the United States twice (which does not have to be consecutive) and not indefinitely.\n\nThe U.S. hasn't always had them, but presidential term limits are not something new either. They have been around for more than 70 years.\n\nHere's a look at the ins and outs of presidential term limits and how long they have been around.\n\nIs there anything in the Constitution about presidential term limits?\n\nYes, it is clearly outlined in the 22nd Amendment that a person serving as president can only hold the office twice. Here's what it says:\n\n\"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"\n\nWhen did presidential term limits become part of the Constitution?\n\nThe 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951, according to the National Constitution Center. The idea of term limits came about from Republicans after President Franklin D. Roosevelt won four consecutive elections. His presidency started in 1933 during the Great Depression and spanned over 12 years until his death on April 12, 1945, during his fourth term.\n\nIt took nearly four years for the amendment to be ratified though.\n\nHave there always been presidential term limits?\n\nNot in writing.\n\nAmerica's first president, George Washington, set an unofficial precedent when the first elections in the United States were happening. Washington only served as president twice, declining multiple times to serve a third term.\n\nIn later years, Washington's decision to not seek a third term was seen as a safeguard against the type of tyrannical power wielded by the British monarchy during the Colonial era. According to the National Constitution Center, the concept of term limits was discussed at the Constitutional Convention when America was first founded but not added to the Constitution at that time.\n\nHas anyone sought more than two terms as president?\n\nOnly a handful of people have sought a third term as president before the 22nd Amendment was ratified.\n\nUlysses S.

Summers, retired judge and state attorney general.\n\nIn November 1940, Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) won a third term as president of the United States. A dozen years later he would have been barred from running for a third term because of the 22nd Amendment. That amendment was ratified in 1951.\n\nSection 1 provides that “(n)o person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice….” And no person who has held the office, “…or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President(,) shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.”\n\nThe Amendment did not apply to a president holding office when the amendment was proposed by Congress. The amendment did not affect anyone holding the office of “President during the remainder of such term” after it was ratified.\n\nThe second section provides that it must be ratified by three-quarters of the States within seven years of submission.

He won a fourth term as president in 1944, but he died a few months after taking office in 1945.\n\nAfter the death of FDR, the Republicans sought the 22nd Amendment to limit the terms to two. George Washington, our first president, declined to run after two terms. He declared that two terms were enough for any president. So, the 22nd Amendment took effect in 1951; and the office is limited to a maximum of two full terms, or eight years.\n\nI served a term of about eight years as the Attorney General of Tennessee.

However, the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1933, moved the date to January 20 to reduce the \"lame-duck\" period between presidents. The day typically includes the swearing-in ceremony, a parade, and various inaugural balls and events. The oath of office is administered by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n\nThere have been many memorable moments, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt's four inaugurations as the only president to be serve more than two terms; John F. Kennedy's famous, \"Ask not what your country can do for you\" speech; and the peaceful transfer of power even after contentious elections until the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, who tried but failed to stop the certification of the electoral college votes for President Joe Biden.\n\nAlthough more than 20 presidents have been elected to serve a second term, President-elect Trump will become only the second president after Grover Cleveland to serve two nonconsecutive terms. Cleveland was the 22nd and 24th president; Trump was the 45th and will become the 47th president on Monday, Jan. 20, when he formally takes the oath of office.\n\nAdvances in technology have transformed the inauguration ceremony over the years. Calvin Coolidge's 1925 inauguration was the first to be broadcast on radio. Harry Truman's 1949 inauguration was the first to be televised. Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration was the first to be streamed live on the internet.\n\nInauguration ceremonies for state and local officials have their own unique histories and traditions, which can vary widely depending on the region and the specific office. Inauguration ceremonies for state governors often mirror the presidential inauguration, including an oath of office, a speech, and sometimes a parade or public celebration.\n\nInaugurations for local officials, such as mayors and city council members, are typically more modest, but still significant. These ceremonies often take place at city halls or other local government buildings and may include speeches, community events, and receptions.\n\nOver time, the ceremonies have become more formalized and public. Early inaugurations were often simple affairs, but as the importance of these roles grew, so did the pomp and circumstance surrounding their inaugurations. The public is typically invited to attend these ceremonies, reflecting the democratic nature of local and state governance. This inclusivity helps to foster a sense of community and transparency.\n\nSimilar to presidential inaugurations, state and local inaugurations have increasingly utilized technology to reach a broader audience. Live streaming and social media have made it possible for more people to witness these events, even if they cannot attend in person.\n\nAngela O’Neal is Local History & Genealogy Manager for the Columbus Metropolitan Library.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/01/which-presidents-didnt-seek-another-term/74630352007/", "title": "Before Biden, which US presidents didn't seek re-election?", "text": "President Joe Biden’s decision not to seek reelection last month was the first time in more than half a century that a sitting U.S. president voluntarily stepped aside from seeking another term. The last time was in 1968 when President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would not accept his party’s nomination following a weak performance in the New Hampshire primary.\n\nWhile other presidents didn’t run for another term, including Harry Truman, Calvin Coolidge, James Polk, James Buchanan, Rutherford Hayes, and Theodore Roosevelt, to name a few, Biden is the only one who has left the race so close to the general election, as previously reported by USA TODAY.\n\nWhich U.S. presidents decided not to run for a second term?\n\nAlong with Biden and Johnson, two other presidents abandoned a reelection effort: Harry Truman in 1952, who said he would not be running for another term after being upset in the New Hampshire primary, and John Tyler in 1844, who had become president after William Henry Harrison died.\n\nTyler, the first president to serve fewer than two terms but not be the party’s nominee in the next election, had views that didn’t quite match up with either party. He dropped out of his reelection bid as a third-party candidate and endorsed James Polk on the Democratic ticket.\n\nFive presidents retired rather than seeking another term: Calvin Coolidge, Rutherford Hayes, James Buchanan, and Polk. Theodore Roosevelt also upheld his promise not to run for a third consecutive term in the 1908 race, but he regretted the decision. He later ran again in 1912 and lost to Woodrow Wilson.\n\nFour presidents ran for another term but lost their renomination bid: Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, Andrew Johnson, and Chester Arthur. Fillmore, Johnson, and Arthur were vice presidents who acceded to the presidency, while Pierce won his first election in 1852. But all struggled to maintain their party’s support the next time around - situations reminiscent of Biden’s, who faced calls from within his own party to step down.\n\nFinally, some presidents, like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, had already served two full terms and declined to serve a third one. They set the precedent for a two-term presidency, a tradition that later became law under the 22nd Amendment.\n\nDespite dropping out just 107 days before the 2024 presidential election, Biden did leave time for Democrats to choose a new candidate: Vice President Kamala Harris has emerged as the presumptive nominee.

Records and historians indicate the tab – from a party that took place days before the signing of the Constitution – was real.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user who shared the post for comment.\n\nWashington’s rowdy farewell party\n\nThe bender described in the Facebook post took place in September 1787, near the end of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.\n\nOn Sept. 15, after a long day of constitutional framing, Washington headed a few blocks down from Philadelphia’s Independence Hall to the Founding Fathers' go-to gathering spot, City Tavern. He met up with the Light Horse of Philadelphia, a volunteer cavalry corps that crossed the Delaware River with Washington, inspiring an iconic Revolutionary War painting\n\n\"The City Tavern was the place to go, practically every day,\" Gordon Lloyd, a professor emeritus at Pepperdine University, told USA TODAY.\n\nLloyd discovered a summary of Washington's tavern bill that night while digging through Independence Hall documents. According to the bill, the soon-to-be first president and 54 other guests did indeed order 54 bottles of Madeira, 60 bottles of Claret, 8 bottles of whiskey, 8 bottles of cider, 12 bottles of beer and seven “large bowls” of punch.\n\nThat would be about two bottles of wine, several shots and a few cups of punch and beer for every guest.\n\nGeorge Washington's night out:\n\nThe Washington Post reported the night’s tab to be estimated at about 89 pounds, four shillings and two pence – the rough equivalent of $15,400 today.\n\nIn addition to the drinks, the tab included dinner for all 55 guests, fees for broken glasses and meals and drinks for musicians and “servants.”\n\nBut the party might not have been all that much fun for Washington, according to Alexis Coe, historian and author of the Washington biography \"You Never Forget Your First.\"\n\n\"Washington really did not want to be there,\" Coe said of the Constitutional Convention. \"He was happy to provide the stable unifying presence that the founders and framers needed in order to sign the Constitution ... but he was exhausted, he was without his wife – who he really liked to be with – and he knew there was no way she would join him.\"\n\nThe future president likely didn't let the party get out of control, either.\n\n\"He was famously self-controlled,\" Coe said. \"If anyone had gotten out of hand, if anyone had done more than break a few glasses or made excessive toasts, he would have put them in place.\"\n\nOur rating: True\n\nBased on our research, we rate TRUE the claim that a bill shows a hefty bar tab for an extravagant 1787 party attended by George Washington.

But there are others too.\"\n\nTrump, a Republican, declined to specify other scenarios, saying it’s \"far too early to think about it.\" But Trump said that he was serious.\n\n\"I'm not joking,\" he said.\n\nWe asked constitutional law experts what they thought about Trump’s rationale for legally serving a third term.\n\nThey said the clear language of the Constitution’s 22nd Amendment directly bars Trump from running for a third term, and they widely agreed that allowing a president a third term would violate the Constitution’s spirit.\n\nBut would it violate its letter? It might not, legal experts said.\n\nA scenario like the one involving Vance, several legal scholars said, could provide a loophole that a motivated candidate like Trump could exploit — although with some big ifs.\n\nTrump would need to get buy-in from the courts and Congress, and the voters, who would have to weigh whether his performance during his second term and his health at 82 years on Inauguration Day 2029 — an age older than Joe Biden was as president — merited another four years in office.\n\n\"I think the best interpretation\" of the constitutional language \"is that Trump is ineligible to become president for a third term,\" said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor. \"However, the issue is not airtight.\"\n\nWhen we asked the White House to elaborate on Trump’s comment to Welker, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung said in a statement, \"Americans overwhelmingly approve and support President Trump and his America First policies. As the President said, it’s far too early to think about it and he is focused on undoing all the hurt Biden has caused and Making America Great Again.\"\n\nCould Trump legally run for a third term?\n\nBeginning with George Washington, who made a point of stepping down in 1797 after two terms in office, every president until Franklin Roosevelt in the 1940s served no more than two full elected terms. But this was a norm, not a written rule, and after the Great Depression and the start of World War II, Roosevelt successfully ran for a third term, and then a fourth.\n\nAfter Roosevelt’s unprecedentedly long tenure, officials of both parties agreed to codify the two-term presidential limit. The 22nd Amendment cleared Congress on March 21, 1947, and was ratified on Feb. 27, 1951, a little less than six years after Roosevelt died in office.\n\nThe relevant part of the 22nd Amendment says: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\"\n\nThis much, legal experts say, seems ironclad: No two-time winner of a presidential election can run for president a third time.\n\nBut there’s a caveat that hinges on the 22nd Amendment’s specific phrasing: It uses the word \"elected.\"\n\n\"There are ways to become president other than being elected president, and therein lies the problem,\" said Brian Kalt, a Michigan State University law professor who wrote about the question in the 2012 book, \"Constitutional Cliffhangers.\"\n\nThe logic undergirding a Vance-Trump switcheroo is that Trump would have been elected vice president, not president, and he would become president by succession, not by election.\n\n\"The constitution doesn't expressly prohibit that,\" said Frank O. Bowman III, a University of Missouri law professor.\n\nThe earliest and clearest articulation of this argument came in a 1999 law review article by Scott E. Gant and Bruce G. Peabody, then a junior lawyer and a Ph.D. student, respectively. Reached for this article, Gant — now a lawyer in private practice — said he still believed in the article’s analysis.\n\n\"A twice-elected president can clearly serve as president again,\" he told PolitiFact. Gant, who has since argued before the U.S. Supreme Court and taught about this issue in a Georgetown University law school seminar, cautioned against assuming how the justices would rule in a hypothetical case. Still, he said, \"I would expect they would agree with our conclusion.\"\n\nIn his book, Kalt wrote that presidential succession, distinct from presidential election, was a familiar concept to lawmakers as they were drafting the amendment.\n\n\"At the very moment that the 22nd Amendment was written in 1947, the incumbent president was Harry Truman, who had succeeded to the office and had not (yet) been elected in his own right,\" Kalt wrote. \"At that time, every generation in living memory had featured unelected presidents.\"\n\nThe constitutionality of the Vance-Trump scenario is not a slam dunk. The main legal argument against it comes from the 12th Amendment. That amendment, ratified in 1804, says, \"No person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\"\n\nHowever, the 12th Amendment makes no distinction between being elected president and serving as president. If one uses the logic that the 22nd Amendment prohibits a two-term president from being elected to a third term — but does not prohibit a president from serving a third term — then a two-term president is \"eligible\" to serve as president a third time, which would make Trump eligible to run as Vance’s vice presidential running mate.\n\nThere’s at least one other scenario that Trump could pursue. The Constitution doesn’t bar a former two-term president from becoming House speaker. Becoming president this way would require the resignation of both the elected president and an elected vice president; if that happened, the House speaker would be next in line for the presidency. (By the Constitution, an aspiring two-term president wouldn’t need to win a seat in the House to be elected speaker, although historically, the House has always elected one of its members as speaker.)\n\nHow realistic are these scenarios?\n\nNone of this is to say Trump’s path to securing a third term would be easy.\n\nEven if he’s popular enough and healthy enough to be a credible president in 2028, he’d have to lock in a commitment from Vance, or whoever is the Republican presidential nominee, to step down if elected.\n\nTrump would also need to get on the ballot in enough states to secure an Electoral College majority, something that many Democratic-leaning states would likely oppose.\n\n\"This would presumably trigger court challenges on the ground that he would not be constitutionally qualified to assume the office any more than, say, an 18-year-old would be,\" Bowman said. \"Those challenges should be successful, but these are weird times, and by then an even larger number of Trump loyalists will be on the federal appellate courts.\"\n\nAlthough the issues were somewhat different, the Supreme Court’s 9-0 2024 ruling in Trump v. Anderson could bolster Trump’s quest for a third term. In that case, Colorado sought to bar Trump from the 2024 ballot, arguing that his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riots disqualified him under the 14th Amendment. The justices disagreed that he could be barred on those grounds.\n\nMeanwhile, if Trump managed to win the vice presidency, Congress could refuse to certify the election results. This might be a moot point if Republicans win majorities in both the House and the Senate, and if the party was still closely aligned with Trump. But if Democrats won control, they could theoretically block Trump that way.\n\nWhatever constitutional interpretations could make a third Trump term possible, experts said it would violate the 22nd Amendment’s clear intent.\n\n\"By any measure, the whole point of the (22nd) Amendment was to send presidents home after two terms, and it looks as though this is what Congress and the states thought they were doing,\" Kalt wrote.\n\nEven if the courts and Congress lined up uniformly against a third Trump term, he would have another option, albeit unconstitutional by any measure: Simply refuse to give up the presidency.\n\n\"He'd have possession of the White House as well as at least nominal control over the national instruments of coercion, federal law enforcement and the military,\" Bowman said.\n\nOur sources", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/31/could-trump-run-again-president-says-its-no-joke-what-to-know/82738798007/", "title": "Can Donald Trump run for a third term?

However, a run for a third presidential term is unconstitutional. The 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, puts a term limit on presidential power in the U.S.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to be stopping Trump. He has made several comments about a third term during his first few months back at the white house.\n\nIn February, the official White House social media platforms portrayed Trump as a monarch. \"Long live the king,\" the post declared. Just one day after the post, Trump asked supporters at a White House reception, \"Should I run again?\"\n\n“A lot of people want me to do it,” Trump said in a phone interview. \"But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it’s very early in the administration.\"\n\nCan Donald Trump run for a third term?\n\nThe simple answer: No. Under the current constitutional safeguards, Trump cannot seek a third presidential term.\n\nTrump could try to pass a new constitutional amendment. This would require a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and Senate, or two-thirds of state legislatures can call a constitutional convention. Then, three-fourths of the state legislatures would have to ratify the amendment.\n\nIt's an intentionally difficult process that was last done in 1992 when the 27th Amendment was enacted.\n\nAsked by NBC whether he has been shown plans that would allow him to seek a third term, Trump said: \"There are methods which you could do it,\" including Vice President JD Vance running for president and then giving the role to Trump, according to USA TODAY reporting.\n\nIs there anything in the Constitution about presidential term limits?\n\nYes, it is clearly outlined in the 22nd Amendment that a person serving as president can only hold the office twice. Here's what it says:\n\n\"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"\n\nWhen did presidential term limits become part of the Constitution?\n\nThe 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951, according to the National Constitution Center. The idea of term limits came about from Republicans after President Franklin D. Roosevelt won four consecutive elections. His presidency started in 1933 during the Great Depression and spanned over 12 years until his death on April 12, 1945, during his fourth term.\n\nIt took nearly four years for the amendment to be ratified though.\n\nHave there always been presidential term limits?\n\nNot in writing.\n\nAmerica's first president, George Washington, set an unofficial precedent when the first elections in the United States were happening. Washington only served as president twice, declining multiple times to serve a third term.\n\nIn later years, Washington's decision to not seek a third term was seen as a safeguard against the type of tyrannical power wielded by the British monarchy during the Colonial era. According to the National Constitution Center, the concept of term limits was discussed at the Constitutional Convention when America was first founded but not added to the Constitution at that time.\n\nHas anyone sought more than two terms as president?\n\nOnly a handful of people have sought a third term as president before the 22nd Amendment was ratified.\n\nUlysses S. Grant tried for a third term in 1880, but he lost the Republican Party nomination to James Garfield\n\nGrover Cleveland lacked party support for a third term\n\nWoodrow Wilson hoped a deadlocked 1920 convention would turn to him for a third term\n\nTheodore Roosevelt originally passed on running for a third term in 1908, but would later run as third-party candidate in 1912 after a fallout with then-President William Howard Taft. Roosevelt beat Taft, but both lost to Woodrow Wilson.\n\nFormer President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously won not three, but four presidential elections, breaking the long-held tradition of two terms. While several predecessors had sought a third term, FRD was the only person to win four consecutive elections.\n\nFDR served as president from March 4, 1933, until his death on April 12, 1945. He led the country through the Great Depression and World War II.\n\nAs a result of FDR's unprecedented four terms, the 22nd Amendment was ratified, which limited all future presidents to two elected terms, according to the National Archives.\n\nUSA TODAY reporter Riley Beggin contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/31"}]}

The three-car train carrying President-Elect Abraham Lincoln on a 12-day journey from Springfield, Illinois to Washington, D.C. for his inauguration on March 4 stopped in Utica for 10 minutes. Lincoln spoke briefly on non-political matters to the crowd that had gathered in a snowstorm to see him. It was the same day that Jefferson Davis was sworn in as temporary president of the Confederate States of America.\n\n1865. The funeral train carrying Lincoln’s body back to Illinois after his assassination stopped in Utica for several minutes. The German Glee Club, forerunner to today’s Utica Maennerchor, sang.\n\nApril 21, 1884. A 25-year-old Theodore Roosevelt, a New York State assemblyman at the time, arrived in Utica two days before the Republican State Convention began at the Utica Opera House at Lafayette and Washington streets. By the end of the convention, Roosevelt had been elected as an at-large delegate to the Republican National Convention in Chicago, chosen to head the New York delegation in Chicago and drawn notice as an up-and-coming national politician. Roosevelt visited Utica often while serving in the state Assembly.\n\n1887. President Glover Cleveland came to Clinton to celebrate its centennial. Cleveland had lived briefly in Clinton as a boy before the family moved to Fayetteville and then settled in Holland Patent. When he was first elected in 1884, his sister Rose had left her home in Holland Patent to serve as his First Lady for 15 months until Cleveland married Frances Folsom.\n\n1890s. Benjamin Harrison, who left office in 1893, spent much of his time after retirement at his summer home on Second Lake near Old Forge. He and his wife Mary reportedly enjoyed shopping in downtown Utica.\n\nAug. 8, 1908. Roosevelt, in his second term as president, dedicated the Robinson Memorial Library in Jordanville in Herkimer County. The library was a gift to the town from Roosevelt’s sister Corinne Robinson and her husband Douglas, who lived in the area.\n\n1912. President William Howard Taft came to Utica to attend the funeral of his vice president, James Schoolcraft Sherman, a two-decade Congressman for the area, who died on Oct. 30, 1912.\n\nOct. 25, 1928. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in a tight race for governor at the time, attended a rally at Mohawk and Bleecker streets in Utica. The really was organized by Democratic Party leader Charles Donnelley and the head of East Utica’s Democratic machine, Rufus Elefante.\n\n1948. President Harry S. Truman’s spoke in Utica as part of his “whistle-stop” train tour that summer. He invited Mayor Boyd Golder into the presidential dining car for a chat.\n\n1950s. Ronald Reagan, then the host of the TV series “General Electric Theater,” drew large crowds when he visited the GE plants in Utica.\n\n1960. Then presidential candidate John F. Kennedy Jr. spoke at Utica Memorial Auditorium and attended an outdoor rally in front of the courthouse in Rome.\n\n1974. Vice President Gerald Ford attended a cocktail party in his honor at the Oneida County Airport along with Utica Mayor Edward Hanna. Ford had previously visited Utica as Speaker of the House to speak to Republican Party groups. And in 1966, then House Minority Leader Ford spoke to 1,200 people at the annual Lincoln Day Dinner at The Beeches in Rome.\n\n1983. Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush visited Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, hosted by his friend U.S. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert.\n\n1988. George W. Bush campaigned for his father during a two-hour stopover at Oneida County Airport that included a visit to Oriskany High School.\n\n2001. Jimmy Carter spoke at Hamilton College.\n\nNov. 9, 2004. Bill Clinton spoke to a crowd of 4,600 at Hamilton College. Another 1,100 watched on closed circuit TV on campus.\n\nMay 22, 2014. While in office, Barack Obama flew into Griffiss International Airport in Rome, flew by helicopter to a helipad outside Cooperstown and was driven by a motorcade to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown where he gave a 15-minute speech on tourism. Cooperstown schools closed early so students could watch the motorcade drive through town.\n\nApril 12, 2016. Presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke to a crowd of 5,000 at a rally at Griffiss International Airport.\n\nAug. 13, 2018. President Trump flew into Griffiss again, on Air Force One this time, and was met by a crowd that clapped, cheered and chanted, “USA! USA!” He met with Brian and Lynnette Wyman, parents of Oneida County Deputy Kurt Wyman who was killed in the line of duty in 2011. Trump then traveled by motorcade to the Doubletree Hilton Hotel Utica to attend a private fundraiser for U.S. Rep. Claudia Tenney.

Bush and his son George W. Bush have served as presidents. Of course, the elder Bush was a Navy fighter pilot in World War II, where he served with distinction. He later became CIA director, then served as vice president to Ronald Reagan before winning the White House himself.\n\nThere is only one other family in U.S. history with such a presidential tradition. The Adams family produced a father-son presidential duo, with John Adams serving as president from 1797-1801 and John Quincy Adams serving from 1825-1829. The Harrison family had a grandfather-grandson combination in William Henry Harrison who was president for only 31 days, dying in office in 1841, and his grandson, Benjamin Harrison who served as president from 1889 to 1893.\n\nThe Roosevelt family produced two presidents who were fifth cousins, Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt and then Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Teddy earned fame with the Rough Riders, while FDR became the longest serving U.S. president, elected to four consecutive terms. FDR became the man responsible for causing the passage of the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, limiting a president to two elected terms.\n\nFDR is famous for his controversial New Deal legislation, which established the framework for the nation's recovery from the Great Depression. The New Deal was foundational when Lyndon Johnson maneuvered his “Great Society” social welfare legislation through Congress.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nFDR also led the nation through almost all of World War II. His leadership was critical in not only the U.S. military involvement in the war, but perhaps more importantly he came up with the lend-lease program that kept arms flowing into the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, thus ensuring both nations could stay in the fight during seriously dark times as they faced the Nazi war machine.\n\nAmerica’s most tragic presidential family is, without doubt, the Kennedy family. Joe Kennedy, the patriarch, had aspirations to be president himself, but his work as ambassador to the United Kingdom became an embarrassment to the Roosevelt administration. He was strongly antisemitic and his efforts to forward the policy of appeasement with Germany put him at odds with Roosevelt and United Kingdom Prime Minister Winston Churchill. His public comments eventually led to his recall and the end of his political aspirations.\n\nKennedy’s oldest son, Joseph Kennedy Jr., the Kennedy most likely to be president after his father's dreams were unfulfilled, was killed while flying a dangerous mission over the English Channel during World War II.\n\nIt was John F. Kennedy who eventually became the Kennedy in the White House. Everyone, of course, knows the romanticism surrounding the Kennedy presidency, as well as the tragedy. Joe Kennedy’s other children to attain high political office were Bobby Kennedy who was also felled by an assassin during his presidential campaign, and Teddy, a longtime U.S. senator. Teddy Kennedy sank his own chances for the presidency with the Chappaquiddick incident.\n\nEven today, after many trials and travails, there is a Kennedy running in the Democratic presidential race, attempting to add another name to the Kennedy political legacy. One hopes his name will not also be added to the tragic family legacy.\n\nIf we look back throughout history, a few names stand out like stars in the night sky for their service to the nation. Abraham Lincoln is widely regarded as the greatest U.S. president for his leadership through the time of the most severe crisis the country has ever faced, as well as for his abolition of slavery. Those are two accomplishments that would be hard to top.\n\nFDR and George Washington are the two presidents who could contend for the top spot and for obvious reasons.\n\nThe worst president in U.S. history is considered to be James Buchanan, whose presidency came before Lincoln’s and whose leadership created the mess that was passed to Lincoln. Donald Trump is ranked as the second-worst president. He is, of course, the only president who attempted to overthrow his own country’s government and will ever be known for his chaotic handling of the COVID-19 crisis. The third-worst president is considered to be Andrew Johnson who came immediately after Lincoln. The Tennessean did nothing to safeguard the rights of freed slaves and his inaction would lead to nearly 100 years of legal discrimination against Blacks, particularly in the former slave states.\n\nU.S. News and World Report compiled the list of worst presidents based upon a trio of metrics developed by experts in the field of presidential history.\n\nWhile you might not agree with either the best or the worst presidents mentioned above, the one thing we can all agree on is that the best former president is Jimmy Carter. I can’t think of a more decent man who has ever served in the office of the president. While his tenure in the White House is never going to be considered great, and many will look back on those years as among the worst in our history due to the rampant inflation and the horrors of the Iran hostage crisis, his performance since leaving office has been nothing short of spectacular. If nothing else, Carter is a great human being.\n\nGary Cosby Jr. is the photo editor of The Tuscaloosa News.

Journal News\n\nYONKERS, N.Y. — An auction house in New York is selling a letter by George Washington describing a sale of 90 slaves he supervised less than two years before the Declaration of Independence.\n\nCohasco Inc., of Yonkers, N.Y., is offering the founding father's letter, a reward poster for runaway slaves and 440 other historical documents in an auction ending 8 p.m. ET Wednesday. One of the auction's highlights is the Washington 1774 letter describing his sale of the Virginia estate of Col. George Mercer, a friend who served under Washington in the French & Indian War.\n\n\"What makes the letter historically significant is that Washington started life as a slave owner in his early teens and by about this time he began to realize that he had a conflict, an intellectual conflict,\" said Bob Snyder, vice president of Cohasco. \"On the one hand he was agitating for American independence and freedom. On the other hand he's surrounded by slaves.\"\n\nCohasco estimated the value of the Washington letter at $32,000 to $40,000, but as of Monday morning, the bidding for it was about $45,000. Snyder declined to reveal the name of the person selling the Washington letter.\n\n► Related:New photo shows ‘beautiful, resilient’ Harriet Tubman\n\nSnyder said that Washington's sale of the Mercer slaves before the Revolutionary War helped change Washington's views on slavery.\n\n\"Suddenly he found himself in direct contact with black soldiers, some of whom were free blacks, some were slaves, some were slaves who had been promised their freedom if they would serve, and many did on that basis,\" Snyder said. \"So he began to have this contact with them in another context, as opposed to being on a plantation.\"\n\nCohasco holds auctions once or twice a year, often in February. Snyder said that the auction's end date was adjusted so that it would fall near Presidents Day in a nod to the documents related to Washington, Abraham Lincoln and black history.\n\nThe Lincoln connection in Cohasco's auction is an 1848 runaway slave poster offering a $250 reward for the capture and return of three black sisters named Maria, Susan and Harriet Johnson to their owner in Washington, D.C. The sisters were eventually caught and remained slaves until they were freed in 1864 when Lincoln's administration paid for their and other Washington, D.C., slaves' emancipation, 14 years after slavery was officially abolished in the nation's capital.\n\nSnyder described the poster as rare because it was never intended to be saved.\n\n\"They were printed under very crude conditions. You can see the wood type was used, not even metal type here, and they were printed in small numbers,\" Snyder said. \"They were meant basically to be nailed to a tree or put up in the general store and then if the wind blew it down they would just wash into the gutter and that was the end of it, so the fact that any of them survived is only an accident.\"\n\n► Related:Hitler's phone which 'sent millions to their deaths' sold for $243K at auction\n\nThe reason the three sister slaves poster survived is attributable to a handwritten annotation on the bottom of the poster stating that the poster was used in a legal proceeding against the three sisters.\n\nCohasco estimated the runaway slaves poster's value at $6,500 to $9,000, but as of Monday morning, the bidding was at $12,000.\n\nSnyder said the Washington letter and the runaway slaves poster don't necessarily appeal to one type of collector because collectors have varied interests.\n\n\"There are people who only collect Lincoln, Babe Ruth, Washington, Geronimo, whatever it is,\" he said. \"And there are collectors of African American stuff exclusively, many of whom are white.\"\n\nFollow Ernie Garcia on Twitter: @ErnieJourno", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/10/05/henry-a-wallace-and-george-washington-carver-plaque-tells-their-story-drake-iowa-neighborhood/8107220002/", "title": "Iowa plaque tells story of Henry A. Wallace, George Washington ...", "text": "About 120 years ago on what was then the far western edge of Des Moines lived a bright teen named Henry A. Wallace.\n\nGiven the use of 5 acres of his family's land, he planted corn for use in experiments that, drawing on lessons in plant genetics he had learned from none other than George Washington Carver, launched him on the path to devising hybridized strains of corn — the cornerstone of Iowa row crop agriculture today.\n\nSo goes the story told on a historic marker at the corner of 38th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, where Grace United Methodist Church now stands on the site of the Wallace home. The plaque depicts a rapt Henry listening as Carver instructs him in a field of tall grass.\n\nIs this charming and remarkable story true? I've been intrigued with it since I first spotted the marker while on a walk near my Drake neighborhood home.\n\nI learned to be skeptical about historical markers during my years as an Atlanta resident. My neighborhood there was thick with memorials to Civil War battles, and as I did my own reading and research, I realized a brass casting often is an invitation to hagiography.\n\nBut there's plenty of evidence to back the story of the tie between the Scotch-Irish-descended boy who went on to be vice president of the United States and the brilliant former slave who later worked to enhance the commercial viability of peanuts and sweet potatoes, providing poor Southern farmers an escape from the bondage of cotton.\n\nWallace was the third generation of an Iowa family that dedicated itself to farming with a scientific approach. When he was around 5 or 6, his father, Henry C., a future U.S. secretary of agriculture, was a professor at the Iowa Agricultural College, now Iowa State University.\n\nCarver, born in Missouri during the Civil War, was the first Black student at the university, arriving in Ames to study botany after a stint at Indianola's Simpson College. After graduating, he served briefly on the faculty of the future ISU and became a friend of the elder Wallace, occasionally dining with the family. During those visits, he would take Henry for nature walks, introducing him to the plants he found so intriguing. Henry would later call him the \"kindliest, most patient teacher I ever knew.”\n\nThe Wallaces moved in 1899 to Des Moines, where Henry's father and grandfather, also named Henry, achieved great success publishing Wallace's Farmer, a progressive agriculture journal. In the early 1900s, when Henry was a student at Des Moines' West High School, he got his family's consent to plant 5 acres of corn on land that was on or near the site of the present-day church.\n\nThat's where facts veer from the plaque's account.\n\nAccording to the authoritative biography \"American Dreamer: A Life of Henry A. Wallace,\" by the late Iowa U.S. Sen. John Culver and longtime Des Moines Register reporter John Hyde, Henry wasn't conducting genetic experiments. He was trying to disprove a popular agronomist's contention that the best-shaped, most visually appealing ears of corn had the best yields.\n\nPlanting the scientist's preferred strains and some that were ugly but dependable, Henry succeeded in showing that, as he suspected, the less well-groomed corn produced more food for hogs — who, as he observed, didn't care a whit for what corn looked like.\n\nThe claim that Henry had learned plant genetics from Carver in the early 1890s strains credibility, given that the science was in its early stages then and that no matter how brilliant, a kindergartner was unlikely to grasp the complexities of it. Henry himself would later relate in an address that Carver had awakened his interest in plants by teaching him to recognize different species and praising him for having a good eye.\n\nAlso, as Henry's brother James would point out in an address he made in the 1970s, Henry didn't invent hybrid corn, and never claimed to have. His achievement was to recognize the value of hybrid crops, experiment with and improve them and form what became Pioneer Hi-Bred Seed Co., an early marketer of the seed. The company was a predecessor to Corteva Agriscience, the global seed giant that today has major facilities in Johnston.\n\nThe wealth Wallace amassed allowed him to pursue a career in public service. Bolting to the Democrats after a policy disagreement with his ancestral Republican Party, Wallace followed in his father's footsteps, serving as secretary of agriculture in the first two terms of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, then winning election in the third as vice president before a run-in with the party's conservative wing saw him relegated to secretary of commerce.\n\nHe himself wasn't given to the hyperbole of the plaque that honors him. In a 1962 speech, he recalled the family's first Des Moines home as a \"dilapidated old house\" with \"slanting floors and cracked linoleum,\" no electricity and outdoor plumbing. He walked 4 miles round trip to school and complained he didn't have time for extracurriculars, grousing, \"My parents had held me in a pioneer status too long.\"\n\nBut there is no exaggerating the fascination of the story of the two very different people, both bound for greatness, who found their common humanity in a fascination with plants.\n\nBill Steiden is the business and investigative editor for the Register.

Roosevelt and other American leaders of the free world at the Ontario County Historical Society in Canandaigua are tangible reminders of their presidencies and the reach far and wide of the Office of the President.\n\nThe Ontario County Historical Society has a lot of neat stuff. Some may not know just how much neat presidential stuff is in its collection, which includes photos of George W. Bush's visit to Canandaigua in 2006, a portrait of then Gov. Roosevelt, taken by Canandaigua photographer Peggy Stewart, and many other items large and small, including a tiny brass and enamel pin promoting Herbert Hoover.\n\nMost of the museum's over 30,000 artifacts, including those of a presidential nature, are donated, according to Curator Wilma Townsend.\n\nIn celebration of Presidents Day, here are the top 6 (or so) items.\n\n1. Abraham Lincoln life mask\n\nA plaster cast of a life mask of a beardless Abraham Lincoln may be the best-known and the most popular must-see item in the collection.\n\nChicago sculptor Leonard W. Volk, who was a native of Wells, Hamilton County, prepared the cast in spring 1860, when Lincoln was attending the Republican Convention in Chicago as the presidential candidate. The mask was used for future sculptures including a full-length statue of Lincoln.\n\nA family member gave the mask to state Sen. John Raines, who lived on Gorham Street, Canandaigua and his summer residence \"Thendara\" on Canandaigua Lake. He gave the mask to the Ontario County Historical Society prior to his death in 1909.\n\nThe mask is, Townsend said, \"happily sitting here in its storage box, and it’s safe. If anybody wants to come and look at it, we can get it out.\"\n\n2. Lincoln and Hamlin in 1860\n\nThe “Lincoln & Hamlin” American flag, which is printed on cotton with 13 red-and-white stripes and 31 white stars on blue background, promoted the GOP ticket in the 1860 presidential campaign. Lincoln became the nation's 16th president, and Hannibal Hamlin became its 15th vice president.\n\n3. George Washington and peace in the country’s beginning\n\nObviously, an item with etchings of George Washington and a Native American, goes way, way back in the history of the U.S., and it does. Engraved on front is \"George Washington President 1792.\"\n\nThe United States government gave medals to the chiefs of different Native American nations in commemoration of various peace treaty negotiations. This medal is believed to have been presented at a meeting in Philadelphia.\n\n4. 'Adams Forever,' or not\n\nA sewing box, with “Adams Forever” stenciled on the outside with an illustration of President John Quincy Adams on the inside, is a favorite of Townsend's. It dates to the election of 1828, when President Andrew Jackson defeated Adams.\n\nRemember, this was well before women had the right to vote, and the sewing box was a way that women could convey their political views, Townsend said.\n\n\"Clearly, they were talking about politics,\" Townsend said. \"They couldn’t vote but they could certainly talk about it.\"\n\n5. James Garfield torch\n\nThe Historical Society has a torch carried in a parade in Bristol Center in 1880 when James Garfield was elected president. Oil or kerosene lamps on long poles were used to illuminate parades and political gatherings. Garfield was assassinated during his first year in office.\n\n6. Presidential political pins\n\nThe Historical Society has political pins promoting Herbert Hoover, who ran successfully for president in 1928; a rhinestone-encrusted pin for Dwight D. “Ike” Eisenhower, the first of his two terms in the Oval Office starting in 1953; and Lyndon Baines “LBJ” Johnson, who became president after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963.\n\nWhat about Biden and Trump?\n\nThe Historical Society has no items relating to President Joe Biden or President Donald Trump.\n\nYet.\n\n\"Certainly, we would be happy to take small items, souvenirs or promotional materials for both of them, particularly if they have some local connection,\" Townsend said.\n\nHow to see the presidential items\n\nThe presidential items are not on exhibit now, however. But if someone wants to see a particular item, just call the museum and set up an appointment, Townsend said.\n\n“Like most museums, we don’t have a lot of the collection on exhibit just because there’s no room,” Townsend said. “And it’s better long term for the artifacts and papers and so forth to be stored and brought out for an exhibit or for somebody doing research. Something that somebody just wants to see, that’s fine.”\n\nMore about the Ontario County Historical Society\n\nThe Ontario County Historical Society is at 55 N. Main St., Canandaigua.

In 1803, the United States paid France $15 million for the Louisiana Territory, approximately 828,000 square miles of land west of the Mississippi River. The lands acquired stretched from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian border. Thirteen states were carved from the Louisiana Territory.\n\nFlorida\n\nIn 1819, Spain gave East Florida to the United States. Although they received no compensation, according to the State Department, the United States agreed to assume liability for $5 million in damage done by American citizens who rebelled against Spain.\n\nTexas\n\nDuring his tenure, U.S. President James K. Polk oversaw the most significant territorial expansion of the United States following the Louisiana Purchase.\n\nFollowing Texas’ successful war of independence against Mexico in 1836, Polk annexed Texas in 1845, and by 1846, the United States declared war on Mexico, resulting in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo.\n\nUnder the treaty’s terms in 1848, Mexico gave up approximately 525,000 square miles (55% of its prewar territory) in exchange for a $15 million lump sum payment.\n\nThe Gadsden Purchase\n\nThe U.S. made the Gadsden Purchase in 1853 to acquire a nearly 30,000 square-mile region of present-day southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico in a treaty signed by the American ambassador to Mexico, James Gadsden. The purchase was the last major territorial acquisition in the contiguous United States, according to the National Archives.\n\nAlaska\n\nThe U.S. purchased Alaska, a territory from Russia, in 1867 for 586,412 square miles of territory for $12 per square mile, less than two cents an acre, for a total of $7.2 million. Alaska didn’t gain statehood until 1959, becoming the 49th state in the Union.\n\nSpanish-American War purchase\n\nThe United States acquired Guam and Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War in 1898, where the U.S. victory forced Spain to give up control of these territories through the Treaty of Paris; this treaty also granted the U.S. control of the Philippines, but the nation would later gain full independence in 1946.\n\nHawaii\n\nThe Spanish-American War increased the strategic value of Hawaii as a base for military operations in the Philippines, which led to its annexation in 1898. Hawaii became a U.S. territory in 1900, and in 1959, it became the 50th state in which 90% of the islanders supported statehood.\n\nAmerican Samoa\n\nThe matai (local chiefs) of Tutuila, the largest island in American Samoa, gave the island to the United States in 1900. Manu'a followed in 1904 and Swain Island joined the territory in 1925 by an act of the Congress. Authority was transferred to the Department of the Interior (DOI) in 1956.\n\nVirgin Islands\n\nBeginning in 1867, the United States made several attempts to expand its influence into the Caribbean and asked Denmark if they were willing to sell the Danish West Indies, according to the State Department. Unlike Greenland, the Danes were willing to sell the islands to the U.S. for $25 million in the 1917 Treaty. After the transfer, the U.S. government changed the name of the territory to the Virgin Islands of the United States.\n\nReuters contributed to the reporting of this story.\n\nVictor Hagan is the Alabama Election Reporting Fellow for the USA TODAY Network.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThomas Jefferson helped write the Declaration of Independence and represents the United States’ expansion as the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803 allowed the young country to double its size and move west.\n\nAbraham Lincoln, who championed the end of slavery, represents the preservation of the United States for how he held the nation together during the tumultuous Civil War from 1861 to 1865.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt represents leadership during the country’s early 20th century economic growth when he played a key role in establishing the Panama Canal shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and became a “trust buster” to end corporate monopolies. He also fought for the environment by establishing 150 national forests, five national parks and 55 preserves that would become the National Wildlife Refuge System in 1903.\n\nBuilt to draw travelers\n\nThe concept for Mount Rushmore was proposed by historian Doane Robinson in 1923 as a bold way to draw tourists to the state as more people bought their first motor cars and roads were being expanded across the country. The national memorial was declared completed in 1941 and now draws close to 2.5 million visitors annually.\n\nThe film at Mount Rushmore’s Lincoln Borglum Visitor Center explains the challenges of carving the mountain as well as the pivotal eras represented by each president.\n\nThe Presidential Trail, which begins at the Grand View Terrace, takes visitors through ponderosa pines and loops closer to the mountain for additional views, such as seeing Washington’s face framed by rock. On the trail’s last stretch, guests can see Gutzon Borglum’s Sculptor’s Studio, which includes a scale model of the original carving concept.\n\nBorglum intended to carve the presidents to their waists, but the declining quality of rock as crews progressed forced them to reign in the design. An idea for a Hall of Records behind the memorial also didn’t reach completion.\n\nMost people spend three to four hours at the memorial, with many returning or staying until the evening program in the outdoor amphitheater. It begins at 9 p.m. from the Friday before Memorial Day through early August and at 8 p.m. through Sept. 30. The program can draw up to 2,000 people for a short talk by a park ranger, a film inspired by the presidents and the history they represent and the illumination of Mount Rushmore. Attendees also stand to sing the national anthem and recognize retired and active military members, and Gold Star families who’ve lost someone in service to their country.\n\nCrazy Horse carving continues. The original idea for what became Mount Rushmore would have depicted Western heroes, such as Oglala Lakota leader Red Cloud and “Buffalo Bill” Cody. Chief Henry Standing Bear proposed a carving of a Lakota leader in the Black Hills, and work began in 1948 on Crazy Horse Memorial about 15 miles from Mount Rushmore.\n\nThe 87-foot-tall face is finished, along with part of his arm and the top of the horse he rides. Crazy Horse is expected to be the world’s largest sculpture when it’s complete, rising more than 500 feet tall. Operated by a nonprofit foundation, the site is also home to the Indian Museum of North America, art galleries and Native American cultural programs. Many tribal nations consider Pahá Sápa (the Black Hills) a sacred place, as well as an ancestral home.\n\nHere are some tips for enjoying a visit to Mount Rushmore:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/02/10/obama-holland-monticello-state-visit/5361833/", "title": "Obama, Hollande get beyond 'freedom fries'", "text": "Aamer Madhani\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nState visit starts with a visit to Jefferson%27s Monticello\n\nHollande visit comes in the wake of scandal over his love life\n\nFormal state dinner will be held Tuesday night\n\nPresident Obama rolled out the red carpet for Francois Hollande on Monday, kicking off a state visit for the French president with a tour of the picturesque estate that belonged to Thomas Jefferson, a pivotal figure in establishing the U.S.-Franco relationship.\n\nJefferson, the third president of the United States, started building Monticello when he was a young man.\n\nA noted Francophile who served as U.S. ambassador to France, Jefferson lived in France as the French Revolution unfolded.\n\nWith the trip to the Virginia plantation, Obama intended to underscore the long and increasingly crucial relationship between the U.S. and France.\n\n\"This home represents the bonds that helped lead to the American revolution, helped to influence the French Revolution,\" Obama said after they completed their tour.\n\nHollande joked about how Jefferson purchased the Louisiana territory from Napoleon in 1803.\n\n\"It was a good bargain!\" Obama quipped..\n\nThe visit by Hollande comes at awkward moment -- just weeks after he announced that he has split with companion and France's first lady, Valérie Trierweiler. The split followed reports last month that Hollande had been having an affair with actress Julie Gayet.\n\nBut the two leaders seemed intent on noting how far the two countries have come since the days of American lawmakers rebuking France for its opposition to the Iraq war by ordering their burgers with a side of \"freedom fries.\"\n\n\"A decade ago, few would have imagined our two countries working so closely together in so many ways. But in recent years our alliance has transformed,\" Obama and Hollande wrote in a joint Op-Ed published in the Washington Post and Le Monde on Monday.\n\nWhite House officials on Monday highlighted the two countries' cooperation in reaching an interim agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program through the P5+1 as well as their ongoing effort to end the three-year-old civil war in Syria. Even before Hollande began his presidency last year, the Obama administration coordinated closely with the French on Afghanistan and Libya.\n\nFrance has also played a key role in dealing with security challenges in combating the rise of Islamic militants in places like Mali and the Central African Republic, with airlift and other logistical support coming from the Untied States.\n\nThe two leaders will also spend plenty of time talking about economic issues, including ongoing negotiations for a major U.S.-European Union trade deal, and France's ailing economy.\n\nBoth Obama and Hollande are facing declining popularity -- in Hollande's case, he has the lowest favorability rating of any modern French president.\n\nAlthough U.S. unemployment has fallen to 6.6%, Obama has repeatedly acknowledged that too many Americans are struggling, and he has made addressing income inequality a central focus of his remaining time in office.\n\nHollande faces a more difficult situation, with French unemployment hovering around 11% and 0.4% economic growth in the last quarter.\n\nThe two returned to Washington on Monday night, where Hollande was to have dinner with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde and World Bank President Jim Yong Kim.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hollande and Obama will meet again at the White House and hold a joint news conference.\n\nHollande will also be honored with a luncheon by Vice President Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday afternoon, and the official visit will be wrapped up with a state dinner on Tuesday night at the White House.\n\nWhite House executive chef Cristeta Comerford and White House pastry chef William Yosses appear ready for the challenge of cooking for the leader of the gastronomic epicenter of the universe and have come up with their \"Across America\" menu for the dinner.\n\nIf the dinner isn't impressive enough, the evening's entertainment should be. The White House has arranged for Mary J. Blige to perform after dinner.\n\nThe White House won't say yet how many they expect to attend Tuesday night's dinner, the seventh state or official dinner of Obama's presidency.\n\nBut one indicator that they've invited a big group is that the White House announced it will not be using any of its official china. White House curator Bill Allman explained that none of the services are big enough to accommodate the expected crowd.\n\nBefore returning to France, Hollande will also travel to San Francisco on Wednesday and meet with tech executives, including officials from Facebook, Twitter and Google.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/02/10"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/955229/the-weeks-christmas-quiz-history-and-politics", "title": "The Week's Christmas quiz: history and politics - The Week's ...", "text": "1.

In 1946, when President Harry Truman tried to purchase Greenland, Secretary of State James Byrnes wrote that the proposal \"seemed to come as a shock\" and an insult to Danish officials, who turned it down.\n\nThat was a big mistake.\n\nAs part of his deal, Truman had offered to trade parts of the Point Barrow district of Alaska, including the rights to any oil discovered there, to Denmark, in exchange for parts of Greenland. The Danes dismissed the idea just as they did Trump's proposal.\n\nIn 1967, the richest oil strike in U.S. history was made in the Point Barrow area. Bad move, Denmark! Sad!\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWith that blunder in their rearview mirror, you would think that Danish leaders would at least hear Trump out. The president's idea of buying Greenland is far from absurd. Today, we have a military base in Greenland, so there is no need to buy it for that purpose. But Greenland has enormous unexplored stores of natural resources, including zinc, lead, gold, iron ore, diamonds, copper and uranium, that Denmark has been unable or unwilling to exploit.\n\nIt also has large, untapped stores of rare-earth elements, such as praseodymium or dysprosium, that are critical to the production of everything from electric cars to smartphones and lasers. Today, the United States gets many of these rare-earth elements from China, which makes Americans dependent on Beijing.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Beijing may cut off access to those minerals in its trade dispute with Washington, and China is also trying to corner the market for rare-earth elements in Greenland. Buying Greenland would put those strategically valuable minerals in U.S. hands.\n\nBut what makes Greenland particularly valuable to the United States is global warming. The unavoidable receding of Arctic sea ice will open a new sea route in the Arctic that can be used for both commercial and military vessels.\n\nIn May, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered an address at the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in Finland in which he pointed out that \"steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new opportunities for trade. This could potentially slash the time it takes to travel between Asia and the West by as much as 20 days.\" He added that the emerging \"Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st-century Suez and Panama canals.\"\n\nHe's right. A recent report in the New York Times notes that as sea ice melts and \"Arctic routes become more direct, voyage times could fall to less than three weeks in some cases, making Arctic shipping potentially more attractive than the southern routes in coming decades.\"\n\nThe United States and its allies have a major interest in not allowing these Arctic sea lanes to fall under Russian or Chinese control. \"Do we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a New South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?\" Pompeo asked in Finland. Purchasing Greenland would help the United States to better secure these emerging strategic passageways.\n\nIn 1946, the Joint Chiefs of Staff told Truman that Greenland was \"completely worthless to Denmark.\" Today, Denmark may not feel that way. But rather than getting offended, Copenhagen should entertain Trump's offer. After all, it would not be the first time Denmark sold the United States one of its overseas possessions.\n\nIn 1916, it sold the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands) to President Woodrow Wilson. So, we've long ago established that parts of Denmark are for sale; there's no harm haggling over the price.\n\nIndeed, a Greenland purchase would be in keeping with a long history of presidential land acquisitions. In 1803, Thomas Jefferson bought the Louisiana territory from France. In 1819, President James Monroe bought Florida from Spain. In 1854, President Franklin Pierce, in the Gadsden Purchase, bought part of New Mexico and Arizona from Mexico.\n\nIn 1867, President Andrew Johnson bought Alaska from Russia. In 1898, President William McKinley bought the Philippines from Spain. And in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt rented the Panama Canal Zone from Panama and Guantanamo Bay from Cuba. If Denmark won't sell Greenland, maybe we can rent it!\n\nOn Monday, Trump tweeted a picture of a gleaming Trump high-rise amid small huts on the Greenland coast and declared, \"I promise not to do this to Greenland!\" But the idea of buying Greenland is no joke. It actually makes a lot of strategic and economic sense.\n\nMarc A.

Land south of the river was Spanish Territory until 1821, when Mexico won its fight for independence.

They sought asylum status, hoping for better lives in the United States.\n\nNews outlets recorded videos showing horse-mounted border police grabbing Haitians trying to cross from Mexico into the United States. One infamous picture that spread across the internet showed a mounted officer clutching a Black Haitian man by the shirt with what some thought was a whip.\n\nBorder Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz said Monday the agent was swinging his horses’ reins, not a whip. Still, the imagery caused outrage. The use of horseback patrol has been suspended, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday.\n\nByrnes Guillaume, a Palm Beach County attorney who helped organize the Saturday rally, laid out three demands: Hold the border agents accountable, treat Haitians with dignity and have an “action plan” to accept and house them.\n\nBiden said Friday, “There will be consequences” for those patrolmen, adding that an investigation will be conducted. “Those people will pay,” he said. “It’s beyond embarrassing. It’s dangerous and it’s wrong.”\n\nBut the Texas encampment has been cleared of Haitians, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Friday. He said about 12,400 migrants have been allowed to enter the country, at least temporarily, while they make claims before an immigration judge.\n\nMayorkas said another 5,000 were in DHS custody and being processed to determine whether they will be expelled or allowed to press their claim for legal residency. Some returned to Mexico. Flights to Haiti continued Saturday and were scheduled to continue Sunday, a U.S. official told the Associated Press.\n\nThe clearing of the camp infuriated the crowd of mostly Haitians and Haitian-Americans gathered Saturday. They wanted the U.S. immigration system to legally process those migrants.\n\n“Everybody deserves a hearing!” Cherfilus-McCormick yelled. “We’ve paid our dues! We held up the health care system! During COVID it was us who were working! It was us who were getting sick!” The crowd cheered and clapped in response. The Homeland Security Department said Wednesday it is releasing Haitians into the U.S. but did not disclose how many.\n\nThat message, “we’ve paid our dues,” rang from rally speakers and was echoed by attendees.\n\n“We fought for this land,” audience member Cherdeline Pierre-Louis, 39, of West Palm Beach said. “And you’re telling us we don’t belong here? That makes no sense to me.” The proud Haitian-American mother of four, who helps ship basic supplies to Haiti, was referencing a piece of U.S. history not taught in many schools.\n\nIn October 1779, three years into the American Revolutionary War, 545 Haitian free Blacks joined the Continental army and French troops in Savannah, Ga., to fight the British. Their unit was bigger than the American one. The Brits won that battle, driving back the pro-independence coalition and killing hundreds of Americans and their French and Haitian allies. But the surviving Haitian troops tasted battle and learned its tactics.\n\nWhen they returned home, they led their people in a struggle for freedom against the French. Haiti was still a slave colony of France at the time called Saint-Domingue.\n\nAs the rebellion came close to throwing off colonial rule in 1803, Emperor Napoleon could see the writing on the wall. France would lose. He had hoped to sell sugar, spices and other goods in New Orleans from the slave colony in Saint-Domingue. But that seemed unlikely with the success of the Haitian revolt.\n\nSo he sold the French Empire’s largest territory to the United States, the deal known as the Louisiana Purchase, spanning an area now occupied by 15 states, from Louisiana through Montana.\n\nSpeakers at the Saturday rally in West Palm Beach emphasized that point: Without Haiti, America might not exist.\n\n“We owe Haiti a great debt,” state Rep. Omari Hardy said Saturday at the West Palm Beach rally. “But we are treating them with disrespect.”\n\nHardy and Cherfilus-McCormick, both Haitian-American Democrats, are running for the same seat in Congress, Florida’s 20th House District. The winner will represent Black neighborhoods in the Glades as well as Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties.\n\nSaturday's speakers included another contender for the seat, Jamaican-American Democrat Dale Holness, and Boynton Beach resident Golene Gordon, who said she will run for mayor of that city next year.\n\nMany people like those at the rally voted for Biden, hoping to end the inhumane treatment of immigrants under former President Donald Trump, Hardy said, so it was dismaying to see migrants continue to face such treatment at the hands of the Biden administration.\n\n“That a Democratic president is doing this is disrespectful,” Hardy said. “We need an immigration system that is based on fulfilling the needs of human beings and on furthering the interests, or at least the stated interests, of this country.”\n\n'We are human, too'\n\nCrisis after crisis has plagued Haiti in recent months.\n\nAn earthquake ravaged the country Aug. 14, killing more than 2,200 people, damaging or destroying more than 137,000 homes and leaving more than 40% of the population in need of humanitarian assistance, the Haitian Civil Protection General Directorate reported.\n\nDays later, Hurricane Grace, a Category 3 storm, ripped through Hispaniola, the island where Haiti is located.\n\nA month earlier, on July 7, President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated. Violent gangs financed by powerful politicos have sprouted to fill the power vacuum, the Associated Press reported.\n\nMany of the Haitians who gathered under the Del Rio bridge had come from South American countries such as Chile, where they had lived for years until a recent surge of COVID-19 infections.\n\nSaturday’s rally goers repeated a grievance long held by some Haitians and their children in America: The U.S. government treats people coming from Haiti worse than migrants from other nations, even though Haitians fleeing to America are trying to escape terrible conditions in their home country, like migrants from other places.\n\n“When Afghanistan needed help, did America ... go and get them?” radio show host Kelline Jean Baptiste asked the audience. “Yes!” they replied. The U.S. has flown more than 116,000 Afghans out of that country after ending its 20-year war there and conducting mass evacuations in August. The country quickly fell to the Taliban, an oppressive group of Islamic fundamentalists.\n\nJean Baptiste also argued that the U.S. government has treated Haitian migrants worse than people coming from Cuba, ruled for decades by a Communist dictatorship. Until 2017, the U.S. granted Cubans who made it to American soil the chance to stay for a year and apply for a fast track to citizenship.\n\n“We are human, too,” she said. “We deserve to be treated like humans.”\n\nSome attendees expressed indignation and a sense of betrayal towards Biden.\n\n“Just remember that Haitian people voted for you,” Gabriel Jean Baptiste, a 34-year-old pastor from West Palm Beach said. “You were down here dancing with us, singing with us, showing us some love. Show us you’re a president.”\n\nChris Persaud is a data reporter for The Palm Beach Post.

It is also getting some new energy thanks in part to the spotlight provided by the HBO series Treme.\n\n\"All the things sacred to New Orleans bubbled up from that neighborhood, because Treme had such a mixture of people and cultures,\" said Toni Rice, a spokeswoman for one of the neighborhood groups organizing its bicentennial celebration. \"It wasn't just slaves. It wasn't all white or all black. It was German, Spanish, Haitian, Italian.\"\n\nBorn from the immigration that followed the Haitian revolution of the early 1800s and named for French milliner and property owner Claude Treme, the neighborhood became an entertainment center where white and black Creoles gathered.\n\nThe wave of Haitian refugees added to a New Orleans that was already a mix of French, Spanish and African-American culture, with American influence filtering in after the 1803 purchase of the territory from France. New Orleans was still largely confined to the French Quarter - the original city founded in 1718. Treme and other outlying neighborhoods were farms or swamps until efforts to drain the land took hold as the population grew.\n\nIt's the site of St. Augustine, one of the oldest African-American Catholic church parishes in the nation, where famed clarinetist Sidney Bechet was baptized in 1897 and where Homer Plessy was a parishioner. In 1892, Plessy triggered the infamous U.S. Supreme Court case, Plessy v. Ferguson, which upheld the constitutionality of state laws requiring racial segregation in public facilities under the doctrine of \"separate but equal.\"\n\nIt's also the site of Congo Square, where during the 18th and 19th centuries slaves were permitted to dance, trade goods and play music that would evolve into jazz. Generations of musicians hail from Treme, among them Troy \"Trombone Shorty\" Andrews and his grandfather, the late Ooh Poo Pah Doo singer Jesse Hill.\n\nIt was also home to the recently deceased Lionel Batiste - the vocalist, drummer and assistant leader of the Treme Brass Band who was known simply as \"Uncle Lionel.\" And it was the birthplace of jazz singer and trumpeter Lionel Ferbos, who at 101 is believed to be the oldest working musician in the city. He performs regularly at the Palm Court Jazz Cafe in the French Quarter.\n\nPercussionist Shannon Powell, 50, has lived in Treme his entire life. It's where at age 11 he performed Bourbon Street Parade at a now-closed jazz club near his house and where as a teenager he was discovered by singing banjo and guitar player Danny Barker, who helped launch Powell's career.\n\n\"I caught the tail end of a lot of good things, of old ways of doing things,\" Powell said. \"Jazz funerals meant a lot more than they do now. They were so respectful and dignified. The procession dressed in suits, wore black and white, and they played a slow dirge until the body was put in the ground. It's not like that anymore. Now you have kids out there in jeans playing all kinds of stuff.\"\n\nStill, after years of blight and crime problems, a slow revival is taking shape. Treme is now part of a multimillion dollar Department of Housing and Urban Development revitalization plan, which could include the removal of the interstate highway. Work is under way to turn an unused rail corridor into a miles-long walking and bike path called the Lafitte Greenway.\n\n\"This neighborhood is an example of survival,\" said Wayne Baquet, who operates Lil Dizzy's restaurant. \"The city lost a big part of the middle class due to white flight and then black flight to newer neighborhoods like New Orleans east and Gentilly.\n\n\"After Katrina, which practically destroyed those two areas, Treme is coming back. People have realized that the closer they are to the older parts of the city the less problems they're having in terms of infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nFloodwaters from levee failures during Hurricane Katrina, which struck in August 2005, inundated much of the city. But the French Quarter and nearby neighborhoods are built on higher ground and suffered less damage.\n\nTreme consists of roughly 150 square blocks. According to 2010 census figures, 4,155 people live there.\n\nRice said that as Louisiana celebrates its statehood bicentennial, it was fitting that New Orleans commemorates the establishment of Treme. Festivities begin on Tuesday and continue through Sunday. They include discussions of the neighborhood's history and performances by jazz trumpeter Kermit Ruffins, clarinetist Doreen Ketchens and the Treme Brass Band.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2016/12/20/azmemo-common-core-year-in-review-phoenix-weather/95635646/", "title": "AZ Memo: AZ revises Common Core; Rock HOF inductees; jaguar ...", "text": "The Republic | azcentral.com\n\nGood morning, Arizona.

You've heard Whitney Houston magnify it. And if you watch a baseball game this weekend or listen to a marching band in a Fourth of July parade, you're apt to hear it.\n\nBut how much do you really know about \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and its history?\n\nMark Clague, associate professor of musicology at the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance, is pretty sure you don't know as much as you might think.\n\nThat's why Clague — the founding board chairman of the Star Spangled Music Foundation and editor and producer of the \"Star Spangled Songbook\" and its associated recording project \"Poets & Patriots: A Tuneful History of 'The Star-Spangled Banner.'\" — has compiled a list of common misconceptions about the song.\n\nHere's eight of them. Click on the myth number for more detail.\n\nMyth No. 1: Francis Scott Key was held prisoner aboard a British ship during the bombardment of Baltimore when he penned what would become our nation's national anthem. Reality: Key was aboard his own American truce ship during the battle.\n\nMyth No. 2 : Key drafted \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" on the back of an envelope or letter. Reality: Most likely, Key wrote his draft on a clean sheet of paper using pen and ink.\n\nMyth No. 3 : Key wrote a \"poem\" later set to music by someone else. Reality: \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was always conceived of by Key as a song, and he wrote his \"lyric\" to fit a specific melody of his own choosing.\n\nMyth No. 4 : Key's \"Banner\" is based on the melody of a bawdy old English drinking song. Reality: \"The Anacreontic Song\" was the constitutional anthem of an elite, London-based, amateur music society.\n\nMyth No. 5 : \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as baseball's game day ritual begins with Babe Ruth and the 1918 World Series. Reality: The earliest documented performance in pro sports was on opening day at a baseball game in 1862.\n\nMyth No. 6 : A 1931 act of Congress made \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" the official anthem of the U.S. Reality: This is absolutely correct in terms of the anthem's legal status, but the bill approved by the House and Senate and signed by President Herbert Hoover simply recognized what had been true in American cultural practice for decades.\n\nMyth No. 7 : There is a sanctioned traditional or otherwise official version of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Reality: The 1931 act making Key's song America's anthem does not identify an official arrangement, in part because the song as sung in the 20th Century had already departed from what Key had known. During World War I, attempts were made to codify the arrangement, resulting in both a military \"service version\" and a \"standardized version\" endorsed by the Department of Education.\n\nMyth No. 8 : A mug shot offers proof of composer Igor Stravinsky's arrest by the Boston Police for desecrating a national symbol after conducting a performance of his own arrangement of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" with the Boston Symphony. Reality: The well-known image is not associated with an arrest at all, but it is true that Stravinsky's anthem was controversial. The supposed mug shot is actually part of Stravinsky's 1940 visa application for residence in the U.S.\n\nClague began studying the song as part of a class on musical history he taught at U-M. He was using the performance of the anthem by Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock to teach his students about the song's meaning and what the artist was trying to communicate. That led him to do more research on the anthem.\n\n\"This song really becomes a statement about what it means to be an American,\" he told the Free Press. \"All of us have some sort of relationship with that song. It has a resonance that cuts across demographics.\"\n\nIt was common in the 19th Century to rewrite lyrics to songs — there are more than 100 sets of lyrics around this song, including an 1844 abolitionist version written in Michigan.\n\nAs for the enduring popularity of Key's version? That came from the timing and his words.\n\n\"Key caught the right moment,\" Clague said. \"The War of 1812 was seen as a second American Revolution. National pride was weak. Victory over the British led to an infusion of patriotism. Key's lyrics are also somewhat abstract. There's no reference to Ft. McHenry or even to himself. He uses the word \"you\" to place you there.\n\n\"It used to be played much faster. It was a party song — a victory song. Now it's the sacred hymn of our country.\"\n\nContact David Jesse: 313-222-8851 or djesse@freepress.com.

It was written to match \"The Anacreontic Song,\" just like 580 other songs that didn't become the national anthem.\n\nAlso, says University of Michigan musicology professor Mark Clague, we tend to forget that the verse we sing ends in a question mark, not a period. It's not saluting us for our plucky resolve; rather, it's asking whether we have the nerve to endure.\n\nFurthermore, he contends, the anthem isn't terribly difficult musically: \"As long as you start low enough in your vocal range, you can pull it off.\"\n\nWe are universally correct, he says, in regarding Whitney Houston's rendition at the 1991 Super Bowl as a masterpiece — but we don't realize that without Jose Feliciano's soulful and misunderstood performance at Tiger Stadium during the 1968 World Series, other versions still might be more boring than soaring.\n\nAs for that problematic, rarely heard third verse, with its reference to the spilled blood of \"the hireling and slave,\" Clague suspects that \"slave\" doesn't mean what a logical person in 2022 would assume it does.\n\nLikewise, Key isn't necessarily what we think he was, even though he owned slaves. As an attorney, he prosecuted abolitionists, but “he also fought on behalf of Black Americans fighting for their freedom in court,\" Clague says. \"His legalwork resulted in the freedom of at least 189 people.”\n\nAnd, while Key would be flattered that we sing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" almost to the exclusion of every other patriotic tune, \"he'd also think it was crazy.\"\n\nClague outlines all of that and much, much more in a vibrantly readable new book, \"O Say Can You Hear? A Cultural Biography of 'The Star-Spangled Banner,'\" (W.W. Norton & Co., $28.95).\n\nTo his surprise and enormous delight, the book wound up on the cover of last week's New York Times Book Review, with an accompanying rave from Peter Sagal of NPR's \"Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me!\"\n\nSagal called it \"immensely interesting,\" a status Clague achieved largely by treating the anthem as a historical figure in its own right. Like Key, who jotted down his poem after watching British ships bombard Fort McHenry two years into the War of 1812, it's been a witness to history.\n\nFrancis Scott's key question\n\nClague, 55, grew up in Ann Arbor, meaning he’s “been a Wolverines fan basically since I was a toddler.”\n\nHe majored in bassoon performance and the history of art at U-M , and was good enough with his instrument to fill in with the Chicago Symphony while he was earning advanced degrees at the University of Chicago.\n\nHe and his wife, conductor Laura Jackson, have three college-student children who assisted in the writing process by telling him when they found a passage confusing or dull.\n\n“One of the things I bring to the book,” he says, “is a sensibility as a musician as well as a historian.”\n\nIn both roles, he appreciates how Feliciano begat Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock who begat Motown’s Marvin Gaye at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, turning the anthem’s 3/4 time into 4/4 and transforming a waltz to a march — or, “a waltz to a hymn.”\n\nThat option didn't exist when Key put quill to paper. Sheet music was not readily printable or available at nearby strip malls, so new songs frequently piggy-backed on established tunes.\n\nKey's goal was not to write a song to be performed centuries later: \"Nobody has ever written a successful anthem,\" Clague notes, \"that starts with, 'I'm going to write an anthem today.'\"\n\nRather, Key was calling on the citizens of a nation less than 40 years old \"to answer the question, 'Are we still free? Are we brave enough to live up to our ideals?'\"\n\nColin Kaepernick, he suggests, was asking the same thing when he knelt on NFL sidelines as the anthem echoed across stadiums.\n\n\"To me,\" Clague says, \"patriotism and protest are both part of the history of the anthem.\"\n\nOften, they're the same thing.\n\n'True to ritual'\n\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" began its transition from song to national anthem during the Civil War, Clague says.\n\nThe volume was turned up again during World War I, as anthems and flags helped sort out which countries were on the side of right and goodness and which were in the other trench.\n\nBy the time Congress codified “The Star-Spangled Banner” in 1931, “it was just recognizing what was already true in ritual.”\n\nClague began teaching the anthem in musicology classes in 2004 and started research for the book six years later.\n\nIt wasn't until the Kaepernick firestorm, he concedes, that he started digging into the third verse, and he was stunned to learn that \"no one had really looked at the word 'slave' in any depth. It's remarkable. I mean, the song has been around for 208 years.\"\n\nHis conclusion is not flattering to Key or his target audience.\n\n“Hirelings and slaves,” he believes, refers to the British attackers, who were salaried soldiers while the Americans were volunteers. Doing the bidding of the king made them slaves.\n\n“It takes an incredible myopia to not see this as people who were actually held captive as laborers,” he says, but obtuseness was a benefit of being a white American male in 1814.\n\nAs he acknowledges, other historians hold that Key was referencing the Colonial Marines, liberated Blacks who volunteered with the British.\n\nEither way, it's a verse that does not endear itself to millions of Americans. So as a trained academician with more than a decade of study to fall back on, Clague has a suggestion:\n\nWhack it.\n\nWe only sing the first verse anyway, and the same sort of legislative act that made the song the national anthem could shorten it from four verses to three.\n\nNo muss, no fuss, and one thing we all know to be true is that the author isn't around to complain.\n\nNeal Rubin still sings along to \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at ballgames, but he lets the sopranos in the crowd handle the high notes.

This was also the philosophy of a young lawyer and amateur poet, Francis Scott Key, in 1813, when he wrote the “Star Spangled Banner”.\n\nKey was on an errand of mercy to release a prominent local physician, (a Dr. Beane), who had been taken prisoner by the British, at Fort McHenry. The officers had decided to let him go, but not until the current battle was over.\n\nHelplessly, Key watched, from a distance, all throughout the night, as that bloody battle in the War of 1812 ensued. His heart was heavy, as there was little hope that these brave, but few, tired fighters for freedom could withstand the strong, well equipped British warhead.\n\nIn the “dawn’s early light” of Sept. 14, Key noticed that the British had stopped firing. He knew that Major Armistad had specifically asked for a huge flag to be flown, “so large, that the British would have no difficulty seeing it from a distance,” if the victory was ours. Key strained to see through the smoke, if the flag was still there.\n\nHe later described his feelings of exquisite gratitude, as he looked across the bay, through the clouds of war. He said, “In that hour of deliverance, and joyful triumph, my heart ‘spoke.’ Such defenders and a country deserve a song.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHe scribbled the first words of this song, (it was never meant to be just a poem) on a piece of paper, and finished it later, back on shore.\n\nHe showed it to a relative by marriage, Judge Nicholson, who was most impressed with it, and took it to a newspaper, “Baltimore America.” They began to distribute it around Baltimore, making poster-sized copies of it. Each man serving at Fort McHenry gratefully received a copy. Everyone who got it was excited to share it with others.\n\nThe immortal words were put to the music of John Stafford Smith’s “To Anacreas in Heaven,” and thus we have our national anthem.\n\nFrancis Scott Key remained most humble about this great gift.

Yada yada yada.\n\nBut did you know where the tune comes from?\n\nIt is from a song of – shall we say – questionable character. Some would call it a drinking song. Some would call it worse.\n\n\"The Anacreontic Song\", also called \"To Anacreon in Heaven\", was the anthem of an 18th-century British gentlemen's club. Composed by John Stafford Smith, its original lyrics ran: \"To Anacreon in Heav'n, where he sat in full Glee / A few Sons of Harmony sent a Petition.\" (Try singing it to the tune of the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\")\n\nAnacreon was a Greek poet. He was known, especially, for drinking songs and erotic poetry. The song is a plea for inspiration in both departments. \"That he their Inspirer and Patron would be.\"\n\nFrom heaven – in the midst of who knows what debauch – Anacreon sends a reply: \"I'll instruct you, like me, to intwine, The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine.\"\n\nBacchus, as in drink. Venus, as in sex.

Look at that ridiculous American!\n\nYankee Doodle then makes himself even more embarrassing by sticking a feather in his cap and calling it \"Macaroni.\" A \"Macaroni,\" in those days, was a dandy, a fop – in line with contemporary prejudice that Italians were effeminate.\n\nBut Yankee Doodle isn't even a fop. He's a wannabe fop. \"Stuck a feather in his cap and called it Macaroni\" is the equivalent of \"Dyed my hair green and called myself Lady Gaga.\"\n\nJuly 4th at the White House is an annual tradition.

Delta has good news for you: No fare difference when rebooking travel\n\n'You're a Grand Old Flag'\n\nThis song might have gotten you into a fight – if you sang it with the original lyrics.\n\n\"You're a Grand Old Flag\" was first published and performed in 1906 as \"You're a Grand Old Rag.\"\n\nIt wasn't meant as an insult. George M. Cohan, the musical comedy writer famous for this, \"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy,\" \"Over There,\" and other patriotic tunes, had no beef with the flag. Neither did the old Civil War veteran he had encountered carrying a tattered but much-loved flag – possibly from Gettysburg, where he'd fought. \"She's a grand old rag,\" the man had remarked wistfully.\n\nCohan was taken with the phrase. So much so that he wrote a song about it. And so much so that even when people started complaining (\"You can't call the Stars and Stripes that!\"), he was loath to change the lyric.\n\nHe tried \"You're a grand old flag / Though you're torn to a rag.\" No sale. Finally, reluctantly, he changed it to, \"You're a grand old flag, you're a high-flying flag.\"\n\nWhich is a non-rhyme – but at least it didn't offend the music-buying public. \"You're a Grand Old Flag,\" in sheet-music form, became the first million-selling musical comedy song.\n\nIn other news: Will you have to have to eat your July Fourth hot dog or hamburger without mustard?\n\n'My Country 'Tis of Thee'\n\nYou will have noticed that the tune of this familiar song – a de facto national anthem for many years, until \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" became our official one in 1931 – is the same as \"God Save the Queen.\"\n\nWhat you may not know is that the same tune is used in dozens of countries.\n\nIt's the national anthem of Liechtenstein: \"Oben am jungen Rhein.\" It's the royal anthem of Norway: \"Kongesangen.\" The Swiss call it \"Rufst du, mein Vaterland\" (it's their former national anthem). Germany and Russia have their own versions.\n\n“All the brass instruments and big drums in the world cannot turn 'God Save the King' into a good tune,\" remarked George Orwell in 1943. Clearly the minority opinion.\n\nBut did you know that, even in America, there were two versions of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\"?\n\nThere's the one you grew up with. And there was an abolitionist version, popular in the 1840s, which you probably did not sing in grade school: \"My native country, thee / Where all men are born free, if white's their skin…\"\n\nBlack Lives Matter was a thing then, too.\n\nHoliday pet care: How to keep your dog calm during fireworks this 4th of July\n\n'The Stars and Stripes Forever'\n\nIf you were at a circus or the theater, and the house band started playing this beloved 1896 march by John Philip Sousa, you knew you were in trouble.\n\nThat march, back in the day, had a very specific meaning. It meant: Get out!\n\n\"The Disaster March,\" as it was known in the trade, was never to be played except in the case of the most extreme emergency. The march was code. The point was to signal the staff, without letting the public know.\n\nThis was the music people heard at the infamous fire at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus on July 6, 1944, in Hartford, Connecticut, according to historian Michael Skidgell (\"The Hartford Circus Fire: Tragedy Under the Big Top,\" 2014). For some, it was the last music they heard. At least 168 were killed that day, and the incident led to Ringling Bros. abandoning the canvas \"big top\" in favor of arenas.\n\nBut it didn't lessen the popularity of \"The Stars and Stripes Forever.\" In 1987, \"The Disaster March\" became the national march of the U.S.\n\n'God Bless America'\n\nThis is the song many people wish was our national anthem – if only because Irving Berlin's tune is easier to sing than \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\nBut people have loved \"God Bless America\" ever since Kate Smith introduced it on her Armistice Day broadcast in 1938. Coming on the eve of World War II (it was actually a rewritten version of a song Berlin had penned in 1918, for the previous war, but never published), the song seemed like a national prayer for deliverance in a dark moment. Since then, \"God Bless America\" has been popular in good times and bad. Presidents since Ronald Reagan have invariably ended their speeches with, \"God Bless America.\"\n\nWhere did Irving Berlin get the inspiration for this passionate, transcendent hymn to all things American?\n\nApparently, from a 1906 novelty song called \"When Mose with his Nose Leads the Band.\"\n\nAt least, the first six notes of the chorus are the same as \"God Bless America,\" as music historian Jody Rosen has pointed out.\n\nSuch humorous \"ethnic\" ditties were all the rage in the early 1900s, when Berlin began his career. \"It Takes the Irish to Beat the Dutch,\" \"Come Down to Your Italian Romeo,\" \"Abraham Jefferson Washington Lee\" were some of the more mentionable ones.\n\nBerlin, though Jewish himself, was not above writing \"Yiddle on Your Fiddle Play Some Ragtime.\" So Mose and his nose were probably not unknown to him.\n\nFrom such questionable beginnings came a patriotic treasure. Only in America.\n\nWhat does the Juneteenth flag look like?: Can it be celebrated with July 4th? It's complicated\n\n'This Land Is Your Land'\n\n\"Answer records\" are an old story in pop music. Chuck Berry wrote \"Back in the U.S.A.,\" The Beatles responded with \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" Tenafly's Lesley Gore answered her own hit, \"It's My Party and I'll Cry if I Want to\" with \"It's Judy's Turn to Cry.\" In 1984, the hip-hop hit \"Roxanne, Roxanne\" was followed by \"Roxanne's Revenge,\" \"Do the Roxanne,\" \"The Parents of Roxanne,\" \"Roxanne's a Man\" and at long last \"The Final Word – No More Roxanne (Please).\"\n\nThis is the great tradition that folk singer Woody Guthrie was tapping into when he responded in 1945 to \"God Bless America\" with \"This Land Is Your Land\" – originally titled \"God Blessed America for Me.\"\n\nHe had become tired, he tells us, of hearing \"God Bless America\" everywhere – he felt it was jingoistic. The original lyrics contained verses (often omitted now) critical of capitalism and private property: \"There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me / Sign was painted, it said private property / But on the back side it didn't say nothing / This land was made for you and me.\"\n\nThe chorus was meant to be confrontational. This land is made for you and me – not them (millionaires and big business).\n\nIronically this song, with its left-wing lyrics, is now widely viewed as a patriotic anthem equal to \"God Bless America\" – most people, if pressed, could not detect any difference in sentiment. Both were added to the Library of Congress National Recording Registry in the same year: 2002.\n\nTraveling for July Fourth?: Here are 5 things to know before flying, driving this weekend.\n\nJuly Fourth gas prices: How much will gas cost?

Can't you just wag your tails?\n\n'Only in America'\n\nGet Me Rewrite – Part 2. \"Only in America\" was a No. 25 Billboard hit for Jay and the Americans in 1963. And its sunny optimism struck a chord with lots of people. Cuban immigrants, fleeing Castro, made it a kind of anthem: \"Only in America / Can a guy from anywhere go to sleep a pauper and wake up a millionaire.\"\n\nBut those weren't the original lyrics.\n\nSongwriters Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil originally intended the song for The Drifters, the Black R&B group that had hits with songs like \"Up on the Roof\" and \"On Broadway.\" And the original lyrics were quite different: \"Only in America / Land of opportunity / Can they save a seat in the back of the bus just for me.\"\n\nNo can do, said Atlantic Records – which refused to release a song with such incendiary lyrics.\n\nThe Drifters refused to release the rewritten version. So the original instrumental track was used to back up the white group Jay and The Americans, who could sing the cheerful new words with some conviction.\n\nAs hopefully we will all do this July 4, as \"America the Beautiful,\" \"This Land Is Your Land\" and \"Yankee Doodle\" bring us together in song.\n\nAssuming we can be brought together, these days, by anything.\n\n\"The Fourth of July gives us an opportunity to put aside our disagreements and come together for love of country,\" Gillespie says. \"That's when we see that coming together, rallying together.\"\n\nJuly Fourth weekend travel: Here are the best and worst times to leave for your road trip", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/09/26/how-national-anthem-become-essential-part-sports/706243001/", "title": "How national anthem became essential part of sports", "text": "For decades, Americans have stood for the national anthem and then sat down for a ballgame. From big-city stadiums to small-town high school fields, those broad stripes and bright stars are the expected musical preamble to our ballgames.\n\nToday the anthem is at the center of an angry national debate. Some believe the melody means respect for the fallen among our military and police. Others believe it means the entirety of the American experience. The answer often depends on the ear of the beholder.\n\nColin Kaepernick, then of the San Francisco 49ers, began a protest movement in the NFL last year that used the anthem as a moment of maximum impact to call attention to social injustice. Last week, with characteristic bombast, President Trump called for firing players — he called them SOBs — who protest during the anthem.\n\nHow did the dawn’s early light and twilight’s last gleaming become so politicized?\n\n“National anthems are political,” Marc Ferris tells USA TODAY Sports. He is the author of Star-Spangled Banner: The Unlikely Story of America’s National Anthem. And he knows the history of how our anthem, born of war, became intertwined with our sporting life.\n\n“Sports are a kind of bloodless warfare,” Ferris says, “a sort of war without death.”\n\nThe song is about a battle in the War of 1812. The first documented time that it was played at an American sporting event came at a baseball game in 1862, during the Civil War. The tradition of playing it at sports events got a dramatic boost at the 1918 World Series, during World War I. And the tradition of playing it before games was popularized during World War II.\n\n“We’re a patriotic country and we’re different from the rest of the world in that respect,” Ferris says. “As we grew and as we prospered, people wanted to show their patriotism.”\n\nFrancis Scott Key wrote the song in 1814 and it became the nation’s de facto anthem not long after. Congress made it official in 1931. World War I vets had been lobbying for it for years.\n\nFerris says that in one respect Yankee Doodle Dandy should be the national anthem because it dates to the nation’s roots in the Revolutionary War. “But the Star-Spangled Banner is a better piece of music,” he says. “It’s got gravitas. It’s got history. It’s got emotional resonance.”\n\nAnd bombs bursting in air. North and South wrestled over which side could claim the song during the Civil War.\n\n“The North won the tug of war,” Ferris says. “The irony is that the South’s anthem, Dixie, was written by an anti-slavery Northerner whereas the Star-Spangled Banner, the anthem of the North, was written by a slave-holding Southerner whose family supported the Confederacy” long after Key died in 1843.\n\nKey's song was played at some baseball games in the 1890s, often with great pomp, Ferris says, but the World Series in 1918 offered a star-spangled moment. Babe Ruth’s Boston Red Sox opened in Chicago against the Cubs. The game came 17 months — and 100,000 American deaths — after the U.S. entered the war to end all wars. During the seventh-inning stretch, a military band spontaneously played the country’s still-unofficial anthem.\n\nRed Sox third baseman Fred Thomas, on furlough from the Navy, saluted. Other players put hands over hearts. The crowd, already on their feet to stretch, began to sing along. The New York Times reported the song’s final bars were met by “thunderous applause and rent the air with a cheer that marked the highest point of the day’s enthusiasm.”\n\nWhen the Series moved to Boston, the Red Sox played the song during pregame festivities and paired it with the introduction of wounded soldiers. Ferris credits the theatrical move to Red Sox owner Harry Frazee. “He thought, ‘I’m an impresario, I’ll show those Midwesterners in Chicago how it’s done,’ ” Ferris says.\n\nThe song did not yet catch on at all games for the simple reason that owners didn’t hire bands except for big events like the World Series or Opening Day. Sound systems, in place by World War II, changed that.\n\n“The anthem was heard everywhere” during the second world war, Ferris says. “Before the opera, before the movies, before the theater.”\n\nAnd, of course, before all manner of sports. Most teams continued to play the anthem in the surge of postwar patriotism. Ferris says the Cubs stopped playing it after the war but picked it up again in 1967, during the Vietnam war, and have played it since.\n\nAmid the upheaval of Vietnam, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle enforced a policy that players stand at attention during the anthem, with helmets tucked under their arms. They were not to talk, chew gum or move their feet.\n\nThe government cannot restrict speech under the First Amendment. Employers can.

Housed in a chamber that keeps oxygen and lighting very low and temperature and humidity constant, it should last for generations more.\n\nAnd lest we be too harsh on our forebears, Jones credits the revolutionary-era tradition of souvenir-keeping for maintaining the flag's value, which \"probably led to its ability to survive 200 years.\"\n\nWith Maryland celebrating its Defenders' Day on Friday and America's victory over the British 200 years ago Sunday, at least two families recently inquired whether their fragments might have historical value.\n\nMuseum conservators are using microscopes, x-rays and other equipment to analyze their weaves, stains and soils to see if they match. Family histories and documents also help prove provenance.\n\nSince the flag came to the Smithsonian in 1907, about 17 pieces have been donated or bought at auction. The museum last acquired pieces in 2003 but has no plans to try to recover them all or reattach them to the original flag.\n\nIt's difficult to determine exactly where each piece came from, and the Smithsonian wants to lend pieces to other museums.\n\nBut some are more valuable than others. The 15th cotton star was cut away sometime before 1873, and remains missing.\n\n\"We'd love to have that back,\" said the flag's chief conservator Suzanne Thomassen-Krauss. \"That one I might put back on.\"\n\nKey's poem propagated a misunderstanding that persists today, by suggesting that the garrison flag had withstood British cannon fire. In fact, soldiers hoisted the huge American flag at dawn as the British fleet retreated, replacing a smaller storm flag that had flown during the bombardment. The garrison flag flew at the fort for another year or so, until it was acquired by Fort McHenry's commander, Lt. Col. George Armistead.\n\nThe first documented clipping was taken in 1818 at the request of a widow, to be buried with her husband who fought at the battle.\n\nThe Star-Spangled Banner was passed down through Armistead's family and protected through the Civil War. In 1873, his daughter Georgiana Armistead Appleton lent it to historian George Preble for a lecture series across New England.\n\nHistorians believe Preble made many clippings for friends, patriotic citizens and his own family.\n\nSome pieces turned up in Minnesota, where another Armistead daughter settled. Another piece was placed in a keystone for the Francis Scott Key Memorial in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Historical societies have donated fragments to the Smithsonian, and the U.S. Naval Academy sent a thumb-size piece in a gold frame.\n\n\"We suspect there are more fragments that have just lost their history,\" Thomassen-Krauss said. \"People see them, but they don't know what they are.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/12"}]}

A look at White House history", "text": "Stewart D. McLaurin\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThis Fourth of July week will feature the picnics, parades and fireworks that Americans love. But with just two years left until the 250th anniversary of our independence, it’s important to look at how our nation’s birthday has evolved and how the White House’s role on this holiday has contributed to our national identity.\n\nWe should begin by remembering how audacious it was for revolutionaries to break away from their mother country – and to pledge “our lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor” to one another.\n\n“That was more than rhetoric,” President Ronald Reagan reminded Americans on July 4, 1986, with the Statue of Liberty in the background. “Each of those men knew the penalty for high treason to the crown.”\n\nIf our second president, John Adams, had his way, we’d celebrate on July 2 – the day in 1776 that the Continental Congress in Philadelphia officially declared freedom from Great Britain. But the Declaration of Independence wasn’t signed for two more days, and it was Adams’ successor, Thomas Jefferson, who began the tradition of observing the Fourth of July at the White House in 1801.\n\nThe early Fourth of July celebrations at the White House\n\nOn that day, President Jefferson opened the White House to diplomats, civil and military officers, citizens and Cherokee chiefs in what was known as the Oval Saloon (today’s Blue Room). The Marine Band played in the Entrance Hall, and a festival on the north grounds featured horse races and parades, along with cakes, wine and punch for the revelers.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe celebration on July 4, 1803, featured a history-making reveal, when Jefferson stood on the front steps to announce news of the Louisiana Purchase, which had just reached the White House.\n\nAs annual receptions and other commemorations became customary, the national symbolism of Independence Day grew stronger in 1826, when Adams and Jefferson both died on July 4 – exactly 50 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nFive years later, James Monroe, the last Founding Father to become president, also died on July 4.\n\nTest your knowledge about Camp David: Pop quiz: Where do presidents vacation and hold historic events?\n\nFireworks were sometimes part of these early July Fourth celebrations, including a tragedy in 1845, when they discharged into a crowd assembled along the south wall of the White House, killing a local carpenter.\n\nOn July 4, 1848, President James Polk witnessed the laying of the cornerstone of the Washington Monument. (Future President Abraham Lincoln was also in attendance.)\n\nLincoln's last Fourth of July was historic\n\nSome of the most important and resonant days of the Civil War came on July 4, with the president and the White House at the center.\n\nOn Lincoln’s first July 4 as president, just a few months after the war began in 1861, he reviewed New York militia regiments marching on the White House lawn, raised an American flag at the Treasury Department, and addressed Congress to call for more troops and war funding.\n\nAfter the Union won a decisive victory at Gettysburg on the day before July 4, 1863, Lincoln harkened back to America’s Independence Day, citing its writing “four score and seven years ago” when he visited the battlefield that November to deliver his iconic Gettysburg Address.\n\nThe following July 4 – the last of Lincoln’s life – the president opened the White House South Grounds to picnickers from Black schools, churches and religious groups, moving the nation one symbolic step closer to fulfilling the promises made on the first Fourth of July.\n\nBecoming a federal holiday\n\nIt wasn’t until 1870 that Independence Day was made an official federal holiday. On our nation’s 100th birthday in 1876, President Ulysses Grant and first lady Julia Grant greeted guests and opened a centennial exposition in Philadelphia by starting up a newfangled Corliss steam engine that powered most of the exhibits.\n\nPresidents sometimes used Independence Day to get away from the office and the heat. President Andrew Jackson went home to the Hermitage, Presidents Polk and Grant vacationed in New Jersey, while Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft escaped to “summer White House” locations farther north. President Woodrow Wilson returned to Gettysburg on the battle’s 50th anniversary.\n\nCalvin Coolidge – the only U.S. president born on July 4 – traveled to Philadelphia to celebrate the 150th anniversary of our founding.\n\n“Amid all the clash of conflicting interests, amid all the welter of partisan politics,” he said, “every American can turn for solace and consolation to the Declaration of Independence.”\n\nAmerica celebrates 200 years of independence with Queen Elizabeth\n\nPresident Harry Truman marked the 175th with an address at the Washington Monument, saying, “The ideas on which our government is founded ‒ the ideas of equality, of God-given rights, of self-government ‒ are still revolutionary.”\n\nBy 1976, the celebration of the 200th anniversary of American independence became more elaborate. President Gerald Ford spent the day shuttling to Valley Forge, to Philadelphia’s Independence Hall and to the New York Harbor to ring a bicentennial bell on the flight deck of the USS Forrestal – ending the night at the White House, watching fireworks over the National Mall with first lady Betty Ford from the Truman Balcony.\n\nThe Fords also invited a special guest ‒ Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, who appeared on the Truman Balcony three days later with President Ford to greet 7,000 guests on the White House lawn. A state dinner was held in her honor (in a tent in the Rose Garden), broadcast live on public television, and featured a Julia Child interview with White House Executive Chef Henry Haller as he made Maryland vegetables and Georgia peach custard.\n\nWhere past and present coexist: White House furniture is America's living history\n\nJuly 4 'unleashed not merely a revolution against the British'\n\nDuring recent Independence Days, the White House South Lawn has been opened to staff, military families and special guests for barbecue, ice cream and a seat on the grass to watch the fireworks burst over the National Mall.\n\nAs we approach our nation’s 250th birthday, we’ll have many opportunities to look beyond the bands and fireworks to consider that day in Philadelphia that changed world history.\n\nAs President John Kennedy said on Independence Day 1962, the Declaration of Independence \"unleashed not merely a revolution against the British, but a revolution in human affairs.”\n\nJuly 4 is not just a day to celebrate our ideals and the people who envisioned them. It’s also a time to honor the generations who came after our Founders, to fulfill these promises and renew our nation. That’s why a number of presidents have marked the holiday by attending naturalization ceremonies where new citizens take their oath of allegiance to the United States.\n\n“From this day forward,” President George W. Bush told new Americans in 2008, “the history of the United States will be part of your heritage. The Fourth of July will be part of your Independence Day.”\n\nHere’s hoping that your July 4 weekend includes rest, relaxation and reflection – on our nation’s history, its promise and the part we can all play in carrying forward the American experiment.\n\nStewart D.

At dusk, 91-year-old John Adams spoke his last words, “Jefferson survives.”\n\nHe did not know that on that morning, his onetime ally, enemy and friend, Thomas Jefferson, had passed. The fact that two presidents died on the same day pops up on quiz shows occasionally. What is even more astounding is that it was on the day celebrating the document that those two did more than anyone to create.\n\nWhen the gathering of colonial elite known as the “Continental Congress” decided to go for broke and declare independence, one delegate told Jefferson, “When they hang us, I’ll go quickly, because I am very fat. You will dangle for a while.”\n\nHe was only half-joking. Benjamin Franklin, possibly the most respected man in the world, chaired the committee responsible for writing the declaration; he left it to the committee’s younger members, Adams and Jefferson, saying that he did not want his work edited by others. Adams told Jefferson that he must be the author, for three reasons: 1. Having a Virginian author would bring the most populous colony and the rest of the South into the struggle; 2. Jefferson was much better liked than the obnoxious Adams; and 3. Jefferson was a far better writer.\n\nAt a time when equality was not even a pipe dream for slaves, free blacks, Indians, women, religious minorities and non-property owners, Jefferson wrote what historians see as a promise: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among them, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIt is a promise that still inspires us. The black historian John Hope Franklin said, “I thought that they were beautiful words. They reinforced what my parents told me, that no one was better than I was.”\n\nWhen Congress adapted the declaration, Adams presciently wrote his wife Abigail: “It ought to be celebrated by pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other... .”\n\nOn July 4, 1863, the United States was at war with itself. President Abraham Lincoln, however, had reason to celebrate: The Union had not only prevailed at Gettysburg the previous day, but Vicksburg had surrendered that day to General Ulysses S. Grant, giving control of the Mississippi to the Union.\n\nOn Nov. 19, Lincoln dedicated the Gettysburg Battlefield by reminding the country that the founding fathers had created a nation “dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal” and called for them to continue the cause for which the dead on this ground had given “their last full measure of devotion” so that “government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth.”\n\nOne hundred years later, on Memorial Day 1963, Vice President Lyndon Johnson told an audience at Gettysburg: “Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men’s skins, emancipation will be a proclamation, but not a fact.” A year later, President Johnson pushed through Congress the first of three civil rights acts, fulfilling, more than anyone, Jefferson’s promise.\n\nIn 1946, the U.S. relinquished sovereignty of the Philippines. The Filipinos celebrate their independence on June 12, the day in 1898 when they declared independence from Spain, but they celebrate July 4 as Filipino-American Friendship Day.\n\nOthers have been inspired as well: When Ho Chi Minh, a former resident and admirer of the United States, wrote Vietnam’s declaration of independence from France in 1946, he quoted Jefferson’s words. Ironically, he would face a long struggle against both France and the U.S.\n\n“Born on the Fourth of July” is a line from a song by George M. Cohan, as well as the name of a movie by Oliver Stone. Louis Armstrong claimed to be born on the Fourth of July, 1900; he wasn’t, but he might as well have been. Willie Nelson’s Fourth of July picnic in Texas is an annual event.\n\nJefferson’s promise has inspired many over the years. In view of recent events, it is now time, more than ever, for our national leaders to rededicate themselves to his promise.\n\nRobert Evins Pickard, MA, MPA, is an adjunct professor of U.S. and world history at Nashville State Community College.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/12/29/jimmy-carter-death-presidents-ages-compared/70645902007/", "title": "President Jimmy Carter broke age record.

Seemingly the most important milestone to him arrived in 2020, when he celebrated his 75th wedding anniversary with Rosalynn Carter, making the Carters the longest-married presidential couple in history. Rosalynn Carter died in November 2023 at the age of 96.\n\nJimmy Carter dies: How many former US presidents are still alive today?\n\n\"The best thing I ever did was marry Rosalynn,\" Carter said in a C-SPAN interview at The Carter Center in 2015. \"That's the pinnacle of my life.\"\n\nUnable to view our graphics?

Since 2004, every former U.S. president has lived into his 90s, while the average man's life expectancy has been in the mid-70s.\n\nThe byproduct: A lot of living former presidents.\n\nAs early as 1861, there were five living ex-presidents, but that was the exception, rather than what Americans have come to expect in the past couple of decades.\n\nEras with at least five living former presidents\n\nFor four brief periods since 1993, Carter has been among an evolving group of five former presidents.\n\nAnd when they appeared together at historic junctures, their images offered momentary respites from the growing partisanship in Washington.\n\nAssuming partisan discord doesn't make these images a thing of the past, presidential photographers might need wider lenses on their cameras before long.\n\nThree former presidents were born 66 days apart and turned 78 this year. Barack Obama turned 63 in August.\n\nBeyond those living past presidents, it's interesting to note that President Joe Biden, the oldest U.S. president at 82, has already outlived all but nine past presidents.\n\nOf the four other living former presidents, Bill Clinton, Obama and George W.

The 10th president fathered 15 children, more than any other. From 1815 to 1860 he welcomed eight sons and seven daughters before his death in 1862.\n\nAbraham Lincoln may have had Marfan Syndrome\n\nSixteenth president Abraham Lincoln was considered to be the tallest president. His 6'4 height could be explained by him possibly having Marfan Syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue from the fibers that support organs to other body structures.\n\nAndrew Johnson befriended mice at the White House\n\nThe rumors that Andrew Johnson did not officially have any pets isn't entirely true. The 17th president apparently befriended a family of white mice during his impeachment.\n\nJohnson was also the first president to ever be impeached when the House of Representatives voted to do so after he removed Secretary of War Edwin Stanton from the cabinet, breaching the Tenure of Office Act. The Senate acquitted in a 35-19 vote - just one vote short of the two-thirds required to convict him.\n\nBenjamin Harrison was afraid of touching light switches\n\nPresident Benjamin Harrison was the first president to live in an electrified White House. The 23rd president and his wife Caroline Harrison both refused to touch light switches out of fear of an electric shock as electricity was very new in the U.S. at the time.\n\nWhite House staff took on the extra task of turning on and off light switches to avoid taking any chances of electrocution.\n\nWilliam McKinley was on discontinued $500 bill\n\nWilliam McKinley, the 25th president, had his face and likeness featured on the $500 bill.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury discontinued the bill in 1969. The bill is now worth more than just $500, with some collectors willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars under the right conditions.\n\nRacoons lived at the White House during Calvin Coolidge's term\n\nIt was quite common to find raccoons around the White House when Calvin Coolidge lived there. The 30th president grew up surrounded by wildlife when he lived on a secluded farm in Plymouth Notch, Vermont and he took his affinity for raccoons when he moved to the Oval Office.\n\nIn November 1926, a \"cohort of well-intentioned admirers\" shipped him a live racoon to roast for Thanksgiving dinner. The Coolidge family refused to eat their friend and a few weeks later the racoon appeared for Christmas in a red ribbon along with the title \"Rebecca Raccoon of the White House.\"\n\nAccording to a book on Calvin Coolidge, Rebecca even had a presidential diet during his tenure where she ate chicken, eggs, persimmons, green shrimp and cream. She even made public appearances at summer parties and Easter egg rolls.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt was a movie buff\n\nBecoming president doesn't mean the end of having hobbies. In addition to being the only president to ever serve more than two terms, Franklin D. Roosevelt was known for his love of cinema. The 32nd president found movies to be an escape from the responsibilities of being president during the Great Depression and World War II.\n\n\"He especially liked comedies, particularly the work of the 1930s and 1940s comedy team Abbott and Costello. He even invited them to perform at the White House several times while he was President,\" the FRD Library and Museum website reads.\n\nGerald Ford used to be a model before president\n\nThere's no denying that appearances often matter for voters in presidential elections. It might have helped that Gerald Ford, the 38th president, had some modeling experience before his term.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale in 1941, Ford earned extra cash as a model.

In November 2023, the Nobel Peace Prize-winner's wife of 77 years, Rosalynn, also passed away in the modest house they built together in 1961, when he had taken over his father's peanut warehouse business and was only beginning to consider a political career.\n\nIn February 2023, he had announced he was ending medical intervention and moving to hospice care.\n\nJason Carter had visited his grandparents at the time of the announcement and said \"They are at peace and – as always – their home is full of love,\" he posted on Twitter.\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2024\n\nJimmy Carter dies at 100: Trump, Biden, Obama all honor the 39th president's legacy\n\nAt peace, perhaps, but still political: The former president vowed he wanted to cast a ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAfter serving a single term in the White House, Jimmy Carter became one of the most durable figures in modern American politics. Evicted from the White House at age 56, he would hold the status of former president longer than anyone in U.S. history, and in 2019 he surpassed George H. W. Bush as the nation's oldest living ex-president.\n\nCarter remained remarkably active in charitable causes through a series of health challenges during his final years, including a bout with brain cancer in 2015. He was admitted to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta in November 2019 for a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain, a consequence of bleeding that followed a series of falls. A few months earlier, in May, he had undergone surgery after breaking his hip.\n\nIn the White House from 1977 to 1981, Carter negotiated the landmark Camp David peace accords between Israel and Egypt, transferred the Panama Canal to Panamanian ownership, dramatically expanded public lands in Alaska and established formal diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China.\n\nBut the 39th president governed at a time of soaring inflation and gasoline shortages, and his failure to secure the release of Americans held hostage by Iran helped cost him the second term he sought.\n\n“He’s never going to be ranked as a great president; he’s middling as a president,” said historian Douglas Brinkley, author of a 1998 book on Carter, \"The Unfinished Presidency.\" “But as an American figure, he’s a giant.”\n\nAfter losing his reelection bid to Ronald Reagan, and until well into his 90s, Carter continued working as an observer of elections in developing countries, building houses through the nonprofit Habitat for Humanity and teaching Sunday school at the tiny Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia, his hometown.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, 22 years after he left the White House.\n\n\"I can't deny that I was a better ex-president than I was a president,\" he said with a wry laugh at a breakfast with reporters in Washington in 2005.\n\n\"My former boss was humiliated when he lost in 1980; he felt he let himself and the American people down,\" David Rubenstein, a young White House staffer for Carter who became founder of the Carlyle Group and a billionaire philanthropist, told USA TODAY in an interview in 2019.\n\n\"For a long time, he was basically the symbol of a weak president and a terrible person. And today, 40-some years later, he's seen as a very incredible person who has had many good things he did, though he didn't get reelected,\" Rubenstein said.\n\nPeanut farms and nuclear subs\n\nJames Earl Carter Jr. was born on Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains to Earl Carter, a peanut warehouser who had served in the Georgia Legislature, and “Miss Lillian” Carter, a registered nurse and formidable figure who joined the Peace Corps when she was in her 60s.\n\nHe grew up on a peanut farm in Plains, then graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. In the years after World War II, he served in the Navy's submarine service in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets. After doing graduate work in nuclear physics, he became a pioneer in the introduction of nuclear power in submarines.\n\nWhen his father died in 1953, Carter resigned his naval commission and took over operation of the family peanut farms with Rosalynn, his hometown sweetheart. After a rough early patch, the business flourished, and Carter became increasingly active in community affairs and politics.\n\nDuring two terms in the Georgia state Senate, he gained a reputation as an independent voice who attacked wasteful government practices and helped repeal laws designed to discourage Black Americans from voting.\n\nBut in 1966, he lost a race for governor to segregationist Lester Maddox in an election that analysts said reflected a Southern backlash against national civil rights legislation enacted in 1964 and 1965. In a second bid for governor in 1970, Carter minimized his appearances before Black audiences and won endorsements from some segregationists.\n\nAfter he was elected, though, Carter declared that the era of segregation in Georgia was over, and he was hailed as a symbol of a new, more inclusive South.\n\nStill, he was an unlikely presidential contender. When he launched his bid for the 1976 Democratic nomination, the former one-term governor was so obscure outside the Peach State that “Jimmy who?” became a campaign trope. He perfected the meticulous cultivation of voters in Iowa, and his unexpected victory in the opening presidential caucuses there provided a launching pad that long-shot contenders tried to emulate for decades.\n\nThe Watergate scandal boosted Carter's prospects. In the aftermath of President Richard Nixon’s decision to resign in 1974 rather than be impeached, Carter pitched himself to voters as an outsider who would reject Washington’s unsavory ways. “I’ll never lie to you,” he told them.\n\nIn 1976, he narrowly defeated President Gerald Ford, whose campaign was damaged by verbal missteps and by controversy over his decision to pardon Nixon.\n\nFour years later, Carter would be ousted himself. He faced a damaging challenge for the Democratic nomination from the left by Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy and then a landslide defeat in the general election from the right by Reagan.\n\nThe former California governor tapped into discontent with Carter’s leadership. “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” Reagan asked voters in the iconic closing of their only campaign debate.\n\nPresidential achievements eclipsed?\n\nCarter’s defenders argue that he was a better president than generally recognized.\n\n\"I think that he is the most underappreciated modern president that we've had,\" said Stuart Eizenstat, a veteran Washington official and ambassador who was Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser in the White House.\n\n\"The reason for that is the lingering memories of his presidency are negative ones – gasoline lines, high interest rates and inflation, the Iran hostage crisis, the Desert One failed rescue effort – and those totally obscure a really remarkable set of accomplishments both at home and abroad, which in many ways didn't materialize until after he left office.\"\n\nEizenstat, author of \"President Carter: The White House Years,\" published in 2018, said Carter's policies and appointments laid the groundwork for a stronger economy, energy independence, environmental protection, business innovation in transportation and more.\n\nOn foreign policy, Carter painstakingly negotiated the 1978 Camp David Accords, a historic agreement between Israel's Menachem Begin and Egypt's Anwar Sadat that led to a formal peace treaty between the two countries the next year.\n\nJimmy Carter: The media has been harder on Trump than predecessors\n\nBut he stumbled when he came to the politics of the job.\n\nDespite having the advantage of a solidly Democratic Congress, many of his legislative proposals, including a consumer protection bill, stalled. The no-backroom-deals approach that helped him win the White House contributed to his difficulties in actually governing once he got there. He was mocked for charging members of Congress for their breakfast when invited to meet with him at the White House and for eliminating alcohol from most evening events.\n\nHe was seen by some, then and later, as prickly and sanctimonious.\n\nMeanwhile, unemployment rose, interest rates for home mortgages climbed into double digits and Americans found themselves waiting in lines to buy gas in an oil crisis created by OPEC, the powerful international energy cartel. In a speech to the nation in July 1979, Carter described a “crisis of confidence\" among the American people. Although he never said the word, it became short-handed as his “malaise” speech.\n\n\"He lacked the political and managerial skills needed to make best use of the office he held,\" said Robert McClure, a political scientist at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.\n\nDamaged by the hostage crisis\n\nMost damaging of all was the Iranian hostage crisis.\n\nCarter had agreed to allow Iran's deposed shah, a former U.S. ally who was living in exile, to receive cancer treatment in the United States. In protest, Iranian Islamist radicals overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 Americans captive. The confrontation, which began on Nov. 4, 1979, would end only as Reagan was being inaugurated 444 days later.\n\nCarter chose diplomacy and economic sanctions over military action. He halted oil imports from Iran and froze Iranian assets in the U.S. He severed diplomatic relations with Iran and imposed a full economic embargo on the country.\n\nFinally, he approved a top-secret military mission to free the hostages, but it ended in catastrophe. Three helicopters developed engine trouble in a remote staging area in the Iranian desert, forcing the mission to be aborted. Eight U.S. troops were killed when a helicopter and a plane collided while forces were being withdrawn.\n\nIt all added to the impression that Carter was out of his depth.\n\n\"The hostage crisis left a bitter taste in voters' mouths, which Carter was never able to overcome,\" said Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution scholar who worked on Carter's transition team when he was president-elect.\n\nOn the day of Reagan's inauguration, Jan. 20, 1981, Iran agreed to accept $8 billion in frozen assets and a promise by the U.S. to lift trade sanctions in exchange for the release of the hostages. Minutes after Carter's successor took the oath of office, the hostages were freed.\n\nFinally, a Nobel Peace Prize\n\nCarter left the White House, but he didn’t retire.\n\nJimmy and Rosalynn Carter established the Carter Center in Atlanta, their home base for decades as they worked on global health and democracy. He helped negotiate an end to the long civil war in Nicaragua between the Contra rebels and the Sandinistas. He met with North Korean leaders to try to end its nuclear weapons program. He mediated conflicts in Ethiopia, Liberia, Haiti, Bosnia, Sudan, Uganda and Venezuela. He led dozens of delegations of international observers to various countries to help assure elections were free and fair.\n\nFor decades, the Carter Center also led an international campaign to eradicate Guinea worm disease, a devastating tropical ailment that in 1986 afflicted an estimated 3.5 million people in Africa and Asia. In 2020, it was on the verge of eradication; just 27 cases were reported in six African countries.\n\nFor a week each year, the Carters volunteered with Habitat for Humanity, a charitable group that renovates and builds homes for poor people around the world.\n\nHe also wrote more than 30 books – controversial ones on the Palestinian territories and the Middle East and less controversial ones on Christmas memories and fly-fishing. He published a collection of his poems and a collection of his paintings. Again and again, he returned to writing about the lessons and demands of his Christian faith.\n\nPoking at the president: Carter pokes fun at Trump in speech at Liberty University\n\nCarter, who attended Donald Trump's inauguration in 2017, at times criticized the 45th president. In June 2019, at a Carter Center conference in suburban Virginia, he questioned the legitimacy of Trump's election, citing allegations of Russian interference that were later called into question.\n\nTrump responded at a news conference by calling Carter a \"nice man, terrible president.\"\n\nBut there were also times when Carter reached out to Trump. On the 40th anniversary of the normalization of U.S.-China relations, in 2019, he sent Trump a letter offering advice on managing that relationship. Carter said the phone conversation that followed was the first time the two men had spoken.\n\nTogether for charity: 5 living ex-presidents to headline hurricane relief concert\n\nIn 2002, Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize that supporters thought he had deserved years earlier, when it had been presented to Begin and Sadat. The Nobel committee honored Carter \"for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights and to promote economic and social development.\"\n\n\"The bond of our common humanity is stronger than the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices,\" Carter said in accepting the prestigious award. \"God gives us the capacity for choice. We can choose to alleviate suffering. We can choose to work together for peace. We can make these changes – and we must.\"\n\nFriendly skies: Jimmy Carter shakes hands of every passenger on his flight\n\nWhen he left the White House, Carter moved back home to Plains. Unlike most other modern presidents, he didn't choose to make money by delivering high-priced speeches or serving on corporate boards. But he did regularly speak to hundreds of visitors who would gather for his Sunday school class at Maranatha Baptist Church.\n\nIn November 2019, he told those gathered that he didn't fear death.\n\n\"It's incompatible for any Christian not to believe in life after death,\" Carter, then 95, told them, although he acknowledged he had wrestled with doubts throughout his life. In his prayers, he said, \"I didn't ask God to let me live, but I just asked God to give me a proper attitude toward death. And I found that I was absolutely and completely at ease with death.\"\n\nIn July 2021, he and his wife hosted a 75th anniversary party in Plains attended by about 300 friends, family members and fellow pols, among them Bill and Hillary Clinton. Carter, his fragility apparent, made a point of greeting the guests at each table for what many of them assumed would be the last time they saw him.\n\n\"He was not a self-promoter in the White House or afterwards, and I think that hurt, because it leaves all the sour tastes from the failures and didn't allow the positives to shine through,\" Eizenstat said. When Eizenstat visited Carter in Plains in 2018, Carter told his former aide he was comfortable with letting history judge.\n\nAs he approached his 90th birthday, Carter mused about his legacy in an interview with USA TODAY.\n\n\"One is peace,\" he said. \"I kept peace when I was president and I try to promote peace between other people and us, and between countries that were potentially at war, between Israel and Egypt for instance. And human rights. ... I think human rights and peace are the two things I'd like to be remembered for – as well as being a good grandfather.\"\n\nContributing: Richard Benedetto", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/03/obama-presidents-july-fourth-john-adams/12021999/", "title": "Presidents promote patriotism on July 4", "text": "David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhen America declared its independence back in 1776, John Adams wrote wife Abigail that future generations should celebrate the day \"with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other.\"\n\nAdams couldn't have predicted how presidents themselves would come to mark the day — both to promote patriotism and their political agendas.\n\nOver the past 238 years, the nation's presidents — from George Washington and Adams himself to current commander-in-chief Barack Obama — have found a variety of ways to commemorate the Fourth of July and the ideals of the day.\n\nWhether it's a barbecue on the White House lawn — as Obama plans again this year for military service members — or a visit to an historical shrine like Independence Hall in Philadelphia, presidents have sought to summon the patriotic spirit of the founders.\n\nMany presidents have also tailored July 4 ceremonies to fit the times, whether they involve civil war or foreign threats of terrorism.\n\n\"They try to represent what is on the mind of the American people at that particular time,\" said James Heintze, a librarian emeritus at American University who has studied presidential activities on July Fourth.\n\nIn recent years, veterans from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have had pride of place at Independence Day ceremonies at the White House and elsewhere.\n\nIn addition to the barbecue on the South Lawn, on Friday Obama, as he has in previous years, will preside at a naturalization ceremony for immigrant active duty military service members, veterans, reservists and spouses.\n\n\"This Independence Day will be their first day as American citizens,\" Obama said earlier this week.\n\nAt last year's military barbecue, Obama said that \"on July 4, 1776, a small band of patriots declared that we were a people created equal, free to think and worship and live as we please.\" The president told members of the military they are \"part of a long line of folks who are willing to fight for those ideals.\"\n\nPresidents have echoed similar sentiments in July 4 ceremonies that have evolved over time.\n\nPresident George Washington and his successor, Adams, had relatively low-key Fourth of July commemorations, back when the national capital was located first in New York City and then in Philadelphia. Adams moved into the White House in late 1800.\n\n(Adams, by the way, initially believed Independence Day celebrations would be on July 2, the day the Continental Congress approved a resolution of independence. Over the years, however, Americans began to celebrate July 4, the day the Congress approved the actual document known as the Declaration of Independence.)\n\nIn general, presidents like to meet with large groups of people on July 4. In the early days, they even threw open the doors of the White House to greet members of the public.\n\nThomas Jefferson, the third president and Adams' successor, held the first Fourth of July reception at the Executive Mansion in 1801.\n\nIn more recent times, amid heavy security around the president, White House holiday events are by invitation only.\n\nPresidents also like going to famous places on July 4, Heintze said. Gettysburg, Valley Forge and Philadelphia's Independence Hall (where the Declaration of Independence was signed) have been on holiday presidential schedules.\n\nThe Fourth of July also holds a somber place in presidential history.\n\nAdams and Jefferson both died on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Another early president, James Monroe, died on July 4, 1831.\n\nOn a happier note, one president was born on the Fourth of July (Calvin Coolidge in 1872). So was at least one presidential family member: Malia Obama, who turns 16 on Friday.\n\nPresidents have often used the holiday as a call for renewal of the nation's heritage.\n\nAs the nation faced Civil War on July 4, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln called an extraordinary session of Congress to discuss the crisis and urge national unity.\n\nEighty years later, with Nazi Germany in control of Western Europe and imperial Japan threatening the Pacific, President Franklin Roosevelt delivered a somber address from his home in Hyde Park, N.Y., on July 4, 1941.\n\nThe United States broke from Great Britain to fight for its freedom, Roosevelt said, but \"the fundamentals of 1776 are being struck down abroad and definitely they are threatened here.\"\n\nLittle more than five months later, the United States plunged into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nObama's predecessor, George W. Bush, often discussed the war on terrorism during July 4 events that followed the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. On his last Fourth of July as president, in 2008, Bush became the fourth president to visit Jefferson's home at Monticello, Va., where he presided over naturalization ceremonies.\n\nObama, swearing in immigrant service members in 2012, called it \"a perfect way to celebrate America's birthday — the world's oldest democracy, with some of our newest citizens.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/07/04/united-states-presidential-candidates-patriotism-july-fourth/29688615/", "title": "Presidential hopefuls discuss patriotism on July 4th", "text": "Des Moines Register\n\nContenders for the nation's highest office are once again crisscrossing Iowa, the state that kicks off presidential voting.

The thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see, but the brave rescuers never wavered. They made me so proud to be an American, and inspired me to do everything I could as their senator to support them and rebuild.

Whether serving overseas in war or responding to the eight hurricanes that battered the Sunshine State in just 16 months, Florida's national guardsmen exemplified the values of all the men and women who have committed to serving in our armed forces.\"\n\nBen Carson\n\nRetired neurosurgeon\n\n\"I am humbled before God and before the courage and leadership of our Founding Fathers. These are the touchstones and the guiding light of my faith and patriotic values. Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Nathan Hale; they represent the very essence of patriotism, defined by their selfless duty and service to their countrymen, and the generations that have followed. Long ago, I accepted their baton of service to my fellow man as my calling in life, as a care provider for children and as an advocate for the principles of our Constitution.\"\n\nChris Christie\n\nGovernor of New Jersey\n\n\"The brave men and women who have worn our nation's uniform have courageously and selflessly served to uphold the democratic principles that as Americans we hold so dear. At the same time, we must remember the families of those who made the ultimate sacrifice and did not come home.

We are forever grateful for their service, today and every day.\"\n\nTed Cruz\n\nU.S. senator from Texas\n\n\"My father came to America from Cuba in 1957. He had little money, and spoke little English. My Irish-Italian mother was the daughter of working-class parents. Both my parents worked hard. In a single generation, their son became a United States senator, and now I am running for president. That could only happen in America. These stories demonstrate how America is the land of limitless opportunity. I ask myself, 'What have I done today to ensure that same opportunity exists for future generations?' We're an exceptional nation, and it is up to each of us to keep it that way.\"\n\nCarly Fiorina\n\nFormer CEO of Hewlett-Packard\n\n\"Ours was intended to be a citizen government, so when citizens volunteer our time and talent to make our country, our government and our politics better, we exhibit patriotism. I have continued to make this a priority, acting as a volunteer chair of two large charities dedicated to improving our communities. I have volunteered my time to help good candidates run for political office — and I have even volunteered more directly to improve our government, serving as an adviser for the departments of State, Defense and Homeland Security as well as for the CIA and (National Security Agency).\"\n\nLindsey Graham\n\nU.S. senator from South Carolina\n\n\"I was honored to be an Air Force officer serving on active duty, in the Guard, and in the Reserves for 33 years. Being part of a military unit that is focused on the mission and not on individual differences was a great inspiration and taught me what true patriotism is all about.\"\n\nMike Huckabee\n\nFormer governor of Arkansas\n\n\"When I was asked how I demonstrate patriotism, I considered all the ways I try to convey my love and gratitude for this truly exceptional nation, where a poor kid from Arkansas can someday become governor. But then I remembered JFK: 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.' And I realized that what perfectly demonstrates pure, selfless patriotism are those who love this country so much they offer their lives to preserve its freedoms and opportunities for us all: the heroic men and women of the United States military. \"\n\nBobby Jindal\n\nGovernor of Louisiana\n\n\"My parents came to chase the American dream and they caught it, they've lived it. I simply want my children and one day my grandchildren to be able to live that same American dream. I want all of our children to have those opportunities, so I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunities that America has afforded my family. I want those opportunities to continue. One of the ways I can show my gratitude for what this country has done for me is fight with everything I've got to make sure those opportunities continue to exist for the next generation.\"\n\nJohn Kasich\n\nGovernor of Ohio\n\n\"Patriotism means you don't take a pass on dealing with problems where you live. Far too many officials fear taking on big challenges, and as a result, nothing gets done and problems worsen. Throughout my public career both in Congress and as governor, I have taken on the challenges of the day in the belief that big ideas drive success and generate excitement. Are they risky? Do they aggravate some people? Sometimes. But, if you're not doing that, you're not doing your job, and a strong agenda of ideas is not only what people want — it's what our nation needs.\"\n\nRick Perry\n\nFormer governor of Texas\n\n\"Patriots put their country first, alongside faith and family. I had the honor of wearing America's uniform, defending freedom as an Air Force officer and aircraft commander. I inherited my love and sense of duty for my country from my father, a WWII B-17 tail gunner. Patriots work 365 days a year, not just on July 4. Providing for our heroes and their families is a sacred duty I take extreme pride in executing. As governor, we took important steps to expand our commitment to our nation's heroes. As commander in chief, it would remain one of my highest priorities.\"\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nU.S. senator from Florida\n\n\"One way I exercise patriotism is by teaching my kids what America means to me on a personal level. In school and from our entertainment culture, children rarely receive a meaningful explanation of the principles and ideals that set America apart from every other nation. I teach my children that they, like me, owe a debt to America, for it is the nation that changed our family's history. I believe these conversations are important, for if our children believe America is just an ordinary country, they will not be willing to go to extraordinary lengths to extend her promise.\"\n\nRand Paul\n\nU.S. senator from Kentucky\n\n\"To me, patriotism means giving back to your community. Whether it is volunteering at the local food shelter, tutoring struggling students, singing in the church choir, or the most selfless act of all, serving in our military to protect our nation and our American values. As a physician, I have an obligation to help those in need. I am honored to have the opportunity to perform free sight-restoring eye surgeries for lower-income families in my home state. There is nothing more rewarding than using my skills as an ophthalmologist to give back — to find the problem and diagnose the solution.\"\n\nRick Santorum\n\nFormer U.S. senator from Pennsylvania\n\n\"The moment in my life I gave the most for my country was not when I ran for Congress, not when I ran for the Senate, and not when I decided to run for president. The moment I most committed myself to my country was the day my son Daniel came to me and said he wanted to join the Air Force. I cannot give more to my country than one of my own.\"\n\nDonald Trump\n\nBusinessman\n\n\"Our country has a sacred duty to care for veterans and their families. One of the greatest gifts of my success is being able to honor veterans. I sit on the board of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, which helps find jobs for veterans. One of my proudest accomplishments: In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of World War II, only 100 spectators watched New York City's parade. It was an insult. I agreed to lead a second parade that year. I made a $1 million matching donation to finance the parade. Over 1.4 million watched; more than 25,000 veterans participated.\"\n\nScott Walker\n\nGovernor of Wisconsin\n\n\"My family lived in Plainfield, Iowa, from 1970 to 1977. Right around the time of our nation's bicentennial, I noticed that there was no state flag at our City Hall.

It would make 2017 income tax cuts permanent; create new, narrow tax breaks for tips and overtime; implement new benefits for businesses; and roll back clean energy tax credits crated under former President Joe Biden.\n\n\"Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy,\" Trump said on social media during a procedural vote. \"What are the Republicans waiting for???\"\n\nThe timing of the victory gives Trump a chance to promote his so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" tonight in Des Moines, Iowa, where he’s traveling to kick off a yearlong celebration marking the 250th birthday of the United States.\n\nDemocrats were unified in opposition to the bill in the House and Senate, calling it an assault on healthcare and nutritional assistance. The bill would make deep cuts to Medicaid, leaving nearly 12 million Americans uninsured, and knock 2 million people off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance food program.\n\n\"People will die. Tens of thousands, year after year after year, as a result of the Republican assault on the healthcare of the American people,\" said Jeffries who spoke for more than eight-and-a-half hours. \"This is a crime scene.\"\n\nHere's what we know about the bill:\n\nTrump: 'I have more power now'\n\nA few hours after the House’s approval, Trump touted the sweeping tax and spending bill as the \"biggest bill of its kind ever signed\" and predicted the country would soar to new heights.\n\n\"It’s going to make this country into a rocket ship,\" Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One on Thursday evening to travel to Des Moines, Iowa, where he’s set to give a speech to kick off a yearlong celebration for the 250th anniversary of America’s founding.\n\nTrump said it wasn’t difficult to convince House Republicans, including members of the House Freedom Caucus, who met with him at the White House on Wednesday to discuss their concerns with the legislation. Only two House Republicans voted against the bill.\n\n\"I did not have much of a problem with any of them,\" Trump said, adding that he didn’t make any \"deals\" in exchange for their support but focused on the merits of the bill. \"It was not hard. This is going to be a great bill for the country.\"\n\nTrump acknowledged the enormous sway he has on Republicans in Congress — and said he has even more power over his party compared to his first White House term.\n\n\"I think I have more power now,\" Trump said. \"I do. I could say, oh gee, I don’t know. I think I probably do because we’ve had a great record of success.\"\n\n\"More gravitas. More power,\" he added.\n\nTrump is set to sign the bill into law during a White House ceremony on Friday, which falls on the 4th of July, the deadline Trump set weeks ago for Republican lawmakers to send him the bill.\n\nHouse takes next week off from voting after passing Trump bill\n\nAfter round-the-clock negotiations to send Trump’s legislative package to the president’s desk, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer announced lawmakers will not be voting next week.\n\nJohnson had said he hadn’t slept much in the previous two days.\n\nThe House had expected to be on recess this week for the July 4 holiday, but returned to vote on Trump’s bill. Lawmakers had planned to return July 7. But Emmer, R-Minnesota, announced the next House votes are now expected July 14 about 6:30 p.m. EDT.\n\nYMCA blasts as Johnson enrolls bill\n\nJohnson and dozens of Congressional Republicans crammed into a ceremonial room off the House chamber to celebrate the completion of their months-long effort.\n\n\"YMCA\" by Village People — a standby from Trump’s campaign rallies — blasted as Johnson shook hands with his colleagues and signed the bill at a wooden desk.\n\n\"We had a vision for what we wanted to do,\" Johnson said. \"I believed in this vision. I believed in the group. I believe in America.\"\n\nWhen will Trump sign the bill into law?\n\nTrump will sign the newly approved megabill into law Friday at 4 p.m. EDT during a ceremony at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nThe ceremony will take place on the Fourth of July, the deadline Trump set weeks ago for Republicans to send his signature to his desk.\n\n\"Today is a victorious day for the American people,\" Leavitt said in a call to reporters where she described the bill as \"an encapsulation of all of the policies that the president campaigned on.\"\n\nWhich Republicans voted against Trump’s bill?\n\nTwo House Republicans voted against Trump’s legislative package, after round-the-clock meetings with legislative leaders and the president himself at the White House prevented more defections.\n\nGOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania opposed the measure in the 218-214 vote.\n\nThe legislation was approved by narrow votes throughout its journey through Congress. The House approved its initial version in May on a 215-214 vote, with two Republicans opposed, one voting present and two absent. The Senate voted 51-50 on July 1, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie with three Republicans voting no.\n\nWhat does non voting, voting present mean?\n\nIt’s not as simple as yes or no for lawmakers. The other options include \"present\" or \"non voting.\"\n\nLawmakers can vote present, essentially opting out of a yes or no, and keeping their vote from counting toward the final tally.\n\nThis is a popular route for hardliners in controversial decisions — saving them from voting against their position without hurting their party’s chance of success.\n\nSpeaker Johnson tees up House vote\n\nJohnson teed up the vote on Trump’s sweeping tax bill. But before surrendering the microphone, the Louisiana Republican slammed Jeffries' record-breaking speech.\n\n\"Democrats deliver performances and Republicans deliver results,\" Johnson said.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the speaker teed up the roll call as a pivotal political moment for the country. \"In a few moments, we will remind the world why the American experiment still endures today and why its best days are still ahead of us,\" he said. Johnson ended his remarks shortly after 2:05 p.m. EDT and the House began 15-minute vote for final passage on Trump's second-term legislative agenda.\n\nJeffries wraps record-breaking speech\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, turned in a record-breaking House floor speech, speaking for more than eight-and-a-half hours.\n\nHe concluded by urging people to \"press on.\"\n\nAfter he wrapped, the Democrats gave him hugs, handshakes and high fives and chanted \"Hakeem! Hakeem!\"\n\nRepublicans then took the floor and immediately began poking fun at Jeffries' marathon speech.\n\n\"I'm from the 'Show Me' state,\" Rep. Jason Smith, R-Missouri, said on the floor after the speech. \"And what we just heard can be defined in one word: A bunch of hogwash.\"\n\nWhat was the scene like on the House floor?\n\nThe mood in the House was while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries trashed Trump’s sweeping tax bill during his floor remarks that started in the middle of the night.\n\nDemocrats seated behind Jeffries included Michigan Rep. Shri Thanedar, California Rep. Luz Rivas, and Arizona Rep. Yassamin Ansari. They had pursed lips and scrunched eyebrows while listening to their leader rail against the bill's tax cuts and Medicaid spending changes.\n\nSome were spotted scrolling on their phones. At times, Jeffries’ colleagues stood up and clapped at his remarks. Others shouted \"preach\" and \"take your time.\"\n\n\"You are the swamp,\" Jeffries said at one point addressing Republicans, who almost entirely skipped the Democratic leader's remarks.\n\nAbout 50 Democrats were present in the chamber. For the GOP, a few staffers and lawmakers were present, including South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman.\n\nVP JD Vance: Hakeem Jeffries’ speech flipped a GOP vote on the bill\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ marathon floor speech protesting Trump’s tax bill has not only moved Democrats. It’s moved Republicans too, according to Vice President JD Vance.\n\n\"GOP Congressman just texted me: 'I was undecided on the bill but then I watched Hakeem Jeffries performance and now I’m a firm yes,'\" Vance wrote on X, without specifying who the lawmaker was.\n\nRepublicans criticized Jeffries. \"When I listen to Hakeem Jeffries, it drives me bananas,\" Tennessee Republican Rep. Andy Ogles said on \"The Benny Show.\"\n\nJohnson told reporters of Jeffries, \"It takes a lot longer to build the lies than to tell the truth, so he's really spinning a long tale in there.\"\n\nWhen will the GOP tax and spending bill go into effect?\n\nThe nearly 900-page spending and tax bill covers a wide swath of government spending beyond Medicaid cuts and tax cuts, and there is a wide variation on when each provision goes into effect as well.\n\nMedicaid: Nationwide Medicaid work requirements take effect Jan. 1, 2027, shortly after the mid-term elections decide which party controls Congress.\n\nThe legislation requires \"able-bodied\" Medicaid recipients to work 80 hours a month or qualify for an exemption, such as being a student, caregiver or having a disability. The work requirement applies to parents of children older than 13.\n\nTax rates: The bill permanently extends the tax cuts introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which were set to expire this year. There should be not disruption in their application if the bill is signed.\n\nSALT: The cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, would lift to $40,000 starting in 2025. That benefit starts to phaseout for people who earn more than $500,000 of income. In 2030 the increased deduction ends and the $40,000 limit would revert to $10,000.\n\nTips and overtime: No tax on tips or overtime are promises Trump made on the campaign trail when he was running for a second term. Workers will be able to deduct up to $25,000 in tips and up to $25,000 in overtime, but the tax law change is temporary and ends Dec. 31, 2028, right before he leaves office.\n\nChild Tax Credit: Under current law, the maximum child tax credit is $2,000, which will revert to $1,000 after 2025 without changes from Congress. The GOP’s spending bill would permanently raise that maximum credit to $2,200 starting in 2025 and tie the amount to inflation going forward. There is no end date\n\nSocial Security tax deduction: Only some Social Security beneficiaries will be able to claim the deduction, which was also a promise Trump made on the campaign trail. This deduction is also temporary. It would last from 2025 to 2029.\n\nThe bill includes a temporary $6,000 deduction for seniors over the age of 65 and eliminates Social Security tax liability for seniors with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less or $150,000 if filing as a married couple.\n\nThe lowest-income seniors who already don’t pay taxes on Social Security, those who choose to claim their benefits before they reach age 65 and those above a defined income threshold could not claim the deduction. - Sarah D. Wire\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: ‘We have the votes’\n\nJohnson told reporters on July 3 that he expects Trump's major tax bill to make it through to final passage.\n\n\"We have the votes,\" the Louisiana Republican said.\n\nWith a razor-thin majority in the House, Johnson can only afford to lose three Republican votes. Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie has previously said he will oppose the bill.\n\nMembers of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus have also raised concerns about the legislation adding to the nation's deficit. But Johnson expressed confidence in the bill’s passage, saying he’s \"ready to roll.\"\n\nWhat does the GOP bill mean for Medicaid?\n\nThe GOP spending and tax bill would cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid, the state-federal health program for low-income families and disabled people. The bill is projected to eliminate insurance coverage for between 12 million and 20 million people over the next decade, according to two estimates.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office calculates that the bill would leave 11.8 million people uninsured by 2034. The Senate Joint Economic Committee Minority estimates that about 20 million people could lose coverage.\n\nMedicaid insures 83 million low-income children and adults, or more than 1 in 5 Americans, according to KFF, a health policy nonprofit. Medicaid funds 63% of nursing home facility residents, according to KFF.\n\nRepublicans say the $900 billion-a-year program was allowed to grow too large under Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden by adding nondisabled adults they say don't deserve government assistance, and they have long sought to scale it back. The expanded access has been in place for 13 years.\n\nPeople may not recognize that their coverage is at risk because in many states Medicaid goes by a local name. For example, California’s program is called Medi-Cal and Louisiana's Medicaid program is called Healthy Louisiana.\n\nThe funding cuts mean states will receive smaller Medicaid payments from the federal government.\n\nWhat Medicaid work requirements are in the bill?\n\nThe Trump tax bill imposes nationwide Medicaid work requirements that take effect Jan. 1, 2027, shortly after the mid-term elections decide which party controls the next Congress.\n\nThe legislation requires \"able-bodied\" Medicaid recipients to work 80 hours a month or qualify for an exemption, such as being a student, caregiver or having a disability. The work requirement applies to parents of children older than 13.\n\nThe bill would require states to check eligibility twice a year, rather than once. And states, which administer Medicaid, would have to set up systems to verify a person's employment or exemption status.\n\nThe work requirements mean states will have extra administrative duties of verifying an enrollee's work or volunteer status.\n\n‘MAGA is not happy,’ Trump warned Republican holdouts\n\nAs the House advanced the bill forward earlier on the morning of July 3, Trump applied pressure to conservative holdouts and expressed frustration with their stubbornness.\n\n\"FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!\" Trump said in a 12:45 a.m. ET post on Truth Social.\n\nA half-hour earlier, he wrote: \"Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy. What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT’S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!\"\n\nHakeem Jeffries slams Trump’s bill in ‘magic minute’ speech\n\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized Trump’s sweeping tax and domestic policy bill under a procedural tactic known as \"magic minute,\" which allows party leaders to have unlimited speaking time on the floor.\n\nJeffries' speech started shortly before 5 a.m., as the bill moved closer to passing the House.\n\n\"I rise today in strong opposition to Donald Trump’s disgusting abomination…that guts Medicaid, rips food from the mouths of children, seniors and veterans, and rewards billionaires with massive tax breaks,\" Jeffries said.\n\nHe condemned the cuts in spending for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the bill, arguing that the cost of living is too high.\n\n\"Cruelty should never be the objective or the outcome of legislation that we consider here in the House of Representatives,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/03"}]}

A look at White House history", "text": "Stewart D. McLaurin\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThis Fourth of July week will feature the picnics, parades and fireworks that Americans love. But with just two years left until the 250th anniversary of our independence, it’s important to look at how our nation’s birthday has evolved and how the White House’s role on this holiday has contributed to our national identity.\n\nWe should begin by remembering how audacious it was for revolutionaries to break away from their mother country – and to pledge “our lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor” to one another.\n\n“That was more than rhetoric,” President Ronald Reagan reminded Americans on July 4, 1986, with the Statue of Liberty in the background. “Each of those men knew the penalty for high treason to the crown.”\n\nIf our second president, John Adams, had his way, we’d celebrate on July 2 – the day in 1776 that the Continental Congress in Philadelphia officially declared freedom from Great Britain. But the Declaration of Independence wasn’t signed for two more days, and it was Adams’ successor, Thomas Jefferson, who began the tradition of observing the Fourth of July at the White House in 1801.\n\nThe early Fourth of July celebrations at the White House\n\nOn that day, President Jefferson opened the White House to diplomats, civil and military officers, citizens and Cherokee chiefs in what was known as the Oval Saloon (today’s Blue Room). The Marine Band played in the Entrance Hall, and a festival on the north grounds featured horse races and parades, along with cakes, wine and punch for the revelers.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe celebration on July 4, 1803, featured a history-making reveal, when Jefferson stood on the front steps to announce news of the Louisiana Purchase, which had just reached the White House.\n\nAs annual receptions and other commemorations became customary, the national symbolism of Independence Day grew stronger in 1826, when Adams and Jefferson both died on July 4 – exactly 50 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nFive years later, James Monroe, the last Founding Father to become president, also died on July 4.\n\nTest your knowledge about Camp David: Pop quiz: Where do presidents vacation and hold historic events?\n\nFireworks were sometimes part of these early July Fourth celebrations, including a tragedy in 1845, when they discharged into a crowd assembled along the south wall of the White House, killing a local carpenter.\n\nOn July 4, 1848, President James Polk witnessed the laying of the cornerstone of the Washington Monument. (Future President Abraham Lincoln was also in attendance.)\n\nLincoln's last Fourth of July was historic\n\nSome of the most important and resonant days of the Civil War came on July 4, with the president and the White House at the center.\n\nOn Lincoln’s first July 4 as president, just a few months after the war began in 1861, he reviewed New York militia regiments marching on the White House lawn, raised an American flag at the Treasury Department, and addressed Congress to call for more troops and war funding.\n\nAfter the Union won a decisive victory at Gettysburg on the day before July 4, 1863, Lincoln harkened back to America’s Independence Day, citing its writing “four score and seven years ago” when he visited the battlefield that November to deliver his iconic Gettysburg Address.\n\nThe following July 4 – the last of Lincoln’s life – the president opened the White House South Grounds to picnickers from Black schools, churches and religious groups, moving the nation one symbolic step closer to fulfilling the promises made on the first Fourth of July.\n\nBecoming a federal holiday\n\nIt wasn’t until 1870 that Independence Day was made an official federal holiday. On our nation’s 100th birthday in 1876, President Ulysses Grant and first lady Julia Grant greeted guests and opened a centennial exposition in Philadelphia by starting up a newfangled Corliss steam engine that powered most of the exhibits.\n\nPresidents sometimes used Independence Day to get away from the office and the heat. President Andrew Jackson went home to the Hermitage, Presidents Polk and Grant vacationed in New Jersey, while Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft escaped to “summer White House” locations farther north. President Woodrow Wilson returned to Gettysburg on the battle’s 50th anniversary.\n\nCalvin Coolidge – the only U.S. president born on July 4 – traveled to Philadelphia to celebrate the 150th anniversary of our founding.\n\n“Amid all the clash of conflicting interests, amid all the welter of partisan politics,” he said, “every American can turn for solace and consolation to the Declaration of Independence.”\n\nAmerica celebrates 200 years of independence with Queen Elizabeth\n\nPresident Harry Truman marked the 175th with an address at the Washington Monument, saying, “The ideas on which our government is founded ‒ the ideas of equality, of God-given rights, of self-government ‒ are still revolutionary.”\n\nBy 1976, the celebration of the 200th anniversary of American independence became more elaborate. President Gerald Ford spent the day shuttling to Valley Forge, to Philadelphia’s Independence Hall and to the New York Harbor to ring a bicentennial bell on the flight deck of the USS Forrestal – ending the night at the White House, watching fireworks over the National Mall with first lady Betty Ford from the Truman Balcony.\n\nThe Fords also invited a special guest ‒ Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, who appeared on the Truman Balcony three days later with President Ford to greet 7,000 guests on the White House lawn. A state dinner was held in her honor (in a tent in the Rose Garden), broadcast live on public television, and featured a Julia Child interview with White House Executive Chef Henry Haller as he made Maryland vegetables and Georgia peach custard.\n\nWhere past and present coexist: White House furniture is America's living history\n\nJuly 4 'unleashed not merely a revolution against the British'\n\nDuring recent Independence Days, the White House South Lawn has been opened to staff, military families and special guests for barbecue, ice cream and a seat on the grass to watch the fireworks burst over the National Mall.\n\nAs we approach our nation’s 250th birthday, we’ll have many opportunities to look beyond the bands and fireworks to consider that day in Philadelphia that changed world history.\n\nAs President John Kennedy said on Independence Day 1962, the Declaration of Independence \"unleashed not merely a revolution against the British, but a revolution in human affairs.”\n\nJuly 4 is not just a day to celebrate our ideals and the people who envisioned them. It’s also a time to honor the generations who came after our Founders, to fulfill these promises and renew our nation. That’s why a number of presidents have marked the holiday by attending naturalization ceremonies where new citizens take their oath of allegiance to the United States.\n\n“From this day forward,” President George W. Bush told new Americans in 2008, “the history of the United States will be part of your heritage. The Fourth of July will be part of your Independence Day.”\n\nHere’s hoping that your July 4 weekend includes rest, relaxation and reflection – on our nation’s history, its promise and the part we can all play in carrying forward the American experiment.\n\nStewart D.

Planning for America's 250th birthday party began nearly nine years ago, when the 2016 U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission Act was passed by an act of Congress.\n\nThe America250 site lists more than a dozen corporate partners, including Amazon, Coke and Walmart, and has information on events scheduled so far in states throughout the country.\n\nAmerica250: Trump kicks off birthday celebration with Iowa speech\n\nTo kick off the year-long celebration President Donald Trump is expected to give a speech in Des Moines tonight, July 3, at the Iowa State Fairgrounds.

(The parade marked the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army and also fell on the president's 79th birthday.)\n\nNow he has an opportunity to drape himself in the red, white and blue for the next 12 months.\n\n\"We are planning parties. We are planning a national celebration to really unite the country,\" Monica Crowley, the White House's ambassador for major U.S.-hosted events, including the 250th anniversary celebration, said this week in an interview on Fox News, where she was previously a contributor. \"Bring the country together out of shared patriotism, shared values and a renewed sense of civic pride.\"\n\nBy losing the 2020 election but winning in 2024, Trump has noted that he now gets to be president for America's 250th birthday and when the United States hosts the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the world's most popular sporting event both in the same year. In the summer of 2028, while he's still in his second term, Los Angeles plays host to the Summer Olympics.\n\n\"Can you imagine? I missed that four years and now look what I have. I have everything,\" Trump said May 26 at National Arlington Cemetery on Memorial Day. \"Amazing the way things work out. God did that. I believe that, too,\" he added with a laugh.\n\nWho is leading the 250th birthday efforts?\n\nIn Des Moines, Trump is expected to unveil efforts to create the \"Great American State Fair,\" a concept he touted on the 2024 campaign trail as a \"unique, one-year exhibition featuring pavilions from all 50 states.\" He said the fair will showcase the \"glory of every state in the union,\" promote pride in American history and highlight U.S. innovation. He promised in a 2023 video speech to make Iowa ‒ which votes first in the Republican primary ‒ the home of the one-time festival that will also include \"patriots games\" for high school athletes to compete.\n\n\"Together, we will built it and they will come,\" Trump said then.\n\nThe festivities, dubbed America250, are organized under a nonprofit with the same name created in 2019 after Congress took action three years earlier to create the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission to begin organizing the country's 250th anniversary celebration.\n\nThe initiative is supposed to be a nonpartisan affair, but The Atlantic reported the group has effectively been operating \"as an arm of Trump’s White House operation.\"\n\nAmerica250's newly named executive director is Ariel Abergel, a former producer of Fox News' Fox and Friends who interned at the White House during Trump's first term. He's brought with him other former Fox News employees, according to The Atlantic, and enlisted the help of Trump campaign aides, including senior adviser Chris LaCivita.\n\nCorporate sponsors of America250 include several led by executives who have sought to curry favor with Trump, including Ultimate Fighting Championship, Amazon, Coinbase and Oracle.\n\nTrump, in a post on Truth Social, said the America250 kickoff in Iowa \"will be a very special event, honoring our Great Country, and our Brave Heroes who fought to keep us FREE.\"\n\nIt could also give Trump his first chance to publicly tout passage of his so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" ‒ but only if he's able to push House Republicans to sign off on the massive tax and spending bill before his self-imposed holiday deadline.\n\nTrump has a history of turning traditionally nonpartisan events into supercharged political spectacles. In a June 10 speech to troops at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Trump slammed California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass as \"incompetent\" ‒ prompting some soldiers to boo their names ‒ and referred to Los Angeles as a \"trash heap.\" He also singled out media covering the event as \"fake news,\" making the speech sound more like a Trump campaign rally than an address to uniformed troops.\n\nWhat America250 events are planned for the coming year?\n\nTrump signed a Jan. 29 executive order directing his administration to organize \"a grand celebration worthy of the momentous occasion\" of America's 250th birthday. That included creating a task force on celebrating the 250th anniversary, composed of Trump Cabinet secretaries and chaired by Trump and Vice President JD Vance.\n\nEach federal department and agency has assigned a point person to coordinate with the White House on America250 planning, a White House official told USA TODAY.\n\nThe full slate of America250 activities and projects have not been announced, but some are in the works.\n\nThe most widely publicized plans are for a \"National Garden of American Heroes\" that will honor 250 American heroes across a wide range of fields. Trump reinstated plans for the garden, which he had pushed in his first term, as part of his America250 executive order. A location for the garden hasn't been decided. An updated timeline calls for it to be completed \"as expeditiously as possible.\"\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a \"Great American Road Trip\" to mark America's 250th birthday that will highlight popular travel routes, historic landmarks and scenic destinations in all 50 states.\n\nThe White House has started unveiling videos showing a narrated cartoon version of signers of the Declaration of Independence, such as President Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Heyward Jr. of South Carolina. In the final year of his first White House term, Trump created a \"1776 Commission\" to promote what he called \"patriotic education.\"\n\nThere's also a nationwide student writing and artwork contest in which children are asked to answer, \"What does America mean to you?\" A storytelling project looks to preserve firsthand accounts of Americans, both famous and lesser-known. And an America Gives initiative aims to increase volunteerism.\n\nAn effort is underway for all 50 states to collect items for a \"time capsule\" that will be buried in Philadelphia on July 4, 2026. A traveling tech expo is set to display American innovations across the country. And celebrations will also mark the 250th anniversary of the Navy and Air Force ‒ though neither is expected to include a parade like the U.S. Army received for its 250th anniversary.\n\nAnd you can bet Trump will headline several more America250 events after Iowa.\n\n\"It really is a gift to have him in office,\" Crowley said. \"Can you imagine the other team being in office for America250?\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2022/07/02/president-coolidges-150th-birthday-is-coming-on-the-4th-of-july/65364677007/", "title": "President Coolidge's 150th birthday is coming on the 4th of July", "text": "What better day for a president of the United States to be born than the Fourth of Jul.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other national Democrats criticized the move as authoritarian.\n\nTrump turns 79\n\nTrump and former President Joe Biden’s ages were a flashpoint in last year’s presidential campaign. Biden quit the Democratic ticket after several episodes, including a debate with Trump, raised doubts about his ability to do the job.\n\nBiden turned 82 in November. He was the oldest president in American history. In January, Trump became the oldest U.S. president to be inaugurated, at age 78. Like Biden, he will be 82 at the end of his term.\n\nHis White House physician, Sean Barbabella, said in April that Trump \"remains in excellent health,\" due to his \"active lifestyle,” including public appearances and “frequent victories in golf events.”\n\nThunderstorms and rain are expected Saturday. Trump frequently plays golf over the weekend but was not expected to on his birthday. The military parade comes amid an explosive conflict between Israel and Iran. Trump also has a trip to Canada on Sunday to meet with leaders of the world’s top economies.\n\nA ‘grand’ parade\n\nThe president’s birthday-themed parade was eight years in the making.\n\nHe’s been floating the idea since before his first inauguration. Trump told the Washington Post in 2017 that he wanted to show off America’s military at parades in Washington, D.C. and New York.\n\nTrump drew inspiration from the Bastille Day celebration that takes place in Paris every July 14. The president and first lady Melania Trump attended the military parade as guests of French President Emmanuel Macron in the summer of 2017.\n\nHe told Macron later that year that he wanted to have a “really great parade to show our military strength” after what he witnessed during his visit to France.\n\n“We may do something like that on July 4th in Washington,” Trump told Macron. “We're going to have to try and top it.”\n\nThat year Macron rolled down the Champs-Élysées in a military jeep. Trump will be watching his parade on Constitution Avenue from a viewing stand.\n\nAccording to America250, which is organizing the event, veterans, active-duty troops, wounded warriors and Gold Star Families will be in attendance, in addition to members of the general public.\n\nAs many as 120 vehicles, including Abrams tanks, Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles and military helicopters are expected to be part of the display of American military hardware.\n\n\"We want to show off a little bit,” Trump said in a June 10 speech at Fort Bragg.\n\nBringing up events commemorating WWII that recently took place in Europe and America’s role in the war, Trump said, “France was celebrating. Really, they were all celebrating. The only one that doesn't celebrate is the USA, and we're the ones that won the war.”\n\n“We're going to celebrate on Saturday,” Trump added. “And we're going to celebrate from now on.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/03/trump-tax-bill-house-vote-live-updates/84450911007/", "title": "House passes Trump's tax, spending and policy bill", "text": "WASHINGTON – The fight is over: Republicans' sweeping bill to cut taxes and slash benefit programs like Medicaid has passed out of Congress and is on its way to President Donald Trump’s desk to be signed into law during a July 4 ceremony at the White House.\n\nThe 218-214 House vote came after a full day of negotiations July 2, an overnight debate and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, delivering the longest House speech on record. Trump met at the White House with skeptical GOP lawmakers, worked the phones and, via social media, cheered the members on during votes.\n\nIt’s a major victory for Trump and Republican leadership in Congress, which captured a trifecta during the 2024 elections and has used that political muscle to force what they've dubbed their \"One Big, Beautiful Bill\" through both chambers at a rapid-fire pace. The passage came despite deep reservations within their own party and unanimous opposition from Democrats who see it as a ticket to winning back congressional majorities in 2026.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, said he hopes Trump will sign the bill on the nation's 249th birthday on Friday. \"What more appropriate time to pass the big, beautiful bill for America than on Independence Day?\" he said.\n\nThe bill that Trump has touted as a centerpiece of his second-term agenda will touch nearly every aspect of the American economy, from the social safety net and income taxes to business and clean energy incentives.\n\nIt is estimated to increase deficits by around $3.4 trillion over the next ten years.

Only two House Republicans voted against the bill.\n\n\"I did not have much of a problem with any of them,\" Trump said, adding that he didn’t make any \"deals\" in exchange for their support but focused on the merits of the bill. \"It was not hard. This is going to be a great bill for the country.\"\n\nTrump acknowledged the enormous sway he has on Republicans in Congress — and said he has even more power over his party compared to his first White House term.\n\n\"I think I have more power now,\" Trump said. \"I do. I could say, oh gee, I don’t know. I think I probably do because we’ve had a great record of success.\"\n\n\"More gravitas. More power,\" he added.\n\nTrump is set to sign the bill into law during a White House ceremony on Friday, which falls on the 4th of July, the deadline Trump set weeks ago for Republican lawmakers to send him the bill.\n\nHouse takes next week off from voting after passing Trump bill\n\nAfter round-the-clock negotiations to send Trump’s legislative package to the president’s desk, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer announced lawmakers will not be voting next week.\n\nJohnson had said he hadn’t slept much in the previous two days.\n\nThe House had expected to be on recess this week for the July 4 holiday, but returned to vote on Trump’s bill.

But Emmer, R-Minnesota, announced the next House votes are now expected July 14 about 6:30 p.m. EDT.\n\nYMCA blasts as Johnson enrolls bill\n\nJohnson and dozens of Congressional Republicans crammed into a ceremonial room off the House chamber to celebrate the completion of their months-long effort.\n\n\"YMCA\" by Village People — a standby from Trump’s campaign rallies — blasted as Johnson shook hands with his colleagues and signed the bill at a wooden desk.\n\n\"We had a vision for what we wanted to do,\" Johnson said. \"I believed in this vision. I believed in the group. I believe in America.\"\n\nWhen will Trump sign the bill into law?\n\nTrump will sign the newly approved megabill into law Friday at 4 p.m. EDT during a ceremony at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nThe ceremony will take place on the Fourth of July, the deadline Trump set weeks ago for Republicans to send his signature to his desk.\n\n\"Today is a victorious day for the American people,\" Leavitt said in a call to reporters where she described the bill as \"an encapsulation of all of the policies that the president campaigned on.\"\n\nWhich Republicans voted against Trump’s bill?\n\nTwo House Republicans voted against Trump’s legislative package, after round-the-clock meetings with legislative leaders and the president himself at the White House prevented more defections.\n\nGOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania opposed the measure in the 218-214 vote.\n\nThe legislation was approved by narrow votes throughout its journey through Congress. The House approved its initial version in May on a 215-214 vote, with two Republicans opposed, one voting present and two absent. The Senate voted 51-50 on July 1, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie with three Republicans voting no.\n\nWhat does non voting, voting present mean?\n\nIt’s not as simple as yes or no for lawmakers. The other options include \"present\" or \"non voting.\"\n\nLawmakers can vote present, essentially opting out of a yes or no, and keeping their vote from counting toward the final tally.\n\nThis is a popular route for hardliners in controversial decisions — saving them from voting against their position without hurting their party’s chance of success.\n\nSpeaker Johnson tees up House vote\n\nJohnson teed up the vote on Trump’s sweeping tax bill. But before surrendering the microphone, the Louisiana Republican slammed Jeffries' record-breaking speech.\n\n\"Democrats deliver performances and Republicans deliver results,\" Johnson said.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the speaker teed up the roll call as a pivotal political moment for the country. \"In a few moments, we will remind the world why the American experiment still endures today and why its best days are still ahead of us,\" he said. Johnson ended his remarks shortly after 2:05 p.m. EDT and the House began 15-minute vote for final passage on Trump's second-term legislative agenda.\n\nJeffries wraps record-breaking speech\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, turned in a record-breaking House floor speech, speaking for more than eight-and-a-half hours.\n\nHe concluded by urging people to \"press on.\"\n\nAfter he wrapped, the Democrats gave him hugs, handshakes and high fives and chanted \"Hakeem! Hakeem!\"\n\nRepublicans then took the floor and immediately began poking fun at Jeffries' marathon speech.\n\n\"I'm from the 'Show Me' state,\" Rep. Jason Smith, R-Missouri, said on the floor after the speech. \"And what we just heard can be defined in one word: A bunch of hogwash.\"\n\nWhat was the scene like on the House floor?\n\nThe mood in the House was while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries trashed Trump’s sweeping tax bill during his floor remarks that started in the middle of the night.\n\nDemocrats seated behind Jeffries included Michigan Rep. Shri Thanedar, California Rep. Luz Rivas, and Arizona Rep. Yassamin Ansari. They had pursed lips and scrunched eyebrows while listening to their leader rail against the bill's tax cuts and Medicaid spending changes.\n\nSome were spotted scrolling on their phones. At times, Jeffries’ colleagues stood up and clapped at his remarks. Others shouted \"preach\" and \"take your time.\"\n\n\"You are the swamp,\" Jeffries said at one point addressing Republicans, who almost entirely skipped the Democratic leader's remarks.\n\nAbout 50 Democrats were present in the chamber. For the GOP, a few staffers and lawmakers were present, including South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman.\n\nVP JD Vance: Hakeem Jeffries’ speech flipped a GOP vote on the bill\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ marathon floor speech protesting Trump’s tax bill has not only moved Democrats. It’s moved Republicans too, according to Vice President JD Vance.\n\n\"GOP Congressman just texted me: 'I was undecided on the bill but then I watched Hakeem Jeffries performance and now I’m a firm yes,'\" Vance wrote on X, without specifying who the lawmaker was.\n\nRepublicans criticized Jeffries. \"When I listen to Hakeem Jeffries, it drives me bananas,\" Tennessee Republican Rep. Andy Ogles said on \"The Benny Show.\"\n\nJohnson told reporters of Jeffries, \"It takes a lot longer to build the lies than to tell the truth, so he's really spinning a long tale in there.\"\n\nWhen will the GOP tax and spending bill go into effect?\n\nThe nearly 900-page spending and tax bill covers a wide swath of government spending beyond Medicaid cuts and tax cuts, and there is a wide variation on when each provision goes into effect as well.\n\nMedicaid: Nationwide Medicaid work requirements take effect Jan. 1, 2027, shortly after the mid-term elections decide which party controls Congress.\n\nThe legislation requires \"able-bodied\" Medicaid recipients to work 80 hours a month or qualify for an exemption, such as being a student, caregiver or having a disability. The work requirement applies to parents of children older than 13.\n\nTax rates: The bill permanently extends the tax cuts introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which were set to expire this year. There should be not disruption in their application if the bill is signed.\n\nSALT: The cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, would lift to $40,000 starting in 2025. That benefit starts to phaseout for people who earn more than $500,000 of income. In 2030 the increased deduction ends and the $40,000 limit would revert to $10,000.\n\nTips and overtime: No tax on tips or overtime are promises Trump made on the campaign trail when he was running for a second term. Workers will be able to deduct up to $25,000 in tips and up to $25,000 in overtime, but the tax law change is temporary and ends Dec. 31, 2028, right before he leaves office.\n\nChild Tax Credit: Under current law, the maximum child tax credit is $2,000, which will revert to $1,000 after 2025 without changes from Congress. The GOP’s spending bill would permanently raise that maximum credit to $2,200 starting in 2025 and tie the amount to inflation going forward. There is no end date\n\nSocial Security tax deduction: Only some Social Security beneficiaries will be able to claim the deduction, which was also a promise Trump made on the campaign trail. This deduction is also temporary. It would last from 2025 to 2029.\n\nThe bill includes a temporary $6,000 deduction for seniors over the age of 65 and eliminates Social Security tax liability for seniors with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less or $150,000 if filing as a married couple.\n\nThe lowest-income seniors who already don’t pay taxes on Social Security, those who choose to claim their benefits before they reach age 65 and those above a defined income threshold could not claim the deduction. - Sarah D. Wire\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: ‘We have the votes’\n\nJohnson told reporters on July 3 that he expects Trump's major tax bill to make it through to final passage.\n\n\"We have the votes,\" the Louisiana Republican said.\n\nWith a razor-thin majority in the House, Johnson can only afford to lose three Republican votes. Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie has previously said he will oppose the bill.\n\nMembers of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus have also raised concerns about the legislation adding to the nation's deficit. But Johnson expressed confidence in the bill’s passage, saying he’s \"ready to roll.\"\n\nWhat does the GOP bill mean for Medicaid?\n\nThe GOP spending and tax bill would cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid, the state-federal health program for low-income families and disabled people. The bill is projected to eliminate insurance coverage for between 12 million and 20 million people over the next decade, according to two estimates.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office calculates that the bill would leave 11.8 million people uninsured by 2034. The Senate Joint Economic Committee Minority estimates that about 20 million people could lose coverage.\n\nMedicaid insures 83 million low-income children and adults, or more than 1 in 5 Americans, according to KFF, a health policy nonprofit. Medicaid funds 63% of nursing home facility residents, according to KFF.\n\nRepublicans say the $900 billion-a-year program was allowed to grow too large under Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden by adding nondisabled adults they say don't deserve government assistance, and they have long sought to scale it back. The expanded access has been in place for 13 years.\n\nPeople may not recognize that their coverage is at risk because in many states Medicaid goes by a local name. For example, California’s program is called Medi-Cal and Louisiana's Medicaid program is called Healthy Louisiana.\n\nThe funding cuts mean states will receive smaller Medicaid payments from the federal government.\n\nWhat Medicaid work requirements are in the bill?\n\nThe Trump tax bill imposes nationwide Medicaid work requirements that take effect Jan. 1, 2027, shortly after the mid-term elections decide which party controls the next Congress.\n\nThe legislation requires \"able-bodied\" Medicaid recipients to work 80 hours a month or qualify for an exemption, such as being a student, caregiver or having a disability. The work requirement applies to parents of children older than 13.\n\nThe bill would require states to check eligibility twice a year, rather than once. And states, which administer Medicaid, would have to set up systems to verify a person's employment or exemption status.\n\nThe work requirements mean states will have extra administrative duties of verifying an enrollee's work or volunteer status.\n\n‘MAGA is not happy,’ Trump warned Republican holdouts\n\nAs the House advanced the bill forward earlier on the morning of July 3, Trump applied pressure to conservative holdouts and expressed frustration with their stubbornness.\n\n\"FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!\" Trump said in a 12:45 a.m. ET post on Truth Social.\n\nA half-hour earlier, he wrote: \"Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy. What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT’S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!\"\n\nHakeem Jeffries slams Trump’s bill in ‘magic minute’ speech\n\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized Trump’s sweeping tax and domestic policy bill under a procedural tactic known as \"magic minute,\" which allows party leaders to have unlimited speaking time on the floor.\n\nJeffries' speech started shortly before 5 a.m., as the bill moved closer to passing the House.\n\n\"I rise today in strong opposition to Donald Trump’s disgusting abomination…that guts Medicaid, rips food from the mouths of children, seniors and veterans, and rewards billionaires with massive tax breaks,\" Jeffries said.\n\nHe condemned the cuts in spending for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the bill, arguing that the cost of living is too high.\n\n\"Cruelty should never be the objective or the outcome of legislation that we consider here in the House of Representatives,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/06/14/flag-day-history-and-how-to-best-celebrate-the-american-flag/84191102007/", "title": "Flag Day history and how to best celebrate the American flag", "text": "On June 14, we will not only be saluting the Army's 250th year with President Donald Trump's military parade in downtown Washington, D.C., we will also be celebrating America's symbol of freedom: the American flag.\n\nA flag resolution was adopted 248 years ago, on June 14, 1777, that said, \"Resolved: that the flag of the United States be made of 13 stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be 13 stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation,\" according to the Smithsonian.\n\nSince President Woodrow Wilson declared June 14 Flag Day in May 1916, the United States has honored the adoption of the stars and stripes in a number of ways, including carrying the flag in parades, displaying it outside homes and holding other patriotic events. Before 1916, a number of states and cities had started to observe the day.\n\nThough it's observed nationally, Flag Day is not a federal holiday. Pennsylvania recognizes it as a state holiday.\n\nMore than 100 years after the Continental Congress approved the flag, Flag Day was first observed in 1877. President Harry Truman established Flag Day as a national holiday in 1949.\n\nAmerica's flag throughout history\n\nThe 50 stars and 13 stripes that make up the U.S. flag will celebrate its 65 birthday on July 4. Hawaii became the 50th state in 1959, and on July 4, 1960, the flag's new design was officially adopted.\n\nUnable to view our graphics?

However, when the Congress of the Confederation chose red, white and blue for the Great Seal of the United States in 1782, the meanings were listed as:\n\nHow to properly display the American flag\n\nFlag etiquette has been in place for many years to ensure the flag is treated with respect. Congress established the U.S. Flag Code in 1942, which outlines standards for flag care and display.\n\nExcept in situations when there is imminent danger to life or property, the American flag should not be flown with the union down, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nA flag should never touch the ground.\n\nNo other flag may be flown above or to the right of the U.S. flag, except at United Nations headquarters.\n\nCitizens may fly the flag at any time but preferably from sunrise to sunset − except for special occasions or when well lighted.\n\nWhen a flag becomes unfit to fly, it should be destroyed with dignity.\n\nHow to properly fold the American flag\n\nA traditional triangular method is used to fold the American flag. According to the American Legion, the origins of the triangular fold are unknown, but some sources attribute it to the Gold Star Mothers of America or a chaplain stationed at the U.S. Air Force Academy.
