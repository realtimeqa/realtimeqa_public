The president is finally acting on the one issue that matters: BALLROOM!\n\nAll my life, I’ve been a single-issue voter, and that issue has been to find a president with the courage and good taste to rip apart some of the uggo White House and attach a 90,000-square-foot, gold-forward, glass-walled ballroom that overshadows the so-called People’s House.\n\nImages of the White House being demolished for a ballroom? Huzzah!\n\nWell, on Oct. 20, as construction workers used massive machines to violently demolish the East Wing facade, I finally felt seen. It was everything I had ever dreamed of, and more, like something out of a fairy tale: A historically ballroom-less building, long a central symbol of American democracy, was being torn asunder by a failed casino owner who previously promised the new construction would not impact the White House.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\n“It’ll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of,” Trump said in July.\n\nHah! Excellent dissembling, sir. Every great ballroom begins with a fantastic lie!\n\nHistorians, critics oppose Trump's ballroom, but what do they know of grandeur?\n\nBallroom-averse critics are predictably hollering about the construction.\n\nRobert Sutton, a former chief historian of the National Park Service, which stewards the White House and surrounding property, told the BBC that the agency has not reviewed the ballroom plans or vetted the architect.\n\n“This building is so important,” Sutton said. “It's considered, I think, to be the most important executive building in the world – yet we just don't know what's happening, and I think that's very inappropriate.”\n\nBooooooo! What’s happening is America is getting a marvelous new ballroom, and that’s all that matters.\n\nCosts are going up, and funding is murky. A perfect ballroom backstory!\n\nThe project is off to a perfect start, with The Washington Post reporting that “Trump originally estimated the project would cost $200 million to build but has since upped that to $250 million.” (All good ballrooms have dramatic price overruns.)\n\nThe president claims the ballroom is being funded entirely by donations, which I believe without evidence, as I’ve certainly never known Trump to lie or engage in dodgy backroom agreements. And besides, who cares? WE’RE GETTING A BALLROOM!\n\nFor so long, my dream has been for the White House to have a ballroom\n\nWhen I first walked past the White House at age 7, my parents had to comfort me as my eyes welled up with tears and I, unable to raise my voice above a whisper, asked: “Mummy and daddy, why is there no giant, gaudy ballroom?”\n\nSince that day, my vision ‒ the sun around which my political beliefs have orbited ‒ has been this: An exterior wall of the White House’s historic East Wing gets ripped to shreds by a twice-impeached convicted felon serving his second term in office, all to make way for a $250 million metaphor being built while the federal government is shut down and many workers aren’t getting paid. The construction will involve a sprawling ballroom with towering ceilings, gorgeous chandeliers, seating for 650 people and gold, gold and more gold! And it all happens without oversight by preservationists or a lick of input from the American people.\n\nFolks, my vision is becoming reality. America is getting a fantastic Trump-approved White House ballroom! What could be more important than that?\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on Bluesky at @rexhuppke.bsky.social and on Facebook at facebook.com/RexIsAJerk", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/22/what-is-east-wing-white-house/86836841007/", "title": "What is the East Wing of the White House? History of the space", "text": "President Donald Trump’s recent White House renovations are moving into the historical building’s East Wing.\n\nPhotos of a bulldozer tearing through the wing’s facade went viral on social media this week, sparking criticism from historical societies and some political figures.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the planned construction in an Oct. 21 open letter to the National Capital Planning Commission, the National Park Service and the Commission of Fine Arts\n\n\"We respectfully urge the administration and the National Park Service to pause demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes, including consultation and review by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, both of which have authority to review new construction at the White House, and to invite comments from the American people,\" the organization wrote.\n\nAs construction continues, here’s what to know about the East Wing of the White House.\n\nWhat is the East Wing of the White House?\n\nA large structure that originally began as a colonnaded terrace during President Thomas Jefferson’s administration, the East Wing has served as office space and has held a theater and a visitor’s entrance, according to an archive of the White House's website.\n\nWhite House visitors often entered through the White House’s east entrance and followed the East Colonnade past the former Rose Garden, which was renovated earlier this year, to enter the residence and see rooms on the Ground and State Floors.\n\nWhen was the East Wing built?\n\nThe modern version of the East Wing was added to the White House in 1942. The terrace that existed in Jefferson’s time was removed in 1866 and rebuilt on the foundation in 1902. Prior to 1942, a greenhouse occupied the east grounds of the White House, according to an archive of the White House’s website.\n\nIn 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt further developed the East Wing to house additional staff and offices, according to the White House Historical Association.\n\nThe construction was highly controversial at the time because it took place during World War II, the association’s website states. Republicans in Congress called the project \"wasteful,\" and some accused Roosevelt of \"using the project to bolster his presidency’s image.\"\n\nAccording to History.com, Roosevelt originally constructed the building to cover up an underground bunker that would protect the president and his staff from an enemy attack during World War II.\n\nWhere is the East Wing located?\n\nThe East Wing is connected to the main residence of the White House by a covered colonnade and projects eastward from the main building.\n\nWhat is the East Wing used for?\n\nAs of this year, the East Wing continued to serve as part of White House tours and had a gift shop. It had been the traditional location for the first lady’s offices until demolition began this week. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said the first lady's offices have been temporarily relocated.\n\nWhy is the East Wing being demolished?\n\nPart of the East Wing is being demolished to make way for a new $250 million White House ballroom. The ballroom will be a 90,000 square-foot addition to the White House, one of the biggest changes in decades. The White House has said the project is being privately funded, according to previous USA TODAY reporting.\n\nThe project \"will significantly increase the White House’s capacity to host major functions honoring world leaders, foreign nations, and other dignitaries,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nContributing: Janet Loehrke, USA TODAY\n\nMichelle Del Rey is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

No permits or reviews were needed.\n\nA second-generation real estate businessman, Trump explained that he was well-versed with the “brutal” process of getting zoning approvals but couldn’t believe his ears that he could move with such speed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n“I said, 'How long would it take? They said: ‘Sir, you can start tonight. You have zero zoning conditions. You have no approvals,'\" Trump said. \"I said, 'You gotta be kidding.' He said: 'Sir, this is the White House. You're the president of the United States. You can do anything you want.'\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to a question from USA TODAY seeking the identity of the two men, but his faith in them may come back to haunt him. It's already happening.\n\nTrump in July: Ballroom construction will not touch the East Wing\n\nWhen the White House first released plans for the ballroom July 31, Trump told reporters the 90,000-square-foot addition would be “built over on the east side and it will be beautiful.”\n\n“It'll have views of the Washington Monument. It won't interfere with the current building,” he said. “It'll be near it but not touching it and pay total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of.”\n\nLess than three months later, bulldozers had removed the entire East Wing of the White House. The construction was no longer \"near\" the part of the building that historically housed the first lady’s offices − as Trump had initially described the project.\n\nThe demolition was in full swing. So was the backlash.\n\nHillary Clinton: 'It's not his house. It's your house'\n\nOn Oct. 21, when pictures from the demolition site began circulating, a chorus of voices, including former first lady Hillary Clinton, expressed outrage as the nation’s preeminent historical structure stood gutted.\n\nClinton posted a picture of the torn-down facade with the caption on X: \"lt's not his house. It’s your house. And he’s destroying it.\"\n\nThe National Trust for Preservation urged the administration and the National Park Service to pause demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom “go through the legally required public review processes, including consultation and review by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts,” both of which it said have authority to review new construction at the White House.\n\nCarol Quillen, the National Trust's president and CEO, said in a letter to the National Capital Planning Commission, the National Park Service and the Commission of Fine Arts that the group acknowledges the utility of a larger White House footprint. But she said it remained concerned about the size of the building addition.\n\nThe 90,000 square feet of new construction “will overwhelm the White House itself,” which is 55,000 square feet, Quillen wrote, adding: “(The addition) may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings.\"\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, pointed to the timing of the project, which broke ground on Day 21 of the government shutdown that has left hundreds of thousands of people working without pay.\n\n“Oh you're trying to say the cost of living is skyrocketing?” Warren wrote on X. “Donald Trump can't hear you over the sound of bulldozers demolishing a wing of the White House to build a new grand ballroom.”\n\nTrump said the sound of construction was music to his ears.\n\nA Trump ballroom commences with 'no approvals'\n\nTrump said he had been advised that no reviews of the project were needed.\n\nBut White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said in a statement unveiling the project July 31 that the “president and the Trump White House are fully committed to working with the appropriate organizations to preserving the special history of the White House while building a beautiful ballroom that can be enjoyed by future Administrations and generations of Americans to come.”\n\nHer comment contrasts with a congressional aide familiar with the process who told USA TODAY that no reviews had been submitted to be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission, which provides building and zoning advice to Washington, DC, and approves various federal construction plans.\n\nAsked for a response, a White House official told USA TODAY that the National Capital Planning Commission does not have jurisdiction over demolition, only construction. Therefore, the official said, approval from the NCPC was not required or needed for demolition.\n\nAs for the construction, the White House will \"soon\" seek approval from the commission, the spokesperson told USA TODAY Oct.22.\n\nOn the question of why the facade had been demolished after the president had said the ballroom construction would not touch the East Wing, the official said the scope and size of the project was “always subject to vary” as the “process developed.”\n\n'Compliments of a man known as Donald J. Trump'\n\nTrump for years and across multiple administrations had pitched the idea for a ballroom. He also had always said he'd finance the project.\n\n\"Just inspected the site of the new Ballroom that will be built, compliments of a man known as Donald J. Trump, at the White House,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on June 6. \"For 150 years, Presidents, and many others, have wanted a beautiful Ballroom, but it never got built because nobody previously had any knowledge or experience in doing such things.\"\n\nBut that plan changed, too.\n\nIn the intervening months, Trump said private donors had lined up to pay for the $300 million project.\n\nAt the Oct. 15 dinner, Trump announced that the project had been fully financed. The donors included some of the biggest American corporations, including those in the defense and tech industries with business before the government.\n\nSome of them include Palantir, Lockheed Martin, Amazon, Google’s parent company Alphabet and Meta.\n\n“So many of you have been really, really generous,” Trump said to the donors at the dinner. “A couple of you, here saying, sir, would $25 million be appropriate? I said, ‘I will take it.’”\n\nThough the president may not be using taxpayer money for the project, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, criticized Trump's timing in the middle of a government shutdown.\n\n“His priorities are totally absurd. He should be negotiating with Democrats every single day until government is open and families are saved from financial ruin by extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” Murray said. “He’s focused on tearing down history to build a ballroom when millions of families will go uninsured.”\n\nNew details on the ballroom plans − bulletproof glass\n\nTrump has said for years that the East Room, the biggest room in the White House, was too cramped for large gatherings. Often, state dinners have been moved to outdoor tents to accommodate the guests.\n\n“When it rains, it's a disaster. And the tent's a hundred yards. That's more than a football field away from the main entrance,” he said on Oct.15. “It's not a pretty sight. The women with their lovely evening gowns, all of their hair all done and they're a mess by the time they get there.”\n\nWhen Trump recently paved over the lawn of the Rose Garden, he said he was doing it in the service of women whose high heels are known to get stuck in the mud.\n\nTrump has been on a renovation frenzy from the time he entered the White House for a second term in January.\n\nHe bathed the Oval Office in gold, added a \"Presidential Walk of Fame” display along the South Colonnade featuring portraits of past presidents, and proposed construction of an arch across from the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nAs for the ballroom plan, Trump has said glass on the building would be bulletproof. It would seat 999 people − big enough, he said, for a \"presidential inauguration.\"\n\nAnd the target date for completion? By January 2029, when Trump's second term in the White House will be over and the 48th president of the United States takes office.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

He said one of the East Room walls would be removed, calling it a \"knock out panel, and that goes right into the ballroom.\"\n\n\"Right on the other side you have a lot of construction going on,\" Trump said, adding: \"It just started today.\"\n\nTrump later posted on social media that the East Wing is \"being fully modernized as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete!\"\n\nThe East Wing dates to 1902 and \"has been renovated and changed many times, with a second story added in 1942,\" according to a White House press release from July announcing the new ballroom. It includes a formal entrance, offices on the first and second floor and an underground bomb shelter, according to the White House Historical Association. It traditionally has been the location of the first lady's office.\n\nA real-estate-developer-turned-president, Trump has quickly moved in his second term to put his stamp not just on policy, but on the physical landscape. He tore up to the White House Rose Garden to install a patio, overhauled the Oval Office with gold trimmings, put 88-foot-tall flagpoles on the north and south lawn of the White House and is working on a bathroom in the Lincoln Bedroom.\n\nFor years, Trump has been pushing for a ballroom in the White House that would accommodate large gatherings, such as state dinners. He has lamented the fact that many of the fancy affairs in the past were held in tents.

Do the Oval Office next | Opinion", "text": "Now that President Donald Trump is demolishing the entire East Wing of the White House – always the ugliest of the two wings, in my opinion – I hope he continues his aggressive historic de-preservation effort and launches a full-on American remodel.\n\nWe've now learned the giant ballroom Trump is building on the White House grounds, which he promised would be near the East Wing “but not touching it,” is actually going to replace the East Wing, which construction crews continued demolishing Oct. 22. It should be fully smashed to ruins by the weekend. That’s perfect, because who can afford an East AND a West Wing in this economy?\n\nThe $250 million ballroom, nearly twice the size of the White House itself, will be much more modest than some dated, fancy-schmancy “wing.”\n\nTrump has always been great at ruining things\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put it best on Oct. 21 when she said of Trump: “He is the builder-in-chief, in large part, he was elected back to this People's House because he is good at building things.”\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nExactly. Most people voted for Trump strictly for building purposes. So I say: Let the man cook.\n\nLet’s start with that ridiculous “oval” office he’s forced to use, something historians lamely call “the Oval Office.” Where are the bold, masculine corners? Why is there no place for President Trump to put the vice president, JD Vance, or members of his Cabinet when they don’t behave obsequiously enough?\n\nTrump needs to dispatch the wrecking ball and construction crews and make that stupid office square, something the American people will undoubtedly appreciate.\n\nThe Washington Monument is in desperate need of a little neon\n\nOnce that’s done, Trump should address the Washington Monument. That ridiculous obelisk is way too pointy, and the exterior marble is primo real estate for some signage. A little scaffolding and a grinder will help get the top rounded out. Then you put a little gold up there and add a neon Trump sign on each side to modernize the monument and fully embrace America’s not-optional Trump aesthetic.\n\nBy the way, as with the East Wing demolition and the ballroom project, there’s no need to get preapproval from the National Capital Planning Commission or any other place. Just start smashing and figure things out from there. What are they going to do, make Trump resharpen the Washington Monument? Hah!\n\nWhy should Abraham Lincoln get all that space for a monument?\n\nThe Lincoln Memorial, obviously, is eating up way too much space for just one guy. Trump could knock about 90% of that thing down and open up space for a food court (Eric Trump could run it) and a MAGA merch shop while still having plenty of room for a “God Bless America” Trump Tower Hotel and Casino.\n\nTrump is already planning to build an arch that resembles the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but he shouldn’t stop at Washington, DC. Up in New York City, the president needs to send construction barges to level the Statue of Liberty and replace it with something more modern and useful: A 300-foot statue of Donald Trump holding up a “TURN BACK!” sign.\n\nThis is why Americans put Trump in office, folks. He’s a builder. Our country’s historical sites are in desperate need of updating, except for the Confederate statues and monuments – those are precious and must be preserved.\n\nSo let’s allow the builder to tear stuff down and build!

Dismantling continued the next day when much of the East Wing was torn down.\n\nThe work contradicts Trump’s statement in July that the ballroom would not interfere with the current building. “It’ll be near it but not touching it,” he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nTrump's White House ballroom is something he’s always wanted, the centerpiece of what’s planned as the largest construction project for the executive mansion since the Harry Truman administration.\n\nTrump, in a post on social media, said the East Wing is \"being fully modernized as part of this process and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete.\"\n\nGround crews cut down trees and shrubs on the South Lawn in preparation in September for the $250 million, 90,000-square-foot expansion of the East Wing that will contain the White House Ballroom, a formal dining area for an estimated 999 people.\n\n“It’s going to be a beauty. It’ll be an absolutely magnificent structure,” Trump said on Sept. 13.\n\nThough project details have not been released, the ballroom itself is estimated at 25,000 square feet in size according to an analysis by Common Edge.\n\nWork is expected to be completed by the end of Trump’s second term in office in 2029.

The number of ballroom seats was put at 650.\n\nTrump said on Sept. 13 that the ballroom would be \"a little bigger\" than originally planned, with seating for 900 people instead. He later put the number at 999 people.\n\nThere are two dining rooms in the Executive Residence, both on the first floor, but not adjacent:\n\n◾State Dining Room: 140 guests.\n\n◾East Room: 200 guests.\n\nLarger White House gatherings of 300 to 400 people were held in elaborate tents on the South Lawn.\n\nHave there been previous renovations at the White House?\n\nYes.

For the latest news on Hurricane Erin, visit USA TODAY's coverage for Wednesday, Aug. 20.\n\nHurricane Erin slowly moved northward on Tuesday, triggering rough surf and dangerous rip currents along the East Coast that have already resulted in dozens of water rescues, swimming bans, and beach closures across the region.\n\nHundreds of thousands of beachgoing tourists were keeping a watchful eye on the massive hurricane as Erin was expected to produce life-threatening conditions for the Atlantic Coast from central Florida to Canada. The National Hurricane Center urged beachgoers in those areas to follow advice from lifeguards, local authorities, and beach warning flags.\n\nEvacuations were underway along parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks, a big draw for vacationers every summer. North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein declared a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon \"to assist with the response and to mobilize resources.\"\n\nWith Erin's predicted storm surge and waves of over 10 feet, the National Weather Service advised people in the Outer Banks to stay out of the ocean to avoid deadly surf conditions expected through at least Thursday. Tropical storm conditions were forecast to arrive by Wednesday evening or night, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\"The storm surge will be accompanied by large waves, leading to significant beach erosion and overwash, making some roads impassible,\" the hurricane center said in its key messages at 11 p.m. ET.\n\nTropical storm conditions were also possible along the southeastern coast of Virginia — where a tropical storm watch was in effect — on Thursday, according to the hurricane center. The agency advised interests in the mid-Atlantic and southern New England coasts to monitor the progress of Erin due to potential strong winds on Thursday and Friday.\n\nErin was downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane earlier Tuesday but remained powerful, driving sustained winds of 100 mph by late night. Erin was moving north-northwest at nearly 12 mph, the National Hurricane Center said in an 11 p.m. ET advisory.\n\nThe storm appeared to be making the long-forecast, slow cruise northward hundreds of miles offshore − and no U.S. landfall was forecast. Still, Erin's large and expanding wind fields mean storm-driven waves, coastal erosion, and high seas are expected to batter areas of the coast, especially along the Outer Banks, the barrier islands that fringe the coast of North Carolina.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Bermuda's weather service issued a tropical storm watch for the archipelago, which has seven main islands and a total population of 65,000.\n\n∎ Winds with tropical-storm force from Erin will probably extend outward more than 230 miles from its center, AccuWeather said. According to the outlet, wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph could impact parts of the mid-Atlantic and even southeastern Massachusetts as the storm heads north later in the week.\n\n∎ The National Weather Service office in the Baltimore/Washington area has issued advisories that include a coastal flood warning for Annapolis, Maryland, where flooding is expected within 36 hours.\n\nBeach closures along the East Coast\n\nVacationers at beaches were forced to forgo the final days of summer sand due to swimming bans and beach closures in North Carolina, parts of New Jersey, Delaware, and New York City, as high waves and rip currents whipped up the surf.\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams said all the city's beaches will be closed for swimming on Wednesday and Thursday \"due to dangerous riptides from Hurricane Erin.\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy urged visitors and residents to avoid wading or swimming in the ocean, citing the dangerous rip currents and high waves.\n\nOn Tuesday, officials in Cape May, Ocean City, and Longport ordered beachgoers to stay out of the water altogether. The ocean was largely off limits in beach towns that included Atlantic City and Ventnor.\n\n\"Conditions are deadly,\" Ocean City's Beach Patrol said in a Facebook post. \"Do not enter the ocean until further notice.\"\n\n'Window to safely evacuate is closing quickly'\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, officials in Dare County warned that roads, including the main exit route, could soon be overwhelmed by water. In neighboring Hyde County, a mandatory evacuation order went into effect Tuesday for Ocracoke Island.\n\n\"Dare County remains under a State of Emergency and a Mandatory Evacuation order is in effect for Hatteras Island,\" the county posted on social media. \"Please note that N.C. Hwy. 12 may be impassable by August 19 at 5 p.m.\"\n\nThe villages under the evacuation order include Rodanthe, Waves, Salvo, Avon, Buxton, Frisco, and Hatteras. County officials urged residents to immediately evacuate, warning that the \"window to safely evacuate is closing quickly, as coastal flooding and overwash is already beginning to occur along vulnerable stretches of N.C. Highway 12—and is expected to continue to worsen with the approach of today’s high tide.\"\n\nCounty officials noted that once coastal flooding begins, inundation will persist for several days and will worsen with each high tide. Though the most severe impacts from the storm are expected on Hatteras Island, county officials advised residents and visitors north of Oregon Inlet to remain alert.\n\nNWS warns of submerged cars, dangerous surf for Outer Banks\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Newport/Morehead, which provides forecasts for the Outer Banks, has spared no effort in alerting residents and visitors about the incoming danger from Erin.\n\nIn addition to showing a portion of the crucial Highway 12 in Buxton already starting to flood two hours before high tide on Tuesday, the office is warning that the storm's impacts will be prolonged, with some roads being impassable or inaccessible for days. \"Vehicles will likely be submerged,\" the weather service said.\n\nThe office also predicted a storm surge of up to 3 feet and said waves in the surf zone could reach 15 to 20-plus feet, likely causing severe damage.\n\n\"Despite the path of Erin forecast to remain offshore, the threat for life-threatening rip currents, damaging beach erosion, major coastal flooding and overwash, and extremely dangerous surf is expected,'' the weather service said in a situational overview Tuesday shortly after 5 p.m. ET.\n\nErin expected to grow\n\nAt 8 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Erin was about 585 miles southwest of Bermuda and 570 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras. The center of Erin was forecast to pass to the east of the Bahamas on Tuesday and then move over the western Atlantic between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nA tropical storm watch was extended north to Chincoteague, an island off the Virginia coast.\n\nA storm surge warning was issued for the Outer Banks from Cape Lookout to Duck, meaning there's a danger of life-threatening rising water moving inland from the coastline during the next 36 hours. A tropical storm warning is also in effect from Beaufort Inlet to Duck.\n\n\"Erin forecast to substantially grow in size while moving over the western Atlantic through the week,\" National Hurricane Center meteorologist Robbie Berg wrote in a public advisory. \"Dangerous rip currents expected along U.S. East Coast beaches.\"\n\nErin's strength could still fluctuate before it finally begins to wind down later in the week, according to the center's forecast.\n\nScores of swimmers rescued\n\nLifeguards have rescued dozens of people from the churning waters along East Coast beaches even as Hurricane Erin remains hundreds of miles offshore. Officials in North Carolina said at least 60 people had to be rescued from rip currents at Wrightsville Beach, prompting a no-swim order in place through the rest of the week, according to reporting from the Wilmington Star-News, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nAnother person was rescued from rip currents at a South Carolina beach, and a dozen rip currents were reported at South Carolina and Georgia beaches on Aug. 18, the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina, said.\n\nThe threat exists up and down the entire East Coast, hurricane forecasters said. Beaches as far north as Massachusetts are closed to swimmers due to rough surf. In Atlantic City, New Jersey, officials said beachgoers were restricted to getting knee-deep into the water and were prohibited from using boogie boards. Read more here.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nDozens rescued from rip currents as Hurricane Erin brings danger to East Coast beaches\n\nOuter Banks at risk\n\nTropical storm and storm surge watches were in effect for parts of the Outer Banks and coastal North Carolina, which means tropical storm winds and higher-than-normal sea levels are possible. The hurricane center warned that storm surge could cause the water to rise 2 to 4 feet above dry ground along the Outer Banks as Erin pushes northward.\n\nSome roads could remain impassable in several locations for several days. Dare County announced that transportation was available on Tuesday to a shelter in Warren County.\n\n\"Individuals evacuating on the buses need to bring clothing and medications for 7 days,\" the county said in a statement. It said shelters are available for dogs and cats and that owners can transport these pets on the buses.\n\nDare County has a permanent population of about 37,000, but the population balloons from June through August to about 225,000 to 300,000, according to the county's website.\n\nThe county said several Facebook accounts were sharing misinformation surrounding Hurricane Erin. \"The Town of Kill Devil Hills truly said it best: \"Misinformation spreads quicker than storms,'\" the county said on social media.\n\n\"The photos shown here are examples of false, AI-generated images and videos that have been circulating,\" the post warned. \"Stay informed by following trusted sources for information.\"\n\nTwo tropical systems lurk in the Atlantic\n\nHurricane Erin is the current concern of meteorologists, and not the only one.\n\nForecasters are monitoring two tropical systems in the Atlantic − one in the central part of the ocean, the other off the coast of Africa − and gauging whether they could develop into a named storm. If so, the next one will be called Fernand.\n\nAt this point, neither disturbance appears to be a threat to land, though the National Hurricane Center gives the one farther west a 60% chance of developing.\n\nThe hurricane season, which began June 1, has yet to reach its midpoint, so plenty more activity is expected before the season's closure at the end of November.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nSome fishing excursions put on hold in New Jersey\n\nIn Asbury Park, New Jersey, boats were tied up and fishing trips were being canceled or delayed this week. Erin's swell could see waves build to 22 feet in the underwater Hudson canyon that sprawls for hundreds of miles along the shores of New Jersey and New York, forecasters said.\n\nThe timing isn't good − the mid-Atlantic fishing competition was scheduled to run from Aug. 17 to Aug. 21 with over $3.2 million in cash payouts at stake. The event kicked off amid much fanfare in Cape May, New Jersey, and Ocean City, Maryland. For the safety of tournament participants, staff, sponsors, and venues, the competition directors announced that the competition will run an extra day, through Saturday.\n\n\"Tournament staff have been closely monitoring all aspects and impacts the storm would have on the event,\" a statement on the competition's website said. \"We take date changes very seriously, but don’t see any way to avoid it under these exceptional circumstances.\"\n\n− Dan Radel, Asbury Park Press\n\n'Not going to be a safe environment to be in the ocean'\n\nDangerous conditions in the surf zone with large, breaking waves are forecast from East Central Florida to Canada's Atlantic Coast beginning Tuesday, Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan has warned. Brennan is pleading with U.S. residents to take Erin's potential coastal impacts seriously, even though the nation will be spared a direct landfall.\n\nOffshore wave heights could exceed 20 to 30 feet.\n\nHigh tides are also expected to bring higher-than-normal water levels further southward along the coast, the weather service has warned.\n\n\"It's not going to be a safe environment to be in the ocean,\" Brennan said, adding that even when the weather may be pleasant on shore, dangerous and possibly life-threatening rip currents could be lurking in the water.\n\nBecause of its slow movement, coastal areas of North Carolina are expected to feel the brunt of the ocean's impacts for several days, according to the weather service office in Newport/Morehead City. Mandatory evacuations were issued Aug. 18 for Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island.\n\nWhat's next behind Hurricane Erin?\n\nFollowing behind Erin is yet another tropical wave that's given a 60% chance of becoming a tropical storm over the next seven days, the hurricane center said. A third disturbance just moved off the West African coast, but it's expected to encounter hostile conditions that may limit its further development.\n\nWhen did Hurricane Erin form?\n\nErin formed on Aug. 11 from a tropical wave that moved across the Cabo Verde Islands. By Aug. 15, it was a hurricane and quickly joined the ranks of the fastest intensifying hurricanes in Atlantic history, increasing its winds by 85 mph in about 21 hours.\n\nIt has mostly spared the islands along the Eastern Caribbean but soaked Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and portions of the Southeastern Bahamas with up to 8 inches of rain. Its winds caused widespread power outages in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\nDoes a Category 5 hurricane say anything about the rest of the season?\n\nThough the Atlantic hurricane season that started June 1 is forecast to be more active than normal, Dan Brown, branch chief of the center's hurricane specialists, said that Erin's formation has no bearing on what may happen later in the season.\n\nAnd Levi Silvers, a research scientist at Colorado State University, pointed out that it only takes one intense landfalling hurricane to make it a disastrous season.\n\nContributing: Lori Comstock, NorthJersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2024/08/01/invest-97l-spaghetti-models-gulf-coast/74633466007/", "title": "Invest 97L spaghetti models show Gulf Coast paths", "text": "The National Hurricane Center has designated a tropical wave traveling toward the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas and Florida as Invest 97L, and forecasters are already chiming the alarms for Gulf Coast residents.\n\nThursday afternoon, the NHC increased the chances that Invest 97L could develop within the next 48 hours to 30%, with the chance it could develop over the next seven days remaining at 70%.\n\nNHC forecasters say the tropical wave could develop this weekend or early next week over the eastern Gulf of Mexico or near the Florida peninsula, with some of the first spaghetti models backing up the claim.\n\nTropics update in 60 seconds: How could tropical wave affect Florida? Everything you need to know in less than a minute\n\nEarly spaghetti models show Invest 97L moving into the Gulf of Mexico, where the lack of steering currents means it could rapidly gain strength before making its way toward land − where that would be is still anyone's guess.\n\n\"The latest models show it going into the eastern Gulf and then exploding there,\" said AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Expert Paul Pastelok. \"Residents from Louisiana to Florida's West Coast have to be ready in case it rapidly intensifies.\"\n\nIf Invest 97L continues to develop and reaches sustained wind speeds of 39 mph, it would become Tropical Storm Debby, marking the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nLatest tropics update\n\nInvest 97L is currently producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the Southeastern Bahamas and the adjacent waters of the southwestern Atlantic and northeastern Caribbean Sea.\n\nThe system is expected to develop slowly over the next day or so while it moves northwest over portions of the Greater Antilles, according to the latest NHC advisory.\n\nEnvironmental conditions are conducive for the development of Invest 97L after it passees the Greater Antilles. The NHC believes it could form a tropical depression over the eastern Gulf of Mexico near the Florida peninsula this weekend or early next week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the tropical rainstorm stretched across a few hundred miles and lacks a well-defined center, which is a characteristic typical of most tropical depressions and tropical storms.\n\nThe tropical rainstorm, a term AccuWeather is using to help raise public awareness, is near the northern Caribbean. The system has continued to become more organized.\n\nInvest 97L began showing notable signs that a center of circulation was starting to form along the northern coast of Hispaniola on Thursday, according to AccuWeather. The tropical wave lacks strong winds as of now.\n\n\"A storm center that remains over or close to the large, mountainous islands of the northern Caribbean from Puerto Rico to Hispaniola and Cuba will tend to keep strengthening at bay,\" AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said, adding, \"If the center forms or drifts away from the large islands, then more swift strengthening may be possible.\"\n\nRecent changes to the way the NHC presents its tropical outlook map may confuse some people. Right now, the orange area represents where a tropical cyclone could develop; it's not an indicator of where the storm will travel.\n\nFormation chance through 48 hours: low, 30 percent.\n\nFormation chance through 7 days: high, 70 percent.\n\nWill Invest 97L become a tropical depression, Tropical Storm Debby?\n\nWe are in the wait-and-see phase at the moment. Invest 97L is still disorganized, producing a large area of showers and thunderstorms over Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the adjacent waters of the southwestern Atlantic and northeastern Caribbean Sea.\n\nForecasters will have a better idea of how the tropical wave will develop over the next few days.\n\nHowever, environmental conditions are forecast to be more conducive for development after the wave passes the Greater Antilles, and a tropical depression could form this weekend or early next week over the eastern Gulf of Mexico or near the Florida Peninsula.\n\nResidents in the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Florida should monitor the progress of this system.\n\nInvest 97L spaghetti models\n\nWill Invest 97L impact Florida?\n\n\"Downpours and gusty thunderstorms will spread westward across Cuba and the western islands of the Bahamas on Friday before spreading over the Florida Keys and the southern part of the Florida Peninsula on Saturday.\n\n\"Along with the potential for urban flooding will be the risk of waterspouts and hazards for beach and boating interests, at the very least,\" AccuWeather said.\n\n\"As the system approaches and begins to strengthen, rip currents will increase in strength and number along the Florida coastline this weekend.\n\n\"Should the storm stay east of Florida, the rough surf conditions will spread northward along the Atlantic coast. If the center migrates farther to the northwest, then surf conditions will build along the Gulf Coast.\"\n\nHow will Invest 97L impact the Gulf Coast?\n\n\"The latest models show it going into the eastern Gulf and then exploding there,\" said AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Expert Paul Pastelok.\n\n\"There is low steering flow in the eastern Gulf so once it gets there, it's kind of stuck and over warm water, it can intensify. At this point, it can go almost anywhere. There's just nothing in the Gulf to steer it and there's very concerning.\n\n\"I don't trust it and don't like it. Residents from Louisiana to Florida's West Coast and Panhandle have to be ready in case it rapidly intensifies. And if it sits there (in the Gulf) it can intensify. The slower it moves, the stronger it can become.\"\n\nPastelok said forecasters will have a better idea of what will happen once the invest moves through the Caribbean islands and mountains, which could slow development and organization.\n\n\"Sunday, it could blow up in the eastern Gulf.\"\n\nMeteorologists have also warned that the impending tropical wave will begin churning waters in the Gulf of Mexico, which will produce stronger rip currents at a greater frequency as it approaches.\n\nWhat is a tropical wave?\n\nAt its simplest, a tropical wave is an elongated area of clouds and thunderstorms that typically move from east to west. It's also known as an easterly wave, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nDiving a little deeper, a tropical wave is an area of low pressure in the atmosphere that moves west across the Atlantic basin, which includes the northern Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWant even more?

For the latest news, view our live updates file for Thursday, Oct. 3.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. − President Joe Biden traveled to the Carolinas on a Wednesday tour to survey devastation from Hurricane Helene as residents across much of the Southeast press on with the arduous task of rebuilding their shattered communities, homes and lives.\n\nBiden visited Greenville, South Carolina, and later got an aerial view of the extensive damage in Asheville, North Carolina. Vice President Kamala Harris also made a trip to a highly impacted state, meeting with local officials and first responders in Augusta, Georgia.\n\n\"I'm here to say the United States – the nation – has your back,'' Biden said at an emergency command center in Raleigh alongside North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. \"We're not leaving until you're back on your feet completely.\"\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Biden had approved the deployment of up to 1,000 active-duty U.S. soldiers to reinforce North Carolina National Guard members assisting recovery efforts in the state.\n\nThe death toll across the Southeast was 181 as of 10 p.m. ET Wednesday, based on state and local reports. Local authorities said they expect the total to rise. Buncombe County, home to Asheville, has reported 57 deaths.\n\nWater authorities warned that potable running water could be weeks away in some areas. Duke Energy said its round-the-clock power-restoration efforts had resolved more than 1.6 million customer outages in the Carolinas. Still, almost 900,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the two states Wednesday; another 450,000 were dark in Florida, Georgia, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nHurricane Helene crashed ashore along Florida's Big Bend as a Category 4 monster late Thursday. Its winds died down after landfall, but the unrelenting rains overwhelmed a wide swath of the already-saturated Southeast. Flash flooding from creeks and rivers destroyed homes and businesses, collapsed roads and ripped victims from their families.\n\nAs the waters receded, the damage to infrastructure grew more apparent.\n\n\"We are starting to see some of this damage,\" Duke Energy spokesman Bill Norton wrote on social media. \"We had entire substations that were under water.\"\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the regional cleanup would be a \"multibillion-dollar undertaking\" and take years to complete.\n\n∎ USA TODAY published a map of resources in the Asheville area that shows where residents can find shelter, water, food and more. The tool is available here.\n\nHarris visits Georgia, will also travel to NC\n\nHarris visited the Augusta Emergency Operations Center in Georgia, where she thanked officials and emergency personnel for their work in the state's recovery from the impacts of Hurricane Helene. She also consoled residents of a neighborhood that had toppled trees and debris on the road.\n\n\"It is particularly devastating in terms of the loss of life that this community has experienced, the loss of normalcy and the loss of critical resources,\" said Harris, who is cutting short her campaign schedule as the Democratic presidential nominee to travel to some of the heavily affected states.\n\nHarris spoke Tuesday with Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer and plans to visit North Carolina in the coming days to view the damage, provide updates on federal response and meet with members of affected communities, the White House said.\n\n\"I've been reading and hearing about the work you've been doing over the last few days,'' Harris told officials in Augusta, \"and I think it really does represent some of the best of what we each know can be done, especially when we coordinate around local, state, federal resources to meet the needs of people who must be seen, who must be heard.\"\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nTennessee company draws probe after workers die in flood\n\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation opened an inquiry into a plastics manufacturer in Erwin where several workers were swept away by floodwaters from Helene, the Knoxville News Sentinel has learned.\n\nTwo women in the group died, an immigrant advocacy group for workers' families said. At least three people are missing. Employees of Impact Plastics have alleged management didn’t allow workers to leave the factory even as warnings were issued and floodwaters from the Nolichucky River began to swamp the building. The company denies the claim.\n\nThe bureau confirmed to The News Sentinel – known as Knox News, part of the USA TODAY Network − that District Attorney Steve Finney requested an investigation involving the company but provided no details. Read more here.\n\n− Tyler Whetstone, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nWater everywhere, but not to drink\n\nAccess to safe potable water remains a top concern in western North Carolina, where about 200,000 of the 1 million residents either had no water or low system pressure Wednesday, Reuters reported. In addition, more than 1.1 million customers were still without power in the Carolinas and Georgia as of 6 p.m. ET, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nThe municipal water supply system in Asheville, which serves more than 150,000 residents, was so badly damaged by the storm that Assistant City Manager Ben Woody said it would take weeks before it can pump out water. For now, those who are getting water are advised to boil it. .\n\nWater distribution sites have been set up at several locations in ravaged Buncombe County, home to Asheville, with supplies provided in a combined effort by local, state and federal officials. But the lack of running water presents a major obstacle to returning to any semblance of normalcy, such as reopening schools.\n\n\"The biggest concern for getting students back to school is water,\" Asheville City Schools Superintendent Maggie Fehrman said at a news conference Wednesday. \"Without water, we just simply cannot bring students back or staff back into our building.\"\n\nCDC offers tips for avoiding post-hurricane dangers\n\nSome of the less-obvious dangers from a hurricane can linger long after the winds have died down. They include mold and risk of infection from stagnant floodwater, which can have bacteria from overflowing sewage and agricultural and industrial waste, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Here are the CDC's tips for addressing hazards left behind by large storms:\n\nIf you do come in contact with floodwater: Wash the area with soap and clean water as soon as possible. If soap and water aren't available, use alcohol-based wipes or sanitizer. Take care of wounds and seek medical attention if needed. Wash clothes contaminated with flood or sewage water in hot water and detergent before wearing them again.\n\nWash the area with soap and clean water as soon as possible.

Wash clothes contaminated with flood or sewage water in hot water and detergent before wearing them again. If you can’t disinfect: Remove and discard items such as mattresses, carpets, rugs, baby toys and most paper products. The same goes for drywall and insulation.\n\nRemove and discard items such as mattresses, carpets, rugs, baby toys and most paper products. The same goes for drywall and insulation. Water and food: Tap water may not be safe, the CDC said. With water you suspect is contaminated, do not use it to wash dishes, brush your teeth, prepare food (including baby formula), wash your hands or make ice. Instead, use bottled, boiled or treated water. Throw away food that may have come in contact with flood or storm water.\n\nTap water may not be safe, the CDC said.

Power outages: When possible, use battery-powered flashlights or lanterns instead of candles, gas lanterns or torches to reduce fire risk. Poisoning deaths from exposure to carbon monoxide tend to increase after natural disasters like hurricanes, and the CDC said they're already on the rise after Helene. Never use a generator, pressure washer or any gas-powered engine inside a home or garage, or less than 20 feet from a door, window or vent. Such equipment emits carbon monoxide, which is odorless and colorless and can be fatal.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nHow to signal you're OK from disaster area\n\nRelatives and friends of those in areas impacted by natural disasters often become anguished when they can't confirm whether their loved ones in those locations are safe.\n\nHurricane Helene disrupted power and communications in large swaths of the Southeast, and many communities are still disconnected from the outside world. In some places where internet access is back, power is still out, preventing residents from charging their phones and computers.\n\nBut for people in affected areas with even fleeting cellular or WiFi connections, there are ways to signal they're all right, whether it's by indicating so through their voicemail greeting or on Facebook, Instagram or X postings.\n\nRead more here\n\nBiden sending troops to aid recovery in North Carolina\n\nThe soldiers Biden approved being deployed to North Carolina have the manpower and logistical capabilities to \"get this vital job done, and fast,\" the president said in a statement.\n\n\"These soldiers will speed up the delivery of life-saving supplies of food, water and medicine to isolated communities in North Carolina,\" Biden said.\n\nThe North Carolina Air National Guard said Wednesday that it had delivered over 100,000 pounds of food, water and other critical supplies for Helene victims, part of a coordinated relief effort with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Over 760 North Carolina Guard soldiers and airmen have been assisting with hurricane relief efforts by air and ground, conducting search and rescue missions, delivering supplies and clearing roads.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nNo rest for weary: October historically active for hurricanes\n\nHelene's deadly and devastating rampage across the Southeast last week has eliminated any hope of a quiet hurricane season for the U.S. There is still plenty of the season left − it runs through November − and \"October is historically an active month, particularly in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and off the U.S. Southeast coast,\" said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane research scientist at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School. It doesn't take a strong hurricane to cause a lot of damage, McNoldy said.\n\n\"A slow-moving disorganized disturbance that maybe doesn't quite become a tropical storm can unleash feet of rain over an area and create terrible flash flooding,\" he said. Rainfall concerns, he added, have historically \"taken a back seat to the wind threat in people's minds, despite being deadlier.\" Read more here.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nMiracles in the mud: The search for lost loved ones\n\nA son who journeyed 11 miles into the Blue Ridge Mountains to locate his parents.

Grandpa's gone.' And he was washed away.\"\n\nMoms 'jump into overdrive' to help\n\nIn the mountains of western North Carolina − one of the areas hit hardest by Hurricane Helene − mothers are doing what they do best: taking care of others. Local Facebook groups, previously filled with weekend activity recommendations and hand-me-down clothes offerings, are now swamped with moms ready to go to great lengths to help one another − even while in dire need themselves.\n\nThey're sharing formula and baby wipes. They're giving away their kids' books and toys. They're offering cribs, mattresses, meals. One mom even offered her frozen breast milk. Kate Patterson, the mother of two young children, has spent the past few days going door-to-door, conducting wellness checks on people living in remote, rural areas around Boone.\n\n\"You just see the need, and you do it,\" she said. \"There's no sitting around waiting.

For the latest news on Hurricane Gilma, view USA TODAY's story for Tuesday, Aug. 27.\n\nHONOLULU − Residents across Hawaii are taking steps to prepare for the potential impacts of back-to-back hurricanes, as Hone was exiting Monday and Gilma slowly approached from the eastern Pacific.\n\nIn Lower Puna, just south of Hilo in the Big Island, Laurie Lyon-Makaimoku and her family took the tarps off their outdoor garage structure and pulled out their camping stove and propane tank. They also picked avocados and breadfruit from the trees on their property in anticipation of Gilma's gusty winds.\n\n“We got a ton of rain,” she told USA TODAY. “Sunday afternoon, everything started settling down, but it was raining all day Friday. We were doing our storm prep in the rain. But the worst of it was on Saturday.”\n\nHone strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane as it crossed south of the Big Island early Sunday, dumping over a foot of rain across portions of the island and up to 18 inches in some areas. Some major roads flooded, waterways swelled and thousands of homes and businesses lost power, but there were no reports of major damage. By night, Hone had weakened into a tropical storm as it pushed to the west of the Hawaiian islands.\n\nHurricane Gilma tracker: See latest details, projected path of storm in Pacific\n\nSeveral beaches across the Big Island were closed Monday and five public schools canceled classes because of power outages and dangerous road conditions, the Hawaii County website said. The school where Lyon-Makaimoku's children attend shut down Monday after a tree fell and took out power on the main campus.\n\n\"We are moving into the recovery stage,\" Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth said in a Facebook livestream Sunday afternoon. He said emergency crews will inspect damage across the island this week as linemen restore power and authorities begin preparations for Hurricane Gilma. Blackouts were down to just 2,000 across the state by midmorning, according to poweroutage.us.\n\n\"Gilma is coming so ... even through we're done with this one, it's good to start preparing for the next one,\" Roth said.\n\n'The tropics are broken': So where are all the Atlantic hurricanes?\n\nHurricane Gilma forecast to swipe the Hawaiian islands\n\nWhile Tropical Storm Hone continued moving away from the Big Island of Hawaii, forecasters and local officials are keeping a close eye on Hurricane Gilma.\n\nGilma, still more than 1,100 miles east of Hilo in the Big Island, is forecast to bring showers, thunderstorms and gusty winds to the state later this week. As of 11 a.m. Hawaii time, the storm's sustained winds had increased to 110 mph, making it a Category 2 storm just on the edge of a major hurricane.\n\nForecasters project the storm will pass just north of the Hawaiian islands and they stressed that Gilma's impacts will depend greatly on how close it comes to the state. On its current track, Gilma is expected to lose strength and be downgraded to a tropical depression in the latter half of the week, AccuWeather said.\n\n\"The combination of both tropical cyclones will likely bring an extended period of rough seas and surf to the islands, which will pose dangers to boarders, swimmers and small craft,\" AccuWeather said, referring to Hone and Gilma.\n\nLesser impacts in Oahu, but mindset has changed\n\nIn Oahu, the most populous of the Hawaiian islands and home to Honolulu, Kulana Cannon didn’t lose power but experienced strong winds, prompting her family to clear and secure everything in their yard.\n\n“We're feeling like we did as much preparation as we could,” she said. “Not to say it’s a normal thing, but it kind of is for Hawaii – there’s always a season for hurricanes.''\n\nOahu is located more than 130 miles northwest of the Big Island, which took the brunt of Hone's impact. Though Oahu wasn't in the direct path of the storm, lessons from last August's tragedy in Maui, where strong winds from Hurricane Dora fueled the devastating fires that leveled the town of Lahaina, now permeate the mindset.\n\n\"With what happened last year with Maui,'' Cannon said, \"it makes it more urgent, just to take it more seriously than normal day-to-day hurricane weather.”\n\nAs Pacific spins out storms, Atlantic stays quiet\n\nAlmost halfway through the hurricane season, the Pacific has churned out more named storms than the Atlantic, 9-5. Not only that, there are currently three such storms spinning in the Pacific − Hone, Gilda and Hector − which is three more than the Atlantic has produced since Aug. 20 or figures to pump out over the next week.\n\nThat runs counter to the norm, and is far from what forecasters envisioned when they warned of a hyperactive hurricane season in the Atlantic this year. The warm ocean water hurricanes need to fuel them is not where the storms are developing at this point.\n\n\"The Atlantic tropics are broken – for now,\" meteorologist Ryan Maue said on the X platform, adding that developing storms near Africa are encountering at least one problem: \"Ocean temperatures at this latitude are way too cool to sustain a rain shower.\"\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nWhere is Tropical Storm Hone?\n\nTropical Storm Hone was located 280 miles west-southwest of Honolulu and 240 miles southwest of Lihue, Hawaii, late Monday morning, according to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu.\n\nThe storm had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and its tropical force winds extended outward 90 miles from its center. Churning west at 13 mph, the storm is forecast to continue moving away from Hawaii and weaken in the coming days, the hurricane center said.\n\nBack-to-back storms passing near Hawaii is extremely rare, experts say\n\nIf Hurricane Gilma lashes Hawaii by Sunday, it will be the first time in over 30 years that two named storms passed within 300 miles of the state within a week.\n\nThe last time back-to-back named storms hit the islands was in September 1992 when Hurricane Iniki, the most powerful storm to directly hit Hawaii, was followed three days later by tropical depression Orlene, according to AccuWeather.\n\nStorm systems don't need to barrel directly over Hawaii to wreak havoc. Last year, Hurricane Dora fanned the deadliest wildfires in the U.S. in over a century.\n\nForecasters had worried Hone's winds could replicate Dora's impact, especially as swaths of the islands suffer relentless drought conditions, but the storm brought enough rain to quell fears and canceled wildfire warnings for portions of Hawaii's Big Island.\n\nHurricane Hone's havoc hovers over Hilo on Sunday\n\nThe hurricane didn’t just affect residents – travel to and around the islands was also disrupted over the weekend.\n\nHigh winds from Hurricane Hone canceled all flights to and from Hilo International Airport on Sunday and some on Saturday. Flights resumed to normal on Monday with extra flights added to accommodate the stranded travelers.\n\nAs of Sunday morning, the Hawaiian Tourism Authority assured travelers it was still safe to visit the islands despite Gilma being expected make landfall by Wednesday morning with more gusty winds and rainfall as a tropical depression.\n\n“We are not advising visitors to cancel their trips,” the organization announced in a media alert.\n\nSome visitors continued their trip to Hawaii as planned, encountering only minor disruptions, such as less-than-ideal beach weather.\n\n“As far as Oahu goes, I don't think anything got affected except really high winds… and consistent rainfall but we’re out of the heart of the storm and luckily, we didn’t get affected like Big Island,” said Colt Shaw, who arrived in Honolulu from Los Angeles on Saturday evening.\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\nTropical Storm Hector expected to strengthen in the eastern Pacific\n\nTo the east of Hurricane Gilma is Tropical Storm Hector, the latest storm to break out in the Pacific.\n\nThe storm is expected to continue tracking west in the general direction of Hawaii over the next few days, according to the National Hurricane Center. While officials are closely tracking the storm, it's far too early to tell how close it will come to the state.\n\nAs of 11 a.m. Hawaiian time Monday, Hector was over 1,000 miles west-southwest of Mexico's Baja California peninsula. The storm was moving west at 10 mph with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, the hurricane center said.\n\nAs wind shear decreases, the storm will likely gain strength moving toward the central Pacific basin early this week. Hector's intensification is expected to be limited by a region of dry air and stronger wind shear, according to the hurricane center.\n\nUnderstanding hurricane basins and names\n\nTropical storms and hurricanes form in what meteorologists call \"basins.\" Americans are most familiar with the Atlantic basin, which includes storms that form in the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. The vast majority of storms that affect the U.S. are Atlantic basin storms.\n\nThe Pacific has two basins with storms that impact the U.S., in the eastern and central parts of the ocean. Eastern and central Pacific storms rarely affect land areas and typically head out to sea. However, they can sometimes impact the west coast of Mexico, the Southwest U.S. and Hawaii.\n\nThe Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins have a six-year rotating list of names to identify the storms, updated and maintained by the World Meteorological Organization, NOAA said. The Central Pacific basin has its own rotating list of Hawaiian names.\n\nOften storms will cross from the eastern to the central Pacific basins. In that case, the original name of the storm is kept; this will happen with Hurricane Gilma later this week. Only if the storm first forms in the Central Pacific basin will it get a Hawaiian name, such as Hurricane Hone.\n\n− Doyle Rice", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/08/18/tropical-storm-grace-become-hurricane-fred-tornadoes-henri-new-england/8176417002/", "title": "Storm tracker: At least 35 missing after Fred sweeps North Carolina ...", "text": "Grace strengthened to a hurricane Wednesday on its way toward Mexico, where it could make landfall and soak the Yucatan Peninsula with up to a foot of rain early Thursday.\n\nIt's the second hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nWith 80 mph winds, Grace brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the Cayman Islands on Wednesday, forecasters said, and the storm drenched earthquake-stricken Haiti this week.\n\nGrace is one of three active Atlantic storms in a busy August for hurricane season. The remnants of Post-Tropical Cyclone Fred were still bringing rain across the eastern USA on Wednesday, with Gov. Roy Cooper declaring a state of emergency in North Carolina, and Tropical Storm Henri is expected to become a hurricane Friday as it spins out in the Atlantic.\n\nFred, which made landfall in Florida as a tropical storm, brought several possible tornadoes to Georgia and North Carolina, and the storm was blamed for at least one death Monday: A Las Vegas man whose car hydroplaned near Panama City, Florida, and overturned into a water-filled ditch, the Florida Highway Patrol said.\n\nIn North Carolina, at least 35 people are still missing, Haywood County Emergency Services Director Travis Donaldson said during a Wednesday news conference.\n\n“We have homes that are completely destroyed and off their foundations,” Haywood County Sheriff Greg Christopher added. “Mobile homes that were moved, and mobile home parks that I would call completely destroyed.”\n\nOn its current path, what's left of Fred was expected to move from central Pennsylvania to the southern tier of New York, then New England as the system transitioned into a non-tropical low.\n\nGrace batters Haiti days after quake: 'Countless Haitian families have lost everything'\n\nHenri could pick up to hurricane strength by Friday, and changes in its forecast track place southern New England in its possible path, though there remains plenty of uncertainty as to where it will go, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nTornadoes and flooding in Fred's path across US\n\nAlthough it's slowly losing steam as it treks across the eastern USA, the remnants of Fred caused twisters and prompted flash flood warnings in several states.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, as many as 14 possible tornadoes were reported across Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina on Tuesday as Fred passed.\n\nIn Georgia, the tornadoes damaged homes, an apartment complex and a sporting goods warehouse, which ripped off metal siding and knocked around a semitruck trailer in Jeffersonville.\n\nFlooding in parts of North Carolina forced some people to evacuate. In Grovemont, east of Asheville, residents were told to shelter in place instead as roads had become impassible.\n\nTransylvania County, south of Asheville, declared a state of emergency after 10 inches of rain fell Monday, causing landslides, flooding roads and destroying at least one home.\n\n“It really caught everyone off guard,” Transylvania County Chairman Jason Chappell said. “No one was forecasting that amount of rain.”\n\nGrace reaches Category 1 hurricane strength as it nears Mexico\n\nGrace strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane Wednesday as it approached the Yucatan Peninsula, where it was expected to make landfall early Thursday.\n\nThe storm, about 125 miles east of Tulum, Mexico, as of 11 p.m. EDT Wednesday, was expected to continue strengthening as it moved over the warm waters of the Caribbean, and it could reach winds of up to 85 mph.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said hurricane conditions and dangerous storm surge were expected in Mexico as the storm could bring up to a foot of rain in some areas and \"life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\"\n\nThough Grace is likely to weaken during its push over the Yucatan, once it reaches the Gulf again, it could intensify back to hurricane strength before reaching central Mexico by Saturday, forecasters said. Winds could regain strength to 85 mph, but the storm is expected to rapidly dissipate once it reaches the mountains in central Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nHow to help: Haiti is reeling from a devastating earthquake, COVID-19 pandemic and political instability\n\nIn Haiti, Grace temporarily halted search-and-rescue efforts after a deadly magnitude 7.2 earthquake shook the island over the weekend. The storm raised the threat of mudslides and flash flooding, and many residents seeking treatment for earthquake-related injuries were drenched as they waited outside packed hospitals.\n\nHenri could hit New England\n\nAlthough its exact path is unclear, Tropical Storm Henri could hit southern New England by early next week, the latest National Hurricane Center forecast track shows.\n\nAs of 11 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Henri was churning about 795 miles south of Nantucket, Massachusetts, with maximum winds up to 65 mph.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center forecast it to move west before making a turn north and northeast this week, gaining strength to hurricane status by Friday.\n\nDuring the weekend, forecasts remain more uncertain as to where Henri will go, and several models show it moving toward the New England coast, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\"Swells are expected to increase across much of the east coast of the U.S. and Atlantic Canada later this week and this weekend. These swells could cause life-threatening\n\nsurf and rip current conditions,\" the Hurricane Center said.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/09/30/along-east-coast-local-communities-brace-for-floods-and-winds-as-hurricane-joaquin-threatens-the-region/73083790/", "title": "East Coast communities brace for Hurricane Joaquin", "text": "Matthew Diebel\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nTowns and cities along the East Coast, already dealing with heavy rain, are bracing for newly formed Hurricane Joaquin, which could pound the region with downpours and strong winds.\n\nForecasters are divided as to whether the storm's eye, around which the most violent part of the storm circulates, will hit the East Coast later this week. But local officials were already taking precautions Wednesday.\n\nHere is how regions are preparing and what some are expecting, according to newspapers owned by Gannett, which also is the parent company of USA TODAY.\n\nDELAWARE\n\nIn Wilmington, Del., The News Journal reports that the storm will be the first test of a so-called \"mega beach,\" an artificial strand about 200 feet wide that is backed by a man-made dune.\n\nBroadkill Beach's windfall of sand comes courtesy of a $69.3 million project to both deepen the lower reach of the Delaware Bay shipping channel and reuse the sand by pumping it onto Broadkill as a shoreline protection initiative.\n\nJoaquin becomes hurricane; could hit East Coast\n\nRichard Pearsall, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Philadelphia, told the News Journal that 44% of the project is complete. A total of 1.9 million cubic yards of sand is expected to be used to rebuild the beach and dune at Broadkill. The dredge crew is expected to begin pumping again in mid-October, Pearsall said.\n\nIn Broadkill Beach, a town in the southeast part of the state, shoreline and waterway manager Anthony Pratt was confident that most of the beach would hold up. \"That's going to be fine,\" he told the paper.\n\nBut at the southern end of the community, the beach is still vulnerable because sand pumping there has just started, he said.\n\n\"I'm watching carefully,\" Pratt said of the impending weather system.\n\nFor Delaware, the worst-case scenario is a storm that makes landfall to the south, such as at Ocean City, Md., or Chincoteague, Va., Pratt said. That puts the Delaware coast in the northeast quadrant for winds – the worst place to be.\n\nMARYLAND\n\nJust to the south on the same Delmarva Peninsula, the Salisbury, Md., Daily Times reports that more than 11 inches of rain is expected in the area by the end of the week.\n\nIn nearby Wakefield, Va., the National Weather Service station there, which covers the Lower Shore and the Eastern Shore of Virginia, said on its Facebook page Wednesday morning that heavy rain is likely Thursday night into Friday and Friday night.\n\nVIRGINIA\n\nIn Staunton, Va., the News Leaderreported that several days of rain had drenched the area, causing flooding, road closures and even a mudslide.\n\nThe mudslide, on U.S. 250 in Staunton, prompted the city to bring out heavy machinery to deal with the mess. Raymond Campbell, an employee for the Staunton City Street Department, spent more than an hour clearing trees, mud and debris after a portion of the road became covered.\n\n\"We done hauled a bunch of stuff away,\" he said. \"We will probably be here for a couple more hours.\"\n\nCampbell said the area on U.S. 250 has never collapsed before and said no one was injured.\n\n\"We just got a lot of rain all at one time,\" he said.\n\nThere were several reports of motorists being stranded by floodwaters. The City of Staunton reported that a road at the entrance to part of the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind had to be closed because of flooding.\n\nAccording to Accuweather, up to 4 inches of rain had fallen by 6 p.m. on Tuesday. The Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport recorded 3.44 inches by early evening, meteorologist Carl Erickson said.\n\nNEW JERSEY\n\nFarther north in New Jersey, the Asbury Park Press reported that shore towns were bracing for heavy rains and flooding that forecasters say might hit the state as Joaquin strengthens.\n\n\"It looks like it's headed toward New Jersey, but I would say there's a lot of uncertainty with the storm right now,\" Al Cope, meteorologist for the National Weather Service's station in nearby Mount Holly, told the paper.\n\nNew Jersey is expected to get 8 to 9 inches of rain by Oct. 7, according to the service. Significant river flooding is possible in most of the state between Friday and Sunday.\n\nIt could also create conditions New Jersey residents haven't seen since Superstorm Sandy hit three years ago: strong winds, heavy surf, beach erosion and coastal as well as inland flooding, Cope said.\n\nMeanwhile, towns along the shore are preparing for the storm by building barriers and warning residents to keep storm drains clear.\n\nFloods likely for East Coast even without Joaquin\n\nBelmar has built sand dunes along the beach and started lowering lakes, Belmar Mayor Matt Doherty tweeted. \"In particular we are pumping out water from Lake Como,\" he told a Press reporter in an email. \"It started last night and will run all day today.\"\n\nNeptune City police asked residents and business owners to avoid leaving debris and building material on the curb line to make sure the storm drains are clear, according to the department's Facebook page.\n\nHarvey Cedars officials are having the remaining lifeguard benches, trash cans and park benches removed from the beach area, according to police.\n\nIn many municipalities, officials were meeting Wednesday to solidify their storm preparation plans.\n\nFarther north, the Bridgewater, N.J., Courier News also reported that inland flooding was a distinct possibility.\n\n\"Lots of weather energy focused on the region over the next 7 days,\" the paper quoted a tweet from Gary Szatkowski, meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service's Mount Holly Office. \"Keep an eye on the forecast, take necessary action if warnings are issued.\"\n\nTo the south of the state, the Cherry Hill Courier Post reported a power outage in downtown Camden that affected about 2,000 customers. The local power company, PSE&G, said the loss was likely caused by winds and heavy rains.\n\nFLORIDA\n\nIn Brevard County, Fla., home of the Melbourne-based Florida Today, local National Weather Service forecaster Scott Kelly told the newspaper that the current high surf will continue and possibly strengthen as Joaquin moves from the nearby Bahamas.\n\n\"Going on in time, that swell looks like it's going to persist through the weekend and in part due to Tropical Storm Joaquin as he very slowly moves westward and then gets picked up by a trough,\" said Kelly, who noted that swells could be as high as 5 feet.\n\nThe National Weather Service on Tuesday issued a coastal flood advisory as swells to continue to impact the coast from the Northeast.\n\nAnd there are other threats the storm poses as well, Kelly said.\n\n\"I think the main threat is going to continue to be a pretty high risk of rip currents for the rest of the week and into weekend,\" Kelly said.\n\nHe also noted that inexperienced boaters could have an issue returning to shore and high swells could make it \"very hazardous to navigate inlets, especially during the outgoing tide.\"\n\nNEW YORK\n\nIn Binghamton, N.Y., the Press & Sun Bulletinnewspaper reported that a flood watch was in effect in parts of the Southern Tier, a region bordering Pennsylvania.\n\nSome areas could exceed 4 inches of rainfall, which could lead to localized flooding and significant river rises, the local station of the National Weather Service said.\n\nBroome, Chemung, Chenango, Delaware, Tompkins, Tioga, and Steuben counties are included in the flood watch area. Bradford and Susquehanna counties in northern Pennsylvania are also included.\n\nFarther to the east, in Dutchess County, the Poughkeepsie Journal also reported a flood watch.\n\nThe watch, issued Tuesday evening at 8 p.m., will continue as heavy rainfall continues across the county, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Kevin Lipton, who is based in nearby Albany. In urban areas, flood advisories are in force, Lipton said, as poor drainage will cause minor flooding in these locations.\n\nDutchess County has received 1 to 2 inches thus far, according to Lipton, but a threat for heavier ran may come back for this weekend on Saturday or Sunday, he said, as Hurricane Joaquin may potentially move up the East Coast and impact the Hudson Valley.\n\nFarther south in the state, the Westchester Journal News reported that downed trees, flooding and rain had slowed many commutes on Wednesday morning.\n\nMeanwhile, rainfall of up to 2 inches and isolated flash flooding are expected to plague the lower Hudson Valley, portions of Long Island and southern Connecticut through Wednesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in New York wrote on its Facebook page. Heavy rain was expected to continue through Friday.\n\nNOAA said there is a chance Joaquin could impact the New York-New Jersey area by Sunday. Up to 8 inches of rain could fall in the Lower Hudson Valley during the next seven days, according to the NOAA.\n\nWhether Joaquin directly hits the East Coast or not, \"tropical moisture from Joaquin is expected to increase the potential for heavy rainfall,\" NOAA wrote on its Facebook page.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/30"}]}

Adam Simjee, 22, was shot to death in the Talladega National Forest near Cheaha State Park on Sunday, the Clay County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. Yasmine Hider and Krystal Diane Pinkins were charged with murder, kidnapping and robbery, the statement said. Wounded several times during the confrontation, Hider was awaiting transfer to jail from a Birmingham hospital, where she underwent surgery for her wounds. Pinkins, 36, was jailed. Simjee and girlfriend Mikayla Paulus, 20, were driving on a National Forest Service road when Hider flagged them down and asked for help with her car, sheriff’s officials said. She then pulled out a gun and ordered them into the woods, they said. Simjee also pulled out a pistol and shot Hider several times, but he also was hit and died at the scene. Hider called out for help, and Pinkins emerged from the forest before fleeing, authorities said. Authorities using a dog tracking team and a state police helicopter found a camp where they saw Pinkins, whose 5-year-old son ran from the woods with a loaded shotgun as officers were arresting her, sheriff’s officials said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Two oil and gas companies have announced plans to invest $2.6 billion into developing a major oil field on Alaska’s North Slope. Australia-based Santos and Spain-based Repsol made the announcement, which was lauded by state political leaders, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Santos has a 51% stake in the Pikka project, and the company said Tuesday that its investment will be $1.3 billion. Santos last year acquired Oil Search of Papua New Guinea, which had been working to advance the project. Santos, in a statement, said the funds will cover the initial phase of development at the Pikka field, with 80,000 barrels of oil daily expected to begin flowing in 2026. If developed, the field on state land east of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska could significantly boost the flow of oil through the trans-Alaska pipeline system. Development could also generate billions of dollars in state and local tax revenue, primarily through royalties to the state. Another major North Slope oil prospect, ConocoPhillips’ Willow project, has been delayed by litigation and a new environmental review. Alaska U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan lauded the plans for the Pikka project. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy said it “will continue the renaissance on Alaska’s North Slope.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An effort by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey to use shipping containers to close a 1,000-foot gap in the U.S.-Mexico border wall near Yuma suffered a brief setback when two stacked containers somehow toppled over. Claudia Ramos, a correspondent for the digital platform of Univision Noticias in Arizona, posted on her Twitter feed a photo she took Monday morning of the containers on their side. She said they fell on the U.S. side of the border. No witnesses have come forward to say what happened Sunday night. Ramos said contractors in the area told her they believed the containers may have been toppled by strong monsoon winds. But C.J. Karamargin, a Ducey spokesman, said he doubted that hypothesis, adding that even though the containers are empty, they weigh thousands of pounds. “It’s unlikely this was a weather event,” Karamargin said, suggesting that someone opposed to the wall was to blame. The stacked pair of containers were righted by early Monday morning. “Clearly we struck a nerve. They don’t like what we are doing, and they don’t want to keep the border open,” the spokesman said. “This happened before securing the containers to the ground. They will be bolted later and will be immovable.”\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Medical marijuana patients spent $23.3million in July at the state’s 38 dispensaries to take home 4,171 pounds of cannabis. Natural Relief Dispensary of Sherwood had the largest month, with 392 pounds sold, while The Releaf Center of Bentonville followed with 308 pounds. The Arkansas Department of Health reports 88,893 active patient cards. “Medical marijuana purchases increased by more than $1 million from June to July,” said Scott Hardin, spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. “An average of $751,720 was spent daily on medical marijuana purchases in July.” Since Jan. 1, 2022, patients have spent a total of $157.9 million to obtain 27,782 pounds from the state’s 38 dispensaries. Arkansas patients purchased 12,056 pounds of medical marijuana in April, May and June totaling $68.75 million. The state tax collection for the first three-month period of the year totaled $8.23 million, the state department reported. For the month of July, the state collected $2.6 million in tax form sales. Patients pay a 6.5% regular state sales tax on medical marijuana and a 4% privilege tax. Cultivators who sell their product to a dispensary only pay the 4% privilege tax.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Forecasts for more scorching heat and monsoon moisture brought calls for Californians to conserve electricity Wednesday, along with warnings that lightning, thunderstorm winds and parched vegetation were a recipe for wildfires. The heat wave was expected to be most extreme in the state’s interior, chiefly the Central Valley, where some locations hit 110 degrees Tuesday. The wildfire risk was focused on northern counties. The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state’s power grid, called for voluntary electricity conservation from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. due to expectation of increased use of air conditioning and tightening power supplies. Late afternoon through early evening is the period when the grid is most stressed due to high demand while solar energy production is decreasing. Red flag warnings for fire danger were posted for the northern Coast Range, eastern Shasta County and the Mount Lassen area. The National Weather Service warned of the possibility of “abundant lightning” and erratic gusts from thunderstorms. “Lightning can create new fire starts and may combine with strong outflow winds to cause a fire to rapidly grow in size and intensity,” the weather service said.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Tumble out of bed and stumble to your mailbox. Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is now available in Larimer County. The country music singer’s international children’s literacy program provides one free book a month to children until they turn 5 to help inspire an early love for reading. Parents in Larimer County can enroll their children in the program through the United Way of Larimer County. “People are really excited about the program,” said Allison Hines, United Way of Larimer County’s senior vice president of resource development. “This is a really great opportunity to get books in the hands of families that may not otherwise have access to them.” Any child qualifies for the program until their 5th birthday. In Larimer County alone, roughly 17,000 children are eligible. Since the program launched last week, over 2,000 people have registered their children for the program, Hines said. Officials hope to have 4,200 families signed up in the program’s first year.The Imagination Library is mostly funded through the Dollywood Foundation, supplemented by the Imagination Library of Colorado, which receives money from the state. The Dollywood Foundation selects the books and sends them directly to the child.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The city is investing in public art, with two more artists now invited to paint murals downtown. It seems that 2022 has become the year for murals in Norwich with the murals on Market Street Garage and Castle Church. Now, two more are in the works. The Norwich Street Art Collective invited artists Carlitos Skills, whose legal name is Carlos Alexis Rivera Rivera, from Bayamon, Puerto Rico, and Golden, legal name Cristhian Saravia, of Miami, to town. Both of their murals are expected to be finished Thursday. Peter Helms, founder of the Norwich Street Art Collective, was inspired by the street art in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami, once a blighted neighborhood but now a place where culture and business thrive. “A group of people decided that if they brought in art, that would inspire people and give them a sense of pride in their community and ultimately transform it economically,” Helms said. Norwich is in a unique position. While millions of people visit the nearby casinos every year, there hasn’t been enough of a draw to pull casino visitors into the city. An outdoor art museum may have the kind of pull needed, Helms said. As long as it was family-friendly, the artists could do anything they wanted, as tight restrictions are “not how you get the best art from artists.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The Riverside community celebrated the completion of 74 mixed-income apartments Tuesday, bringing updated public housing as well as units designated for people with disabilities and special needs as part of a $100 million redevelopment project in the Wilmington neighborhood. Over 100 state, federal and local elected officials, community leaders and neighbors gathered outside the first phase of Imani Village, where units have been set aside to house seniors, veterans and individuals with disabilities, along with transitioning families out of outdated Wilmington Housing Authority apartments into newly built apartment homes with up to four bedrooms. This is the first of six phases of a “Purpose Built Community” redevelopment plan spearheaded by the nonprofit Reach Riverside. It will offer 59 affordable units as well as 15 market-rate apartments. The second phase, expected to be completed by the end of the year, will add another 50 affordable and 17 market-rate units, said Jennifer Lienhard, Reach Riverside’s director of marketing and communications. Announced in 2018, the multimillion-dollar project aims to build hundreds of public housing units as well as mixed-income and homeownership opportunities, revamp early education and health services at Kingswood Community Center, and add high school grades to the local EastSide Charter School.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A Catholic school in Northeast D.C. is raising money to repair the damage after someone broke several concrete windowsills and knocked down a statue of the school’s namesake weeks before the first day of classes, WUSA-TV reports. St. Anthony Catholic School said three benches were also pulled out of the ground and damaged. According to a police report, an unknown suspect destroyed the school’s property overnight Aug. 11 and took the head off the statue. St. Anthony Catholic Principal Mike Thomasian discovered the damage Friday and said he was disappointed to see someone would target the school’s patron saint. “Hate crimes can happen in any house of worship, and Catholics are being attacked right now,” he said. “And I didn’t know how strongly I felt about that until it hit home.” The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the incident as a suspected hate crime. It is at least the third religious hate crime investigated by police this year. Then, St. Anthony was targeted again over the weekend, according to Thomasian. He said a custodian discovered the principal’s office had been ransacked, and two religious statues had been destroyed. Thomasian said the thief also took $1,400 that children had raised for a charity. A GoFundMe had raised more than $30,000 in donations as of Wednesday.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Scientists and students from the University of Miami dove into the dark waters a few miles off the shores of Miami this week as part of an effort to develop hybrid reefs. The team from the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science was on a mission to collect eggs and sperm from spawning staghorn coral, which they hope to use to fertilize other strains of staghorn corals in a lab. It’s all part of a $7.5 million federal grant from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to help address security threats to the military and civilian infrastructure along vulnerable coastal regions in Florida and the Caribbean. The Miami-based project seeks to protect coastal bases from damaging hurricane storm surge using hybrid reefs. “Our mission is to develop hybrid reefs that combine the wave-protection benefits of artificial structures with the ecological benefits of coral reefs,” said Andrew Baker, a professor and director of the Coral Reef Futures Lab at the Rosenstiel School. “We will be working on next-generation structural designs and concrete materials and integrating them with novel ecological engineering approaches to help foster the growth of corals on these structures.” They will also be testing new adaptive biology approaches to produce corals that are faster-growing and more resilient to a warming climate, he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Attorneys for the family of a woman killed by gunfire last year as sheriff’s deputies executed a search warrant at her cousin’s home are calling for the U.S. Justice Department to investigate, arguing the deadly raid echoes the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky. Shooting broke out within seconds after Camden County deputies knocked down the door of Varshan Brown’s darkened home in Woodbine, about 100 miles south of Savannah, just before 5 a.m. May 4, 2021. The officers had a warrant to search the house for drugs. Brown’s cousin, 37-year-old Latoya James, was killed by bullets as deputies and Brown fired guns at each other. Brown was wounded and later charged with crimes. Local prosecutors brought no charges against the deputies after concluding they were justified in using deadly force. Lawyers for James’ family say there are striking parallels between this case and the 2020 raid by police in Louisville, Kentucky, that left Taylor dead. In both cases, officers arrived in the middle of the night and forced their way into homes with little to no warning. And each involved a shootout that killed an unarmed Black woman. “Latoya James was innocent in all aspects of this case,” said Harry Daniels, an attorney for her family. “She was at her cousin’s house. She wasn’t a target of any investigation.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Warning of a tough flu season ahead, state health officials are urging residents to get vaccinated against influenza and COVID-19 alike, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State lawmakers who made it more difficult for transgender people to change the sex listed on their birth certificates despite a U.S. court ruling banning such obstacles must pay $321,000 in legal fees to the winning side after losing in the same court. Republican Gov. Brad Little and Secretary of State Lawerence Denney on the State Board of Examiners on Tuesday approved paying the winning side’s legal fees set by the court in June. The court in March 2018 banned Idaho from automatically rejecting applications from transgender people to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. The court ruled the restriction violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. But lawmakers in 2020 approved a ban anyway, and Little signed the bill into law. The 2018 case was reopened, and Idaho lost again, resulting in the $321,000 legal bill. The state previously paid $75,000 after losing the initial case in 2018. The plaintiffs in the case were represented by Lambda Legal, which on its website describes itself as a national legal organization working to get full civil rights recognition for lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and everyone living with HIV. The Board of Examiners typically sends such bills to the Constitutional Defense Council but instead sent the bill to the Legislature on Tuesday.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state’s first lady has again bested her husband in an Illinois State Fair tradition, with M.K. Pritzker outbidding Gov. J.B. Pritzker for the fair’s grand champion steer. The first lady’s $105,000 bid for the steer, King, also beat her own record from 2021, when she and the governor were again pitted against each other in the auction.\n\nIndiana\n\nFremont: Hundreds of fish found dead in a northeastern Indiana lake likely died from natural events tied to recent hot weather, state wildlife officials said. Fisheries biologists with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources visited Clear Lake on Aug. 4 after residents reported numerous dead fish in the lake near the Steuben County town of Fremont, The Journal Gazette reports. The DNR said an estimated 500 fish were found dead, including bluegill, crappie and bass, in the lake about 50 miles northeast of Fort Wayne. The state agency said Monday that natural events likely caused the fish to die and noted that heat, warm water and windless days can produce low levels of dissolved oxygen in lakes. “Without dissolved oxygen, fish are unable to breathe and can die rapidly and in large numbers,” the DNR said in a news release. DNR biologists will continue monitoring conditions at Clear Lake. While the public health threat is considered very low, the agency said people should use common sense when visiting natural waterways, especially during periods of hot weather.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A City Council member is countersuing two police officers who took the unusual step earlier this year of suing several people who participated in a 2020 protest following a Minneapolis officer’s killing of George Floyd. Councilwoman Indira Sheumaker’s countersuit says Officers Peter Wilson and Jeffrey George used excessive force and violated her civil rights when they arrested her during a protest July 1, 2020, outside the Iowa State Capitol. Sheumaker’s lawsuit also accuses the officers of filing a frivolous lawsuit against protesters. In June, Wilson and George sued Sheumaker and five other protesters, accusing them of assault and seeking monetary damages, including an unspecified amount in punitive damages. The protest was among demonstrations against racism and police brutality that erupted worldwide following Floyd’s killing. It began as a rally at the Iowa State Capitol to push for the restored voting rights to felons and turned violent as police led away arrested protesters. The officers’ lawsuit – which they filed as individuals and not as representatives of the Des Moines Police Department – accuses Sheumaker and another protester of putting George in a chokehold as protesters attempted to thwart the officers’ attempts to arrest several people on prior warrants.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Federal officials are expected next month to rename five creeks and a stream on federal land in the state because their names include a slur for Native American women. That word, “squaw,” was formally declared derogatory last November in an order issued by Deb Haaland, the nation’s first Native American Secretary of the Interior. The term is an ethnic, racial and sexist slur, particularly for Indigenous women, Haaland said in a news release. “Our nation’s lands and waters should be places to celebrate the outdoors and our shared cultural heritage – not to perpetuate the legacies of oppression,” she said. Haaland ordered the Board on Geographic Names, the federal body tasked with naming geographic places, to find replacement names for more than 660 geographic features bearing that term, including the six sites in Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky State Parks has launched a photo contest that encourages visitors to capture some of the best parts of their stay. The contest aims to attract more travelers and showcase these “places of beauty, from scenic mountain views to tranquil beaches,” Kentucky Department of Parks Commissioner Russ Meyer said in a statement. Photos can be entered in the categories of camping, scenic, trails and park activities and will be judged on factors including originality and artistic composition, officials said. Photo submissions can be made through Oct. 31, and winners will be announced in December. A grand prize winner will receive a two-night cottage stay, a Canon camera and a $100 Kentucky State Parks gift card. Four honorable mention categories will have first- and second-place winners, who will receive camping certificates and gift cards.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: State law does not require that a candidate who mistakenly fills in the wrong address on a qualification form must be tossed off the ballot, a lawyer for Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins told the Louisiana Supreme Court on Tuesday. A lawsuit says Perkins did not use the address where he claims a homestead tax exemption when he signed up to run for reelection, as the law requires. He used another address for a residence he owns in the city. Perkins has acknowledged the mistake, and none of the seven justices Tuesday accused him of perjury. The case involves the question of whether “there are some things that a candidate does not have to tell the truth about,” Justice Jay McCallum said as he questioned Perkins’ attorney, Scott Bickford. Bickford said state law does not specifically call for disqualifying a candidate for using the wrong address. Jerry Harper, attorney for plaintiff Francis Deal, said the use of false information on the sign-up form for the Nov. 8 election – information the candidate swears to be true – disqualifies Perkins, who wants to run for a second term. Justice Scott Crichton at one point suggested that allowing Perkins on the ballot would be tantamount to nullifying the law. It was unclear when the justices would rule. So far, a district judge and an appellate court have ruled against Perkins.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to defrauding federal pandemic assistance programs of more than $300,000, which investigators say was spent on trucks, exercise equipment, a big-screen TV and laptop computers. Craig Franck, 40, of Levant, also used some of the relief money to post bail and hire a defense attorney after being charged with felony fraud in Florida, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud and money laundering charges. He faces up to 20 years in prison when he’s sentenced. U.S. Attorney Darcie McElwee vowed to go after those who “take advantage of a national emergency simply to line their own pockets.” Franck formerly owned CCF Acoustics LLC and CCF Acoustical Systems, but neither company was in business or had employees in 2020 and 2021 when he applied for federal assistance during the pandemic, prosecutors said. Franck received $177,400 from the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program through the Small Business Administration and $145,060 from a private lender through the Paycheck Protection Program, prosecutors said. U.S. District Judge Lance Walker entered a forfeiture order Tuesday for about $320,000. Franck’s lawyer didn’t immediately return a telephone message seeking comment.\n\nMaryland\n\nCrofton: The family of a man fatally shot by a police officer filed a federal civil right lawsuit Monday against the department and individual officers. Dyonta Quarles Jr. was shot Jan. 30 when Anne Arundel County officers responded to his Crofton home after his mother called 911 saying her son wouldn’t let her leave, according to the Attorney General’s Office. Bodycam footage shows Quarles punching Officer J. Ricci. As officers handcuff Quarles, the video shows him bite Ricci and another officer deploy a stun gun. Ricci calls on colleagues to shoot Quarles, then fires himself. Quarles died, and Ricci was taken to a trauma center in serious condition, officials said. Mikel Quarles said at a news conference announcing the suit Monday that she was asking for help, and her son was killed, news outlets report. Attorneys for the family said part of the suit focuses on officers’ training. The officers weren’t properly trained “and reacted in a manner which was unconstitutional, unreasonable and excessive,” attorney Gregory Kulis said. The officers should have reduced tension, he said. “The police arrived with guns drawn,” Kulis said. “They were ready to go to battle.” The Attorney General’s Office said the case remains under investigation. County police declined comment but said Ricci is still recovering.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city is seeking to ban fossil fuels from new building projects and major renovations, Mayor Michelle Wu announced Tuesday. The Democrat said the state’s largest city will take advantage of a key provision in the climate change bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker last week. That legislation, which is meant to bring the state closer to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, calls for a pilot project allowing 10 Massachusetts cities and towns to require new building projects be all-electric, with the exception of life sciences labs and health care facilities. Wu said the city will file a home rule petition with the Legislature to join the pilot. “Boston must lead by taking every possible step for climate action,” she said in a statement. “Boston’s participation will help deliver healthy, energy efficient spaces that save our residents and businesses on utilities costs and create local green jobs that will fuel our economy for decades.” Wu’s office said natural gas, oil and other fossil fuels used in buildings represent more than one-third of the city’s greenhouse gas emissions. New York, Washington, D.C., and Seattle are among the major U.S. municipalities that have enacted similar bans, The Boston Globe reports.\n\nMichigan\n\nGaylord: Recent solar activity and weather conditions could give Michiganders the chance to view the northern lights through Friday night, according to the National Weather Service in Gaylord. The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, are created when charged particles ejected by the sun collide with atoms and molecules in Earth’s atmosphere. These charged particles then emit light that viewers perceive as the aurora. The Upper Peninsula is known to offer great conditions to view night sky phenomena due to its latitude, but Lower Peninsula residents may also get the chance to witness the northern lights, as they’re predicted to be visible as far south as Ohio and Pennsylvania. To spot the northern lights, look for greenish streaks of light that move and change, unlike clouds, which move in one direction. For best visibility, avoid areas with light pollution, and try to gain an unobstructed view of the night sky. The aurora will be visible closer to the horizon and will appear higher up in the sky the farther north the viewer are located. Strong solar activity may interfere with electronic communications such as radio, cellphone, television and satellite signals.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Former Minneapolis police Officer Thomas Lane, who was sentenced to 21/ 2 years for violating George Floyd’s civil rights, will do his time at a low-security federal prison camp in Colorado. A court order Tuesday directs Lane to report to the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood in the Denver suburb of Littleton on Aug. 30. U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson had recommended that the Bureau of Prisons send Lane to the low-security prison camp in Duluth, closer to his home, but the bureau makes the final decisions on where to place inmates, including weighing safety concerns. “He should be fine there,” said Lane’s defense attorney, Earl Gray. According to the Bureau of Prisons website, FCI Englewood is a low-security prison for men with an adjacent minimum security satellite camp. It holds 1,032 inmates, including 97 at the camp. Housing is dormitory or cubicle style. Life there is highly regimented, including frequent head counts and having to wake at dawn.\n\nMississippi\n\nLexington: Police have “terrorized” Black residents in a small town by subjecting them to false arrests, excessive force and intimidation, according to a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday by a civil rights organization. The group, JULIAN, is seeking a temporary restraining order against the Lexington Police Department to demand protection for the town’s largely Black population. Lexington is about 63 miles north of the capital, Jackson. “It’s both unconscionable and illegal for Lexington residents to be terrorized and live in fear of the police department whose job is to protect them,” said Jill Collen Jefferson, president and founder of JULIAN. “We need both the courts and the Department of Justice to step in immediately.” The town’s city attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The town’s interim police chief, Charles Henderson, cast doubt on many of the allegations in response to an email request for comment. “I’m working on moving the Lexington Police Department forward,” he said. “I will say, don’t buy into everything you hear. This is defamation of character.” The lawsuit comes after JULIAN said it obtained an audio recording in July of then-Lexington Police Chief Sam Dobbins using racial slurs and talking about how many people he had killed in the line of duty.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: As the U.S. government expands incentives for renewable energy, a decision by the Missouri Supreme Court is moving the state in the opposite direction by halting a solar energy tax break that has been on the books for nearly a decade. The high court struck down a 2013 state law granting a property tax exemption for certain solar energy systems, saying the tax break wasn’t allowed under the state constitution. The case involved a privately run solar farm supplying energy for City Utilities of Springfield, which serves Missouri’s third-largest city. As a result of the ruling, the company owning the solar energy farm will owe at least $423,360 in property taxes from 2017 to 2020, Greene County Collector Allen Icet said. It’s not clear how many other solar energy sites across Missouri could be affected by the ruling or exactly how much tax revenue is at stake. But the ruling could have a chilling effect on solar energy development in Missouri, just as the federal government is trying to encourage it. “This obviously would put a big kink and cost in the way of someone trying to lay out a large panel system, if you’ve got to pay taxes on the material generating this renewable, free energy,” said Jon Dolan, executive director of the Missouri Solar Energy Industries Association.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs can be held responsible for damages awarded to a woman who became pregnant after an on-duty BIA officer used the threat of criminal charges to coerce her into having sex, the Montana Supreme Court has ruled. The woman, identified by the initials L.B. in court documents, sued former BIA officer Dana Bullcoming and his employer for the October 2015 sexual assault on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation that resulted in the birth of a child, who is now 7, said her attorney, John Heenan. “This is a woman that had the courage to report a federal law enforcement officer for sexually assaulting her and then had the courage to go through the entire process, including agents there to collect DNA when the child was born,” Heenan said Wednesday. She pursued the case on behalf of people living on reservations to show “that they should have the same rights as Montanans do on this issue.” U.S. District Judge Susan Watters of Billings awarded the woman $1.6 million in damages in May 2020 but had ruled earlier that the BIA could not be held responsible for paying them because under federal law, the coercion and sex were outside the scope of Bullcoming’s duties.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The special board appointed by President Joe Biden to intervene in stalled railroad contract talks suggested Tuesday that 115,000 rail workers should get 24% raises and thousands of dollars in bonuses as part of a new agreement to avert a strike. Railroads and unions will use those recommendations as the basis for a new round of negotiations over the next month. It remains to be seen, however, whether railroads will agree to the higher wages or find ways to address union concerns about working conditions. If the two sides can’t agree on a new deal by mid-September, federal law would allow a strike or lockout. But Congress is likely to intervene before then to keep the supply chain moving. A railroad strike could devastate businesses that rely on Union Pacific, BNSF, Norfolk Southern, CSX and other major freight railroads to deliver raw materials and ship their products. In past national rail labor disputes, lawmakers have voted to impose terms on the railroads before workers could strike. A White House official said Biden is optimistic the report will provide a good framework for successful negotiations because avoiding a rail shutdown is in the nation’s interests.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Conservationists who are already suing to block a geothermal power plant where an endangered toad lives in western Nevada are now seeking U.S. protection for a rare butterfly at another geothermal project the developer plans near the Oregon line. The Center for Biological Diversity is petitioning the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the bleached sandhill skipper under the Endangered Species Act at the only place it’s known to exist. It says the project the Bureau of Land Management approved last year 250 miles north of Reno could ultimately lead to the extinction of the 2-inch-long butterfly with golden-orange wings. “This beautiful little butterfly has evolved over millennia to thrive in this one specific spot, and no one should have the right to just wipe it off the face of the Earth,” said Jess Tyler, a scientist at the center who co-wrote the petition. USFWS has 90 days to decide whether there’s enough evidence to conduct a yearlong review to determine if protection is warranted, so any formal listing is likely years away. But the petition signals the potential for another legal fight all too familiar to Ormat Nevada, which wants to tap hot water beneath the earth to generate carbon-free energy the Biden administration has made a key part of its effort to combat climate change with a shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A hermit known as River Dave – whose cabin in the New Hampshire woods burned down after he had spent nearly three decades on the property and was ordered to leave – has found a new home in Maine. David Lidstone, 82, has put in windows and is working on installing a chimney on his rustic three-room cabin, which he said is on land he bought. “The foundation needs repair work,” Lidstone, who received more than $200,000 in donations following the fire, said in a phone interview Monday. “It’s just an old camp, but I enjoy working (on it).” Lidstone, who grew up in Maine, declined to say where he was living or provide a contact for the landowner. A search of Maine county registers of deeds did not show any recent transactions involving Lidstone, but a cousin confirmed he had moved to Maine, and a Facebook post had photos of Lidstone with a family member in his new home. “He’s working on putting it together and clearing land and planting gardens, and he’s got some chickens. He’s moving on,” said Horace Clark, of Vermont, Lidstone’s cousin. Lidstone said he had to leave Canterbury, New Hampshire, over his dispute with a different landowner since 2016 over a patch of forest near the Merrimack River that Lidstone called home for 27 years.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state’s casinos, horse tracks that offer sports betting, and the online partners of both types of gambling outlets won $480.7 million in July, an increase of 6.7% from a year ago. But some of Atlantic City’s nine casinos continue to struggle to return to pre-pandemic levels in terms of the amount won from in-person gamblers, with five of them individually winning less in July 2022 than they did in July 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic began. Figures released Tuesday by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show that the casinos collectively won just under $299 million from in-person gamblers. That’s more than the $277 million they collectively won in July 2019. But five casinos – Bally’s, Borgata, Golden Nugget, Harrah’s and the Tropicana – won less from in-person gamblers last month than they did in July 2019. Nonetheless, Atlantic City’s performance in July “showed indications of a strong summer season fueled by a return to normal operations and consumer behavior,” said Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University. James Plousis, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, said the resort is off to a good start to the crucial summer season.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nFarmington: A fundraiser organized by a local LGBTQ organization at a brewery in Aztec was canceled after the owners of the business reportedly received threats. Nicole Hall, board president of Identity Inc., the Farmington-based nonprofit that was organizing the Aug. 12 fundraiser, said she received a call from one of the owners of the 550 Brewing Taproom two days prior saying the business had received several threats from people apparently upset about the all-ages event including a drag show. The Back to School Bash planned by Identity Inc. at the brewery was intended to raise cash and draw donations of school supplies for children and teachers, according to a flyer for the event posted on the organization’s Facebook page. It included a $5 cover charge and featured a drag show, an open mic session, games and more. But Hall said the brewery owner said she and other business representatives had been contacted through various means by people upset by the prospect of children being present for the drag show. Some reportedly threatened the owners and members of their family, Hall said she was told. “My immediate response was, ‘I’m so sorry people are being hateful to you. We’re used to it, but I didn’t think it would boil over to you and your family,’ ” Hall said she told the brewery’s owners.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal authorities say they have busted an organized crime racket reminiscent of the Mafia’s heyday, involving illegal gambling parlors in New York City and Long Island and a police detective accused of helping to protect the lucrative schemes. Two indictments unsealed Tuesday charged nine people, including the detective, with crimes such as racketeering, illegal gambling, money laundering conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Nicknames of the defendants included “Joe Fish,” “Sal the Shoemaker” and “Joe Box.” The top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn said the racketeers operated from fronts including a coffee bar, a soccer club and a shoe repair shop. “Today’s arrests of members from two La Cosa Nostra crime families demonstrate that the Mafia continues to pollute our communities with illegal gambling, extortion and violence while using our financial system in service to their criminal schemes,” U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said. He called the detective’s alleged conduct “shameful.” The Nassau County Police Department detective, Hector Rosario, is accused of accepting money from the Bonanno crime family in exchange for steering police raids toward competing gambling clubs.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Although illegal marijuana and lawful hemp look and smell the same, criminal prosecution for pot can still be legitimate when sight or odor contributes to a warrantless search and seizure, the state Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday. A three-judge panel found no errors related to a trial judge or attorney for Derek Edwin Highsmith, who was convicted last year of felony marijuana possession stemming from a Duplin County traffic stop in 2017. He was sentenced to a maximum of a little over four years in prison. Highsmith argued unsuccessfully at a hearing before his trial that the evidence collected after a K-9 alerted officers to possible drugs inside the vehicle should have been suppressed because it was unlawfully obtained. Superior Court Judge Henry Stevens IV denied Highsmith’s suppression motion, saying the K-9’s positive alert for narcotics, along with other factors, provided officers with the facts to find probable cause to conduct the search. The prosecutor called ït a “K-9 sniff-plus case,” Tuesday’s opinion said. Sheriff’s officers said it saw a vehicle that left a residence after many complaints about narcotics sales there, according to the opinion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The city’s school board will reconsider its decision to stop reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at each of its meetings, after the move drew widespread criticism and threats of retaliation from some conservative state lawmakers. Fargo Board of Education President Tracie Newman told board members in a memo that she believes the pledge should be reinstated because the onslaught of “negative local and national feedback” could cost time and resources ahead of the new school year. She called a special meeting for Thursday. The Fargo board voted 7-2 last week to nix a previous board edict from April to recite the pledge before each meeting. The board includes four newcomers from the June election. In deciding against reciting the pledge, the board said the move didn’t align with the district’s diversity and inclusion code, largely because it says “under God” in one phrase. Robin Nelson, one of two board members to vote against dropping the pledge, said no one complained after the panel started reciting the patriotic vow. But since last week’s vote, the board has received “hundreds and hundreds of local and national emails and phone calls,” she said. She has heard personally from state lawmakers who have threatened to get even.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A federal judge awarded $650 million in damages Wednesday to two Ohio counties that won a landmark lawsuit against national pharmacy chains CVS, Walgreens and Walmart, claiming the way they distributed opioids to customers caused severe harm to communities and created a public nuisance. U.S. District Judge Dan Polster said in the ruling that the money will be used to abate a continuing opioid crisis in Lake and Trumbull counties, outside Cleveland. Attorneys for the counties put the total price tag at $3 billion for the damage done to the counties. Lake County is to receive $306 million over 15 years. Trumbull County is to receive $344 million over the same period. Polster ordered the companies to immediately pay nearly $87 million to cover the first two years of the abatement plan. In his ruling, Polster admonished the three companies, saying they “squandered the opportunity to present a meaningful plan to abate the nuisance” after a trial that considered what damages they might owe. CVS, Walmart and Walgreens said they will appeal the ruling.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state lawmaker has filed an Open Records Act lawsuit seeking records about expenditures from Governor’s Emergency Education Relief funds. Republican state Rep. Logan Phillips filed the lawsuit Tuesday against the Office of Management and Enterprise Services and said Gov. Kevin Stitt and Education Secretary Ryan Walters, also both Republicans, have not responded to his requests for the documents. “I am seeking declarative and injunctive relief because I believe failure to provide the requested records is unlawful, and the records need to be made publicly available,” Phillips said. Stitt and OMES representatives told the Tulsa World that Phillips failed to attend scheduled meetings to see the documents. A U.S. Department of Education audit in July sharply criticized state officials for lack of oversight and accountability in how they used nearly $40 million in coronavirus relief funds intended for education. The audit recommended the state return nearly $653,000 spent on non-educational items such as televisions and Xbox gaming systems and audit another $5.4 million for possible refund of misspent funds. The state blamed the Florida-based contractor hired to administer the programs and sued the company for how it distributed the funds.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Oregon’s gubernatorial election took a step closer Tuesday to being a three-way race when unaffiliated candidate Betsy Johnson delivered thousands of voter signatures to get on the ballot. If the signatures are verified by election officials, the former state lawmaker will face Democratic nominee Tina Kotek, who is a former Oregon House speaker; and Republican nominee Christine Drazan, a former leader of the minority GOP in the House. “Coming onto the ballot through the power of people’s signatures is one of the most meaningful and foundational elements of my campaign,” Johnson said. She and several supporters delivered boxes of signature sheets to election officials in Salem. Johnson’s campaign said it delivered 48,214 signatures to Secretary of State Shemia Fagan’s election officials. Officials need to verify 23,744 of them as valid by Aug. 30 for Johnson to qualify for the November ballot. Tuesday was the deadline to deliver the signatures. “By delivering more than twice the number of signatures needed, we’ve made it very difficult for the political establishment to imagine ways to keep me off the ballot,” Johnson said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Two former judges who orchestrated a scheme to send children to for-profit jails in exchange for kickbacks were ordered to pay more than $200 million to hundreds of people they victimized in one of the worst judicial scandals in U.S. history. U.S. District Judge Christopher Conner awarded $106 million in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive damages to nearly 300 people in a long-running civil suit against the judges, writing the plaintiffs are “the tragic human casualties of a scandal of epic proportions.” In what came to be known as the kids-for-cash scandal, Mark Ciavarella and another judge, Michael Conahan, shut down a county-run juvenile detention center and accepted $2.8 million in illegal payments from the builder and co-owner of two for-profit lockups. Ciavarella, who presided over juvenile court, pushed a zero-tolerance policy that guaranteed large numbers of kids would be sent to PA Child Care and its sister facility, Western PA Child Care. Ciavarella ordered children as young as 8 to detention, many of them first-time offenders deemed delinquent for petty theft, jaywalking, truancy, smoking on school grounds and other minor infractions. The judge often ordered youths he had found delinquent to be immediately shackled, handcuffed and taken away without giving them a chance to put up a defense or even say goodbye to their families.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: A group of police officers put on body cameras Tuesday as part of a two-month pilot program that’s expected to pave the way for all the department’s patrol officers to wear them. Sixteen Warwick officers wore the Axon body cameras, which officers are now wearing on all three of the department’s patrol shifts. “This pilot program is really us getting our feet wet,” said Warwick’s police chief, Col. Brad Connor. The camera tryout in Warwick evokes a buzz of activity at police departments across the state as many local police officers get ready to do their jobs, day in and day out, with body cameras. A 30-day public comment period for a set of proposed rules and regulations runs out Friday. The draft policy was developed by the office of Attorney General Peter F. Neronha and the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety with guidance from the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association. Under the program, which is based largely on legislation passed last year, the draft policy can be approved following consideration of public input. The approved policy would govern the use of body cameras by police departments that tap into $15 million in funding that has been allocated by the state legislature.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Attorneys for disbarred lawyer Alex Murdaugh say prosecutors are taking too long to share their evidence alleging the disbarred attorney killed his wife and son, unfairly making it tougher to defend him at his upcoming trial. It’s a technical legal dispute that precedes many trials, but because of overwhelming public attention on Murdaugh’s case, attorney Dick Harpootlian called a news conference Wednesday that drew a dozen cameras at which he declared prosecutors want a “trial by ambush.” Prosecutors shot back. “This manufactured drama is just a well-known part of defense counsel’s playbook,” the state Attorney General’s Office responded in legal papers. Murdaugh, 54, was indicted in July on murder charges in the shooting deaths of his wife Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, who were killed June 7, 2021, at one of the family’s homes in Colleton County. He has adamantly denied killing them. Murdaugh’s lawyers immediately asked for the prosecution’s evidence, and court rules require authorities turn it over in 30 days. That deadline was Monday, and defense lawyers said prosecutors didn’t provide the evidence because they wanted a judge to decide whether to require a protective order limiting to whom the defense can show the evidence and how it handles documents, photos and recordings.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., has introduced a bill that would prevent foreign powers like China from buying U.S. agricultural land, according to a press release. The bill plays off the PASS Act introduced on the House side in July by Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and co-sponsored by Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D. The Senate bill would amend the 1950 Defense Production Act to allow for the review of agricultural transactions, according to the bill’s language. The difference between Rounds’ bill and the Promoting Agriculture Safeguards and Security Act includes prohibiting China, Russia, Iran and North Korea from investing in agricultural land, as well as requiring the U.S. secretary of agriculture to report on the risk of foreign takeovers and investments in agricultural companies or land use for ag purposes. “Protecting American farmland is critical to maintaining our national security,” Rounds said. “In my travels around South Dakota, I’ve heard from many farmers and ranchers who are concerned about foreign adversaries owning American farmland.” More than 350,000 acres of farmland in South Dakota belong to foreign businesses, despite a 1979 law barring non-resident foreigners from owning more than 160 acres.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Two Black men who challenged their criminal convictions after jurors deliberated in a courthouse room containing Confederate symbols have received opposite rulings from different judges on the same appeals court. One was granted a new trial. The other was denied. The conflicting decisions likely mean the matter will be appealed up to the Tennessee Supreme Court to sort out the discrepancy. The rulings from two three-judge panels of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals center on trials held at the Giles County Courthouse, putting jurors in a room adorned with items maintained by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, including an antique Confederate flag and portraits of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Gen. John C. Brown. In June, a state commission approved plans to move the artifacts to a museum. This week, a panel of judges ruled unanimously against a new trial for Barry Jamal Martin, who went to trial in February 2020 and was convicted on drug charges and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The ruling says none of the jurors testified to “even noticing or being aware that the memorabilia was in the room.” The decision also questioned whether an average person would be able to recognize who was in the portraits or what the flag meant.\n\nTexas\n\nUvalde: Just months after an armed teenager entered Robb Elementary and killed two teachers and 19 children, a summer of conflicting government narratives has set parents on edge, particularly after a state report showed that 376 law enforcement officers showed up at Robb on May 24 but did not engage the shooter for more than an hour. Parents are now trying to plan for the back-to-school season and facing tough choices about their children’s education and safety. Some are keeping their kids in the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District when school starts Sept. 6, the Texas Tribune reports. Some are choosing home-schooling, and others are looking at private schools. At Uvalde High School’s auditorium this past week, district officials laid out for parents new safety measures and increased access to mental health resources for the upcoming school year. Superintendent Hal Harrell discussed the district’s partnership with Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine, which helps identify behavioral health needs of children and adolescents. The district is also contracting Rhithm, a company with an app that allows staff and students to log how they are feeling. Communities in Schools, a nonprofit focused on connecting students with resources, is also sending teams to the district to provide additional behavioral health support to students.\n\nUtah\n\nSanta Clara: A 12-year-old Little League World Series player was in critical condition Tuesday with what his family said was a head injury suffered when he fell off the top bunk of his bed at a dormitory complex. Easton Oliverson is a pitcher and outfielder for the Snow Canyon team out of Santa Clara. The Little League World Series began Wednesday in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. His dad, Jace Oliverson, is an assistant coach on the team. “I’ve always been a firm believer of prayer and the power that comes with it, and I feel like if people continue to rally around us that he will make a full recovery,” Oliverson told KSL-TV. “Right now it’s slow. They keep telling me it’s a cross-country race.” Oliverson gave an update on his son’s condition through Facebook and said doctors told him his son had punctured an artery, which caused bleeding on the brain and required the removal of a piece of skull. Snow Canyon Little League started an online store to support the team while in Williamsport. Now, proceeds from the fundraising will go toward Easton’s recovery. Snow Canyon is the first team from Utah to advance to the Little League World Series by winning the Mountain Region. The Santa Clara-based club plays its first game Friday at 1 p.m. and will face the winner of the New England vs. Southeast game.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A city police officer is on leave after he shot a man in the leg who was having an apparent mental health crisis Saturday afternoon, according to a news release from the Vermont State Police. David Johnson, 20, is still in the hospital, and no information has been shared by police about his condition. Sgt. Simon Bombard, who has worked for the Burlington Police Department for seven years, is on procedural administrative leave. Three police officers responded to a call just before 3 p.m. and found Johnson with a large kitchen knife standing outside the house and threatening suicide, according to the state police. The officers reportedly attempted to speak with Johnson, whom they knew from previous interactions, and de-escalate the situation. After about four minutes, Johnson reportedly charged one of the officers. The officer used an electroshock weapon on him, but it did not stop Johnson, according to the state police investigation. Another officer, whom state police have identified as Bombard, shot Johnson once in the upper left leg. The officer’s bullets also hit nearby occupied cars, and one person suffered minor injuries from broken glass. Johnson is expected to face charges, police said.\n\nVirginia\n\nMontpelier Station: The U.S. Postal Service has closed a small post office over agency management’s concerns about its location inside a historic train depot that also serves as a museum about racial segregation. In a statement this week addressing the closure, the USPS noted that the museum near former President James Madison’s Montpelier estate has historical signage above two exterior doors, one labeled “WHITE” and another labeled “COLORED.” It added that “Postal Service management considered that some customers may associate the racially-based, segregated entrances with the current operations of the Post Office and thereby draw negative associations between those operations and the painful legacy of discrimination and segregation.” The statement said operations were being suspended at the Montpelier Station Post Office with the intention of finding suitable alternative quarters in the community or, in the absence of any, proceeding with a study of whether to discontinue the branch. The post office location had one employee and operated four hours daily, according to the statement. It served about 100 people and closed in June, according to the Culpeper Star-Exponent.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The state’s apple crop is forecast to be a bit smaller this year because of the cool spring. The Washington State Tree Fruit Association projected this week that the 2022 fresh apple crop will total 108.7 million 40-pound boxes. That’s an 11.1% decrease from 2021’s 122.3 million boxes. “We are pleased with the size of the harvest, particularly in the face of a long, cold spring,” WSTFA President Jon DeVaney said. The estimate shows that five popular apple varieties make up the majority of the harvest. Gala leads production at 20%, and Red Delicious and Honeycrisp are each projected at 14%, followed by Granny Smith at 13.4% and Fuji at 12.7% of total production. Cosmic Crisp, which is grown only in Washington state, is 4.6% of the harvest, up from 3.2% last year. Washington apples are sold in over 40 countries and are the state’s top farm commodity, representing 20% of the state’s farm-gate agricultural value in 2020. On average, 30% of the harvest is exported.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Officials in one county hit by flooding this week are starting the task of removing residential debris. Curbside debris collection began Wednesday in flood-ravaged neighborhoods of eastern Kanawha County where up to 5 inches of rain fell Monday, the county commission said in a news release. Among the hardest-hit areas were Hughes Creek, Kelleys Creek and Campbells Creek. The statement said dump trucks will collect debris through at least Sunday. The cleanup comes as forecasters predict another rainy stretch of weather starting Saturday. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice declared a state of emergency in Kanawha and Fayette counties, enabling the National Guard to respond to hard-hit areas. Some people had to be rescued by boat as the flooding damaged more than 100 homes, bridges and roads, interrupted drinking water systems and left more than 2,000 customers without electricity. Along the Fayette-Kanawha county line, several feet of mud made roads impassible in the Smithers area. The state Department of Environmental Protection on Wednesday issued an advisory against the recreational use of a 10-mile area downstream of the Mount Olive Correctional Center to the London Locks and Dam.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A man vacationing in the city fell to his death after a drawbridge was raised while he was walking across it. Richard Dujardin, 77, of Providence, Rhode Island, was crossing the Kilbourn Avenue Bridge in downtown Milwaukee on Monday afternoon with his wife, according to a Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office report. Rosemarie Dujardin made it across the bridge, which spans the Milwaukee River, but her husband was about halfway across when it began to open. He grabbed onto a side rail as the bridge sections rose to a 90-degree angle, but he lost his grip and fell about 70 feet to the pavement below, the report says. He suffered a head wound and was pronounced dead at the scene, investigators said. The bridge is controlled by the city’s Department of Public Works, and its two halves are raised and lowered for boat traffic by someone working remotely who has two camera views of the span. The lights and bells were operational as the two sections were raised, and crossing arms came down at each end of the bridge, according to investigators. Interim Public Works Commissioner Jerrel Kruschke said the employee who operated the bridge is in his fourth year and has conducted hundreds of bridge openings. He said the employee has been put on leave and offered counseling.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon has a clear path to reelection after winning the Republican primary Tuesday, while state Rep. Chuck Gray won the GOP primary for secretary of state. Megan Degenfelder defeated incumbent Brian Schroeder in the GOP primary for state superintendent of public instruction. Democrats, meanwhile, have all but ceded these offices to Republicans, fielding just two candidates who don’t even have websites for governor and just one candidate for state superintendent. Gordon had faced fierce opposition within the GOP for public health measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus, causing speculation he’d face a tough primary challenge. He didn’t, after lifting a statewide mask mandate and other coronavirus restrictions. Last year, Gordon urged the National Rifle Association to move its headquarters from Virginia to Wyoming. In March, he signed a ban on most abortions that briefly took effect a month after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and is now on hold pending a lawsuit contesting the ban.

Updates on Paris heist.", "text": "French law enforcement officials are racing against the clock on Oct. 21 to find the thieves who carried out a brazen daytime heist at Paris' Louvre Museum.\n\nOn the morning of Oct. 19, the robbers shattered a window and stole eight pieces of \"priceless\" jewelry from the world’s most-visited museum, before escaping on motorbikes, French Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said on France Inter radio. The museum shuttered its doors following the robbery and remained closed Oct. 21, as it is every Tuesday.\n\nThe jewels are worth an estimated $102.63 million, Paris public prosecutor Laure Beccuau told RTL radio on Oct. 21.\n\nThieves executing this kind of heist typically dismantle or melt down the easily recognizable stolen goods \"as soon as possible, within hours, to cut down on the chances of being caught,\" said Erin Thompson, a professor of art crime at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Doing so inevitably diminishes some of their value, she said, but it also makes it harder to trace the items back to the museum.\n\nA specialized police unit known as the BRB, which has dealt with other high-profile robberies, is handling the investigation.\n\nFormer police officer Pascal Szkudlara, who served in the unit, told Reuters the investigators will analyze video footage, telephone records and forensic evidence.\n\n\"They can have teams working on it 24/7 and for a long period,\" Szkudlara said, expressing \"100%\" confidence the thieves would be caught.\n\nMeanwhile, France has ordered a security review at the Louvre, which welcomed 8.7 million visitors in 2024, and pledged to strengthen security measures at the country's other cultural institutions. Justice Minister Gerard Darmanin acknowledged to France Inter radio that officials \"failed\" to keep the \"priceless\" jewels safe.\n\n\"For too long we have looked into the security of visitors but not the security of artworks,\" Culture Minister Rachida Dati told M6TV.\n\nWhat will the thieves do with treasures?\n\nIn recent years, museum thieves have been moving away from stealing art for its cultural value, instead opting for smash-and-grab thefts of valuable items that can be easily broken down, Remigiusz Plath, the secretary of the International Council of Museum Security, told CNN.\n\n\"What we’ve definitely seen in the last five to seven years is some more shift toward raw materials theft,\" he told the outlet.\n\nIf the thieves who hit the Louvre are skilled, they are likely planning to recut the larger gems, said Thompson.\n\n\"There's a lot of value in the history, but again, you're going to get easily caught if you try and sell something like a crown of the Empress Eugénie versus a handful of diamonds,\" Thompson said.\n\nThere are a limited number of people with the necessary skills who are willing to take that risk, she said, so the gems could be recovered if something goes awry. But if the process is successful, the gems can be sold \"pretty easily\" and may never be seen again, even if the thieves themselves are arrested, Thompson said.\n\n\"The recovery of objects that are stolen for their material value is very rare,\" Thompson said.\n\nHow the Louvre heist unfolded\n\nAt about 9:30 a.m. local time, the robbers allegedly used a crane positioned on a truck to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon, a first-floor wing of the museum that houses the French Crown Jewels. They broke a window using an angle grinder, smashed two display cases and fled on motorbikes, according to Nuñez.\n\nProsecutors say the robbery took between six and seven minutes, and the robbers were unarmed but threatened guards with the angle grinders. Investigators believe three to four experienced thieves were involved.\n\nWhat was stolen from the Louvre?\n\nThe eight pieces taken from the gallery include a tiara, as well as earrings and a necklace from a sapphire jewelry set owned by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, the stepdaughter of Napoleon I.\n\nAn emerald necklace and a pair of earrings from the Marie-Louise set, the reliquary brooch, along with a tiara and brooch of Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III, were also taken.\n\nWhat was stolen from the Louvre? See the 8 pieces of jewelry thieves took, per officials\n\nThe burglars also allegedly attempted to take a diamond and emerald-covered gold crown owned by Empress Eugénie, but dropped it. The crown, which was damaged in the heist, was found on the ground outside the museum, Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said.\n\n\"Beyond their market value, these items have inestimable heritage and historical value,\" the Louvre said in a statement.\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/10/20/louvre-robbery-jewel-theft-seven-minutes/86798934007/", "title": "How thieves stole treasures worth millions from the Louvre Museum ...", "text": "It took four thieves just seven minutes to break into the famed Louvre Museum in Paris and steal eight pieces of jewelry worth millions in broad daylight at 9:30 a.m. Sunday.

Officials have acknowledged that lapses in security helped enable the daring theft, which took place with visitors inside 30 minutes after the museum opened.\n\n\"These days a Cartier store is better protected\" than the Louvre, according to a jewelry expert quoted by the Guardian.\n\nThe robbers used simple cutting tools and a truck-mounted powered ladder to gain access to a second-floor window of the Louvre. They were inside the museum for less than four minutes, officials said.\n\nHow did thieves break into the Louvre?\n\nFour men drove a truck with a powered extendable ladder and stopped on a road near the Seine River on the Louvre’s south side. They extended the ladder to a second-floor balcony of the museum.\n\nTwo men climbed the ladder to the balcony and used angle grinders and other power tools to break through and enter a window leading to the Gallery of Apollo. The other two men remained with the ladder truck.\n\nOnce inside, the men smashed glass display cases and took the jewelry. Museum alarms went off, and visitors were evacuated.\n\nThe thieves descended the ladder. One man tried to set fire to the ladder truck but was stopped by museum staff.

French President Emmanuel Macron in January unveiled a 10-year plan to fix the cultural institution's outdated infrastructure and ease congestion for visitors.\n\nThis isn’t the first heist at the museum. In 1911, a former museum employee made off with Leonardo Davinci's Mona Lisa in one of the most brazen art heists in history. The thief was later caught, and the painting was returned to the museum years later.\n\nIn 1976, masked burglars climbed metal scaffolding, broke a second-story museum window and stole the diamond studded sword of King Charles X.\n\nThe Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors in 2024. The museum houses some of the world’s most prized pieces of art from Ancient Egypt to the Renaissance and the modern day.\n\nWhat to know about the stolen Louvre jewelry\n\nTwo of the stolen pieces and the crown found on the ground outside the Louvre belonged to Empress Eugénie, who married Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, an heir of the famous French ruler, in 1853. She was empress until the French Empire fell. When her husband died in 1873, Eugénie was sent into exile in her native Spain, England and southern France.\n\nThe thieves took several pieces of sapphire jewelry owned by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense. Marie-Amélie was the queen of Louis-Philippe, who ruled France from 1830 to 1848. Queen Hortense married Napoleon's brother, Louis Bonaparte, in 1802. The two went on to rule Holland.\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nContributing: Sybille de La Hamaide and John Cotton, Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/10/22/louvre-director-security-camera-gaps-jewelry-heist/86842750007/", "title": "Louvre director blames security camera gaps for brazen jewelry heist", "text": "The Louvre's outdated security system failed to detect robbers in time to prevent a daytime heist of eight French crown jewels worth millions, the museum's director said on Oct. 22.\n\nThe group of burglars broke into the world's most-visited museum on Sunday, Oct. 19, using simple cutting tools and a truck-mounted powered ladder to gain access to the Paris museum. They stole eight pieces of \"priceless\" jewelry worth an estimated $102 million before escaping on motorbikes, French officials said.\n\nNews of the brazen robbery shocked the world and sparked criticism over the museum's lapses in security. Some French officials have called the incident a national humiliation.\n\nLaurence des Cars, the Louvre's president and director, testified about the heist before the French Senate's Culture, Education and Sport Committee on Oct. 22. Des Cars told French senators that she had tendered her resignation following the incident but was refused by Culture Minister Rachida Dati, who has also come under scrutiny over the robbery.\n\n\"We did not detect the thieves' arrival early enough,\" des Car said during the two-hour hearing, in which French senators questioned her on the museum's \"aging\" and weak security system.\n\nDes Cars acknowledged that the Louvre's cameras had failed to spot the burglars and that there were not enough cameras outside monitoring the museum's perimeter. She added that the exterior security cameras do not provide full coverage of the museum's facade and that the window the burglars broke through was not monitored by CCTV.\n\nLouvre director previously warned about the museum's antiquated security system\n\nEarlier this year, the museum requested assistance from the French government to restore and renovate its aging exhibition halls and better protect its countless works of art.\n\nIn a letter to Dati, des Cars pointed to several issues at the museum, including water leaks and \"worrying temperature swings which endanger the conservation of works of art.\" Des Cars also wrote that museum visits were a \"physical ordeal,\" with visitors having trouble finding artworks due to inadequate signage, lack of space for people to take a break, and insufficient sanitary facilities.In January, French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a 10-year plan to fix the cultural institution's outdated infrastructure and ease congestion for visitors.\n\nDuring the Oct. 22 hearing, des Cars said she had repeatedly warned that the centuries-old building was in a dire state. \"The warnings I had been sounding came horribly true last Sunday,\" she told French senators.\n\nDes Cars promised to create no-parking perimeters in areas around the museum, upgrade the security camera system, and ask the interior ministry to establish a police station inside the museum.\n\nThe heist, which occurred with visitors inside 30 minutes after the museum opened, also prompted security checks of cultural sites across France. Paris is home to multiple world-famous cultural institutions, including the Louvre and other museums such as the Orsay, Pompidou, and Quai Branly.\n\nUSA TODAY and Reuters previously reported that at least four French museums have been robbed over the last two months, including Paris' Museum of Natural History. French prosecutors said they had charged a Chinese-born woman for stealing six gold nuggets worth about $1.75 million from the Museum of Natural History in Paris. She was arrested in Barcelona while trying to dispose of some melted gold, according to prosecutors.\n\nLouvre heist sounds like a movie plot. Here's what Hollywood gets wrong.\n\nHow did robbers break into the Louvre?\n\nThe heist occurred at around 9:30 a.m. local time on Oct. 19 as visitors flooded into the museum, French officials said. Four suspects drove a truck with a powered extendable ladder and stopped on a road near the Seine River on the Louvre’s south side.\n\nThey then extended the ladder to a second-floor balcony of the museum, and two suspects climbed to the balcony while the other two remained with the truck, according to officials. They used power tools to break through a window leading to the gilded Gallery of Apollo, home to the French Crown Jewels.\n\nOnce inside, officials said they smashed glass display cases and snatched pieces of historic jewelry as the alarms sounded and the museum staff evacuated panicked tourists, officials said. The robbery took place about 270 yards from the painting of the Mona Lisa.\n\nLouvre heist: Museum reopens as director set to testify before French Senate\n\nThe two suspects then descended the ladder and all four escaped on two motorbikes, according to officials. Investigators believe three to four experienced thieves were involved in the heist.\n\n\"We saw some footage: they don't target people, they enter calmly in four minutes, smash display cases, take their loot, and leave. No violence, very professional,\" Dati told a local news outlet on Oct. 19.\n\nOfficials said the robbers had attempted to steal nine pieces from the collection but dropped one piece as they escaped. A diamond and emerald-covered gold crown owned by Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III, was found on the ground outside the museum. The crown sustained damage but was recovered, Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau previously said.\n\nFollowing the incident, the museum was closed for the rest of the day on Oct. 19 and remained closed through Oct. 21. The Louvre reopened to visitors on Oct. 22.\n\nWhat items were stolen from the Louvre?\n\nEight items were taken, some from matching sets, museum officials said:\n\nA sapphire tiara: Once owned by 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense.\n\nOnce owned by 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense.

The suspects drove a truck up to the museum, part of which was originally built as a castle. They stopped on a road near the Seine River on the south side.\n\nTwo of them climbed a ladder to a second-floor balcony carrying tools they used to break through a window leading to the gilded Gallery of Apollo, home to the French Crown Jewels. Once inside, they smashed glass display cases and snatched nine pieces of historic jewelry as the alarms sounded and the museum staff evacuated panicked tourists.\n\nLess than seven minutes after the brazen robbery began, they escaped on motorbikes in broad daylight. Despite several missteps ‒ including dropping a diamond and emerald-encrusted gold crown on their way out, leaving behind forensic evidence and being caught on security footage ‒ the robbers and the jewels still haven't been found.\n\nThough stealing royal treasures from an iconic location may sound like a scene from a heist movie, the reality is far less glamorous than you might think.\n\nThe key difference between real heists and their fictional counterparts is the level of security the thieves must conquer, according to Robert Wittman, a retired FBI agent who founded the bureau's international art crime team.\n\n\"There's no laser beams that these guys had to dance around like Catherine Zeta-Jones in the movie 'Entrapment,' and there was no walls coming together like Pierce Brosnan had with 'The Thomas Crown Affair,' \" said Wittman, author of \"Priceless: How I Went Undercover to Rescue the World's Stolen Treasures.\"\n\n\"None of that's real.\"\n\nInstead, museums are notoriously hard to protect. That means the robbers in Paris may not have been elite criminals, as the movies would suggest.\n\n\"This is sort of like 'Ocean's 11,' but a lot sloppier ... This was an elite smash and grab,\" said Christopher A. Marinello, founder of Art Recovery International, which has helped return about $600 million worth of stolen art. \"It wasn't the heist of the century, but it certainly, so far, could be the heist of the decade.\"\n\nSome real-life art heists have been elaborate\n\nSome of the most notorious art heists in history have involved the kind of subterfuge seen in the movies.\n\nIn 1990, for example, two robbers dressed as Boston police officers talked their way into the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, restrained the guards and made off with 13 pieces of artwork 81 minutes later. Around 2,000 artifacts were stolen from the British Museum over a long period in what the institution described in 2023 as an \"inside job.\"\n\nBut theft is a known risk for museums, which struggle to balance security with providing public access to national treasures, particularly in old buildings like the Louvre, according to Erin Thompson, a professor who studies art crime at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\nShe noted the stolen jewels were displayed in a gallery with big windows looking out onto a busy street, rather than deeper inside the building where they might have been harder to steal.\n\n\"I say museums have poor security, but it's sort of like 'well what else are they supposed to do?'\" she said. \"It's kind of a hazard of the game.\"\n\nJewel heist becoming more common\n\nThompson said the Louvre heist is one of an increasing number targeting gems and gold pieces that can be easily broken down and sold, unlike famous paintings and sculptures. Experts said the Louvre robbery bore many of the hallmarks of these crimes, including getting away on motorbikes, entering the property in broad daylight and using brute force.\n\n\"It's a pretty standard MO and we've seen more of this as jewelry stores have tightened their security,\" Thompson said.\n\nIn 2019, thieves stole pieces that contained more than 4,300 diamonds with an estimated $124 million by breaking through a grilled window at the Gruenes Gewoelbe museum in eastern Germany. Most of the jewels were eventually recovered.\n\nAt least four French museums have been robbed in the last two months, according to media reports, including Paris' Museum of Natural History. Prosecutors said they arrested a Chinese-born woman for the theft of six gold nuggets worth about $1.75 million from the museum while she was trying to dispose of some melted gold.\n\nIn January, robbers used explosives to gain access to the Drents Museum in the Netherlands and steal three golden bracelets and the golden helmet of Cotofenesti, from the fifth century B.C.\n\nBut Marinello, of Art Recovery International, said smaller museums in Europe have been the primary targets, which is what makes the Louvre heist \"so shocking and so brazen, so audacious.\" He said the heist highlights the need for all museums to tighten their security.\n\n\"This is very important cultural heritage that is at threat of being destroyed and lost forever, just so some stupid criminal can buy a Lamborghini SUV,\" he said. \"We need to stop it.\"\n\nContributing: Karissa Waddick, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/22"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nIf you have always suspected that you might just be a mosquito magnet, scientists now have evidence for you: Mosquitoes indeed are attracted to certain humans more than others, according to a new study.\n\nA research team led by Leslie Vosshall, a professor at Rockefeller University and head of its laboratory of neurogenetics and behavior, sought to identify why certain people seem to draw more mosquitoes than others. The research findings were published in the journal Cell on October 18.\n\nOver the course of three years, researchers asked a group of 64 volunteers to wear nylon stockings on their arms for six hours a day over multiple days. Maria Elena De Obaldia, the study’s first author and former postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller University, constructed a “two-choice olfactometer assay” – an acrylic glass chamber in which researchers put two of the stockings. The study team then released yellow fever mosquitoes, scientifically called Aedes aegypti, into the chamber and observed which stocking drew more insects.\n\nThis test allowed researchers to separate study participants into “mosquito magnets,” whose stockings drew lots of mosquitoes, and “low attractors,” who didn’t seem as enticing to the insects. The scientists scrutinized the skin of the mosquito magnets and found 50 molecular compounds that were higher in these participants than the others.\n\n“We had no preconceived notions about what we would find,” Vosshall, who is also chief scientific officer of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, told CNN. But one difference was particularly distinctive: The mosquito magnets had much higher rates of carboxylic acid on their skin than the low attractors.\n\nCarboxylic acids are found in sebum, the oily substance that creates a barrier and helps keep our skin moisturized.\n\nThe carboxylic acids are large molecules, Vosshall explained. They’re “not that smelly by themselves,” she said. But beneficial bacteria on the skin “chew on these acids, that produces the characteristic smell of humans” – which may be what attracts mosquitoes, according to Vosshall.\n\nOdor from skin secretions play a role\n\nOne participant, identified only as Subject 33, was the belle of the ball for mosquitoes: The subject’s stockings were 100 times more attractive to mosquitoes than the least attractive participants.\n\nAnd humans’ attraction level seemed to stay pretty constant over time for participants who were monitored over the three-year period, Vosshall said.\n\nSubject 33, for instance, “never took a day off from being the most attractive human,” which might be “bad news for mosquito magnets.”\n\nWhen it comes to Aedes aegypti, female mosquitoes prefer to use human blood to fuel their egg production, giving urgency to their quest to find humans to prey on. And these mini predators use a variety of mechanisms to identify and choose the humans they bite, Vosshall said.\n\nCarboxylic acids are just one piece of the puzzle in explaining how the pesky insects might choose their targets. Body heat and the carbon dioxide we release when we breathe also attract mosquitoes to humans.\n\nScientists still don’t know why carboxylic acids seem to attract mosquitoes so strongly, Vosshall said. But the next step might be to explore the effects of reducing carboxylic acids on the skin.\n\n“You can’t strip natural moisturizers off the skin completely, that would be bad for your skin health,” she said. However, Vosshall said dermatological products might be able to minimize carboxylic acid levels and reduce mosquito bites.\n\n“Every bite of these mosquitoes puts people into public health danger,” she said. “Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are vectors for dengue, yellow fever, and Zika. Those people who are magnets are gonna be much more likely to be infected with viruses.”\n\nMosquitoes evolved to hunt by scent\n\nMatthew DeGennaro, an associate professor at Florida International University who specializes in the neurogenetics of mosquitoes, told CNN that the results of the study help answer long-standing questions about what specific factors make mosquitoes love some humans more than others. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“This study clearly shows that these acids are important,” he said. “Now, how the mosquitoes perceive these carboxylic acids is interesting because these particular chemicals are really heavy, so they’re hard to smell at a distance.\n\n“It could be that these chemicals are being altered by, let’s say the skin microbiome, and it causes a certain kind of odor plume. Or it could be that other factors in the environment break down these chemicals a little bit, so they’re easier for mosquitoes to detect.”\n\nThe results are also “a really great example of how well insects can smell,” DeGennaro, added. “This insect has evolved to hunt us.”\n\nFor DeGennaro, the staying power of certain humans’ attractiveness is one of the most interesting aspects of the research.\n\n“We did not know that there were very stable preferences of mosquitoes for certain people,” he said. “It could suggest that the skin microbiome is important, although they did not address that.”\n\nFurther research should explore the microbiome that lives on human skin to understand why mosquitoes are attracted to certain compounds over others, he said. And that could lead to better products to reduce mosquito bites and the spread of disease.\n\n“I think if we understand why mosquitoes find a host, we can design new repellents that will block the mosquitoes from sensing those chemicals,” DeGennaro said. “And this could be used to improve our current repellents.”", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/04/robot-hostesses-veggie-booze-civil-death-news-around-states/39654047/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPrattville: A sheriff says jail inmates were caught making some truly “disgusting” alcohol out of fermenting vegetables. News outlets report it turned up when dozens of officers conducted a shakedown for contraband Monday at the Autauga Metro Jail. Autauga County Sheriff Joe Sedinger says it was the first time he’d seen vegetables being used to make alcohol. He says the jail stopped serving inmates fruit years ago because they made wine with it. Sedinger says searchers also found an electronic cigarette altered to be used as a tattoo gun, as well as dice fashioned from the plastic ball that’s in bottles of roll on deodorant. The sheriff says inmates won’t be punished for the contraband. He just wants to remind them that he’s watching the jail closely.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Wildlife officials and residents of a remote island are cheering the death of a wild rat. A Norway rat that likely was carried by ship was spotted last year on St. Paul Island in the Bering Sea. The Anchorage Daily News reports the island is an internationally known breeding habitat for millions of birds that lay eggs on rocks and tundra. Wildlife officials say an infestation of rats could devastate the bird population. A local wildlife conservation agency and federal officials assembled a team that set up baited rat traps. The rat avoided capture for 10 months but was found dead Sunday by a visiting bird watcher. Monitoring for other rats will continue.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Six itsy-bitsy black-footed ferrets have been born through the Phoenix Zoo’s recovery program. The litter from first-time mom Mandolin arrived two weeks ago. Mandolin will care for them for the next few months at the zoo, which has one of only six breeding facilities in the world for this particular endangered species. In the fall, specialists will determine which of the ferret babies – known as kits – will go to breeding facilities to become future parents and which will be released into the wild. Kits from this litter that are ultimately released will first go to the National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center in Colorado to prepare them for survival in the wild. Over 400 black-footed ferrets have been born at the Phoenix Zoo under the recovery program.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Finance officials say the state has ended the fiscal year with a $295 million budget surplus, nearly $74 million of which will go toward highway needs. The Department of Finance and Administration said Tuesday that the state’s net available revenue collection for the fiscal year totaled $5.9 billion, $426.5 million higher than the previous year and $231.2 million above forecast. Arkansas already had a $64 million surplus that was included in the state’s budget. The fiscal year ended Sunday. Twenty-five percent of the surplus will be transferred to the state Department of Transportation, while the rest will go toward reserve funds for other needs. The department says the state ended the year above forecast because of high growth in individual and corporate income tax collections.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A gigantic mansion built in 1991 for the late producer Aaron Spelling and his widow has been sold for $119.75 million. The Los Angeles Times says the sale that closed Tuesday is the highest home price ever in Los Angeles County. Set on 4.7 acres in Holmby Hills, the 56,600-square-foot chateau is the largest home in the city. The unidentified buyer was represented by a Beverly Hills real estate firm. Spelling produced such TV series as “Charlie’s Angels,” “Dynasty,” “Beverly Hills 90210” and “Melrose Place.” After his death in 2006, his widow, Candy, sold the mansion for $85 million to Petra Ecclestone, daughter of Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone. She made modifications, and the home now has 123 rooms, including 14 bedrooms and 27 bathrooms.\n\nColorado\n\nSteamboat Springs: Wildlife researchers say an elk traveled more than 250 miles across the state to give birth. The Steamboat Pilot and Today reports Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials placed a collar on the elk cow known as R190 near the town of Maybell in late March. Officials tracked the elk as she zigzagged east and crossed the Continental Divide. She gave birth last month in North Park, a large mountain valley in north-central Colorado. State wildlife researcher Nathaniel Rayl says the distance the elk traveled was significant, but elk don’t really have average migration distance. They may travel great distances one year but stay put the next. The elk was equipped with a GPS collar as part of a study tracking the survival of elk calves.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStafford Springs: A recently reopened mill in the state is helping the military bring back old-school Army uniforms by providing the high-quality woolen fabric used in their manufacture. American Woolen Company Inc. in Stafford Springs is gearing up to provide high-end wool to make the Army green uniforms that will be worn by soldiers and officers and that echo similar outfits worn by the military more than a half-century ago. Jacob Harrison Long, chief executive officer of the company, says the idea of the new uniform is to boost morale by harkening back to a time when military men and women were “very well-dressed.” Long said he bought the 19th-century mill in 2014 after the previous owner closed down and has hired back many of the previous owner’s workers.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: At the Robot Captain Crabs Cajun Seafood & Bar, new hostess Charlotte seems eager to show customers to their seats. “Please follow me to the table,” she says in a polite, girlish voice. Dressed in a purple uniform with a hat that looks like one worn by an old-fashioned bellhop, Charlotte waits until patrons are seated to say their server will be with them shortly, and she hopes they enjoy their meal. If someone bumps into her, Charlotte says “excuse me” and rolls out of their way. Charlotte, who seems like the perfect employee, is a robot, one of five now “working” at the new restaurant near Newark, where futuristic sci-fi meets rustic seafood. Owner Guang Chen says he believes the establishment could be one of the first in the nation to use robot servers and hosts. Though humans also greet customers and take orders, there are two “hostesses” and three “food runners” that can spin in circles and “talk” to customers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: City officials are pushing back against an unsubstantiated claim by President Donald Trump that he orchestrated a purge of homeless people there to shield visiting foreign dignitaries from having to see them. The claim was among a series of falsehoods leveled by Trump in recent days as he has seized on the homeless epidemic. He has also claimed, wrongly, that homelessness is a novel issue and suggested that local officials have deliberately exacerbated the problem for political gain. “It’s a phenomena that started two years ago. It’s disgraceful,” Trump told Fox News host Tucker Carlson. He then suggested he had done something to end homelessness in Washington, even though thousands still sleep on the streets of the nation’s capital and in its shelters, a claim that left D.C. officials baffled.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Shores: A Miami-area couple whose front-yard vegetable garden prompted a six-year legal battle with their village has held a ceremonial replanting of veggies under a new law legalizing such gardens statewide. Hermine Ricketts and husband Tom Carroll planted jalapenos, green bell peppers and other vegetables this week when the bill went into effect. Miami Shores previously made such front-yard gardens punishable by a daily fine of $50 on grounds they were unsightly and violated zoning codes. Miami Shores told Ricketts to remove her garden in 2013, prompting their lengthy lawsuit. An appeals court backed the village, but then the Legislature stepped in to legalize the gardens. Republican state Sen. Rob Bradley sponsored the bill.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The case of whether hackers may have tampered with elections in Georgia has taken another strange turn. Nearly two years ago, state lawyers in a closely watched election integrity lawsuit told the judge they intended to subpoena the FBI for the forensic image, or digital snapshot, the agency made of a crucial server before state election officials quietly wiped it clean. Election watchdogs want to examine the data to see if there might have been tampering, given that the server was left exposed by a gaping security hole for more than half a year. A new email obtained by the Associated Press says state officials never did issue the subpoena, even though the judge had ordered that evidence be preserved, including from the FBI. The FBI data is central to activists’ challenge to Georgia’s highly questioned, centrally administered elections system, which lacks an auditable paper trail and was run at the time by Gov. Brian Kemp, then Georgia’s secretary of state.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: Officials say the state’s last remaining native lowland bog is thriving again following a more than decadelong restoration effort. The Garden Island reports conservation groups have worked to restore native plants to the Kanaele Bog on Kauai after it became overrun with nonnative weeds and feral pigs. The Nature Conservancy signed a management agreement in 2003 and built a fence around 58 acres to keep out the pigs. They then pulled tens of thousands of weeds. The conservancy’s director of the Kauai forest program, Melissa Fisher, says the bog now has 95% plant coverage with 97% native plants. The bog is home to unique flowering plants, native grasses and sedges, as well as Hawaii’s only carnivorous plant – the mikinalo.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials are revising a 1999 plan as part of a strategy to recover endangered white sturgeon in the Kootenai River in northern Idaho and western Montana. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is taking public comments through July 29 on the draft recovery plan revisions released last week. The document reflects advancements in understanding of white sturgeon and changes that have taken place over the past two decades to help the fish rebound. Sturgeon have been around since the dinosaurs. They have armorlike scales and in the Kootenai River system have been recorded up to 10 feet long. But the population has struggled since the completion of Libby Dam in Montana in 1974, which altered the natural cycle of the river.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state saw an eighth straight year of record tourism growth in 2018, attracting more than 117 million visitors in 2018. U.S. Travel Association numbers released by the state this week show visitors to Illinois spent $41.7 billion over the previous year. That’s a more than 5% increase in visitor spending over 2017. Tourism generated $3.3 billion in state and local tax revenue, a more than 7% jump. Tourism was a boon jobs-wise too. The state says travel and tourism support more than 342,000 jobs last year. That’s up 5,200 jobs from 2017. The Illinois Office of Tourism credits the record numbers to successful marketing efforts. Gov. J.B. Pritzker called tourism “an integral part of our state’s economy.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State wildlife officials say an Asian carp species that poses a serious threat to mussel populations is advancing closer to the state’s waterways. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources says two black carp were captured last month in the Ohio River about 10 miles downstream of Indiana’s state line. Black carp feed on mollusks. They pose a serious threat to Indiana’s native mussel species, many of which are listed as endangered or of special concern. Black carp are native to Asia. They’ve been moving throughout the Mississippi River basin since escaping from captivity decades ago. The DNR asks anyone who catches a suspected black carp to keep it, note its location, cool it on ice once it’s dead and report it to the DNR by calling 1-866-663-9684.\n\nIowa\n\nNewton: Biofuel plants in the state are adding milkweed and other native plants to their properties so monarch butterflies can fuel up during the annual migration. WHO-TV reports that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says the monarch butterfly could warrant protection if something isn’t done to boost its population. That’s why the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association started its project called the “Monarch Fueling Station” in December 2018. The Renewable Energy Group plant situated on the northeast side of Newton is one of the latest ethanol and biodiesel plants to join the cause. “It’s a little bit of work to begin with, and it’s a small amount of maintenance,” plant manager Phil Abels says. But “the value that will be received goes way beyond any effort.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Drivers can no longer be charged with a crime for refusing a field sobriety test under a new state law. The Wichita Eagle reports that a change in state law that took effect Monday means police can’t ticket suspected drivers for not taking one. But refusal to comply comes with a yearlong license suspension, as long as the longest suspension for failing a breathalyzer or blood test. Drivers who refuse to be tested can still be prosecuted for a DUI based on other evidence. The decision to strike the law making it a separate violation comes amid court rulings on whether motorists driving on streets and highways give implied consent to sobriety tests.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A fire destroyed a massive Jim Beam warehouse filled with about 45,000 barrels of aging bourbon, sparking worries that runoff whiskey seeping into nearby waterways could kill fish. Firefighters from four counties responded to the blaze that erupted late Tuesday. It sent flames shooting into the night sky and generated so much heat that firetruck lights melted. The warehouse was a total loss. Looking to reassure consumers of Jim Beam bourbon, Beam Suntory indicated it amounted to a drop of the iconic brand’s total aging inventory. No injuries were reported, Woodford County Emergency Management Director Drew Chandler said. The fire was contained but was allowed to burn until midday Wednesday, he said. State officials warned recreational users on the Kentucky River that runoff would result in water discoloration, foaming and an odor.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State wildlife officials are upping the price they’ll pay hunters who catch a large aquatic rodent known for harming marsh ecosystems. Louisiana’s Department of Wildlife and Fisheries has increased the bounty from $5 to $6 after fewer nutrias have been caught than in the past. Nutrias are webbed-toed, buck-toothed rodents that are in between the size of muskrats and beavers. They’re known for nibbling on tree roots and causing erosion and damage to marshes. The Times Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports this damage has been increasing in recent years and affecting southeastern Louisiana most. Officials hope the greater sum will encourage more hunters to kill nutrias during the 2019-20 season. All they have to do to cash in is bring in the tails as proof.\n\nMaine\n\nHarpswell: Some parts of the state are finding relief from a rash-causing species of moth because of the cool and rainy spring. The browntail moth’s caterpillar is an invasive nuisance that causes itchy rashes and respiratory problems. But the Portland Press Herald reports damp weather in the late spring helped spur the spread of a fungus that kills the caterpillars. Scientists predicted earlier in spring that browntail moths would be especially bad this year. But the Maine Forest Service said Tuesday that field surveys have shown collapses of the pest due to the fungus. Such collapses have happened in communities including Arrowsic, Camden, Harpswell and Turner. The caterpillar’s high season is usually mid-May through June.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: A local minister is a top finalist in a nationally recognized singing competition. Joshua Copeland, 37, a praise and worship leader and minister at United Faith Churches of Deliverance, joins 19 other talents from across the nation and world on BET’s gospel-themed show, “Sunday Best.” Joshua is also the son of Bishop George Copeland. The premier of the show’s ninth season Sunday marked its return to television following a four-year hiatus. In a recorded interview, Copeland opened up about his experience growing up as a pastor’s son and being bullied in school because of his weight. “Being a PK has its challenges. Everybody feels like a pastor’s kid can do no wrong. He’s supposed to be the perfect kid. I talked to my parents a lot about it, and they always tell us, ‘We’re not perfect, so we’re not expecting you to be perfect, but we’re going to strive to do what God calls us to do,’ ” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAquinnah: The Martha’s Vineyard estate of former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is on the market for $65 million. Red Gate Farm in Aquinnah was a sheep farm and hunting cabin when Kennedy Onassis bought it in 1979. She added a more than 6,000-square-foot, five-bedroom main residence and a two-story, four-bedroom guest house. The estate, which includes more than a mile of private beachfront, also has several other buildings. The property is listed by Christie’s International Real Estate. It has been maintained by Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of Kennedy Onassis and President John F. Kennedy. Caroline Kennedy said in a statement that the estate was a perfect expression of her mother’s “romantic and adventurous spirit,” and she hopes that “a new family will treasure this place as we have for three generations.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Contemporary Motown artist Ne-Yo will join the Temptations, Martha Reeves and others from the label’s classic era during a concert marking the 60th anniversary of the recording company. The Motown Museum has set Sept. 22 for Hitsville Honors: Celebrating Berry Gordy & 60 Years of Motown, at Detroit’s Orchestra Hall. Others performing as part of the tribute to the company and its founder include the Four Tops, Mary Wilson, Big Sean and Kem. The concert is part of a three-day celebration dubbed Motown 60 Weekend. Other events include the Motown Gospel Concert on Sept. 21. The label paved a way for the Motown Museum to be built in Detroit. It was the first headquarters where Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, Miracles and others recorded before Motown decamped to California in 1972.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Norie, a 2-year-old golden retriever, is the newest staffer at the Ramsey County Attorney’s Office. She’s the latest in more than 200 so-called courthouse dogs around the country that are being used to help take some of the stress out of the place and help people work through the legal system. Tami McConkey, director of the victim witness and community services division for the prosecutor’s office, tells Minnesota Public Radio News that dogs help calm people down and help give them confidence to report what happened. Norie is believed to be the first courthouse dog in the state. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi says prosecutors and others understand the justice system can add to the trauma of crime. He says Norie may help ease that burden.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal lawsuit says the state is violating free-speech rights by banning makers of plant-based foods from using terms such as “meatless meatballs” and “vegan bacon.” The lawsuit was filed this week by the Plant Based Foods Association and the Illinois-based Upton’s Naturals Co., which makes vegan products and sells them in many states, including Mississippi. It was filed the same day the Magnolia State enacted a new law that bans plant-based products from being labeled as meat. A similar lawsuit was filed in Missouri last year by the Oregon-based Tofurky Co., which makes vegetarian food products, and The Good Food Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for alternatives to meat. A Missouri law made it a misdemeanor to label plant-based products as meat. Meat producers have been pushing to protect meat terminology.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The Kansas City Public Library has forgiven $250,000 in overdue fines and will no longer charge late fees on any materials. The Kansas City Star reports that the changes were announced last Friday at the library’s southeast branch. Mayor-elect Quinton Lucas said the decision was made to give more people access to the city’s libraries. About 9,000 patrons with suspended library cards will regain access to library resources. Library director Crosby Kemper III says the fee change will increase children’s use of the library system. More than 450 libraries in the U.S. have done away with fines, but Kemper says the Kansas City Public Library is the first major library in the region to do so.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: A nonprofit foundation that raises money for projects in Yellowstone National Park has about $4.35 million in debt. John Walda, interim CEO of Yellowstone Forever, told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle the organization made faulty revenue projections when it was formed by combining the Yellowstone Association and the Yellowstone Park Foundation in 2016. Yellowstone Forever invested in staff, buildings and technology based on the inaccurate projections. Yellowstone Forever has provided $18 million to the park for projects but will reduce its cash support and hold some jobs open as it works to get back on better financial footing. There have been layoffs, and several employees have resigned, including CEO Heather White last month.\n\nNebraska\n\nBeatrice: A biodiesel plant is ceasing production in this southeast Nebraska city. Flint Hills Resources announced this week that the Duonix Beatrice plant is being idled indefinitely. The Beatrice Daily Sun reports the plant processes corn oil and greases into biodiesel. The prices of soybeans used by most other biodiesel producers are so low that the Duonix plant was put at a competitive disadvantage. Flint Hills does not expect those conditions to change. Duonix Beatrice began operation in 2016 and is a joint venture of Flint Hills Resources and Benefuel Inc. The plant was built in 2008 but wasn’t finished and never operated until purchased and refitted for biodiesel production. Officials say severance packages will be offered to the fewer than 40 plant employees.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Nevada Highway Patrol says passengers must be alive in order to be counted as occupants in cars using the high-occupancy vehicle lane. The reminder was prompted by a traffic stop Monday involving a hearse traveling on the carpool lane on Interstate 15 in Las Vegas. A trooper pulled over the hearse that was transporting a dead body. The agency says the hearse driver assumed the body in the back counted toward the requirement of two or more occupants for the lane. The trooper let the driver off with a warning and advised him to move out of the lane. The agency says only living, breathing people can be counted for the HOV lane.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Durham: Partnership efforts have resulted in the preservation of 2,000 acres overlooking Merrymeeting Lake as a community forest. The Birch Ridge Community Forest in New Durham rises over the lake with views of Mount Molly and Mount Bet. It filters clean water to the lake and Coldrain Pond. The forest offers 13 miles of trails for hikers, cross-country skiers, hunters and birders. And it offers critical habitat for wide-ranging species such as moose, bear, deer and bobcat. The forest’s protection was helped by donations from community members and the town; grants from the U.S. Forest Service and New Hampshire Land and Community Heritage Investment Program; and the state Department of Environmental Services. A community event celebrating the conservation is planned for July 13.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEast Rutherford: Officials have finally set an opening date for a massive retail and entertainment center in the Meadowlands. The long-delayed American Dream project will open Oct. 25. The announcement was made Wednesday by its developer, Triple Five. American Dream will feature 3 million square feet of retail, dining and entertainment, including more than 450 stores and restaurants. The project includes an amusement park, an indoor ski slope, an indoor ice skating rink, an indoor water park and more. The project has been plagued by financial problems since the first contract was awarded in 2003. The immense structure, once called “the ugliest damn building in New Jersey” by former Gov. Chris Christie, has sat unfinished between MetLife Stadium and the New Jersey Turnpike for years.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State health officials are predicting one of the worst mosquito seasons in decades thanks to wetter weather earlier this year. KOB-TV reports health officials believe the mosquito population and the threat of West Nile virus are on the rise as monsoon season approaches. Mark DiMenna of the Albuquerque Environmental Health Department says the city is preparing for a bad mosquito season, the likes of which they haven’t seen in 15 years. Standing water along arroyos, ditches, wetlands and even the side of the road is a breeding ground for mosquitoes. New Mexico’s largest city uses larval control through water management and source reduction and with the use of environmentally friendly, EPA-approved chemicals.\n\nNew York\n\nVernon: A key local official says hosting the Woodstock 50 anniversary festival on short notice “could pose a significant challenge.” A mass gathering permit application for the Vernon Downs harness track and casino in central New York was recently filed after operators of the original festival site pulled out last month. Oneida County Executive Anthony Picente released a statement Tuesday noting the challenge of preparing for the health and safety of residents and concertgoers with the event just over a month away. The Woodstock festival has faced a series of setbacks, including the losses of a financial partner, a production company and its original site. Vernon Downs has said it can host up to 65,000 people, far fewer than the 150,000 planned for Watkins Glen International.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Vehicle owners now have another option from which to choose when it comes to the state’s regularly priced license plate. The Division of Motor Vehicles began offering a third standard plate this week. Previously motorists could choose between the “First in Flight” background or the “First in Freedom” theme, which refers to pre-Revolutionary War events. Now they can pick a plate with the national motto “In God We Trust” at the top and the state motto “To Be Rather Than to Seem” near the bottom. A 2018 law directed that the DMV create the new option. The agency says current vehicle owners can request the new plate at no additional charge when they renew their car registration. They’ll pay a standard charge if it’s requested at another time.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nJamestown: The National Buffalo Museum says the herd’s white bull bison has died from injuries suffered in an accidental fall into a ravine. Dakota Miracle was 13 years old. The museum says the bison’s health was compromised due to a genetic condition resulting in lack of pigmentation. That caused Dakota Miracle to have poor eyesight, a factor believed to have led to his fall. NewsDakota reports museum board president Don Williams and executive director Ilana Xinos found Dakota Miracle deceased during a routine herd and pasture inspection. Dakota Miracle was the son of White Cloud, an albino bison that lived with the museum’s herd for almost two decades. The National Buffalo Museum’s mission is to educate the public on the cultural and historical significance of the American bison.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: If your summer plans involve traveling through the Buckeye State, and you’re still a fan of paper maps, it’s time you met Bruce Hull. He’s been injecting visual flair, handy information and a hidden bit of his own family history into Ohio’s road maps for almost two decades. Hull’s artistry has appeared on millions of maps helping drivers navigate the state, which has the nation’s fourth-busiest highway system. As a layout design artist with the Ohio Department of Transportation since 1989, Hull has creative control over the map’s look and feel. One year, his design resembled the front of a refrigerator packed with photos of Ohio attractions. He always works to make featured venues reflect the diversity of the state’s racial and ethnic groups; its rural, urban and natural landscapes; and its cultural and recreational offerings.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Medicaid agency is warning its SoonerCare members to keep current their address on file with the agency or risk losing their health care benefits. The Oklahoma Health Care Authority sent out a public reminder Wednesday of the new rule that was signed by Gov. Kevin Stitt last week. The agency says it intends to launch outreach efforts through social media and through outbound phone calls to SoonerCare recipients after hours and on weekends. Agency officials say the new rule is needed to comply with federal guidelines. But advocates for the poor have criticized the policy, saying low-income people move more frequently, and many members will be wrongfully cut from the programs. About 20% of Oklahoma’s population, more than two-thirds of them children, is enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Despite broad support, a measure that would put the state’s controversial jury system before voters died in the Oregon Senate during the final days of the 2019 legislative session. Oregon is the only state in the country that allows for convictions via non-unanimous juries in criminal felony cases. House Joint Resolution 10 would have put before voters on the November 2020 ballot a proposed change to the Oregon Constitution. If passed, it would have mandated that criminal jury verdicts be unanimous, as is the case with the federal government and all other 49 states. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that with the measure dead, the state’s legal community turns to the U.S. Supreme Court, which will take up non-unanimous juries during its next term.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf has signed legislation that his office says clarifies the options for whom school districts and private schools can hire as armed security guards, although Wolf’s administration says it bars districts from allowing teachers to be armed. The bill also expands training requirements for armed school officers. It says schools can hire armed security guards on contract, as long as they meet certain certification standards. It also expands the definition of a school officer to include a county sheriff or deputy sheriff. Wolf’s office says schools were already employing both. In a statement, Wolf says teachers cannot be considered security personnel and aren’t authorized to be armed in schools under any law in Pennsylvania. Most Democratic lawmakers opposed the bill, saying allowing more guns into school won’t solve school shootings.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging the constitutionality of a state statute that punishes inmates serving life in prison with “civil death.” The ACLU’s Rhode Island chapter filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of two inmates. A spokeswoman for the Rhode Island attorney general says the office is reviewing it and can’t comment on pending litigation. Rhode Island is one of the few places where inmates serving life in prison are deemed dead, by state statute, with respect to property rights, marriage and other civil rights, as if their natural death took place when they were convicted. Most civil death laws in the United States have been repealed or successfully challenged in court. Most countries never adopted the practice. Rhode Island’s statute from 1909 is still enforced.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: The Greenville Zoo’s newest giraffe has arrived. Autumn, a female Masai giraffe, went into labor Sunday night and gave birth just before 10:30p.m., according to a release from the city. The giraffe was up and walking within an hour and nursing soon after, according to the release. The calf is a 6-foot-1-inch male weighing 165 pounds, the release says. The calf is expected to access the giraffe exhibit Wednesday with his mom. Kiden, the baby’s sister, will be allowed to join Autumn and the calf Thursday. Miles, the giraffe’s father, is separated from the family so the baby can bond with Autumn without interruption, according to the release.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A new state law effective this week eliminates the need for a permit to carry a concealed pistol. South Dakota is the 14th state to enact such a law for both residents and visitors. Pennington County Capt. Marty Graves tells KOTA-TV he thinks it’s a good thing for gun owners. Graves says it will lighten the work load for his office because it will no longer issue the permits and collect the fees. Before the new law took effect this week, people could be charged with a misdemeanor if they carried a concealed pistol or had one concealed in a vehicle without a permit.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee State Library & Archives has launched a digital project that uses pension records to map out where soldiers lived before and after the Revolutionary War. State Librarian and Archivist Chuck Sherrill announced the Patriot Paths online initiative at the National Genealogical Society’s recent annual convention. It helps researchers study migration patterns of soldiers born in the colonies and Europe who ultimately traveled to Tennessee. About 2,000 pension files exist for the thousands of veterans who came to Tennessee after the war. Most soldiers weren’t eligible for pensions until they were in their 80s, so it’s a smaller subset of those who served. Library workers used the records to find dates and places where soldiers were born, married, enlisted and died. The information was coordinated with GIS mapping.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A new law legalizing hemp in the state is creating problems for authorities that will likely cost millions of dollars to fix and has temporarily stopped the prosecution of some misdemeanor cases involving marijuana, hemp’s plant cousin. After the 2018 federal Farm Bill made hemp legal in the U.S., states like Texas passed legislation allowing farmers to grow it. Texas’ new law provides a specific definition of marijuana, based on its percentage of THC, the compound that gets users high. But before the new law, Texas authorities only needed to show the presence of THC in suspected marijuana. Officials say most Texas crime labs can’t test for exact amounts of THC. District attorneys in at least four Texas counties say they’ll stop accepting misdemeanor marijuana cases until the problem is fixed.\n\nUtah\n\nOrem: Several environmental groups are working together to shut down unauthorized trails and formalize new ones near a wildlife area in northern Utah. The Daily Herald reports dozens of volunteers gathered June 29 at the Timpanogos Wildlife Management Area in Orem to begin rehabilitating parts that have become overrun by unauthorized bike trails in recent years. Biologists have said urban development threatens habitats in the area used by deer and elk. Volunteers closed off switchbacks, broke up the soil to help vegetation grow and placed new signs directing people to designated paths. Some volunteers said they want the area to be sustainable for wildlife and trail users. The project is expected to take at least a year and will reduce total trail mileage from approximately 40 miles to 20.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont State Colleges System is planning for its future as it faces reduced enrollment, underfunding and other challenges and as a number of private schools go out of business. The Rutland Herald reports that a long-range planning committee is hoping to find solutions. It’s part of a project to keep the state colleges – made up of Castleton University, Community College of Vermont, Northern Vermont University and Vermont Technical College – thriving and relevant. The office of Vermont State Colleges Chancellor Jeb Spaulding released a report earlier this month that looked at reduction of population, the low amount of state funding, and the rise of large universities offering remote education at a lower cost, among other challenges.\n\nVirginia\n\nUpperville: Three new historical markers aim to remember the philanthropic efforts of Paul Mellon. Paul Mellon was heir to the financial and industrial fortune of his father, Andrew W. Mellon. He supported universities, civic improvement projects, conservation efforts and fine-arts institutions. The markers issued by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources were set to be dedicated Thursday in Upperville. One marker highlights Paul Mellon’s life and philanthropy. Another highlights Rokeby Stables, where Mellon bred and raised champion racehorses in Fauquier County. Mellon died in 1999. A third marker highlights the work of his first wife, Mary Elizabeth Conover Mellon, whose interests led to the founding of the Bollingen Foundation and publication of the writings of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung in English.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has voted unanimously to enable the construction of more and bigger backyard cottages in all neighborhoods while removing requirements that property owners live on site and provide off-street parking. The Seattle Times reports Councilmember Mike O’Brien and other proponents touted the new rules for accessory units passed Monday as a gentle and environmentally sustainable way to add living options in response to the city’s population growth. They say it will open up pricey neighborhoods. Proponents included urbanists, labor unions, homebuilders and the AARP. Critics of the new rules, led by the Queen Anne Community Council, warned about the changes allowing developers to replace modest older houses with up to three rental units. They say the plan would make Seattle’s low-density blocks less desirable.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice says the state collected more revenue growth this fiscal year than any other year in state history. The Republican governor announced in a news release Tuesday that general revenue growth hit $511 million in the fiscal year that ended Sunday. He says the figure is due to the state taking in high amounts of consumer sales, personal income, corporate net income and severance taxes. Growth in oil and natural gas sales, as well as “enhanced construction industry activities,” contributed to the total. Justice says last fiscal year’s revenue growth is one-and-a-half times the combined growth for fiscal years 2007 to 2017.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Scientists with the state Department of Natural Resources are searching for sick snakes. Agency biologists are looking for snakes infected with snake fungal disease. SFD has the potential to devastate snake populations because it prevents snakes from effectively feeding and drinking and causes extended basking periods, leaving snakes more vulnerable to predators. The disease has been confirmed in Buffalo, Crawford, Dane, Grant, La Crosse, Outagamie, Sauk and Trempeleau counties since 2011. DNR biologists are literally turning over rocks and logs in an effort to find infected snakes and put together a more complete map of confirmed cases. DNR officials are encouraging anyone who sees a wild snake to send photos to the agency and report any snakes with unusual lumps, lesions or scabs.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state’s first-quarter economic report shows a modest recovery, but the news came out just a day after the unexpected closure of two coal mines in Campbell County put nearly 600 people out of work. Chief economist Wenlin Liu said Tuesday that the state gained 4,400 jobs from January through March, but a lot of them are related to construction of oil and gas pipelines and wind energy projects and are therefore temporary. Liu says miners who lost their jobs with the closure of the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines are entering a job market in need of workers, but the jobs don’t pay as well. The Gillette News Record reports a bankruptcy judge on Wednesday rejected a financing proposal to keep the mines open while owners restructured debt.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/green-mountain/2014/08/29/vermont-bumblebee-tumbles/14744437/", "title": "A bumblebee vanishes", "text": "JOEL BANNER BAIRD\n\nFree Press Staff Writer\n\nAlmost every bumblebee you see this year will be dead before the year's end. That's normal.\n\nBumble bees are burly — even brawny. But, with the exception of next year's queens, they are annuals. They end their lives with winter.\n\nWhat's not normal: The last living rusty-patch bumblebee — one of Vermont's more common species, once upon a time — was spotted in the Burlington Intervale on Aug. 31, 1999.\n\nTo the untrained eye, the absence of Bombus affinis might pass unnoticed.\n\nNow, 15 years after its disappearance, this bumblebee is a strong candidate to be listed as an endangered species in Vermont.\n\nIn legal language, this would define Bombus affinis as a creature \"whose continued existence as a viable component of the state's wild fauna or flora is in jeopardy.\"\n\nAren't there plenty of other, apparently healthy bumblebees bobbing through the pollen of our cone-flowers, goldenrod, blueberries, sunflowers, cranberries, eggplants and tomatoes?\n\nMaybe.\n\nHas anyone been counting?\n\nThankfully, yes.\n\nThe region's most recent bumblebee survey was undertaken in 2012-13 by the Vermont Center for Ecostudies, based in Norwich. The study's architects still are combing through the data dating back to 1915.\n\nOne of the survey's easier conclusions: The rusty-patch bumblebee has been \"extirpated\" — which in Latin translates roughly to \"yanked out by the stalk and roots.\"\n\nYet for many centuries, Bombus affinas flew in stolid formation with other native bumblebees, supremely well suited to cool, overcast and damp weather: They are \"true Vermonters,\" joked Kent McFarland, a conservation biologist at the center.\n\nMcFarland and other scientists term the rusty-patch's decline as not merely unfortunate, but also perhaps cautionary in the canary-in-the-coal-mine sort of way.\n\nUnder glass\n\nSince the 1960s, University of Vermont science students have returned from field trips, mostly in Chittenden County, with their netted insect samples.\n\nPinned and mounted, each insect was accompanied by an almost microscopic, hand-written label chronicling its date and place of capture.\n\nA glance through the glass-topped boxes of bumblebees at the university's Thompson Natural History Collection confirms that, for awhile anyway, the rusty-patch was commonplace.\n\n\"The cool thing about these students is, that they're just swinging their nets — they're not looking for any particular species,\" McFarland said. \"But what you find is that in the mid-'90s, all of the sudden this species just crashes out of the collection.\"\n\nThe rusty patch's plummet in Vermont is a part of the same depressing trajectory that has led to the insect's virtual disappearance throughout its former range — from eastern Canada to Georgia and through much of the American Midwest.\n\nMight the decline be tied somehow to the epidemics that now routinely wipe out honeybees? They share many of the same suspects.\n\nMcFarland outlined the short list:\n\n• Parasites and pathogens.\n\n• Loss and fragmentation of habitat.\n\n• Rapid climate change.\n\n• A newer generation of agricultural and home-and-garden pesticides.\n\nAn uptick in any of them, he said, can compound the collective damage.\n\nThe damage\n\nEuropean greenhouse owners probably contributed to the bumblebee declines in the 1990s, McFarland said: Farmers recognized the efficiencies of American bumblebees' \"buzz-pollination\" or \"sonication\" — in which the insects grab flower stamens and vibrate their wings, shaking loose sticky pollen.\n\nThe Dutch, in particularly, succeeded in propagating North American bumblebees.\n\nBut while in Europe, strays likely picked up protozoan parasites, which hitched rides back here when American farmers imported Dutch-reared colonies: \"The hot spots correlate to hot houses,\" McFarland said.\n\nOther detective work correlates the bees' decline to the rise in use of neonicotinoid pesticides, commonly shortened to \"neonics.\"\n\n\"The science on this is pretty clear,\" said Leif Richardson, who worked with McFarland on the bumblebee survey.\n\nRichardson, a doctoral student at Dartmouth College, specializes in research on chemical and microbial interactions between bees, pollen and nectar. He also co-authored \"Bumble Bees of North America: An Identification Guide\" for Princeton University Press.\n\nNeonicotinoids are a systemic pesticide, Richardson said: They are absorbed by plants, and insects that feed on the plant tissue are poisoned.\n\nUnlike flies, wasps and many other insects, bumblebees get their protein exclusively from plants (pollen and nectar high on the menu) — which might help explain the die-offs.\n\nMcFarland summarized these grim findings in a dense, 25-page report to the Vermont Endangered Species Committee, for which he serves as chief adviser for invertebrates.\n\nCoincidentally, the committee's chairwoman, plant biologist Dorothy Allard, works just down the hall (at UVM's Torrey Hall), where the insect collection resides.\n\nAlerted to the presence of a visitor to this normally quiet corner of campus, she, too, walked over to take a look at the last of the state's rusty-patch bumblebees.\n\nHer account of the committee's deliberations was a short one: In December, the group voted to recommend the bee's endangered status to the Agency of Natural Resources.\n\nWildlife experts at the Agency of Natural Resources have since signed off on the committee's findings.\n\nTrade-offs\n\nAgency Secretary Deb Markowitz has the final say in the matter. She has no deadline for a decision.\n\nMarkowitz said recently she is \"inclined\" toward the endangered listing for the rusty-patch bumblebee, not because there is imminent hope of its rescue, but to a large extent to help raise public awareness of threats to the insect's habitat.\n\nShe offered the agency's 2011 listing of the little brown bat and the northern long-eared bat (in the wake of devastating white-nose fungal infections) as a \"tremendously successful\" effort to alert Vermonters to those species' value, along with their precarious state.\n\n\"We have to consider that these die-offs are perhaps indicators of larger issues,\" Markowitz said.\n\nPractically speaking, the secretary added, the bee's listing could fast-track funding for research on how Vermont might again be a healthy habitat for the bee.\n\nThe slowdown in listing approval is due in part to discussions involving how Vermonters might use more restraint in their use of neonicotinoids.\n\nIn response to concerns from the farming community about how restrictions (voluntary or otherwise) might play out, Markowitz instituted a series of discussions with counterparts in the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets.\n\nCary Giguere, who oversees the agriculture agency's management of chemicals, said he appreciated the heads-up: \"a gracious commitment to outreach.\"\n\nGiguere also summarized the challenges to \"best-management practices\" for neonics:\n\n• Seeds for field (silage) corn brought into the state typically are neonic-treated. The pesticide, designed to be absorbed by young plants, has been known to fly off seeds as a dust during planting, with the potential to contaminate adjacent crops, pasture and wildflowers.\n\n• Neonics are the pesticides of choice for mosquitoes that carry the Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus.\n\n• Bedding plants sold by nurseries and large retailers often are treated with neonicotinoids.\n\nMarkowitz agreed that such considerations must be aired and weighed.\n\n\"We don't want uncertainty,\" she said.\n\n\"We're sensitive to the needs of agriculture,\" Markowtiz added. \"Pollinators are important to agriculture. This is an alignment of interests.\"\n\nGive it up\n\nIn the European Union this year, a two-year ban is in effect for the most widely used neonicotinoids.\n\nA \"high acute risk\" to pollinators was cited by the European Food Safety Authority as the primary concern for the hiatus — an assertion under appeal by the pesticides' manufacturers, Bayer and Syngenta.\n\nIn the U.S., the Department of Agriculture Research Service acknowledges online the possible role of those pesticides as a \"stressor\" to bee populations, but dismisses research that claims a direct link between neonics and bee declines.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, under pressure from advocacy groups, has agreed to review its certification of the major neonicotinoids, and complete the findings by 2019.\n\nThe Vermont Law School in Royalton has decided not to wait around.\n\nOn Aug. 7, Vermont Law announced that the school had become the country's first neonic-free higher-education campus.\n\n\"We don't have crops here, but we have gardens — and we plan to develop more pollinator-friendly areas,\" said Laurie Ristino, director of the school's Center for Agriculture and Food Systems.\n\nThe designation, made through Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit Center for Food Safety, might prompt a broader — and more urgent — discussion of food systems, pesticide policy and climate change, Ristino said.\n\n\"How do we move together as a society? How do we both grow crops and protect our pollinators?\" she asked. \"These are not easy questions, but they're questions we really need to grapple with.\n\n\"If you don't reach out and get multiple perspectives,\" Ristino added, \"you get less durable solutions.\"\n\nBig, fuzzy\n\nIn Norwich, field biologist Sara Zahendra continues to peck away, with McFarland, at the results of the Vermont Center for Ecostudies' survey of bumblebees.\n\nWhat drew her to the Bombus genus in the first place? Zahendra didn't hesitate. Professionally, she's fascinated by their haploid-diploid chromosomes.\n\nShe explained to a novice: Bumblebees' vulnerability to environmental disruption is amplified by the genetic closeness within a brood.\n\nThe shared DNA that likely spurs social behavior in bees can, when constrained by habitat loss and dwindling numbers, result in inbreeding and a faster spiraling-down of group health, she said.\n\nOut of consideration to a non-specialist, Zahendra allowed a personal perspective.\n\n\"They're docile,\" she said. \"Everyone seems to know what they are, and likes them. They're big, and they're fuzzy. Some insects, like the bumblebee, are loveable.\"\n\nContact Joel Banner Baird at 660-1843 or joelbaird@FreePressMedia.com.

Kay Ivey said South Korean auto parts manufacturer Shinhwa Group is investing $42 million in a facility and will create 95 jobs in Auburn, the company’s first manufacturing facility in the United States. Construction is already underway. Phase 1 of the project is expected to be finished by the summer. Shinhwa will initially make driveshafts for vehicles built by Hyundai Motor Manufacturing’s plant in Montgomery, as well as for Kia Motor Manufacturing’s plant, just across the state line in West Point, Georgia. Alabama Department of Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said the company is a “welcome addition” to the state’s network of “high-caliber auto suppliers.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Northern fur seals have declined at the world’s largest rookery in Alaska’s Pribilof Islands, but they’re thriving at an unlikely location. Numbers of fur seals continue to grow on Bogoslof Island, a tiny landmass at the tip of an active undersea volcano in the Aleutian Islands. The volcano two years ago spewed ash into the path of jetliners. Hot mud, steam and sulfurous gases continue to spit up from vents on the island. Fur seals give birth and raise pups along the beach of the island that’s only about one-third the size of New York City’s Central Park. Tom Gelatt of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said biologists in 2015 estimated there were 28,000 pups on the island. He said the 2019 estimate likely will be more than 36,000 pups.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The Arizona Game and Fish Department is investigating the poaching of a bull elk north of Heber in late August and is asking for the public’s help finding whoever killed the animal. The agency said Tuesday the poacher left the bull elk’s meat to waste west of Forest Road 153 near Point and Javelina water catchments. Agency officials said in a press release they believe someone has information about the case because the poaching incident occurred during a time when many hunters were scouting the area for upcoming hunts. Other recreationists are also believed to have been in the area at the time of the crime, the agency said. Hunting elk and other types of game in Arizona is regulated by the department. Hunters are required to draw permits, which are limited in number and allow them to hunt a limited number of game. Hunting can take place only in designated areas during designated periods. Most elk hunting takes place during the fall season in Arizona, although there are a few locations designated during other times of the year, according to the Game and Fish website. Anyone with information about the poaching incident should call the department’s Operation Game Thief hotline at 800-352-0700 or visit www.azgfd.gov and refer to case #19-003199. Callers can remain anonymous upon request and might be eligible for a reward of up to $1,500 upon an arrest. The Arizona Elk Society and Arizona Deer Association are each offering an additional $2,500 reward upon the arrest and conviction of the poachers, according to a press release from the department.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: The Saracen Casino Annex, the largest tourism investment project in Arkansas, opened Tuesday morning. The annex is part of the $350 million Saracen Casino Resort project owned and operated by the Oklahoma-based Quapaw Nation. The casino resort is expected to open next June. About 10,000 guests have visited the 300-slot-machine annex since Friday’s surprise “soft opening.” Quapaw Nation officials said they plan to employ 1,100 people permanently at the Saracen Casino Resort. More than 200 are employed at the annex and a new nearby convenience store and gas station. Most hires came from Pine Bluff. The project is expected to feature 2,000 slot machines and 50 gambling tables, along with a 300-room hotel with a fire safety and an emergency services facility.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Residents had a chance to see a mini-air show as the Royal Air Force Red Arrows aerobatic team tours California. The team flew past the famed Hollywood sign Wednesday afternoon and headed south to the Port of Long Beach to fly over the retired British ocean liner Queen Mary, which is now a tourist attraction and hotel. On Tuesday, the Red Arrows’ jets flew over San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate bridge. This weekend, they will join the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, the Canadian Forces Snowbirds and other performers at the Great Pacific Airshow over the surf at Huntington Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A falcon that has served as the mascot for the U.S. Air Force Academy for the past 23 years has died. KCNC-TV reported the passing of the falcon named Aurora was announced by the academy on Wednesday. The academy said in a statement that the falcon was the longest-serving live mascot in the school’s 65-year history. Aurora was reported to have recovered after suffering injuries to its wings in November 2018 during a prank abduction before the annual football game against the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. The Air Force Academy uses several falcons during home games and Aurora attended most road games to greet fans. The academy described her as a “feisty, spirited bird who commanded respect.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nGroton: The Pentagon said the USS Oregon, the Navy’s newest attack submarine, will be christened Saturday at General Dynamics Electric Boat in Groton. U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, said he will attend as the keynote speaker. He said the submarine will be christened with water from Crater Lake and wine from Oregon. Oregon, a Virginia-class submarine, is the third U.S. Navy ship to honor the state. Virginia-class submarines are built to conduct anti-submarine warfare; anti-surface ship warfare; strike warfare; special operation forces support; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; irregular warfare; and mine warfare missions. The Pentagon said they have stealth, endurance, mobility and firepower.\n\nDelaware\n\nFenwick Island:State environmental officials might soon lease public parkland to an offshore wind energy company in exchange for millions of dollars in new amenities at Delaware’s southernmost beach. The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control has signed an initial memorandum of understanding with Ørsted, an offshore wind company based in Denmark, to discuss leasing up to 1.5 acres at Fenwick Island State Park. Ørsted would use park property to build an interconnection facility that will connect power generated by the yet-to-be-built Skipjack Wind Farm to the electrical grid. In exchange for leasing the public land, the company would fund improvements at the park, with the state now suggesting more than a dozen projects worth upward of $18 million. Those projects could include a two-level parking garage, a pedestrian overpass that allows foot traffic to cross Coastal Highway from the ocean side to the bayside, connections for a trail or sidewalk system, two additional bathrooms, an amphitheater and a new local Chamber of Commerce building that would house the park’s visitors center, a small nature center and more.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A museum dedicated to journalism and the First Amendment is set to close its doors near the National Mall by the end of the year. WTOP-FM reported the Newseum announced its impending closure Tuesday, citing yearslong financial issues. A company statement said that despite more than 11 years of service and nearly 10 million visitors, continued operations have proved to be unsustainable. The statement said the museum’s founder and primary funder, the Freedom Forum, remains committed to its mission to champion the five freedoms guaranteed under the First Amendment. It said efforts to increase public awareness about the importance of a free press are needed now more than ever. Visitors are welcome through Dec. 31. Tickets purchased online include a 15% discount, with prices now starting at about $12.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan said Wednesday that he will be the majority investor in the nation’s only 24-hour news network aimed at African American viewers, giving the network a deep pocket as it launches next month. The network has been in the works for years and an announcement about its launch was made earlier this year. But Khan’s backing gives it a substantial boost. He declined to say how much he would invest initially but said it would be enough to keep the network running for a long time. Khan is worth an estimated $8 billion and made his fortune in the auto equipment industry. As well as the Jaguars, he owns Fulham Football Club of the English Football League, Four Seasons Hotel Toronto and All Elite Wrestling. Former Republican U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts, who was a star quarterback at the University of Oklahoma in the 1980s, will be chairman of the new network. It will be available via cable and satellite viewers in 33 million households. The network has agreements with Charter Communications, Comcast and DISH and will be carried in major African American markets such as New York, Atlanta, New Orleans, Chicago and Los Angeles. The network is to begin broadcasting in November and will be based in Tallahassee, Florida’s capital, with bureaus across the country, Watts said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAdel: A hospital and nursing home in south Georgia has moved into a new $40 million facility. The Adel hospital began operating from its new home Tuesday. What had previously been Cook Medical Center is now called Southwell Medical. The 20-bed hospital, 95-bed nursing home and physicians’ offices are operated by Tift Regional Health System. Tift Regional Health System President Christopher Dorman told WALB-TV that the new complex just off Interstate 75 was renamed to help attract patients from beyond Cook County. The new hospital doesn’t have an emergency room but does have a walk-in clinic. The health system borrowed about 70% of construction costs through a U.S. Department of Agriculture rural development loan. Cook County and Adel government agencies provided the remainder. The old hospital’s new use remains undetermined.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A post-mortem examination of two pygmy killer whales that were found stranded on a Maui beach suggested they were fighting an infection. The Maui News reported Wednesday that the adult males had inflamed lymph nodes when they stranded themselves at Sugar Beach last month. The infection was also found in pygmy killer whales that stranded themselves at the same beach in August. An official from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the whales were afflicted elsewhere and there is no indication of an environmental toxin at Sugar Beach. The animals were euthanized after tests indicated little chance for survival at sea. Researchers said unusual food items, including excess plant material found in the animals, indicate they were not feeding normally.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge said she agrees that fulfilling public records requests can put a big burden on governmental resources, but she expressed skepticism about the number of completely redacted pages provided to four Boise-area journalists by Ada County officials this year. Fourth District Judge Deborah Bail made the comments during a hearing on a lawsuit between the Idaho Press Club and Ada County Commissioners on Wednesday afternoon. In the lawsuit the Idaho Press Club and the four journalists contend county officials repeatedly violated the state’s Public Records Act by wrongly denying access to some documents, over-redacting others and otherwise mishandling public information requests. In court Wednesday, Ada County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney James Dickinson said the judge has all the evidence she needs in the form of the unredacted documents. Dickinson said some of the redacted documents require context to understand why they should be kept from release but said he can’t discuss it in open court lest he reveal private protected information.\n\nIllinois\n\nFairview Heights: Planned Parenthood has quietly been building a new abortion clinic in Illinois, just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, as women concerned about the uncertain future of Missouri’s sole abortion clinic flock across the state line. The 18,000-square-foot in Fairview Heights, 12 miles east of St. Louis, will provide abortion services, as well as family planning, when it opens in mid-October, Planned Parenthood officials said at a news conference Wednesday. Planned Parenthood has been fighting Missouri’s health department for months to try and keep open its St. Louis clinic. The state has refused to renew its license to perform abortions, citing concerns that include “failed abortions” that required additional surgeries. Missouri’s Administrative Hearing Commission is deciding the fate of the St. Louis clinic. During an annual inspection of the St. Louis clinic in March, Missouri health investigators cited numerous concerns, including reports of failed abortions. Planned Parenthood said it has already addressed those concerns and defended its clinic. It claims the state is using the licensing process as an excuse to stop abortions.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: More than 2,200 sets of preserved fetal remains found in the Illinois garage of a late Indiana abortion doctor have been returned to Indiana. Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill said Thursday that the fetal remains found last month at Dr. Ulrich Klopfer’s Will County, Illinois, home were transferred Wednesday to the St. Joseph County coroner’s office for “safekeeping.” Hill said at a news conference in South Bend that investigators determined the remains came from abortions performed in Indiana in 2000, 2001 and 2002. Authorities are still investigating where the abortions occurred. Klopfer performed abortions at clinics in Fort Wayne, South Bend and Gary. Relatives cleaning out Klopfer’s garage after his Sept. 3 death found the remains. Hill said they will be “given the decency of a burial that they deserve.”\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: The Iowa Department of Natural Resources said it plans to collect as many deer samples in northeastern Iowa as it can this hunting season to test for chronic wasting disease after the first case in Dubuque County was confirmed in January, the Telegraph Herald reported Thursday. Chris Ensminger, the wildlife research section supervisor for the department, said officials want to collect at least 250 samples from an area in which the diseased deer was killed and at least 250 samples from elsewhere in Dubuque County. Samples also will be collected from surrounding eastern Iowa counties. The disease attacks the brains of deer and elk and is always fatal. No human cases have been recorded, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people to not eat meat from infected animals. The disease has become increasingly prevalent in parts of the Midwest, including Wisconsin and Minnesota. Nearly 400 of the 1,060 deer that tested positive for the disease in Wisconsin from April 2018 to the end of March were in Iowa County in southwest Wisconsin. Other cases came from surrounding Crawford, Grant and Lafayette counties.\n\nKansas\n\nLinwood: A plan to build a village of foster care homes in northeast Kansas has gotten the OK, although the project has been scaled down. The Kansas City Star reported that the nonprofit Joy Meadows initially sought to create a development with up to 10 homes that could house large sibling sets on a 23-acre property in the Linwood area. Instead, the Leavenworth County Commission voted Wednesday to limit the first phase of development to four total homes, including one that is located there. The nonprofit would be allowed to add three more in a future phase, upon review from the county. Foster care advocates and the Kansas Department for Children and Families voiced support for the residential development. But the project faced opposition from neighbors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLudlow:Fire and police units are at the scene of a barge accident that set several boats adrift or sinking in the Ohio River. The barge hit the Ludlow Bromley Yacht Club on Wednesday morning hard enough to partially submerge the marina’s bar and grill. Steve Hensley, Kenton County’s Director of Homeland Security and Management, told news outlets six boats were knocked loose. Hensley said there was one person on the barge and one person on one of the boats, but neither was injured. Officials said the restaurant and patio of the yacht club were heavily damaged with some of it attached to the barge that struck it. Ludlow Police Chief Scott Smith said the Coast Guard is investigating and the barge operator was being questioned.\n\nLouisiana\n\nGonzales: The federal government has bought out an entire flood-prone neighborhood in Louisiana, prompting all its residents to move to higher ground. News outlets reported the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Emergency Watershed Protection Program financed the buyouts on along Silverleaf Street in Gonzales, which was carved out of a wetland in the 1980s and has frequently flooded since. Chief city engineer Jackie Baumann said the federal agency is buying the homes at preflood market value, and Restore Louisiana is offering to make up shortfalls in the purchasing price for some residents, as long as their next home isn’t in a flood zone. The 2017 offer required all 41 residents to agree to the deal, and the last resident agreed last month, enabling the government to restore the wetland.\n\nMaine\n\nLubec: American fishermen are expected to get a little more fishing quota under terms of an agreement with Canada. The countries are home to fisheries for economically important species that cross international boundaries, such as cod and haddock. They reach an agreement every year about how to divide catch on eastern Georges Bank, a crucial fishing area off New England and Canada. The New England Fishery Management Council said the U.S is scheduled to get 29% of the 1.4 million-pound total allowable catch of cod on eastern Georges Bank in 2020. It’s also set for 54% of the 66 million-pound total allowable catch of haddock in the area. The figures are subject to federal approval. They represent a 2.6 million-pound bump for haddock and about the same figure for cod compared to 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A 1,600-pound bull escaped from a truck into the streets of Baltimore for several hours. The Baltimore Sun reported that it took three tranquilizer shots and a crew of zoo officials to recapture the animal on Wednesday. The purebred Angus breeding bull broke out of a truck while it was stopped at a red light. A crowd gathered and watched as the animal was corralled. Baltimore Police spokeswoman Det. Nicole Monroe told the newspaper that the “owner of the bull said he doesn’t have the best disposition.” The bull was from Hedgeapple Farm in Buckeystown. Executive director Scott Barao said the animal was very expensive and thanked the police for not shooting it. He said the bull is “extremely valuable to us and we’re just glad to have him alive.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: State wildlife officials said a moose that was struck by two cars and had a broken leg has been euthanized. Marion Larson, a spokeswoman for the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, told The Boston Globe that Worcester police were called about a bull moose that was hit by a car Monday morning and Monday night. The moose was spotted in a pond Tuesday morning, and the state Environmental Police responded to the scene. Several boats were deployed so the moose did not approach Interstate 290, and to maneuver the animal into a suitable darting area. Larson said the 3 ½-year-old moose would not have survived its injuries. Another moose spotted in a Worcester cemetery Monday was tranquilized and freed at a state park.\n\nMichigan\n\nBattle Creek:A fourth Michigan resident has died from a rare mosquito-borne virus that has been recorded across the southern half of the state. WWMT-TV reported that 79-year-old Stan Zalner of Battle Creek died Wednesday after contracting eastern equine encephalitis. Ronna Bagent told the television station that her father was hospitalized in September with severe flu-like symptoms before doctors were able to confirm the illness through blood tests. Nine cases have been confirmed in six southern or southwestern Michigan counties. More than 30 animals – including 18 horses – in more than a dozen counties also have died from the disease. State health officials say low-flying aircraft were expected to spray pesticides Wednesday in Calhoun and 10 other counties. The pesticides kill adult mosquitoes on contact.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A federal judge has rejected challenges by several environmental groups to a land swap needed for the planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. U.S. District Judge Joan Ericksen dismissed the four lawsuits late Monday, ruling that the groups lacked the necessary legal standing to block the land exchange between PolyMet and the federal government. She said the groups couldn’t establish that they had been harmed. PolyMet traded 6,650 acres of federal land in the Superior National Forest at the mine site near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes for a similar amount of private land last year. Several environmental groups sued to challenge various aspects of the deal, saying it undervalued the federal land and violated other laws, including the Endangered Species Act. PolyMet disputed those claims and persuaded the judge to dismiss the lawsuits. Ericksen dismissed the lawsuits without prejudice, meaning the groups could refile them at some later point. They could also appeal to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg:At least 22 soldiers training at Champ Shelby were injured during a night parachuting exercise. U.S. Army spokesman John Pennell told WDAM-TV that at least 15 people were treated by medics and another seven were hospitalized. Staff Sgt. John Healy said none of the injuries is considered to be life-threatening. Camp Shelby Cmdr. Col. Bobby Ginn said the troopers belong to the 4th Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division stationed at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. Pennell said about 89 paratroopers were on the plane for the Wednesday night exercise. Ginn said the soldiers jumped from a C-130 aircraft and were blown off-course from their intended landing zone and into a group of pine trees. Several were entangled in the trees and had to be rescued. Healy says about 650 soldiers were involved in the exercise. About 3,000 troops from the Alaska base are at monthlong training at Camp Shelby called “Operation Arctic Anvil.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A compromise has been reached after Kansas City-area defense attorneys complained that their underwire bras were setting off jail metal detectors, forcing them to remove their lingerie for screening if they wanted to meet with their clients face-to-face. KCUR reported that the solution reached last month allows attorneys who set off metal detectors at the Jackson County Jail to be wanded or patted down. Attorneys protested after the jail rolled out a new security protocol in May. Jail officials initially responded by offering to allow attorneys to have noncontact visits, in which they talked to their clients by phones separated by glass, without clearing metal detectors first. But attorneys continued to push for change. Attorney Tracy Spradlin said she is thankful the issue was resolved without a lawsuit.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: U.S. Senator Jon Tester of Montana has announced plans to build a larger veterans affairs clinic in Missoula. The Missoulian reported that Tester, Democrat, announced Tuesday a location was chosen for a new community-based outpatient clinic. Officials said the clinic will be three times larger than the current clinic, which serves more than 6,000 veterans. It will have expanded primary care, mental health and specialty services. Tester said the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act that passed in 2017 set aside about $7 million in federal funding for the project. The clinic is expected to open in 2022. The current clinic will continue to serve patients until the new clinic opens.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A bobcat that wandered into a Lincoln building has been captured and released back into the wild. Staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs campus in south Lincoln called the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission on Tuesday to report the animal had been spotted inside one of its buildings. Commission staffers set a cage trap and baited it with raw fish. The estimated 20-pound bobcat bit on the bait and was caught. It was freed outside of town Wednesday. Bobcats are common in Nebraska and can be found at the edge of Lincoln, sometimes coming inside to hunt. Sam Wilson with the commission said bobcats are common but rarely seen.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A firefighter suffered burns and a woman was hospitalized after she jumped from a second-floor window at a motel that was on fire just east of downtown Reno. Police closed part of East Fourth Street for about three hours Tuesday afternoon before firefighters knocked down the blaze at the Lucky Motel. Fire officials told KRNV-TV the blaze destroyed two units at the weekly motel. One firefighter was being treated for burns to his leg. The woman was transported to a local hospital after she jumped from the window onto a car. She also suffered smoke inhalation. There was no immediate information available on their conditions Wednesday. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. The Reno Fire Department chaplain and motel owner were working to relocate displaced residents to a nearby motel.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBedford: A young moose that got stuck in a swimming pool has been successfully coaxed out. New Hampshire Fish and Game Department biologists and conservation officers were called to a Bedford home Tuesday to help remove the young bull. He was in the water for several hours. Officers said he was unable to get himself out of the pool, so they put in a set of wooden steps. The department posted a video of the moose looking back and forth as the team held a rope and coaxed him out. He scampered away. Col. Kevin Jordan suggested it had to do with it being moose breeding season. He told television station WMUR that “the younger moose will wander long distances struggling to find a female.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nForked River: The state has created an oversight panel to evaluate the process of dismantling the former Oyster Creek nuclear plant. Gov. Phil Murphy said it will ensure the “proper protocols” are in place throughout the process. Oyster Creek is being decommissioned after it was permanently shuttered in September 2018. Its spent fuel is also being put into safe storage. The panel’s formation was announced Wednesday. It plans to meet at least twice a year and will allow the public to share their concerns. Its members include the state’s Environmental Protection Commissioner, state police superintendent, homeland security director and the president of the Board of Public Utilities. Oyster Creek is located about 60 miles east of Philadelphia. It produced enough electricity each year to supply about 600,000 typical homes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Hundreds of hot air balloons will lift off from the New Mexico desert over nine days as part of one of the world’s largest festivals dedicated to the sport of ballooning. In its 48th year, the annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is scheduled to kick off Saturday with a mass ascension. More than 580 balloons are registered, 17 countries are represented and tens of thousands of spectators from around the world are expected to turn out for the opening weekend. Albuquerque has played host to the fiesta since its inception in 1972. Troy Bradley, one of the ballooning world’s most prolific record-setters, said, “There’s just nothing like it in the world, to see that much color going into the sky.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Homeowners hurt by record flooding along Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River have until the end of this month to seek state funding. People living in Cayuga, Jefferson, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Oswego, St. Lawrence and Wayne counties can apply for up to $50,000 to offset damages sustained this year to their primary residences. The window for applications opened Tuesday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office said $20 million is available through the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Flood Relief and Recovery Program.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville:State health officials said 116 people have been diagnosed with Legionnaire’s disease since an outbreak was reported in September. The Asheville Citizen Times reported the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services released the figures Wednesday, adding that there was one death. The department also said 65% of those diagnosed had to be hospitalized. DHHS expected the number of confirmed cases to continue to climb as diagnostic tests are processed. Health officials aren’t sure if the illness originated from last month’s Mountain State Fair. Legionnaires’ disease is bacterial pneumonia that develops when someone breathes in mist or water that contains the bacteria into their lungs.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A pipeline spill has released produced water into a small creek and a stock pond in western North Dakota. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality was notified of the spill, which happened Tuesday in Dunn County. The pipeline is part of a gathering system operated by Marathon Oil. The spill happened about 1.5 miles northeast of Manning. Authorities don’t know what caused the leak. An estimated 21,000 gallons of produced water were released, impacting the creek and stock pond within pastureland. The creek discharges into the Knife River, but no impacts have been detected in the river. Produced water is a by-product of oil and gas development. State inspectors are checking the site and will continue to monitor the investigation and remediation.\n\nOhio\n\nOxford: An investigation into alleged hazing by a fraternity at Miami University has led to misdemeanor charges of hazing and assault against more than a dozen fraternity members. A student reported in March that members of the Delta Tau Delta chapter at the university in Oxford hazed him during initiation. The student said he was beaten with a spiked paddle, kicked and forced to drink lots of alcohol. The Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News reported Oxford police confirmed that a Butler County grand jury’s recent indictments of the 18 men stemmed from an investigation into hazing. Miami suspended the fraternity in August for 10 to 15 years after its investigation determined violations of the school’s Code of Student Conduct. Delta Tau Delta’s national headquarters revoked the chapter’s charter in June.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Some of the 44 death row inmates housed at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester will soon be moved from the prison’s maximum-security H-Unit to another unit to give them more benefits and access to the outdoors, the state’s new prisons boss said. In a letter released by the agency on Thursday, the Department of Corrections’ Interim Executive Director Scott Crow told officials with the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma that the agency plans to move “qualifying inmates” to its less restrictive A-Unit by the end of October. The ACLU had threatened legal action over what it said are potential constitutional violations of the rights of death row inmates, mostly by confining them to their cells for 23 hours per day. Crow said the agency also plans to begin “contact” visitation for some of the moved death row inmates, who are allowed only noncontact visits behind Plexiglas and over a telephone.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: The City Council has agreed to discuss whether to impose a ban on feeding deer and elk that wander city streets. KTVZ-TV reported councilmember Chris Piper, who with Bruce Abernethy proposed considering such a ban Wednesday, said the plans were brought to him and other councilmembers by neighborhood associations. Piper said dozens of collisions involving vehicles and deer were reported in the city last year. Piper said cities including Sunriver and Sisters have seen positive results from similar wildlife feeding regulations. There is a similar ban on feeding geese in Bend that can result in a $372 fine. Although that ban is isolated to Mirror Pond, the potential deer and elk feeding ban would be citywide.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Another alligator has turned up in Pittsburgh, the seventh this year. George DeSavage told WTAE-TV he and his girlfriend spotted it along the Allegheny River as the sun was setting on Tuesday. He said he grabbed it and it “went kind of limp and calm.” He said it seemed like it was handled by somebody. Police took it to Humane Animal Rescue, which named the gator Gus. The shelter shared photos on its Facebook page. The shelter believes the reptile was a pet. It’s not illegal to own an alligator in Pennsylvania.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s high school students scored significantly lower on the SAT than the national averages. The Providence Journal reported Thursday that the state’s Class of 2019 scored an average of 483 points on the English portion of the standardized college entrance exam; the national average was 531. On the math section of the test, Rhode Islanders scored an average of 474; the national average was 528. The numbers also showed a gap between white students and students of color, with white students scoring about 70 points higher in English and math. The Rhode Island Department of Education said SAT scores were flat statewide. State Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green called on district leaders to develop action plans to increase test participation and overall scores.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenwood: A man who set a fire at a Walmart to divert attention as he stole a case of beer has been sentenced to the maximum of 15 years in prison. Solicitor David Stumbo said 34-year-old Russell Geddings pleaded guilty Tuesday to third-degree arson – the same day his trial was set to start. Stumbo said Geddings set a clothes rack on fire at a Greenwood Walmart on Dec. 5 then stole the beer in the chaos. Stumbo said in a statement no one was injured, but $1.2 million worth of damage was done to the store and merchandise. Stumbo said Geddings deserved the maximum sentence for putting so many people at risk to steal beer. Geddings’ attorneys did not answer an email from a reporter seeking comment.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:A Delta commercial airplane made an emergency landing in Sioux Falls on Thursday morning for a passenger who had a medical emergency, officials said. The Delta flight, scheduled around 7:30 a.m. from Chicago to Seattle, was diverted when a 63-year-old male passenger started to experience emergency medical symptoms, said Dan Letellier, executive director for the Sioux Falls Regional Airport. The flight was over Pierre when its pilots diverted to Sioux Falls, he said. The airplane landed around 8:30 a.m. and the passenger was transported to a local hospital, Letellier said. The passenger was alert and conscious, but Letellier didn’t comment any further on the man’s condition. “Based on our location in the country, there are thousands of flights that go overhead each year,” Letellier said. “We get at least one or two medical diversions a month. It’s a matter of where we fit in the country.”\n\nTennessee\n\nCollierville:Dozens gathered Tuesday to welcome home fallen soldier Maj. Trevor Joseph. The 33-year-old died Sept. 26 in an aviation accident at Fort Polk, Louisiana. He is survived by his wife, Erin. “Trevor was the greatest individual who was truly just so humble,” family members said in a text. “He would be so embarrassed by all this heroic attention, but this is exactly what he deserves.” Funeral arrangements are pending. Joseph, a soldier from the Joint Readiness Training Center and Fort Polk’s 1st Battalion, 5th Aviation Regiment, was killed during a JRTC rotation in a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter within the training area, according to a Facebook post from JRTC and Fort Polk. Three other 1st Battalion, 5th Aviation Regiment soldiers were injured. The cause of the accident is under investigation.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A truck driver from California was killed Wednesday when his semi crashed into an overpass support column on Interstate 10 in downtown El Paso. The fatal crash closed westbound lanes for several hours Wednesday morning. Harjot Singh Goraya, 32, of Riverside, California, was driving when he veered off the road and crashed into a support column shortly before 1 a.m. by the Mesa Street exit ramp. Traffic Police said that the road was wet from an earlier rainstorm but that the Special Traffic Investigations Unit has yet to determine how the driver lost control. The crash closed all westbound lanes early Wednesday. Drivers were urged to find alternative routes into downtown or West El Paso, including Paisano Drive, Montana Avenue and Trans Mountain Road. Traffic was directed off the highway at the downtown exit, police said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state Department of Health has confirmed the state’s first human death from West Nile virus this yer. Authorities said Saturday that a central Utah resident at least 65 years old died from the disease carried by mosquitoes sometime between Sept. 21 and Sept. 28. Information about the victim including name and gender have not been released. Utah health officials have confirmed 19 human cases West Nile virus this year. The total is higher than last year, when 11 residents contracted the virus and one person died. State health officials have said a wet spring this year created more standing water habitats for mosquitoes, attracting species that can transmit West Nile virus to Utah. Symptoms include headaches, joint pains and a high fever.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: Residents of a town along the route of the Appalachian Trail have taken the first steps toward filing an application to become a designated Appalachian Trail Community. Local and county officials in Bennington met with state counterparts and community organizers recently to discuss plans to apply for the designation. Officials said the label as an Appalachian Trail Community will bring greater publicity and boost local business. The Appalachian Trail stretches about 2,200 miles, through 14 states and 40 communities. More than 100 miles of the trail runs through Vermont and a portion of it is just east of Bennington. The Bennington Banner reported that in addition to publicity, the move could bring stakeholders together to improve the trail system locally for hikers.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A popular nature center will soon be closing temporarily for a $2.3 million renovation. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Maymont’s Robins Nature & Visitor Center will close Nov. 1 and open in March. The center houses fish, turtles, otters and other animals found within the James River and Chesapeake Bay. It attracts roughly 45,000 people each year. The animals will have upgraded habitats with lighting and heating systems and will be more visible to guests when the center reopens.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A late cold snap last winter has cut the production of Washington apricots in half. The Washington State Fruit Commission said the state usually produces 5,000 tons of apricots a year. But The Spokesman-Review reported that the yield this year is only about 2,500 tons. Washington produces about 20% of the nation’s apricots. The commission said frost in February, when apricot trees had bloomed, hurt production. Apricots produced in Washington are shipped across the country.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Federal officials said drought conditions in West Virginia are worsening as unusually high heat continues to beat down on the region. The U.S. Drought Monitor map released Thursday showed large swaths of southern West Virginia in a severe drought, a designation that includes the likely loss of crops and water shortages. The map also classified the entire northern part of the state as abnormally dry. Officials said nearly 50% of the state’s population is now in a drought. The National Weather Service marked last month as one of warmest and driest Septembers on record in multiple West Virginia cities. Less than 1 inch of rain was recorded in the month. Temperatures measured on Oct. 1 also surpassed record highs for the month in five cities.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said during a stop in Wisconsin that he doesn’t know if the family dairy farm can survive as the industry moves toward a factory farm model. Perdue told reporters Tuesday following an appearance at the World Dairy Expo that it’s getting harder for farmers to get by on milking smaller herds. Perdue’s visit comes as Wisconsin dairy farmers are wrestling with a host of problems, including declining milk prices, rising suicide rates, the transition to larger farms with hundreds or thousands of animals and international trade wars. Wisconsin, which touts itself as America’s Dairyland on its license plates, has lost 551 dairy farms in 2019 after losing 638 in 2018 and 465 in 2017, according to data from the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. The Legislature’s finance committee voted unanimously last month to spend an additional $200,000 to help struggling farmers deal with depression and mental health problems.\n\nWyoming", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/21/arthur-ashe-missing-marilyn-pacifier-eating-pup-news-around-states/39609687/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: A man wanted on drug and weapons charges has posted a video denying he fed methamphetamine to a so-called attack squirrel that he considers a pet. Mickey Paulk posted the video on his Facebook page Tuesday night as authorities continued searching for him. It shows him stroking a rodent that he indicates was the same one seized during a search and then released by authorities. “You can’t give squirrels meth; it would kill ’em. I’m pretty sure, (but) I’ve never tried it,” he said. Paulk said the squirrel was safe and not a threat to anyone. “The public isn’t in danger in any kind of way from the methed-out squirrel in the neighborhood,” he said with a laugh. He also said Wednesday that he was working with an attorney and relatives on a plan for turning himself in to authorities. Paulk said he had “a few loose ends to tie up,” including getting the squirrel to a temporary home in Tennessee.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Federal marine biologists for the first time have recorded singing by one of the rarest whales on the planet, the North Pacific right whale. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researchers used moored acoustic recorders to capture repeated patterns of calls made by male North Pacific right whales. It’s the first time right whale songs in any population have been documented, NOAA Fisheries marine biologist Jessica Crance says. She spoke to southern right whale and North Atlantic right whale experts to confirm that singing had not previously been documented. Researchers detected four distinct songs over eight years at five locations in the Bering Sea off Alaska’s southwest coast, Crance says. Only about 30 of the animals remain. Whalers nearly wiped out the slow-moving whales, which remain buoyant after they are killed.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State test scores are improving, but only by a few percentage points. Early AzMERIT standardized test results show small increases in the percentage of students passing the test in most grade levels in reading and math. But the scores still show more than half the students in most categories, including in third-grade reading, aren’t passing the test. Arizona’s education leaders introduced AzMERIT, an attempt at a reinvigorated state standardized test, in 2015. Schools have a lot riding on test scores. School letter grades are largely decided by test scores, and high-achieving schools get extra funding under the results-based funding program. This is also the first year high schools were able to opt out of the AzMERIT test and choose a different assessment over AzMERIT, such as the ACT and SAT exams.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: Hickory Park will get a splash of color this weekend thanks to Care Center Ministries of Mountain Home. Volunteers with the ministry will meet at 9:30 a.m. Saturday at the downtown park to paint the pavilion, park benches, some of the playground equipment and sidewalks. Anyone is welcome to come lend a hand Saturday morning, pastor Ty Cotter said. “We’ll have extra gloves, glasses and paint. They just need to show up,” he said. On June 1, Care Center Ministries representatives and civic leaders gathered at Hickory Park for a ceremony where the nonprofit “adopted” the care and upkeep of the facility. Saturday’s event will be the official kickoff of Care Center Ministry’s park stewardship, but volunteers have already been inside the park performing some landscaping work.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Officials say someone climbed a more than two-story-tall Hollywood public art piece and stole a statue of Marilyn Monroe. The statue depicting Monroe in her iconic pose from the 1955 film “The Seven Year Itch” went missing early Monday from the “Four Ladies of Hollywood” gazebo. Los Angeles Councilman Mitch O’Farrell says a witness saw someone climb the gazebo on the Hollywood Walk Fame and saw off the statue. Los Angeles police say investigators have recovered fingerprints from the gazebo. The gazebo, erected in 1994, pays tribute to women in film, with depictions of Dolores Del Rio, Dorothy Dandridge, Mae West and Anna May Wong making up the structure’s pillars. Monroe, whose real name was Norma Jeane Mortenson, died in 1962.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A report indicates the Mile High City had the highest increase in the nation in its violent crime rate last year, but crime remains low compared with the most violent large U.S. cities. The Denver Post reports the city recorded 629 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, resulting in a 9% increase between 2017 and 2018. The report by the Brennan Center for Justice shows the rates of homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults in the 25 most populous U.S. cities dropped 4% on average last year. Denver Police Deputy Chief Barb Archer says the department didn’t find a specific cause driving the violence. The department says all categories of crime have declined or stayed level for first five months of 2019.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed legislation that increases the minimum age to purchase cigarettes and other tobacco products to 21. The bill signed into law Tuesday by the Democrat also prohibits the sale of electronic cigarettes and vaping products to anyone under 21. The new law takes effect Oct. 1. Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, says such “Tobacco 21” laws are “more important than ever” given the increase in youth e-cigarette use. He says adolescents and young adults are uniquely vulnerable to the effects of nicotine and nicotine addiction, making Connecticut’s legislation “an important, life-saving measure.” The law also bans smoking on the grounds of child care centers and schools. Critics say it violates the rights of adults ages 18 to 21.\n\nDelaware\n\nBethany Beach: As thousands of people flock to Dover for Firefly Music Festival, one of the world’s rarest fireflies is battling for survival at beaches in the state. The Bethany Beach firefly, a rare species found in only seven unique habitats along Delaware’s southern coast, lost one this year to new residential construction, according to a local scientist who has studied the species. At that new development, beach houses are being built on million-dollar lots in a wetland that had been identified as home to the state’s most dense population of the fireflies. “Imagine if you start losing the species, but you still have a Firefly Festival. That connection is lost,” said Tara Cornelisse, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “I look to it as a beacon of hope, if we can protect it.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: District of Columbia lawmakers voted to add $47 million in excess reserves from the Washington Convention and Sports Authority to the city’s fiscal 2020 budget. The Washington Post reports $24 million will go toward fixing the city’s dilapidated public housing complexes. The rest will upgrade 911 dispatch centers. Tuesday’s approval came after a weeks­long dispute over whether the funds could be redirected from the reserve. The District’s chief financial officer, Jeffrey S. DeWitt, argued that using the funds would violate obligations to bondholders who invested in the convention center. He threatened not to certify the budget if the council redirected the money. However, a spokesman for DeWitt said the issue had been resolved Monday evening. Advocates said the money would cover renovating at least 400 units.\n\nFlorida\n\nHolmes Beach: Police trying to find the rightful owner of a prosthetic ear that washed up on their beach got a happy phone call from South Carolina on Thursday. Holmes Beach Police Sgt. Brian Hall said a woman called saying the rubber ear that police posted on Facebook belongs to her husband. Hall said the Beaufort couple was vacationing in the Tampa Bay area when the man went swimming. She said he was trying to put the ear in his pocket for safekeeping when “a wave knocked it off his hand.” The police department posted a photo of the left ear, saying a local resident found it in the sand Saturday after the “World’s Strongest Man” contest on Anna Maria Island. Prosthetic ears can cost thousands of dollars. Hall said the department will mail it to South Carolina. “We will put it in box. I hope nobody sees it and freaks out,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is shifting its presidential primary to late March, leaving the group of states that vote on Super Tuesday. The primary has been set for March 24, three weeks after Super Tuesday is held March 3, which Georgia has joined in past election cycles. The date announced Wednesday by Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger could relegate the state’s voters to a less influential position in deciding each party’s nominee. But it will also give state and county election officials a bit of breathing room in a tight timeline to replace the state’s outdated touchscreen voting machines. New touchscreen machines are in the process of being acquired, and a vendor has yet to be selected.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. Navy will christen a new guided missile destroyer, the USS Daniel Inouye, during a ceremony this weekend. U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii will speak at Saturday’s ceremony in Bath, Maine. Inouye’s widow, Irene Hirano Inouye, will be the ship’s sponsor. The Arleigh Burke-class ship is being named after the war hero and politician who broke racial barriers in Congress. Inouye represented Hawaii in the U.S. Senate for a half-century until his death in 2012. He played key roles in congressional investigations of the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals and served as chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. He received the Medal of Honor for bravery in World War II with the mostly Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team. He lost his right arm.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: The University of Idaho has ordered a student who owns a beverage company to stop using the name “Vandal Beer.” The Moscow-Pullman Daily News reports university officials sent the letter, citing trademark infringement, to Vandal Beer owner R. Austin Nielsen earlier this week. The school’s mascot is the Vandals. Nielsen announced plans last week for his company to start producing the gold pale ale in Coeur d’Alene next month, with plans to release it in north-central Idaho retail stores in August. Nielsen said he pitched the Vandal Beer idea to the University of Idaho a while ago, but school officials told him he wasn’t allowed to use the Vandal name. He said he came up with the idea while he was a student in the university’s Idaho Entrepreneurs program. Nielsen has said he will donate a portion of all Vandal Beer sales to University of Idaho scholarships.\n\nIllinois\n\nWauconda: A Civil War reenactment at a northeastern Illinois forest preserve is back on after the event was temporarily canceled by a county official over questions of its value, as well as the use of the Confederate flag. The (Waukegan) News-Sun reports Lake County Forest Preserves District President Angelo Kyle announced Wednesday that Civil War Days will still be held July 13-14 at Lakewood Forest Preserve in Wauconda. Kyle noted contractual obligations for the event that’s been held for 27 years and can draw up to 3,000 people. The announcement comes two days after Kyle canceled the event over concerns about the reenactment not telling the victims’ perspective and featuring many Confederate flags. Wayne Carle, who helps plan the event, says the reenactors put on the show to keep history alive.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University is planning several events commemorating the upcoming 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing commanded by school alumnus Neil Armstrong. The university says events begin July 18 with a presentation on the landing by Apollo 11 flight director Gene Kranz, followed by a July 20 screening of “Armstrong,” a new documentary film featuring home videos shot by Armstrong and unseen footage from NASA. Purdue will host a special exhibition of items from its Armstrong archives July 19-20. Other July 20 events include children’s activities on the Purdue Mall and a lunar module landing celebration timed around the 4:17 p.m. touchdown ahead of Armstrong becoming the first person to walk on the moon. Armstrong, a 1955 Purdue graduate, died in 2012 at age 82.\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City: A company that’s been fined thousands of dollars for the stink coming from its plant has lost its lawsuit targeting the city’s odor ordinance. The Sioux City Journal reports Judge Leonard Strand of the U.S. District Court in Sioux City granted the city of Sibley’s motion for a summary judgment. Strand disagreed with Iowa Drying & Processing’s contention that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. Iowa Drying & Processing had said the city’s enforcement unfairly targeted the company and interfered with its efforts to sell the plant, which had drawn residents’ complaints for years. One resident, Josh Harms, sued Sibley after city officials threatened legal action against him for saying on a website that Sibley smelled like “rancid dog food.” Strand ruled against the city in Harms’ case.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Hutchinson Zoo director Ryan VanZant says last month’s flooding covered more than one-third of the zoo. The Hutchinson News reports the zoo – except for the gift shop and train – has been closed since May 21 after consecutive storms caused water to rise at the zoo. VanZant said in a Facebook post Wednesday that five buildings and two playgrounds were affected by flood waters. He said staff moved animals to safety ahead of the rising water and built temporary housing where the animals are being kept while waiting for the water to recede and the cleanup to begin. A Facebook fundraiser has been started to help cleanup costs. The Hutchinson Friends of the Zoo says the goal is to raise $10,000 before Family Fun Day on Aug. 17.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A state agency says it has secured another $5 million federal grant to continue a program providing youth-support services. Kentucky’s Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities says the latest grant will continue the program through March 2024. The Transition Age Youth Launching Realized Dreams program allows youth ages 16 to 25 to easily access quality, developmentally appropriate, youth-driven support services. Officials say the goal is to help participants achieve their goals and transition into adulthood successfully. Officials say available services include expedited assistance in locating housing, mental health services and substance-abuse treatment. Since 2014, the program has helped more than 1,900 youth. Officials say youth and young adults can visit one of Kentucky’s 20 drop-in sites to access behavioral health services.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Billions of mosquito lookalikes are showing up in the area, blanketing car windshields, littering the ground with little bodies and even scaring some folks. They’re aquatic midges, often called “blind mosquitoes.” They don’t bite, and they’re good for the environment, but they’re a nuisance. Entomologist Nick Delisi of the St. Tammany Mosquito Abatement District says that “they tend to emerge in the billions.” Sloshing down bug-spattered windshields has become such a chore that the manager of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway says Motorist Assistance Patrol trucks on the 24-mile-long bridge have had to replenish their water almost daily. Mosquito control officials say they don’t plan to do anything to control the swarms because they die in less than a week and their larvae clean up waterways.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Legislature sent a proposal to the governor Wednesday to ditch the state’s presidential caucuses for a primary system that would be the nation’s first to allow voters to rank candidates. The Democratic-led Senate approved funding the bill, which had already passed the House. It now heads to Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who hasn’t taken a position. As the 2020 presidential primary season nears, Maine is among an increasingly small handful of states that still have caucuses, including Iowa, Nevada and Wyoming. If primaries are approved, Maine voters will use ranked-choice voting to indicate which candidates they want delegates to support. That could get hairy in the Democratic primary, where more than 20 people are running.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A memorial dedication, gun violence forum and moment of silence are among the events scheduled for the one-year anniversary of the attack on The Capital Gazette newspaper that killed five employees. Police say a man with a history of harassing people at the paper shot and killed the journalists June 28, 2018, in its Annapolis newsroom. The Capital Gazette reports the attack will be formally remembered next week with a concert, the unveiling of a memorial garden, a forum on gun violence and a moment of silence. The events also coincide with Maryland’s first statewide observance of Freedom of the Press Day. At 2:33 p.m. June 28 – the time the gunman entered the newsroom – Tribune properties across the country will take a moment of silence for the victims.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A veterinary hospital got quite a surprise recently when a family brought in their bulldog after he stopped eating. The Angell Animal Medical Center found 19 baby pacifiers in the dog’s stomach. It started in April when the Wellesley family noticed that their 3-year-old dog, Mortimer, started getting nauseated before meals. His owner, Emily Shanahan, brought Mortimer to the vet, who prescribed medicine to take care of the issue. But it didn’t help, and Mortimer eventually stopped eating entirely. Shanahan went to Angell, where they took an X-ray and discovered the pacifiers. Vets think Mortimer had been taking the pacifiers from Shanahan’s two children over the course of months. The pacifiers were removed without surgery, and Mortimer has fully recovered and is back at home.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has ordered state agencies to step up efforts to reduce phosphorus pollution and otherwise improve water quality in Lake Erie. Whitmer signed an executive directive Thursday instructing three state departments to support the initiative. The departments of Agriculture and Rural Development; Environment, Great Lakes and Energy; and Natural Resources will submit annual progress reports. Michigan adopted guidelines last year for making Lake Erie healthier, including cutting phosphorus loading into its western basin 40% by 2025. Whitmer’s directive puts a focus on lessening nutrient inflows from the Detroit River, the River Raisin and the Maumee River.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Peter: An invasion of gnats is presenting a risk to the health and lives of livestock in this southern Minnesota town. The Mankato Free Press reports that gnats cause weight loss and stress for any animal with their bites and by gathering around eyes and in airways. Brooke Knisley, who runs an organic produce farm with her husband in St. Peter, says one of her friends has lost 16 chickens to the gnats this year. Knisley says she’s trying to reduce the risk for her own flock by running fans in the chicken coop, hanging fly strips and placing vanilla-soaked rags near where the gnats congregate. Gnats are also an irritant for cattle and horses, and many owners are keeping their animals inside until the invasion passes.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Persistent flooding across wildlife management areas has decimated some wildlife habitats and food supplies, leading the state to allow supplemental deer feeding in Issaquena and Warren counties. The executive director of the state Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks says the deer stuck on a flooded levee have depleted their resources. Russ Walsh says the stressed deer are in bad shape. Resident Melissa Lyons raises two cattle on the levee and says that “the only things thriving are the buzzards.” She says the deer are starved and weak, and her husband recently removed 20 dead deer from their hay field. Supplemental feeding requires a wildlife agency permit that expires this fall.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: McDonald’s has started a trans-Atlantic barbecue feud with the introduction of a Kansas City-themed hamburger in the U.K. Outgoing Mayor Sly James said Tuesday that the fast-food chain should “stay in your lane” in a tweet that included a picture of what he says a “real” burger looks like. Kansas City is known for its style of dry-rubbed, slow-cooked meats drizzled in tomato-molasses sauce. Other Twitter users rushed to join the mocking after McDonald’s proclaimed “Yeehaw” as it promoted its “Kansas City Stack” on social media. Barbecue powerhouse Q39 kidded “Yeehaw, mate!” while Joe’s Kansas City Bar-B-Que retweeted a scathing critique of the burger along with a slew of various laughing emojis. McDonald’s says the bacon-topped burger is available until June 25, but not in America.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: AT&T has started dropping cellphone customers in the state’s northeast, citing customers’ regular data use outside its service area. The Billings Gazette reports the company began notifying customers earlier this year that they would lose their mobile coverage. AT&T spokeswoman Suzanne Trantow says the company can no longer be the primary provider for a “small number of customers who live or have a billing address outside our owned network coverage area.” She declined to give the specific area or the number of customers dropped. Verizon dropped the rural Montana customers in 2017, citing the costs of customers using data while roaming off its network. Scobey-based Nemont Telephone Cooperative has become the only provider for some parts of the region, but T-Mobile has been expanding operations.\n\nNebraska\n\nMcCook: Family Fun Nights have been scheduled for the summer at Red Willow State Recreation Area. The state Game and Parks Commission says a typical Family Fun Night begins at 6 p.m. with a meal provided by the park. Events start at 7 p.m. and include kayaking, fishing and archery. All equipment is provided. Just before dark, everyone heads back to the campfire to finish off the evening with s’mores. Family Fun Nights are scheduled for June 26, July 5 and 19, and Aug. 2. The park sits about 11 miles north of McCook, just west of U.S. Highway 83. A park entry permit is required. Go online at Calendar.outdoornebraska.gov for more information.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: City officials have activated a program that lets people settle fines for parking tickets with donations of school supplies. The Las Vegas City Council approved the program in 2016 and voted Wednesday to activate it for a month. Anyone who is issued a fine between June 19 and July 19 can clear it by taking new, unwrapped school supplies to the city’s parking services offices on Main Street. The donation has to be made within 30 days of receiving a parking ticket. The supplies must be of value equal to or greater than the fine. A receipt also is required. The supplies will be given to the Teacher Exchange, which serves about 390 schools in southern Nevada. It’s part of the Public Education Foundation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A committee of lawmakers has reached a compromise on changes to the state’s new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The rules, which are just starting to take effect, require most recipients to spend at least 100 hours a month working, going to school or participating in community service. The House and Senate passed different versions of a bill to broaden the allowed exemptions and end the work requirements entirely if 500 people lost coverage. A committee reached a compromise Thursday to suspend, but not eliminate, coverage for noncompliance. The state would have until July 2021 to waive the requirements in several scenarios, including if the state is unable to contact all participants to explain the rules. The full Legislature will vote on the amended bill next week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy has signed legislation requiring ride-hailing services to show additional identification after the March death of a University of South Carolina student who police say got into the car of an Uber impersonator. Among the new requirements is that ride-hailing services must issue two identifying markers to each driver. They must be displayed on the front windshield and rear window. Murphy, a Democrat, signed the legislation Thursday in Robbinsville, the hometown of Samantha “Sami” Josephson. The act is known as Sami’s Law. Police say Josephson got into the car of an Uber driver impersonator in Columbia, South Carolina. She was killed and her body dumped in the woods 65 miles away. A man has been charged with kidnapping and murder in the case.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLovington: Lea County has approved more than $5 million in upgrades to an airport in the heart of the state’s booming oil region. The Hobbs News-Sun reports the county commission gave the green light last week to improvements to the Lea County Regional Airport – most funded by federal and state grants. The improvements call for doubling the expansion of the holding area for flight patrons and renovating the apron area on the airside of the terminal. They also including upgrading a runway safety area and extending the primary runway. Officials say increased ridership is spurring the recommended improvements. The Lea County Regional Airport is located in Hobbs – a key city in the booming Permian Basin.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Artist Kehinde Wiley will unveil his first monumental public sculpture in Times Square this fall in response to Confederate statues nationwide. Times Square Arts, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and gallery owner Sean Kelly announced Thursday that the bronze “Rumors of War” sculpture features a young black man dressed in urban streetwear mounted atop a horse. The project originated when Wiley saw Confederate Gen. J.E.B. Stuart’s monument in Richmond, Virginia. Wiley is known for his paintings of black Americans and his commissioned portrait of President Barack Obama, displayed at the National Portrait Gallery. He says the new statue’s inspiration is war and “an engagement with violence.” “Rumors of War” will display in Times Square from Sept. 27 to December before finding a permanent home at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOak Island: Advocates for sea turtles say a hefty fine is in store for whoever dug into a nest of loggerhead sea turtle eggs. The Oak Island Sea Turtle Protection Program says the nest was tampered with Monday. Sand was displaced from the covered hole, and it was burrowed into. The News & Observer reports none of the eggs were broken or harmed. But the group wants beachgoers to know that disturbing sea turtle nests carries a federal fine up to $50,000 and possible prison time. Last week, a woman was arrested in Miami after police said she stomped on sea turtle nests and poked them with a stake. Loggerhead turtles are protected under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s female prison population has reached capacity, leaving some inmates in the custody of counties. The Bismarck Tribune reports that the state’s female prison population reached capacity for the first time in May. Under 2017 legislation, county inmates are transferred to state prisons based on the severity of crimes, medical needs and other factors. Last week, only six of 12 inmates intended for movement from county to state were admitted. The statewide system for women has a daily average capacity of 224 inmates. Donnell Preskey, who represents the North Dakota Association of Counties, says a mechanism must be established to reimburse counties for the cost of holding inmates who should be in state facilities.\n\nOhio\n\nBrecksville: A national park that protects about a quarter of the Cuyahoga River is preparing to celebrate the river’s health 50 years after it infamously caught fire. A ceremonial torch traveling the length of the 85-mile-long river will make a stop in Cuyahoga Valley National Park on Friday afternoon on its way to Cleveland. The public event comes one day before the 50th anniversary of the June 22, 1969, fire. It will feature the passing of the Xtinguish Torch Fest torch along with music, poetry and the unveiling of a new sculpture. Speakers, including a regional director of the National Park Service, will outline efforts to restore the river from its abysmal earlier condition to a vibrant place for wildlife and outdoor recreation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney has announced plans to expand its operations at Tinker Air Force Base. Pratt & Whitney Vice President Kevin Kirkpatrick, Gov. Kevin Stitt and Mayor David Holt announced what is called a “multimillion-dollar investment” to expand its military aftermarket services at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex based at Tinker. The project is also expected to add more than 100 jobs. Pratt & Whitney is a division of Farmington, Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp. and performs engine services and maintenance for the Air Force at Tinker.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown deployed the state police Thursday to try to round up Republican lawmakers who fled the Capitol in an attempt to block a vote on a landmark climate plan that would be the second of its kind in the nation. Minority Republicans want the cap-and-trade proposal aimed at dramatically lowering the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to be sent to the voters for approval instead of instituted by lawmakers. Negotiations with Democrats fell apart late Wednesday, prompting conservatives to pursue a walkout, said Kate Gillem, a spokeswoman for Senate Republicans. Some members have even left the state to avoid a vote, Gillem said. State police don’t have jurisdiction beyond state lines. Democrats have an 18-to-12 majority in the chamber but need 20 members present for a quorum.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A mural by the artist who painted the official portrait of Michelle Obama is being dedicated in the city. Amy Sherald’s overall body of work represents everyday lives of black Americans. So it’s fitting that the 6-story-tall mural dedicated Thursday portrays Najee Spencer-Young, a 19-year-old participant in Philadelphia’s Mural Arts education program. Sherald tells the Philadelphia Inquirer she chose Spencer-Young during a class trip to her studio. The artist saw it as an opportunity to boost the self-esteem of the teenager and those who look like her. The mural depicts Spencer-Young in a black-and-white flower print trench coach and mustard yellow hat, looking confident and composed – and very imposing – against a bright blue background.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo signed a bill Wednesday to preserve federal abortion protections in state law. The Senate passed the bill and immediately transmitted it to the House, which resumed its session to pass it. Raimondo signed it in her office, calling it an “important, consequential bill.” “Fundamentally this bill is about health care,” she said. Rhode Island is one of the Democratic-led states taking steps to enshrine the right to an abortion should the U.S. Supreme Court ever overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Raimondo said she wanted to sign quickly, in light of the uncertainty across the nation. The new law says the state will not restrict the right to an abortion prior to fetal viability or afterward if an abortion is necessary for the health or life of the mother.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A zoo plans to send off two African elephants in order to bring in Southern white rhinos. Riverbanks Zoo and Garden of Columbia announced Wednesday that 48-year-old Robin and 37-year-old Belle will soon join a larger herd. The zoo says the public can attend special activities before the elephants leave. The destination for the elephants hasn’t been determined. Zoo officials say 13 elephants have lived at Riverbanks since 1973. The zoo says there is a chance elephants will return in the future. Director of Animal Care and Welfare John Davis says the zoo hopes to add more space and manage a breeding group one day. Southern white rhinos haven’t lived at the zoo since 1989. The new exhibit is scheduled to open next year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Sioux Falls Freemasons and Architecture Inc. opened a time capsule Wednesday afternoon, revealing multiple artifacts the Masons had placed downtown nearly a hundred years ago. Lisa VandeVoort, business manager at Architecture Inc., said the time capsule – placed on June 6, 1924 – was opened as renovations were being done to the building. The Masons never specified a date to open the capsule, VandeVoort said, “so doing it during renovations made sense.” Dozens of items were removed from a box set in the building’s cornerstone, including a Masonic Bible, several editions of the Argus Leader and a typewritten copy of the address read during the time capsule ceremony 95 years ago. The capsule also included a sealed envelope with stamps from the time, as well as a handbook for new owners of telephones.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The three new eagles at Radnor Lake State Park’s Barbara J. Mapp Aviary Education Center are finally ready to meet the public. After months of park staff working to acclimate the eagles to their new environment, Radnor hosted a free open house Thursday, for American Eagle Day, for bird lovers to get at least a glimpse of the majestic creatures. “One of the long-term goals has been to have captive bald eagles (that could not be released back into the wild due to their injuries) in the aviary where visitors could interact with them,” Radnor Park manager Steve Ward said. The two bald eagles are housed in the park’s new $110,000 flighted aviary, a 38-foot-tall netted enclosure that gives the birds freedom of movement and protects them from other predatory wildlife within the natural area. The golden eagle has its own enclosure.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A federal law enforcement official says the FBI received a call three years ago about the 22-year-old man who opened fire on a courthouse downtown. Brian Isaack Clyde was shot and killed Monday by security officers at the Earle Cabell Federal Building. There were no other serious injuries or deaths in the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says a member of Clyde’s family called a national tip line to say he was suicidal and had a fascination with guns. The official said the July 1, 2016, call expressed concern for Clyde but did not contain a specific threat and was therefore not investigated. It came while Clyde was enlisted in the U.S. Army. Clyde’s mother, Nubia Brede Solis, told The Dallas Morning News that his half-brother had called the FBI with concerns.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A state commission has agreed to provide a $21.4 million grant to a multicounty coalition for a proposed new 80-mile rail route to haul crude oil from eastern Utah to existing Union Pacific tracks northwest of Price in Carbon County. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the Community Impact Board last week approved the funding for the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition for planning and environmental reviews. Supports say the planned Uinta Basin Railway would help Uintah and Duchesne counties develop their energy-dependent economies and reduce tanker traffic on highways. The coalition has contracted with the investment bank Drexel Hamilton, which will commit between $5 million and $15 million of its own funds, to raise private capital, commercialize the project and secure a partner to operate the rail line.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state Department of Fish and Wildlife is reminding people not to release aquarium fish into the wild. It is illegal to release the fish into Vermont waters. While most tropical fish are unlikely to become established in Vermont waters due to the cold weather, biologists say that if the aquarium fish survive and reproduce in the wild, they can be difficult – if not impossible – to control or eradicate. They can also cause changes in the native aquatic environment by competing with native species and introducing exotic parasites and diseases. Vermont biologists recently discovered goldfish, which are native to China, living in the sewer drains of Williston, which connect to public waters. Aquarium plants can also pose a threat if they are released into the wild.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state plans to mark four centuries of black history with a new exhibit and a tribute to tennis star Arthur Ashe Jr. The exhibit begins with the 1619 arrival in Virginia of the first enslaved Africans in English North America and continues all the way to the present day. “Determined: The 400-Year Struggle for Black Equality” will open Saturday at the Virginia Museum of History & Culture in Richmond as the city officially dedicates Arthur Ashe Boulevard. Renowned civil rights activist Rep. John Lewis of Georgia will be the keynote speaker. The exhibit features dozens of artifacts to tell the story of black Virginians, including slavery-era restraints, an African-inspired banjo and a stool from a Richmond lunch counter where students held a sit-in to protest segregation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The proof is in the pee. A new federally funded study has confirmed, not surprisingly, that marijuana use went up in the state after its first legal pot stores opened in 2014. In fact, consumption doubled over three years – a conclusion scientists reached after performing the decidedly unglamorous work of analyzing raw sewage. The researchers tested wastewater from Tacoma, a city whose drug-use trends tend to mirror those of Seattle, for a substance that is produced when people metabolize the active ingredient in pot. It is excreted in urine. The researchers said they can’t tell whether the increase in metabolites means more people are using weed or the same old users are consuming more of it. Another possible explanation is that the THC products sold legally in stores are more potent than what was commonly available on the black market.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State agricultural officials are warning about a fungal disease that attacks boxwood shrubs. The Department of Agriculture says in a news release that boxwood blight has been detected on residential and commercial landscapes throughout the state. Boxwood blight produces dark brown leaf spots and causes rapid defoliation that sometimes kills young boxwoods. It’s found in more than two dozen states and was first detected in West Virginia on plants shipped from out-of-state nurseries in 2015. The statement says residents should buy shrubs from reputable nurseries and only buy plants that appear healthy. Gardeners and landscapers should sanitize gardening tools between different plantings of boxwoods.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Assembly has approved a bill that would require online vendors like Amazon to collect and remit sales taxes from third-party sellers in perpetuity, a move that would trigger income tax cuts. Under the bill, revenue from the tax collections would be used to cover reductions in the lowest- and second-lowest income tax brackets. According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, taxpayers could expect an average reduction of $27 for tax year 2019 and an average reduction of $59 in tax year 2020 under the new rates. The Assembly passed the bill Thursday afternoon on a voice vote. The measure goes next to the state Senate. Coupled with an income tax cut plan Republicans inserted in the state budget, taxpayers could expect a total annual reduction of $91 in 2019 and $124 in 2020.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Some rodeo circuit cowboys say they will boycott this year’s Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo because of the new, tournament-style format the “Daddy of ’em All” adopted in roping and steer wrestling events. Under the new format, slack will now become a qualifying round to make it into the rodeo performances in steer roping, tie-down roping, team roping and steer wrestling. Each performance will see event winners and money paid out, and the contestants will start with a clean slate in the finals. Tie-down roper Hunter Herrin tells KGAB-AM the change means cowboys will compete more for less money. Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo Chairman Chad Mathews tells the Wyoming Tribune Eagle the new format means a better spectator experience and payouts to more contestants.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2024/01/05/arizona-trail-camera-captures-8th-jaguar-seen-1996/72120413007/", "title": "Arizona trail camera captures 8th jaguar seen in US since 1996", "text": "A new jaguar is roaming southern Arizona after a trail camera documented one of the state’s most elusive predators.\n\nOn Dec. 20, Jason Miller’s trail camera in the Huachuca Mountains detected motion at 8:27 p.m. He was shocked to discover a jaguar at the bottom of the frame.\n\n“Five years ago I started running trail cameras for wildlife footage here in southern Arizona, hoping one day maybe I’d get a jaguar,” Miller said in a video posted on YouTube after checking his cameras on Dec. 30. “I got lots of wildlife, including my first jaguar.”\n\nMiller is a hobbyist wildlife videographer who posts trail camera footage to his YouTube channel. He previously captured a rare endangered ocelot on camera and has recorded more common wildlife like bears, mountain lions and javelinas.\n\nThe Arizona Game and Fish Department has authenticated Miller's footage, according to public information officer Mark Hart. The agency has confirmed this is a new jaguar to the United States.\n\nJaguars can be identified by their unique spots, similar to human fingerprints. Miller's mystery cat has different spots compared to images of other jaguars previously in the U.S.\n\nIt is the eighth jaguar photographed in the country since 1996, as the species is largely extinct in the U.S. and avoids human interactions. The majority of jaguars live in the Amazon rainforest.\n\n“Anytime I see detection of a jaguar in Arizona, I’m incredibly elated,” said Russ McSpadden, a Southwest conservation advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity. “I’m certain this is a new jaguar, previously unknown to the United States.”\n\nMcSpadden considers this latest sighting as further evidence that jaguars are moving north and reestablishing themselves in America despite the U.S.-Mexico border wall and other threats to the species.\n\nIs there a new jaguar in Arizona? Trail cameras detect a cat in the Huachuca Mountains\n\nRare jaguar sightings in the US\n\nJaguars evolved in North America, eventually moving south to Central and South America. Today there are an estimated 173,000 jaguars in the wild in 19 countries, extending as far south as Argentina.\n\nTheir historic range included parts of Arizona, California, Louisiana, New Mexico and Texas, but jaguars were extirpated from the United States by the mid-20th century due to loss of habitat and hunting.\n\nJaguars were protected under the Endangered Species Act in 1997, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated about 750,000 acres of critical protected habitat along the border in southern Arizona and New Mexico.\n\nThis newest arrival to the U.S. joins three other jaguars who have roamed the Southwest in the last decade: El Jefe or “The Boss”, Yo’ko which is the Yaqui word for jaguar and Sombra which means “Shadow” in Spanish.\n\nEl Jefe famously roamed the Santa Rita Mountains with multiple spottings between 2012 and 2015. He was most recently detected in 2022 over 100 miles south in Mexico.\n\nYo’ko was discovered in the Huachuca Mountains in 2016 but was killed by a rancher in 2018 after crossing into Sonora.\n\nSombra is still believed to be in the U.S. and has been photographed multiple times around the Chiricahua Mountains since 2016.\n\n“We’re seeing these animals more frequently in the borderlands,” said Ganesh Marin, a University of Arizona doctoral candidate who studies wildlife in the borderlands using motion-activated cameras. “We’re witnessing a natural comeback of a species that was eradicated.”\n\nMarin attributes more sightings to the success of conservation efforts in Mexico, where an estimated 4,800 jaguars live and traverse the region.\n\nIs this a new jaguar?\n\nJaguars can be identified using their unique spot patterns, also known as rosettes. By comparing images of the mystery cat with previously identified jaguars, officials can distinguish whether this is a new arrival to the U.S.\n\n\"This is clearly not El Jefe or Sombra, which would be the only two possibilities if the cat were not a new cat,\" McSpadden said. \"Based on analysis we've done at the Center for Biological Diversity we're certain this is a new jaguar.\"\n\nAn unidentified male jaguar was also seen roaming near the southern Arizona border in 2023 on cameras operated by Customs and Border Protection, but photos were too blurry to identify the cat.\n\n“It’s possible this is the same mystery jaguar,” McSpadden said.\n\nJaguars could reestablish themselves in America\n\nConservation biologists believe these sightings indicate jaguars are finding suitable habitat in Arizona. They could be dispersing north to find more prey and habitat and to avoid human conflict.\n\n“It’s evidence that jaguars are tenacious and they are moving north, and they continue to reestablish territory here,” McSpadden said. “It’s also promising because they’re doing that despite a lot of threats. There’s a border wall, there’s habitat loss, new mines, roads and other developments.”\n\nHowever, a significant jaguar population in the U.S. is still a ways off, as only male cats have traveled into the country.\n\nMcSpadden could not identify the sex of the jaguar in Miller’s footage, but believes it is likely male based on jaguars’ roaming behavior.\n\nFemales tend to stay closer to their original territory, and a female jaguar has not been seen in America since 1949. Males travel more widely, sometimes wandering hundreds of miles, which is why McSpadden believes the mystery jaguar is a male who traveled from Mexico.\n\nAccording to Marin, the northernmost breeding population is in the Northern Jaguar Reserve in Sonora, about 120 miles south of the border. He’s optimistic that females could slowly expand farther north.\n\n“We’re going to continue to see more jaguars in the borderlands, hopefully soon a female in the United States,” Marin said. “It’s important to keep the corridors open, not just for jaguars, but for all the other species that share the ecosystem with them.”\n\nHayleigh Evans covers environmental issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

The move is intended to prevent lakes from shrinking too much. But a statement from the utility said that without rain, water levels will still likely fall below normal on lakes including Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Harris, Martin and Smith. Parts of the state haven’t had substantial rainfall in weeks, and a federal assessment shows more than 80% of Alabama is abnormally dry or in a drought. Conditions are worse in eastern and central parts of Alabama. Montgomery is more than 6 inches below normal, and Troy is more than 10 inches below normal rainfall. Totals are more than 3 inches off in Birmingham.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Scientists have confirmed an increasing number of moon jellyfish floating around Juneau waters. The Juneau Empire reported Friday that warm ocean temperatures and plentiful food in the form of zooplankton have contributed to the increased sightings. A marine biology professor said the moon jellyfish known as Aurelia aurita have reached maturity after spawning in early spring. Experts said residents could be stung and urge people not to pick up beached jellyfish. Scientists said the sting of a moon jellyfish is considered less painful than the sting of some others. Experts have recommended watching the jellyfish from a pier for the best views. Scientists said there are concerns that too many jellyfish in the water could throw off the ecosystem because they would eat too many zooplankton\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:A major construction project to widen Interstate 17 north of Phoenix is moving closer to its start date, as the Arizona Department of Transportation prepares a request for proposals for construction companies that want to be part of the work. The Anthem to Sunset Point rest area project, which is moving ahead after a $90 million federal grant announced earlier this year, should break ground in 2021 and be done by 2023, according to the department. A host of elected officials gathered at the outlet mall in Anthem on Thursday to highlight how the widening will benefit the estimated 1 million residents and visitors who travel the road annually, particularly those who get stuck in hours-long backups on weekends. Delays lasting several hours are a weekend tradition. Crashes, even minor, clog the roadway as people head north to campsites and cabins on Fridays and Saturdays, and as they head home on Sundays. The plan will add a third northbound and third southbound lane to the road between Anthem and Black Canyon City.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: A casino in Pine Bluff held a surprise “soft opening,” four days before its planned grand opening. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported the Oklahoma-based Quapaw Nation’s Saracen Casino Annex opened at 6 p.m. Friday with about 300 slot machines and a full-service bar. Saracen Casino Resort spokesman Carlton Saffa said the facility is a preview of the 80,000-square-foot casino that will have a 13-floor, 300-room hotel across the street by the end of next year. Saffa said the soft opening was planned to be invitation-only, but those plans were changed because of high interest. The Arkansas Racing Commission in June approved the license for the casino after Arkansas voters last year approved a constitutional amendment legalizing casino gambling in four counties.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Investigators completed a two-week examination of the charred wreckage of a scuba diving boat and could not determine what ignited the fire that killed 34 people off the Southern California coast, a law enforcement official said Friday. The boat, named Conception, was anchored just off Santa Cruz Island when it caught fire and sank early on Sept. 2. It was raised and brought to Port Hueneme, a naval base northwest of Los Angeles, where specially trained teams from the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives tried to figure out what sparked the blaze. They completed their work there without finding the cause, but the investigation will continue, said the official, who was not authorized to release the information publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Pieces of the boat have been sent to labs for additional testing, and investigators are poring through hundreds of documents seized from the boat’s operator, Truth Aquatics Inc., the official said. Some parts of the boat washed away when it was submerged.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: Gov. Jared Polis, a solar developer, an energy company and a steel plant have announced a large solar project in Pueblo. The Chieftain reported Lightsource BP would build, own and operate the proposed 240-megawatt solar facility on property owned by EVRAZ North America, a steel manufacturer. The project would sell its power to Xcel Energy, which would sell it to the steel plant. The Bighorn Solar Project would be one of the state’s largest. It would give EVRAZ a long-term contract that provides the steel mill price certainty through 2041. EVRAZ North America president and CEO Skip Herald said Friday the solar power makes possible a planned $480 million investment aimed at producing longer railroad rails. The mill employs about 1,100 people. The solar project would create about 300 jobs in construction, operations and maintenance.\n\nConnecticut\n\nLebanon: A generations-old question over who owns the mile-long green at the center of the city has been resolved after two years of negotiations and court hearings. The green, little changed from the days when French troops camped on it during the Revolutionary War, is the center of community life in the town of just over 7,200 people. But several years ago, plans to expand a library on the edge of the green were thwarted because a document dating to 1705 showed the green actually belonged to the “heirs and assigns” of the 17th and early 18th-century investors in the property. This month a judge signed off on the last piece of a plan that awards ownership and control of most of the land to the town.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Incyte, a Wilmington pharmaceutical company, is preparing to expand its Augustine Cut-Off headquarters. Two years ago, the company opened a 154,000 square-foot office building next to the former John Wanamaker building, which has served as the company’s home since 2014. The latest expansion, consisting of a six-story lab and office building, and a two-story parking deck, is supposed to bring all of Incyte’s employees to one campus. Some of Incyte’s roughly 700 employees work in leased spaces in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and Wilmington. Since 2014, the company has consistently outgrown its buildings, said Paula Swain, Incyte’s head of human resources of facilities. New Castle County Council approved the expansion project Tuesday. Swain expects construction to begin in October and end in about two years.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Beach Drive has reopened after a major rehabilitation project, WUSA-TV reported. Crews completed the fourth and final section of more than 6 miles of work on Friday. Construction crews kept busy on Beach Drive until the bitter end, using every minute leading up to the noon Friday deadline to ensure the 23,000 tons of new asphalt was ready for drivers. The National Park Service, along with the Federal Highway Administration, oversaw the project, installing new pavement markers, center-line rumble strips, guardrails and road signs. It’s a major improvement from the potholes of before. Crews also installed a new drainage system. Fourteen new retention ponds now prevent runoff into Rock Creek. Because Beach Drive is part of a National Park, the road was not expanded beyond its original footprint.\n\nFlorida\n\nLake Buena Vista: Walt Disney World on Friday introduced its newest way to get around the resort: an aerial cable car system that whisks visitors from hotels to theme parks three stories above the ground while going 11 mph. The Disney Skyliner cable cars opening to visitors on Sunday are the latest addition to one of the largest private transportation systems in the U.S. The almost 300 enclosed cable cars join 423 buses, 61 mini-vans (appropriately named Minnie Vans), 30 parking lot trams, 29 watercraft and 12 monorail trains. With the Skyliner air gondolas, visitors get neon-colored cars painted with the images of almost two dozen Disney characters taking them on the three lines to five stations where they can access nine resorts and two parks. Disney World has four theme parks and more than two dozen resorts. No more than 10 people are allowed in each cable car. A car will arrive every 10 seconds, allowing the cabins to handle about 3,000 people an hour.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMacon: An ongoing drought has made outdoor burning in Georgia more dangerous than previous years, state officials said. In the past three months, the Georgia Forestry Commission said firefighters have responded to – on average – about 41% more fires. Drought conditions are worsening, affecting more than 11 million people and threatening crops across a five-state area from Louisiana to South Carolina, federal officials said. In Georgia, residents should postpone open burning if conditions are not favorable, Forestry Commission Chief of Protection Frank Sorrells said in a statement. The main cause of wildfires is debris that escapes from a fire, he said. The Georgia Environmental Protection Division has summer burning restrictions in place in 54 Georgia counties to protect air quality. State officials will resume issuing burn permits in these counties once the restrictions are lifted on Tuesday, The Telegraph reported.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Retail firm DFS Hawaii plans to lay off 165 of its 660 employees in three locations across Hawaii’s islands, officials said. Financial losses from decreases in the international travel market prompted the staff reductions announced Thursday, company officials said. DFS Hawaii said positions are expected to be cut at two Oahu locations, including T Galleria in Waikiki and the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, as well as the Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport on the Big Island. The affected employees worked in the management, sales, operations and clerical departments. Eligible workers will receive severance packages based on their individual years of service, officials said. DFS Hawaii caters largely to international travelers. The company’s flagship store in Waikiki opened in 1975 and is now the chain’s sixth-largest galleria store worldwide. The first DFS Hawaii duty-free shop in the United States was established at what was previously known as Honolulu International Airport, now the Inouye International Airport.\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: KIVI-TV reported The College of Idaho is teaming with local company indieDwell to build new dorms out of repurposed shipping containers. Associate Dean of Students Jen Nelson said the school was eager to find a housing solution that would be quick and affordable. The dorm units will have five single rooms surrounding a common area. Once the shipping container dorms are completed early next year, the school will have 54 new rooms. School officials said that will help alleviate the shortage. At this time, students are even being housed in the vacant President’s House on campus.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Barack and Michelle Obama will speak next month at a summit in Chicago focused on the vision for the Obama Presidential Center. The event will include young leaders from around the world and participants of programs run by the Obama Foundation. It’s the third such summit. Officials said the theme is “Places Reveal Our Purpose.” Organizers said the summit will show how the Obama Presidential Center “connects to a growing global network of leaders.” The center is planned along the lakefront of Chicago’s South Side. It’s near where Obama started his political career and lived with his family. The $500 million center is expected to house a public library branch, house multimedia collections and have community programs, among other things.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Federal officials said an Indiana company is recalling 744 pounds of ready-to-eat pork products which might be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service announced late Saturday that the products by Fisher Packing Company in Redkey were shipped statewide. They were packaged in late August. The products include smoked ham, smoked ham shanks and Canadian bacon. They have the establishment number “74SEIN” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The products should be thrown out or returned. Federal officials said the problem was discovered when the company found that a sample confirmed positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Consumption of foods contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause a serious infection primarily affecting the elderly, people with weak immune systems and pregnant women and their newborns. There have no confirmed illness reports.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Iowa now has 24.9 million pigs on farms, a record number and up 6% from last year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture released the figures Friday for the quarter ending Sept. 1. It showed Iowa farms have just over 1 million breeding pigs and 23.9 million market hogs, or those raised for meat. The growth in hog numbers comes as environmental groups are trying to force the state to slow expansion of pig farms. A state court judge on Sept. 10 said two environmental groups may proceed to trial in their lawsuit alleging the state’s policy of expanding hog farms and its voluntary farm pollution controls violate the rights of citizens to clean water in the Raccoon River. The USDA said the national inventory of pigs is at 77.7 million, the highest number for Sept. 1 since records began in 1988.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State wildlife officials are working on plans to stop a continuing drop in the number of young people who are interested in hunting, in part because the decline could lead to fewer dollars for conservation. For years, Kansas encouraged young hunters by conducting guided hunts. But those classes are losing participants for a variety of reasons, including more entertainment options, more children living in cities and a lack of public hunting land, Kansas News Service reported. Kansas remains popular for out-of-state hunters, with the number of licenses and permits more than doubling over the past two decades to more than 150,000. But in-state licenses have declined about 14%. Hunting licenses contribute about $28 million to the state’s conservation coffers, which gets about 60% of its funding from the licenses. Because out-of-state licenses cost more, their popularity has offset having fewer Kansas hunters. But 2019 was the first in five years where nonresident sales declined. Hunting advocates said one factor contributing to the decline is a lack of public hunting land. Less than 2% of Kansas land is free for public hunting, according to the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Tourism.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:Kentucky’s Division of Water and Department for Public Health are issuing a public health advisory for harmful algal bloom along the Ohio River. The advisory is for people using the waters for recreation. The advisory area is from the McAlpine Dam near Louisville to the Greenup Dam near Greenup in northeastern Kentucky. State officials also issued an advisory for Briggs Lake near Russellville. The advisory means algal toxins have been found at various locations along the water. Swimming, wading, and other water activities are not recommended during the advisory. State officials said ingested water might increase the risk of gastrointestinal symptoms such as stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. It can also cause skin irritation.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The percentage of Louisiana’s people living in poverty has dipped slightly, but the state remains among the poorest in the nation. New data released Thursday from the Census Bureau showed 18.6% of Louisiana residents lived below the poverty line in 2018, compared to 19.7% a year earlier. By comparison, the national average in 2018 was 11.8%. The statistics show more than one-quarter of Louisiana’s children live in poverty. The state remained third-highest in the nation for its poverty rate, behind only Mississippi and New Mexico. Seven states had poverty rates of less than 10%. The census data shows Louisiana’s median income level reached $47,905 last year, well behind the U.S. average of $61,937.\n\nMaine\n\nActon: The devastating toll of ticks on New England’s moose herd has caused the region’s population to shrink, and experts worry it could get worse with climate change. The northern New England states are home to thousands of moose, but the herd has dwindled in the last decade, in part because of the winter ticks. The ticks infest moose and suck their blood dry, and sometimes tens of thousands are found on a single animal. Maine has the largest moose population east of Alaska and was home to some 76,000 animals about seven years ago. Lee Kantar, Maine’s moose biologist, said that number might now be as low as 50,000. Scientists in Maine are entering the final year of a multiyear study of the moose population in its northern and western areas.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: An investigation at the U.S. Naval Academy has found it is “unlikely” a rope and knot found over a door in a construction area was meant to be a noose, but the possibility could not be definitively ruled out. The academy announced Friday that the rope resembled a common construction device used to hoist items, although it was draped over a door “for no readily apparent reason.” The academy said the investigation didn’t discover who placed the rope over the door or identify any existing racial animus on the job site. The academy announced an investigation earlier this month after receiving notice from the Caucus of African-American Leaders. The caucus was contacted anonymously about the rope on Aug. 28, the 56th anniversary of the March on Washington.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Starting on Wednesday, the USS Constitution, the world’s oldest commissioned warship still afloat, will be open to the public Tuesdays through Sundays from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. The ship, berthed in Boston, will be closed on Oct. 22, then open for free public visits from Wednesday until Sunday from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. Guests can walk the ship at their own pace and ask questions to the ship’s active-duty Navy sailors, or listen to sailors give presentations on the ship’s history every 30 minutes. The USS Constitution played a crucial role in the Barbary Wars and the War of 1812, defending sea lanes from 1797 to 1855. It earned its nickname “Old Ironsides” during the War of 1812.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State and local health departments will conduct aerial spraying for the first time since 1980 to combat a rare mosquito-borne virus that has killed three people and been recorded across the southern half of the state. The aerial spraying is set to begin Sunday and will include 14 counties where eastern equine encephalitis has been confirmed in humans or animals. The weather might determine the actual spraying schedule. Other states, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island, have recently done aerial sprays. Michigan is encouraging officials in affected counties to consider postponing or rescheduling evening outdoor events until there is a hard frost. The number of U.S. deaths and illnesses from the virus are higher than usual this year.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Bishop John Francis Kinney, bishop emeritus of St. Cloud, died Friday at Quiet Oaks Hospice in St. Augusta, according to the Diocese of St. Cloud. He was 82. Kinney, the eighth bishop of St. Cloud, headed the diocese from 1995 until his retirement in 2013. He spent 53 years as a priest, with 39 as bishop. During his retirement, Kinney lived at the Speltz House in Sauk Rapids. Kinney presided over the diocese during turbulent times as the Catholic Church became mired in allegations of sex abuse. In a 2016 interview with the St. Cloud Times, Kinney said the revelation of clergy sexual abuse was the most difficult thing he had to work through. Following the revelations, Kinney set up listening and information sessions that he attended in parishes around the diocese. In 1993, the then-National Conference of Catholic Bishops appointed him to chair an Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual Abuse. During his tenure as chair, the ad hoc committee published “Restoring Trust,” a document then used by dioceses to address sexual abuse in the church.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will get $1.25 million to evaluate the effects of freshwater from a Louisiana spillway on dolphins and sea turtles in the Mississippi Sound. The money from federal oil and gas revenue-sharing will go to Mississippi State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport, Gov. Phil Bryant said in a news release Friday. The study will examine the abundance, health and habitat of dolphins and sea turtles in the area. The federal government said at least 310 dolphins have been stranded since February from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, 130 of them in Mississippi. Another 101 were in Louisiana, 42 in Alabama and 37 in Florida. Some have had skin lesions consistent with freshwater exposure, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Army Corps of Engineers opened the Bonnet Carré Spillway twice this year to protect New Orleans levees, sending Mississippi River water into the Mississippi Sound for a total of 123 days. The first opening was from Feb. 27 until April 11 and the second from May 10 to July 27. The number of strandings peaked in May and fell sharply in June, according to NOAA.\n\nMissouri\n\nHannibal: Against all odds, what appears to be Samuel Clemens’ signature has turned up on the wall of the cave he made famous in “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” In the mid-1800s, long before he adopted the pen name Mark Twain, Clemens and his young pals romped around the cave on the outskirts of Hannibal. As a group of Twain scholars toured what is known as the Mark Twain Cave this summer, cave owner Linda Coleberd and three other enthusiasts broke off in search of Clemens’ signature. It was long believed to be among the thousands of names signed on the limestone walls. A beam from a lone flashlight glanced along the cave wall and Lovell saw the name “Clemens” written in pencil. Experts said it is almost certainly authentic.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A group of history fans saw how ground-penetrating radar can be used to help discover unmarked graves Thursday, which was the first day of the 46th Montana History Conference in Helena. During a trip to the Silver City Cemetery north of Helena, University of Montana Ph.D. candidate Ethan Ryan, an archaeologist and ground-penetrating radar specialist, explained that he uses a 400 megahertz device with an electromagnetic pulse to detect anomalies underground. He can then use surface clues and disturbances to determine whether an unmarked grave might be nearby. Before the group went to the cemetery, Pam Attardo, preservation officer for the City of Helena and Lewis and Clark County, spoke about the ongoing preservation efforts happening there. She said the cemetery dates back to the days of the Wild West and is home to a number of graves, both marked and unmarked. Attardo shared some myths about the location, including a story about a group of outlaws captured in Silver City and eventually buried in the cemetery. However, no historical record of any such event exists, the Independent Record reported.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium is holding a new Halloween event meant to replace the zoo’s previous long-running Spooktacular trick-or-treat event. The zoo’s Ghouls and Glow event kicked off Friday and will be held Thursdays through Saturdays every week until its last run on Oct. 24-25. The event will feature 400 lantern displays at the Bay Family’s Children’s Adventure Trails. Visitors will encounter dancing skeletons, candy monsters, jack-o-lanterns, ghosts, witches, wizards, spider web arches and a mummy band. A number of bats, vultures, spiders and black cats will also light up the trails. Hundreds of hand-carved pumpkins will glisten along the zoo’s pathways, as well as a nearly 15-foot-tall pumpkin tree. Tickets for the event, ranging from $8 to $18, are available online and at the zoo.\n\nNevada\n\nFernley:A proposed industrial park east of Reno could benefit efforts to protect part of a desert trail used by the Donner Party and thousands of others as they journeyed west in the 1840s, historic preservationists and a federal official said. Known as the Fernley Swales, the deep sand trenches and grooves that are part of the California National Historic Trail were carved by wagons and oxen in the Forty Mile Desert between the Humboldt and Carson rivers just north of U.S. Interstate 80. The mile-long swales on the edge of the town of Fernley were protected in 2001 by a U.S. Bureau of Land Management easement that has remained in place despite changes in ownership. But the site is near a shooting range and often the scene of illegal dumping. Signs marking its historical significance are regularly riddled with bullet holes. Earlier this year, Mark IV Capital bought land in and around Fernley for its new Victory Logistics Center, including the parcel with the easement. Jon Nowlin, a member of the California-Nevada chapter of the Oregon-California Trail Association, said approval of Mark IV’s plans would require the dedication of some land to open space. Victoria Wilkins, acting field manager for the BLM’s Sierra Front Field Office, said it’s rare for the agency to have a historical easement surrounded by an industrial park, but the development could benefit the swales.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: One of two New Hampshire homes designed by Frank Lloyd Wright is on the market. The Toufic H. Kalil house in Manchester was built in 1955 and is an example the “Usonian Automatic” houses Wright designed as a more moderately-priced option for the post-war middle class. The house made of modular concrete blocks was built for a doctor and his wife who were inspired by the home of a friend whose Wright house was built on the same street. That property, the Zimmerman house, is now part of the Currier Museum of Art. The Kalil house is now for sale for the first time, being offered at $850,000 by the Paula Martin Group. It includes the original furniture and fixtures.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: State attorney general Gurbir Grewal is ordering two counties to end cooperation agreements with federal immigration authorities. Grewal’s announcement Friday came a day after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested more than 50 people in New Jersey. A directive this year limits law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE. But sheriff’s departments in Cape May and Monmouth counties have separate agreements to perform some immigration functions. Critics of New Jersey’s directive said it makes it easier for violent criminals to be released before they can be handed over to immigration authorities. Grewal said Friday the directive gives local authorities the ability to identify dangerous individuals to ICE for detention. Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden said Friday he would fight the order. Cape May County’s sheriff didn’t immediately respond to an email.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Flags across New Mexico are at half-staff in honor of state Sen. Carlos Cisneros, who died earlier this month of a heart attack. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham ordered flags lowered Friday in recognition of the long-time lawmaker lying in state. The senator’s casket, blanketed by a white cloth adorned with the state seal, was in place in the Rotunda for a public viewing. A funnel service is scheduled Saturday at a church in Santa Fe. Cisneros had recently announced his bid for re-election to represent a vast district that stretches from the state line with Colorado to the outskirts of Los Alamos, including Taos, Peñasco, Truchas and Pojoaque Pueblo. Cisneros joined the Senate in 1985 and went on to play a leading role in annual budget negotiations.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: A woman fighting cancer for the third time is thanking police for getting her to treatment after her car got stuck in United Nations-related traffic. Gabriela DeMassi said two officers volunteered to escort her and her parents through Thursday morning’s jam after she and her mother asked officers if they knew a better way to Manhattan’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. After getting through traffic, DeMassi, 28, said one officer greeted her with a smile and said: “Keep up the good fight. Never give up! You got this!” DeMassi recounted the experience in an Instagram post that went viral within the law enforcement community. NYPD Chief Terence Monahan left a comment thanking DeMassi for sharing the story. He closed by echoing the officer’s words: “You got this!”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s health agency is urging people to make sure their vaccinations are up to date after several confirmed mumps cases at two private universities. The state Department of Health and Human Services said there have been seven confirmed cases combined at Elon University and High Point University as of Thursday. State and local public health workers are responding in part by vaccinating susceptible groups on campus. Mumps is a contagious virus causing swollen glands, puffy cheeks and fever, and can lead to more serious complications. DHHS said anyone with confirmed or suspected mumps needs to stay home and limit personal contact for five days, or until mumps is ruled out. The agency said vaccinations are the most effective way to prevent mumps or limit complications should mumps still occur.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The remains of a North Dakota sailor who died during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are coming home for burial at the state’s Veterans Cemetery. KFGO-TV reported that the remains of Radioman 2nd Class Floyd Wells were identified in June. His remains are arriving at Hector International Airport on Monday and burial is scheduled for Tuesday. Wells was a native of Cavalier. He was assigned to the USS Arizona, which was struck by torpedoes. The attack on the ship killed 1,177.\n\nOhio\n\nLancaster: The role of Ohio’s formidable run of early U.S. presidents in establishing lasting national customs like the White House Easter egg roll and West Wing war room is explored in a history exhibition running through late December. “The Ohio Presidents: Surprising Legacies “ opened this month at the Decorative Arts Center of Ohio, located in Lancaster about 30 miles southeast of Columbus. Objects include clothing, furniture, personal items and campaign posters of William Henry Harrison, Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William Howard Taft and Warren G. Harding. Curator Christine Fowler Shearer said the show features fun facts about the presidents that aren’t common knowledge. The artifacts and photographs were gathered from the Library of Congress, Ohio History Connection and elsewhere.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTahlequah: The new chief of the Cherokee Nation plans to invest $16 million into the tribe’s language preservation program, including a new cabinet-level position focused on its language, culture and community. Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. announced the “Durbin Feeling Cherokee Language Preservation Act” in a statement on Friday. Feeling is a leading Cherokee linguist and one of an estimated 2,000 people the tribe identifies as “first-language” speakers, or those whose native language is Cherokee. The new plan includes a $5 million renovation of the former Cherokee Casino Tahlequah building into a new language center, and a $1.5 million annual appropriation for the next five years for its operation. The largest American Indian tribe in the United States, the 370,000-member Cherokee Nation is headquartered in Tahlequah.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The Oregon Supreme Court – the oldest government building on the Capitol Mall – is set to empty out in October for two years of renovations including earthquake reinforcements and safety upgrades. Services at the century-old court building, which includes the Oregon Supreme Court and the Oregon Court of Appeals courtroom, the State of Oregon Law Library, the Oregon Judicial Department and Appellate Court Records, will be spread to different locations throughout Salem. It will cost about $51 million and displace 56 employees, according to Oregon Judicial Department spokesman Todd Sprague. Over the past year, staff members have hauled tens of thousands of volumes from its law library collection to new locations. The second-floor library has been home to historic documents that date to the 15th century.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus have been found in six Pennsylvania counties, along with one human case. The state’s West Nile Control Program said the mosquitoes were found Friday in Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster and Philadelphia counties. The human case of West Nile virus was discovered in Chester County. Friday was the last routine surveillance and reporting day for 2019, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection’s website. West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne sickness that might cause encephalitis, a brain irritation. Mild infections can produce fever, headaches, body aches, skin rash and swollen lymph glands.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Officials said they have decided to dismantle the city’s first two-way bike lane a month after its installation following public criticism. The Providence Journal reported the city’s recent decision is expected to cost $127,500. Mayor Jorge Elorza’s office said the lane was completed the week of Sept. 9 and cost $63,500. The dismantling process will begin this fall and will cost $64,000. After the lane’s construction, residents began complaining it made the rest of Easton Street too narrow. Louise Ely said cars would have nowhere to move if an ambulance drove by since the lane is on one side of the street. Sarah Mitchell, chairwoman of the Rhode Island Bicycle Coalition, said the city should do more outreach to educate people about how to use these lanes.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCongaree National Park: A timber company is selling some swamp and forest land to a conservation group that hopes to donate the land to Congaree National Park. Friends of Congaree Swamp bought the 214 acres from Weyerhaeuser for $783,000. The State newspaper reported the land is along Running Lake Creek and has trees so thick that areas remain darkened by shade in the middle of the day. Friends of Congaree Swamp used a combination of money from the state and federal governments, private donations and fines from wetland violations. The federal government will have to approve the transfer to the national park near Columbia, which could take some time.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster: Officials at Custer State Park said 25,000 people turned out to watch this year’s annual buffalo roundup. The Rapid City Journal reported hundreds of bison were herded into corrals during the 54th annual roundup on Friday. Park resource manager Mark Hendrix said of the 1,460 animals in herd, 470 will be sent to auction Nov. 6. He said staff attempts to keep the herd at an average of 1,000 animals to maintain the ecological balance in the 71,000-acre park south of Mount Rushmore National Memorial.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:Two Memphis schools won the Blue Ribbon designation this year, one of the highest honors from the U.S. Department of Education, given to just 362 schools nationwide. Campus School and Maxine Smith STEAM Academy were recognized for their high scores on state and national tests. They were among six schools in Tennessee to earn the award this year. The designation does not come with financial awards, but is a coveted label. Campus School is a contract school run by the University of Memphis. The elementary school is known for its high test scores and frequently tops district ratings. This spring, 74% of students scored proficient in reading and writing, compared with 21% of students in the district and 34% statewide. Maxine Smith STEAM Academy is a middle school that Shelby County Schools opened in 2014 to serve high-performing students that pass admission tests.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A county administrator is apologizing for saying Gov. Greg Abbott “hates trees because one fell on him.” The Texas Tribune reports that the comment made Friday by Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt, a Democrat, during a panel discussion was first reported in a tweet by the online magazine The Federalist. Abbott, a Republican, has been paralyzed from the waist down since 1984 when a tree fell on him in Houston while he was jogging. Eckhardt said on her website and in a tweet that she “made a mistake” and apologizes to Abbott. Eckhardt said she “made a flippant comment that was inappropriate.” Eckhardt’s comments came during a discussion about the Texas Legislature overriding local ordinances such one in Austin regarding the cutting down of trees.\n\nUtah\n\nAntelope Island State Park: Authorities said a 22-year-old Utah woman hiking at Antelope Island State Park suffered a broken leg and a laceration on her other leg when she was charged by a bison. Officials said the woman was on an established trail while running toward a companion when the incident occurred Friday night in a remote area and that it’s not clear what prompted the bison to charge. The woman’s identity wasn’t released. Utah State Parks Lt. Eric Stucki said the woman lay still after the bison used its head to throw her into the air and that the animal then nudged her with its nose before moving off. Antelope Island wildlife include hundreds of bison. The state park is connected to the Great Salt Lake’s southeastern shore by a 7-mile-long causeway.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Agency of Natural Resources is beginning to receive the results of tests for a class of chemicals known as PFAS in public water supplies and so far all met public drinking water standards. The testing is part of a state law that requires the testing of an estimated 590 water systems across for the presence of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl levels in public drinking water. So far, the results have come back for 45 system and all met all the state standards with concentrations below 20 parts per trillion. Bryan Redmond of the Drinking Water and Groundwater Protection Division said the initial sampling results are encouraging. The deadline for testing is Dec. 1. PFAS chemicals were widely used in firefighting foam, nonstick cookware and other products.\n\nVirginia\n\nLovingston: A vehicle has hit and killed a yak who rose to internet fame by making his great escape in Virginia while on the way to a butcher shop. The Washington Post reported the owner of the yak, Robert Cissell, said on social media that the animal named Meteor died Friday morning on U.S. 29 in Nelson County. Meteor had been on the loose since Sept. 10, when he kicked off the back door of a livestock trailer and ran into the mountains. Nelson County Animal Control officer Kevin Wright said there were no witnesses to Friday’s collision. He said a commercial vehicle might have hit the yak and kept going. The Nelson County Farm Bureau wrote a tribute to Meteor on social media that ended with, “Roam free, Meteor!”\n\nWashington\n\nSnohomish: A multiracial family has raised concerns after Ku Klux Klan symbols were spray painted on multiple trees near their home. KOMO-TV reported that the Anderson family has had tough conversations about race with their four adopted children, but the racially offensive graffiti crossed a line. The family sid the teenage son discovered the KKK symbols on six to eight trees as he walked through the woods right next to their house heading to the lake. Snohomish County deputies said an investigation is underway. Authorities said they have not received any other reports and they do not have any leads. The family said the community is usually friendly and welcoming, but a conversation clearly needs to happen.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia’s U.S. senators want to make the New River Gorge a national park. Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Joe Manchin on Thursday introduced the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve Designation Act. The lawmakers said the move will boost the local economy and tourism in the area, citing a study that said national-park status is shown to increase the number of visitors by 21%. The proposal would allow hunting and fishing at the park. The New River Gorge is the site of the annual Bridge Day festival, where many gather to watch people base jump into the gorge.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State utility regulators have authorized the construction of a $500 million power line, despite claims that they ignored complaints, concerns and alternative solutions. The Wisconsin State Journal reported that the Public Service Commission approved the plan Thursday, rejecting accusations of a conflict of interest that were brought by two conservation groups, the Driftless Area Land Conservancy and Wisconsin Wildlife Federation. The groups said the will appeal. The Cardinal-Hickory Creek line would run between Dubuque, Iowa, and Middleton, west of Madison. Construction is expected to start in 2021. Project supporters said it will allow for the transmission of more carbon-free electricity and save customers money. But critics said the state could transition to renewable energy without damaging natural areas along the planned route of the proposed power line.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson Hole: Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in northwest Wyoming will use renewable energy to power its lifts and other operations. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reported that resort officials announced that they would enter Lower Valley Energy’s Green Power program for customers and begin drawing energy from the Horse Butte Wind Farm near Idaho Falls, Idaho. Phil Cameron of Jackson-based Energy Conservation Works sid Jackson Hole Mountain Resort is one of only a handful of ski resorts across the country to fully move to renewable energy. Over the last two years hundreds of businesses and residents of Teton County have converted to green power. Among them are Snow King Mountain Resort and Jackson Hole Airport.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/09/beluga-whales-muddy-waters-home-db-cooper-search-news-around-states/117967926/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:With the delta variant driving a new wave of COVID-19 cases across the nation, the Montgomery Zoo said it’s canceling its annual Zoobilation event. The Sept. 16 event was planned as an outdoor party with food, music and dancing, with the $50 tickets raising funds for a state-of-the-art reptile facility. That new facility is also planned to serve as an education center for keeper talks, presentations, animal encounters and other programs. The zoo will hold an online auction to serve as a fundraiser for the new facility. That auction will feature jewelry, gift cards, spa treatments, travel packages, hotel stays, restaurant experiences, collectibles and more. More information about that auction is expected soon. You can see more about the zoo at montgomeryzoo.com.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Six people who were killed in a sightseeing plane crash were recovered and identified after crews initially struggled to reach the wreckage in southeast Alaska because of poor weather conditions. Alaska State Troopers identified the pilot and five passengers late Saturday following the crash Thursday. The aircraft went down as the pilot was returning the passengers to Ketchikan from Misty Fjords National Monument. The passengers who died were Mark Henderson, 69, and Jacquelyn Komplin, 60, of Napa, California; Andrea McArthur, 55, and Rachel McArthur, 20, of Woodstock, Georgia; and Janet Kroll, 77, of Mount Prospect, Illinois. The pilot was Rolf Lanzendorfer, 64, of Cle Elum, Washington. All five passengers were on an excursion off the Holland America Line cruise ship Nieuw Amsterdam. Ketchikan is a popular stop for cruise ships visiting Alaska, and cruise ship passengers can take various sightseeing excursions while in port. Popular among them are small plane flights to Misty Fjords National Monument, where visitors can see glacier valleys, snow-capped peaks and lakes in the wilderness area. The plane’s emergency beacon was activated about 11:20 a.m. Thursday when it crashed near the monument, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the cause of the crash. The Federal Aviation Administration was also investigating.\n\nArizona\n\nPage:Houseboat-rental companies for Lake Powell have had to cancel their bookings through August – one of their most popular months – after the National Park Service, which manages the lake, barred people from launching the vessels in mid-July because of low water levels. At the popular main launch point on Wahweap Bay, the bottom of the concrete ramp has been extended with steel pipes so boats can still get on the lake, but that solution will only last another week or two, the park service said. Lake Powell is the second-largest reservoir in the U.S. behind Nevada’s Lake Mead, which also stores water from the Colorado River. Both are shrinking faster than expected, a dire concern for a seven-state region that relies on the river to supply water to 40 million people and a $5 billion-a-year agricultural industry. In 1983, Lake Powell’s water exceeded its maximum level of 3,700 feet and nearly overran the Glen Canyon Dam. The lake is facing a new set of challenges having reached a record low of 3,553 feet last week.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A judge temporarily blocked the state from enforcing its ban on mask mandates after lawmakers left the prohibition in place despite a rising number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox issued a preliminary injunction against the law that Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed in April banning mask requirements by governmental entities. The ban was being challenged by two lawsuits, including one from an east Arkansas school district where more than 900 staff and students are in quarantine because of a coronavirus outbreak. Fox ruled the law violates Arkansas’ constitution, saying it discriminates between public and private school students. He said it also infringes on the governor’s emergency powers, as well as the authority of county officials and the state Supreme Court. Republican Attorney General Leslie Rutledge was talking with the governor and Legislature about the ruling to determine the next steps, her office said. Hutchinson, who was named as a defendant in the lawsuit along with the state and legislative leaders, left open the possibility of separately asking the state Supreme Court to uphold Fox’s ruling if it’s appealed.\n\nCalifornia\n\nRedding:A wildfire has claimed a historic fire lookout at Lassen Volcanic National Park, park Superintendent Jim Richardson said Saturday night. The Mount Harkness Lookout is the park’s first loss from the blaze when it burned into the Juniper Lake area. The structure served as an active fire lookout and visitor destination since its construction in 1930, according to the park’s website. The loss of the lookout was confirmed during an infrared flight Friday and also from a pilot’s visual report, Richardson said. As of Saturday night, the blaze had not reached the popular Drakesbad Guest Ranch in the Warner Valley near Chester, Richardson said. Lassen Volcanic National Park closed to visitors Thursday as the fire burned into the park’s southeast corner. Richardson said the fire “ran nearly the length of the entire park up to near Butte Lake, a little over 8,000 acres in the national park.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: As huge plumes of wildfire smoke from California moved east, Denver’s air quality ranked among the worst in the world Saturday afternoon. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment issued an air quality health advisory until Sunday, warning that people – especially those with respiratory illnesses like asthma or COPD – should avoid prolonged outdoor activities and keep windows closed. Meteorologists at the National Weather Service in Denver expected air quality to improve a bit on Sunday, though it will remain hazy and smoky. U.S. cities, including Denver and Salt Lake City, are being overrun with smoke from distant California and West Coast wildfires.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMystic: One of five beluga whales acquired from an aquarium in Canada after a legal fight with animal rights activists has died at its new home in Connecticut. Officials at Mystic Aquarium, which specializes in beluga research, said in a Facebook post that the male whale had arrived in May with a preexisting medical condition. It died Friday, despite “round-the-clock medical treatment, testing, and 24-hour monitoring,” the aquarium said in a statement. The whale arrived in May with four others from Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario, after a lengthy fight to obtain permits from the United States and Canada. Connecticut-based Friends of Animals and other activists had sought to block the transport in a lawsuit last fall against the U.S. Commerce secretary and National Marine Fisheries Service, which had approved the research permit. The group claimed the U.S. permit violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the National Environmental Policy Act because government officials did not adequately address the potential harm to the belugas from being moved to Mystic. A federal judge in March declined to issue an injunction. The whales, which range in age from 7 to 12, were born in captivity and left an overcrowded habitat with about 50 other whales to be at the center of important research designed to benefit belugas in the wild, aquarium officials said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Hundreds of people met Saturday outside a Delaware hospital to protest ChristianaCare’s decision to require employees to get COVID-19 vaccines or be dismissed. More than 300 gathered at Christiana Hospital to protest the mandate, saying there isn’t enough information on vaccines, they doubt their effectiveness and their right to choose is being infringed upon, The News Journal of Wilmington reported. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has maintained COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. ChristianaCare, the state’s largest health care system and largest private employer, has stated that all employees must receive the first dose of the vaccine by Sept. 21, or the health system with terminate workers who don’t unless given an exemption. The hospital estimated in late June that about 70% of its employees had received at least one dose. Other hospitals in Delaware and elsewhere have announced employee vaccine requirements, including Nemours Children’s Health System on Friday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:WUSA-TV reported a fire outside of the old Grimke School caused a cloud of smoke that was seen across parts of the District on Saturday, according to D.C. Fire and EMS on Twitter. The fire outside the old school building was at 1923 Vermont Avenue, Northwest. Pictures from D.C. Fire and EMS showed firefighters working to control the large blaze. No one was injured during the fire, which is still under investigation by D.C. Fire and EMS officials.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Federal officials approved a deal that will allow the Seminole Tribe to operate sports betting and add roulette and craps to its seven Florida casinos, with the state potentially receiving $20 billion over the next 30 years. Gov. Ron DeSantis had worked out the gambling compact with the tribe in the spring, and it was later approved by the state House and Senate. The deal needed final approved from the U.S. Department of the Interior, which oversees tribal gambling operations. Officials said the agreement will generate an estimated $6 billion through 2030. The Tribe is not currently making any revenue payments to the state.Under the agreement, the Seminoles could begin sports betting Oct. 15 and sports wagering at horse tracks, jai alai frontons and former dog tracks for a share of the income. Online sports betting operated by the tribe also will be allowed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Georgia’s oldest city is planning a giant mural to cover a pedestrian walkway to its new arena. City officials are seeking proposals for the mural, which will be designed by four teams of artists and cover an area spanning 2,400 square feet. Savannah officials said the project will be one of the largest asphalt murals in Georgia. The mural will illustrate a new walkway on the site of Savannah’s historic water works pump house that ends at the Enmarket Arena. The city broke ground on the 9,500-seat arena nearly two years ago and it’s scheduled to open in 2022. City Hall is accepting proposals for the mural project until Sept. 6.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Four Native Hawaiians arrested in 2019 while protesting against construction of a giant telescope on Hawaii’s highest peak were found not guilty of obstructing the mountain’s access road, a judge ruled. Judge M. Kanani Laubach issued her verdict after a trial that began in January 2020 and saw significant delays because of the coronavirus pandemic. Keli’i ’Ioane, Marie Alohalani Brown, Maxine Kahaulelio and Ranette Robinson were the first to go to trial out of 38 mostly Native Hawaiian kupuna, or elders, who were arrested during a swelling effort to stop construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope. The other cases are pending. Those who oppose the $1.4 billion project said it will desecrate land on Mauna Kea held sacred to Native Hawaiians. Hundreds of protesters gathered at the base of the mountain in July 2019 to block construction of the telescope. The kupuna allowed themselves to be arrested and some used canes, and others were taken in wheelchairs to police vans. Those who could walk on their own were led away with their hands in zip ties. An international consortium has a state permit to build the telescope. However, in announcing her verdict, the judge noted that during the trial, officials testified that the access road was closed and there were no permits issued for oversized vehicles. The state respects the verdict, which can’t be appealed, said Gary Yamashiroya, special assistant to the state attorney general. The ruling is based solely on evidence presented at the trial of the four defendants, he said.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: A large timber sale in north-central Idaho has been put on hold because a federal judge said the agencies that approved the deal failed to consider the latest information on steelhead numbers. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled the U.S. Forest Service and National Marine Fisheries Service didn’t take into account new data that showed the numbers of threatened steelhead were at a 25-year-low when they approved the timber sale in parts of the Upper Lolo, Musselshell, Middle Lolo and Eldorado creek watersheds, The Lewiston Tribune reported. The Lolo Insect and Disease project included clear-cut-like harvest practices and would require the construction of 13 miles of temporary roads. It is expected to produce 44 million board feet of timber and help sustain as many as 963 jobs. Opponents said it would also send sediment into streams in the area, harming threatened wild steelhead that are protected under the Endangered Species Act. The federal fisheries service issued a biological opinion that said the project was likely to harm the steelhead that spawn in the streams but that it wouldn’t jeopardize the existence of the population nor adversely affect critical habitat.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The Chicago home where blues legend Muddy Waters once lived and recorded music is a step closer to landmark status and becoming a museum in his honor. The Commission on Chicago Landmarks granted final approval of landmark status to the brick two-flat home in the South Side neighborhood of North Kenwood, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. It now moves to the City Council Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards and, if approved, to a vote of the full council. Waters, known as the “Father of Chicago Blues,” moved to the city from rural Mississippi in 1943. He moved his family into the home in 1954 and purchased it in 1956. Waters’ family lived on the first floor of the house. He rented out the upstairs and had a recording studio in the basement. Waters’ great granddaughter, Chandra Cooper, now owns the property and is converting it into The MOJO Muddy Waters House Museum. Waters’ Chicago home was a gathering place for musicians, and some – including legends like Chuck Berry and Otis Spann – lived there at one time or another. Waters lived in the home until his wife died in 1973. He then moved to suburban Westmont, living there until his 1983 death.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend:St. Joseph County has reached a financial settlement with a former inmate who was wrongfully jailed for more than 40 days after being charged in two counties for the same offense. County commissioners recently approved a $12,500 settlement for Ian McQueen, 42, who was charged in St. Joseph and Elkhart counties with stealing a car. He was kept in the St. Joseph County Jail for 43 days despite being sentenced to probation in Elkhart County for the same crime. Officials blamed a lack of communication between the counties’ court systems for the situation. Court documents showed McQueen stole a car in Mishawaka but was arrested for that offense by police in Elkhart. Two separate sets of charges were then filed in Elkhart and St. Joseph counties for the same offense, the South Bend Tribune reported. McQueen pleaded guilty in the Elkhart case and was sentenced to probation in November 2020. However, because a warrant was issued for his arrest in the pending St. Joseph County case, police there were required to hold him in jail, said Pete Agostino, an attorney who represented the county commissioners in the settlement.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: An eastern Iowa official is participating in a trial for a COVID-19 booster shot, and it’s the second time she has been part of one. Cedar Rapids City Council member Ashley Vanorny traveled Friday to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics for the trial for a booster shot manufactured by Pfizer, KGAN-TV reported. The trial is expected to last a year. Vanorny received the first of two Pfizer shots in August 2020. At the time, she didn’t know whether she received the vaccine or a placebo. She also didn’t know whether her shot Friday was a placebo. Vanorny said she was recruited for the trials because the researchers were looking for a woman who wasn’t pregnant. “I believe in the science,” she said.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The city of Lawrence and Douglas County will require employees and visitors to wear masks inside their buildings, adding to the local mandates aimed at controlling the more contagious coronavirus delta variant. The rules took effect Monday and applied regardless of whether someone has been vaccinated against COVID-19. Their announcements came the same day the University of Kansas imposed an indoor mask mandate for students, staff and visitors at its main campus in Lawrence and a satellite campus in Johnson County in the Kansas City area. Manhattan, the northeast Kansas city that is home to the main Kansas State University campus, also is requiring masks inside its buildings, as is Kansas State.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: State and federal authorities investigating potential human trafficking searched three massage businesses in Kentucky this week, according to state police. The businesses were J Spa on Patchen Drive in Lexington, K 1 Spa in Somerset and Sunny Spa in Elizabethtown, state police said in a release. Police served search warrants Wednesday at each location after receiving complaints and tips related to possible human trafficking, illegal immigration, prostitution and operating without a license, according to the release. Police identified customer information at each spa, and state and federal investigations continue. The release did not mention arrests at any of the businesses. In addition to state police, the agencies involved in the searches included the Lexington Police Department, the Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office, the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Police asked anyone with information about the businesses, or others potentially involved in criminal activity, to call state police at (800) 222-5555 or the FBI at (502) 263-6000.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A program that uses oyster shells discarded by restaurants to construct artificial reefs to protect coastal Louisiana is rebuilding itself after being shut down last year by the coronavirus pandemic. The Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana program has been working since 2014 to recycle oyster shells to protect wetlands and coastal communities. But with stay-at-home orders and and other pandemic restrictions in 2020, it was shuttered, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reported. Before the pandemic, about 20 restaurants produced about 75 tons a month for the effort. Now the coalition and the Chef’s Brigade have 13 restaurants contributing cast-off shells, the website reported. The shells, which would otherwise be sent to landfills, are used to build protections against waves, storms and rising sea levels that contribute to land loss. They also encourage the growth of new oysters and provide a home and food for other marine life.The Chef’s Brigade, which ran a meal assistance program during the pandemic’s first wave, was instrumental in recruiting for the recycling program, according to the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine’s long-shuttered shrimp fishing business has a chance to reopen this winter, but the warming of the ocean threatens to keep the industry shut down. Maine shrimp were once a winter delicacy, but the fishery has been shut down since 2013. Scientists have said environmental conditions in the warming Gulf of Maine are inhospitable for the cold water-loving shrimp. An interstate regulatory board is scheduled to make a decision this fall about whether to extend a moratorium on the shrimp fishery that is set to end this year. Scientists have not seen a lot of good signs that suggest reopening the fishery is a good idea, said Dustin Colson Leaning, a fishery management plan coordinator for the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, which regulates the business. A 2019 report from the Atlantic States commission found that the shrimp were depleted, the number of shrimp that were able to spawn was “extremely low,” and “recent environmental conditions continue to be unfavorable” for the species. New data about the shrimp will become available this year, but it will be limited because a lot of scientific surveys were canceled by the coronavirus pandemic, Colson said. New England fishermen often caught millions of pounds of the fish every winter. The catch exceeded 10 million pounds in several years in the 1990s and topped that total as recently as 2011 before a collapse in 2013.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:A Pennsylvania girl’s injuries at a Maryland beach are consistent with a bite from a sandbar shark and would be a first for the state, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources. Experts made the determination after reviewing photos of the 12-year-old girl’s injuries shared by the Ocean City Beach Patrol, department spokeswoman Megan McGinn-Meals said in an email to the Associated Press. There have been a few unconfirmed reports over the years, McGinn-Meals said, but this would be Maryland’s first “confirmed, nearshore ocean bite” that’s not fishing-related. An angler at Assateague Island was bitten in 2014 while releasing a shark from his line and a man clamming near Mills Island in Chincoteague Bay was bitten about the same time, she said. The bite left 12-year-old Jordan Prushinski with 42 stitches for 20 cuts, family members told WBRE-TV. She was in knee-deep water in Ocean City on Monday when she limped out of the water bleeding from the leg, the family said. Other beachgoers, including an EMT and a nurse, helped give Prushinski first aid and the family took her to a hospital. Prushinski said she will go out in the water again once her stitches are out, WJZ-TV reported. “Something like this is rare and rare for it to even happen again,” she said. Sandbar sharks aren’t aggressive and have rare interactions with humans, and beachgoers shouldn’t let this stop them from enjoying the ocean, Ocean City Beach Patrol Capt. Butch Arbin said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNorthampton: Coca-Cola has announced plans to shutter its Northampton bottling plant in the summer of 2023, leaving its 319 employees to find new jobs. The beverage giant announced plans last week to close the plant, as well as sell facilities in Michigan, Missouri and Texas to Refresco, the Daily Hampshire Gazette reported. Northampton Mayor David Narkewicz said this will be a major economic loss for the city. Narkewicz said the plant is the city’s largest manufacturer, water customer and taxpayer. The property is assessed at $17.7 million, according to city tax records, and the company pays about $306,000 in annual property taxes. The company has benefited from a 13-year tax increment financing agreement with the city that lowered taxes by 50% for the first seven years and by 25% for the remainder. The agreement expires in the summer of 2023. Narkewicz said that representatives informed him that the closure is tied to a restructuring plan that will also close a facility in California.\n\nMichigan\n\nCuster: A 75-year-old man has been rescued nearly 11 hours after falling about 30 feet from a tree and injuring his back in a remote, wooded area of western Michigan. A conservation officer located the man who was able to call 911 before his cellphone lost reception, Michigan’s Department of Natural Resources said. Authorities were told that the man had gone to the Whiskey Creek area near Custer, about 100 miles northwest of Grand Rapids, to prepare tree stands for the deer hunting season. Conservation officer Josiah Killingbeck was on patrol and found the man’s truck. Killingbeck located a faint walking path and found a set of footprints on a dirt bike trail, the DNR said. Killingbeck called out for the man through the woods until he heard a weak reply. He found the man at the base of a large oak tree. The man was carried from the woods on a backboard by emergency support personnel and then airlifted to a trauma center.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: An annual Greek festival in the Uptown neighborhood of Minneapolis has been canceled because of recent unrest in the district, sponsors said. St. Mary’s Greek Orthodox Church sponsors the Taste of Greece festival, which showcases food, music, dancing and other celebrations of Greek heritage. It had been scheduled for Sept. 9-11. The church said on the festival’s website it “would be unable to find a successful solution to ensure the safety and security” for people or property during the festival. Organizers said they plan to resume the festival next year, the Star Tribune reported. Protests and violent crime have occurred more frequently in the Uptown neighborhood since Winston Smith Jr. was shot and killed by a U.S. marshals task force on June 3. Some businesses in the area have closed because they are worried about the safety of customers and employees.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Mississippi judges have the power to delay trials, limit the number of spectators in courtrooms or take other steps to try to slow the spread of COVID-19, the leader of the state Supreme Court said in an emergency order. Chief Justice Michael Randolph issued the order Thursday in response to the rapid spread of illness caused by highly contagious delta variant of the virus. Mississippi has one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the nation, and state health officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said 97% of new cases of COVID-19 in Mississippi are among people who are unvaccinated. Randolph’s order said judges can postpone jury trials that are scheduled through Sept. 10. In addition to limiting the number of spectators in courtrooms, judges can require people to wear masks and maintain distance between each other. The order encouraged courts to use teleconferencing and videoconferencing, when possible. Plea hearings in felony cases must still take place in person, but defendants and others in the courtrooms should wear masks and maintain social distancing.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A man who shot a massive bighead carp last month while bowfishing has set a state record, the Department of Conservation said. Matt Neuling of Perryville shot the 125-pound, 5-ounce fish on July 24 at Lake Perry, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. “I was out with my buddy early that morning when we both shot what we thought was a 30-pound grass carp,” Neuling told the department. “My buddy’s arrow pulled out, but mine shot straight through and stayed in there.” Neuling said his friend sent another arrow into the fish. “If my buddy wasn’t with me, there was no way I could have pulled it out of the water,” he said. The department estimated the fish was 10 years old. It also noted that bighead carp are invasive. Missouri separates fishing records by pole-and-line and alternative methods, such as bowfishing.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:Evacuation orders were rescinded for Austin Lane, Sheep Creek Lane and Sheep Creek Road, according to a wildfire update Saturday morning. The Cascade County Sheriff's Office said residents can return to these locations. The fire was burning in difficult and rugged terrain, with fuels and topography driving fire activity. The fire was just over 31,500 acres in size and 7 miles away from Cascade. The fire as of Saturday morning was 40% contained. “The 17% increase in containment comes from firefighter efforts extending a secure fireline from Soldier Creek west to Bird Creek and also in the area of Sheep Creek Lane,” according to the fire update. Evacuation orders are still in place for residents living on Adel Road south of the intersection with the West Hound Creek Road as, well as Cannon Lake Lane.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Three people narrowly escaped a flooded elevator following a storm that hit Omaha on Saturday night. Tony Luu said he and his two friends got in his apartment elevator to check out storm damage, KTRK-TV reported. Before the elevator doors could open, Luu said water started pouring in through the vents as they descended. Luu called his roommate for help as they waited in chest-high water for emergency responders to arrive. “We might die if you don’t come help us,” he said on the phone. Luu’s roommate and two other people managed to open the elevator from the lobby by the time the water was up to his neck. “I was swimming out,” Luu said. No injuries were reported.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Authorities issued an air quality alert for metro Las Vegas on Saturday, citing unhealthy conditions caused by smoke drifting into Nevada from wildfires in California. “Unfortunately, this is expected to continue through today and Sunday,” the National Weather Service ‘s Las Vegas office said Saturday. The Clark County Department of Environment and Sustainability said small dust particles and other pollutants in smoke can aggravate respiratory diseases and contribute to the formation of ozone. Ozone can induce coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath even in healthy people, the department said. The department urged people to stay indoors when smoke is present and to limit outdoor activity and keep doors and windows closed. Residents most sensitive to the unhealthy conditions include those with respiratory problems, cardiac disease, young children or senior citizens, officials said. Unhealthy air conditions were present Friday in the Reno area, prompting the Washoe County Health District to issue an air quality alert. “Smoke and long periods of poor air quality for many areas in northeastern California and western Nevada is expected to persist through at least Saturday,” the weather service’s Reno office said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: An adult who became infected with the Jamestown Canyon Virus has died, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services said. The virus is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. The adult, from Dublin, New Hampshire, was “hospitalized with worsening neurological symptoms and ultimately died,” the department said in a news release. “JCV infection was identified as a contributing cause to their death.” No further information was released about the person. The department said this has been the first detection of the virus in a person in the state this year. The risk of transmission of mosquito-borne diseases to people in Dublin will be increased to high as a result of the identified infection, the department said. The level for the surrounding towns of Harrisville, Peterborough, Jaffrey, and Marlborough will increase to moderate. “Jamestown Canyon Virus and the other mosquito-borne infections can cause serious illness,” said Dr. Benjamin Chan, the state epidemiologist. “As summer progresses into fall, the risk from mosquito-transmitted infections is expected to increase. So residents and visitors to New Hampshire should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites, especially as people are encouraged to spend more time outdoors during the COVID-19 pandemic.” Since the first report of the disease in New Hampshire in 2013, there have been 15 human cases of JCV. Nationally, there are about 15 human cases of the virus diagnosed each year.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBarnegat Light: Coast Guard authorities said a boater was airlifted to a hospital with injuries reportedly sustained after his vessel ran aground off New Jersey. Authorities said the Coast Guard Sector Delaware Bay was called Saturday after the 33-foot pleasure craft ran aground in Oyster Creek Channel near Barnegat Light. A 29-foot-Coast Guard vessel was launched to assist the 62-year-old man, who had injuries to his rib and arm. After he was stabilized, he was taken to Station Barnegat Light and then transported to Jersey Shore Medical Center for additional treatment.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: With more than four months remaining, Albuquerque has had a record number of homicides this year within the city limits. City police said the homicide total hit 81 early Sunday. The previous record was set in 2019, when there were 80 homicides in Albuquerque. The total dropped to 77 in 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Albuquerque Journal reported the city isn’t alone in seeing a tremendous spike in violence in 2021. Data released by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that in the first six months of 2021, 45 U.S. cities out of the 66 that responded to a survey saw more homicides than in the first six month of 2019.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Citi Bike said it is aware of a scam in which thieves are switching the QR code stickers on rental bicycles in order to steal bikes unwittingly unlocked by customers. The scammers wait for a renter to unlock a bicycle using the QR code, then ride away on the bike to which the code actually belongs, officials said. “Citi Bike is aware of this issue and, while it has not been widespread, we have been actively working to address it in a number of ways, including upgraded QR decals,” Citi Bike spokesperson Jordan Levine told The New York Post. Each rental ride costs $3. But a customer can be charged $1,200 if a bicycle they rent ends up lost or stolen. June and July were two of the busiest months in the history of the program, with a total of more than 6.2 million rides purchased in New York City, including a single-day high of 126,099 rides on July 24, Levine said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A snake collector whose escaped zebra cobra caused a frenzy for days this summer in a Raleigh neighborhood has pleaded guilty to a charge, agreeing in turn to pay restitution and give up his snakes. Christopher Gifford, 21, had been charged last month with 40 misdemeanors stemming from the venomous snake’s escape. Authorities ultimately captured it in late June. The snake actually had escaped last November, according to Gifford’s attorney, but he hadn’t told anyone, media outlets reported. Under Friday’s agreement in Wake County court, Gifford pleaded guilty to failing to report the missing snake. In exchange, the other 39 counts were dropped. The charge he pleaded guilty to also will be dismissed if Gifford successfully completes his probation. “It was a huge mistake,” Gifford said after the court hearing. “Whatever I can do to fix it, I’ve been trying to do.” The deal requires no time behind bars. He must pay $13,162 in part for the emergency and police response to locating the loose snake. And the dozens of snakes that he must relinquish will be used for antivenom and cancer research, said Anna Smith Felts, Gifford’s attorney. Venomous snakes are legal to own in North Carolina, but they must be kept in escape-proof, bite-proof enclosures and owners must notify law enforcement if one escapes. The cobra was reported outside a home on June 28 and captured two days later. During the search, residents were told to stay away from the snake if they saw it and call 911.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The pending sale of a financially troubled coal-fueled power plant is now in the hands of state regulators, who need to sign off on several permits so that the incoming owners can operate it. Affiliates of Rainbow Energy Marketing Corp. seek to purchase from Great River Energy the Coal Creek Station plant and an associated transmission line that runs from the plant’s location in central North Dakota to Minnesota. Great River supplies electricity to 28 rural Minnesota cooperatives, serving about 1.7 million people. The companies have applied for permit transfers from the North Dakota Public Service Commission related to the transmission line and a water pipeline, The Bismarck Tribune reported. The commission is set to hold an informal hearing Aug. 18 to discuss the matter, particularly with Rainbow Energy, Public Service Commissioner Randy Christmann said. The Sierra Club, a San Francisco-based group that wants to curb the use of fossil fuels, has been critical of the sale and has argued the process “lacked transparency and engagement.” Rainbow Energy is based in Bismarck and manages power and natural gas assets for clients within the utility sector.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A Common Pleas judge has ordered a man being sentenced on a felony drug charge to get vaccinated against COVID-19 within two months as a condition of his probation. Judge Christopher Wagner’s office emailed a statement on Friday along with a transcript of Wednesday’s hearing involving Brandon Rutherford, 21. Rutherford pleaded guilty in June to possessing the synthetic opioid fentanyl. “This defendant was in possession of fentanyl, which is deadlier than the vaccine and COVID 19,” Wagner’s statement said. “The defendant expressed no objection during the proceedings and stated no medical concerns, and his attorney did not object. We will have to see what happens now that the defendant is expressing opposition.” Wagner told Rutherford he presumed he hadn’t been vaccinated because he was wearing a mask, which Rutherford confirmed. When asked, Rutherford told the judge he wasn’t worried about the vaccine. “I just never went to get it,” he said. Rutherford’s attorney, Carl Lewis, told WCPO-TV, which first reported the sentence, he had never heard of a judge issuing such an order. “If he truly believes that he’s within his authority to order the individual to get a vaccine, then we’ll have some legal issues,” Lewis said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A judge has ordered the state to reinstate a pandemic-related supplemental federal unemployment assistance program that was cut off to thousands of workers in June. In a letter to attorneys in the case late Friday, Oklahoma County District Judge Anthony Bonner granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting Oklahoma from withdrawing from the program until he issues a final order in the case, or until the program expires in September. “Oklahoma shall notify the U.S. Department of Labor immediately to reinstate and administer the federal unemployment benefit programs,” Bonner wrote. Attorney Brendan McHugh said his clients are pleased and awaiting a detailed order, which Bonner said would come Monday. “It’s always a good day when a judge or the court system tells an elected official they exceeded their power or have gone too far,” McHugh told the Associated Press. Gov. Kevin Stitt in May announced the supplemental payments would end in late June, but was not named in the lawsuit. Alex Gerszewski, spokesperson for the state attorney general’s office, said the order was being reviewed and declined further comment.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A coalition of bars in Portland has banded together to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination at the door as the delta variant spreads throughout the state. The coalition of 15 bars is being organized by Teardrop Cocktail Lounge owner Daniel Shoemaker, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. He said he expects to add as many as 30 more establishments in the coming days as they seek to protect customers and staff by allowing only vaccinated guests inside. Each bar in the coalition will create its own rules around what constitutes proof, but generally a vaccine card or photo of it should suffice\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb announced his candidacy for Pennsylvania’s open U.S. Senate seat, joining a crowded Democratic field in one of the nation’s most competitive races. Lamb is seeking the nomination to replace outgoing GOP U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey. Lamb, a former Marine and federal prosecutor, rose to political prominence three years ago when he beat a Donald Trump-backed Republican in a special election that foreshadowed the 2018 Democratic takeover of the House. The Senate race is wide open on both sides and is expected to be among the most expensive in a 2022 U.S. midterm election that will decide party control of an evenly split Senate. Toomey is retiring after two terms. Lamb launched his campaign Friday afternoon at a union hall in Pittsburgh, making a heavy economic pitch to working and middle class voters while slamming Republicans who tried to overturn the last presidential election. Pennsylvania Republican Chair Lawrence Tabas panned Lamb’s entrance into the race, asserting Lamb – considered a Democratic moderate – has a “reckless track record of putting liberal interests over Pennsylvanians.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence:The city’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade, canceled last year and postponed this year because of the pandemic, has been rescheduled for Sept. 18, organizers said Friday. The parade is scheduled to start at noon and will be preceded by two road races. Former fire Chief Michael Dillon was named the grand marshal, with Citizen’s Bank executive and state Board of Education Chair Barbara Cottam as deputy grand marshal. The parade will also honor first responders and front-line workers who have helped the city’s response to the pandemic. Newport’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade has been canceled two years in a row.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: The Greenville News reported city officials are considering selling the city’s convention center to Greenville County. The convention center usually runs at a deficit, and the city paid a shortfall of more than $1 million last year as events were canceled because of the pandemic. The convention center was used instead for testing and vaccination efforts against the virus. City spokesperson Liz Brotherton said the Greenville Convention Center is “an important asset to our hospitality and tourism industry,” but said the city can’t afford to absorb the losses on its own. The city’s agreement with SMG, the convention center’s private manager, is scheduled to end June 30, 2022. SMG makes $165,000 a year, and gets paid bonuses if it reduces the amount the city loses on the convention center. Brotherton said the last time SMG got a loss-reduction incentive was in 2019. Selling the convention center to the larger county government could keep it in operation, drawing events to the area.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: Law enforcement officials said the first few days of this year’s Sturgis Motorcycle Rally have been among the busiest they have seen. About 700,000 people were expected to celebrate their enthusiasm for motorcycles at the 10-day event that kicked off Friday. “There are more people here than in the 31 years I’ve been doing this,” Meade County Sheriff Ron Merwin told the Rapid City Journal on Saturday. Law enforcement in Sturgis and Meade County are reporting their calls for service during the first few days are up dramatically compared to previous years. Sturgis Police Chief Geody VanDewater said officers have issued 207 violations for open containers of alcohol since Friday. The city allows open containers of beer and wine, but not liquor, during the rally in certain downtown areas, but drinkers must purchase a special cup to do so. “You can’t use cans or red cups. You must use the official souvenir cup purchased from the city and have a wrist band,” VanDewater said. The chief said only two arrests have been made for open container violations because the patrons were uncooperative; the rest have been verbal warnings. Arrests have also been made for drugs and traffic violations, police reported.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee has seen a 90% increase in people receiving the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccination over the past two weeks, Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey said. Piercey praised the bump in inoculations while warning that the virus continues to surge throughout the state. She said pediatric cases are “quickly on the rise.” “We’ve had increased vaccine uptake among Tennesseans, and I don’t really care what the reason is. I want our work to be effective but whatever it is that’s causing it, I appreciate that and am encouraged by that,” Piercey said. About 39.4% of the state’s population has been fully vaccinated, among the lowest rates in the country. Tennessee’s low vaccination rates recently attracted national scrutiny after Piercey fired the state’s former vaccine director and paused outreach for childhood vaccines. Piercey later said the pause was to ensure that childhood vaccine marketing targeted parents, not children, as some lawmakers claimed.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:The fourth and final phase in the enforcement of a city-wide homeless camping ban began Sunday. From this point forward, arrests are to be made if an individual refuses to leave an area. The heightened enforcement came as city officials are working to try to avoid that scenario by continuing to move people out of encampments and into shelter at hotels owned by the city. That process has been completed at encampments in two areas of town and was set to be completed by the end of last week at a third encampment in downtown along Caesar Chavez Street. All told, about 130 people will have been moved from the three encampments and into two hotels since the middle of June, according to the city. A fourth encampment in northwest Austin is next to be addressed under a City Council plan to connect people experiencing homelessness to housing through the HEAL initiative. Beginning Sunday, arrests will be made if police issue a citation for camping and the cited individual refuses to leave the area. In that scenario, the person being arrested is to be processed through the Downtown Austin Community Court whenever possible so they can be connected to services specific to people experiencing homelessness.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Smoke filled the skies of Utah as a cold front swept wildfire smoke into the state. The front moving in from the west picked up smoke from fires in California and Oregon, including a growing fire that leveled a small California town earlier this week, National Weather Service meteorologist Christine Kruse told KSL.com. The air quality got so bad that the site WorldIQ Air, which tracks air quality across dozens of cities globally, ranked Utah’s capitol among the worst in the world. The Utah Department of Environmental Quality forecast air quality to reach levels unhealthy for all groups of people in Salt Lake, Davis, Tooele and Utah counties. Division of Air Quality recommended everyone avoid outdoor activity as much as possible and limit driving. Those in sensitive populations were recommended to be even more careful. Several schools canceled outdoor activities. Poor air quality is linked to spikes in multiple health issues, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, heart attacks and stroke. It also increases the risk of viral infections, such as COVID-19, said Dr. Denitza Blagev, a pulmonary physician at Intermountain Healthcare.\n\nVermont\n\nNorth Hero: A lack of security is forcing the court system to reduce in-person services at the Grand Isle Superior Court. The new plan will still allow in-person drop-off of filings two days a week. The changes will not limit the judiciary’s ability to conduct hearings or address other court-related needs of the public. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Grand Isle Courthouse has been conducting proceedings almost entirely remotely principally because the building lacks the ventilation system necessary to meet court’s COVID-19 protocols. Court Administrator Patricia Gabel said the courts would continue to be available via phone and that remote hearings will continue.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The University of Virginia is requiring everyone on campus to wear masks indoors starting Monday in the wake of rising coronavirus infections from a highly contagious variant. All students, faculty, staff and visitors – including those vaccinated – will have to wear masks when entering any UVA building, The Daily Progress of Charlottesville reported. The restrictions, in keeping with recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, came as fall classes begin later this month. Like elsewhere in the country, the delta variant is contributing to an increase in daily cases and hospitalizations in Virginia. “This policy will allow us to start the year at full capacity and reduce the likelihood of a spike in cases driven by the delta variant and a coming together of students from many places,” UVA provost Liz Magill and Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis wrote in an email to the university community Friday. UVA officials said they’re hoping to lift the mask mandate for those who are vaccinated by Sept. 6. Virginia Tech also announced late last week that all instructors and students will have to wear face coverings in classrooms and laboratories when classes begin Aug. 23.\n\nWashington\n\nVancouver: Nearly 50 years after skyjacker D.B. Cooper vanished out the back of a Boeing 727 into freezing rain – wearing a business suit, a parachute and a pack with $200,000 in cash – a crime historian is conducting a dig on the banks of the Columbia River in search of evidence. KOIN reported that Eric Ulis, a self-described expert on the D.B. Cooper case, began a two-day dig on Friday. Ulis and four volunteers are searching for evidence about 10 to 15 yards away from where a boy found $6,000 of Cooper’s ransom money in 1980. Ulis said his theory is that Cooper buried the parachutes, an attache case and the money at the same time, but dug smaller holes instead of a large one. The case of Cooper has become infamous, not only in the Pacific Northwest but also in the country. The FBI Seattle field office called the investigation one of the longest and most exhaustive in the agency’s history.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLawn: Law enforcement officials said two people have been arrested after they were found chained to pipeline construction equipment in Greenbrier County. Local news outlets reported the two were found Friday morning in the Dawson area secured to pipeline equipment with chains and a welded pipe. According to the Greenbrier County Sheriff’s office, local fire department officials helped extract the pair, who were below ground level in a hole. Deputies said one individual voluntarily climbed out, but the other refused and had to be lifted out. The two face charges of trespassing, obstructing an officer and conspiracy. It was not immediately known if they had an attorney. Known as the Mountain Valley Pipeline, the project has faced various legal challenges from environmental groups because construction has led to violations of regulations meant to control erosion and sedimentation. The 303-mile pipeline will take natural gas drilled from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations and transport it through West Virginia and Virginia\n\nWisconsin\n\nBoscobel: Residents of Grant County are cleaning up debris Sunday after a tornado touched down near Boscobel destroying or damaging homes and farm outbuildings. Initial damage assessments by fire departments in the area indicated six homes were destroyed, five had major damage and 10 had minor damage from the storm that hit Saturday night. As for barns and sheds, 11 outbuildings were destroyed, 10 received major damage and two had minor damage. No injuries have been reported, and no residents have requested shelter, according to Grant County Emergency Management. Volunteers were helping clean up the area Sunday afternoon. The tornado touched down near the Boscobel city limits and traveled southeast roughly four miles, according to initial reports. Crews from the National Weather Service were surveying damage to determine the tornado’s velocity.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Former U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi was remembered Friday during his funeral as an honorable statesman and family man who was focused on leadership, tradition and faith. The Wyoming Republican died July 26 after he was hospitalized with a broken neck and ribs for three days following a bicycle accident near Gillette. He was 77. Friends, family, constituents and colleagues gathered at a college athletic center in Gillette for Enzi’s funeral, and a line to get inside stretched out the door before the service started. Enzi’s son, Brad, recalled how his father was so dedicated to his family that he received special permission to leave the Senate between votes so he could travel to Wyoming to hold one of his newborn granddaughters, if only for a couple of hours. Addressing his mother, who was married to Mike Enzi for 52 years, the younger Enzi said, “I’ve never in my life seen a man more enamored, more proud, and more googly-eyed. … You only need to look at photos where he looks at you and not at the camera to remember his love for you.” Wyoming’s entire congressional delegation attended the service, as did several of Enzi’s former colleagues in the Senate, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, The Gillette News Record reported.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/18/cash-tower-leak-underwater-plaque-library-union-news-around-states/50247181/", "title": "Cash tower leak, underwater plaque: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nThomasville: The whole town celebrated in 2020 when, early in the coronavirus pandemic, Thomasville Regional Medical Center opened, offering state-of-the-art medicine that was previously unavailable in a poor, isolated part of the state. The timing for the ribbon-cutting seemed perfect: New treatment options would be available in an underserved area just as a global health crisis was unfolding. In the end, that same timing may be the reason for the hospital’s undoing. Now deep in the red two years into the pandemic, the 29-bed, $40 million hospital with a soaring, sun-drenched lobby and 110 employees is among three medical centers in the United States that say they are missing out on millions in federal pandemic relief money because the facilities are so new they lack full financial statements from before the crisis to prove how much it cost them. In Thomasville, located in timber country about 95 miles north of Mobile, hospital officials have worked more than a year to convince federal officials they should have gotten $8.2 million through the CARES Act, not just the $1 million they received. With a total debt of $35 million, the quest gets more urgent each day, said Curtis James, the chief executive officer. “No hospital can sustain itself without getting the CARES Act money that everybody else got,” James said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state court judge has said a majority of members on the board tasked with redrawing Alaska’s political boundaries appeared to have adopted a map that splits the Eagle River area into two Senate districts for “political reasons,” and he ordered a new map to be used this year. Superior Court Judge Thomas Matthews in a decision made public late Monday ordered the Alaska Redistricting Board to adopt on an interim basis a map that in part pairs the Eagle River area House districts into a Senate district. The decision comes in a second round of redistricting challenges. The map that the judge ordered be adopted was the other option the board had considered when weighing a revised map. Matthews said he expected a quick review of his decision by the Alaska Supreme Court. The candidate filing deadline for the August primary is June 1. The Alaska Supreme Court in March found constitutional issues with elements of a map drawn by the board last fall. In one of the instances, the court ruled that a state Senate district pairing part of east Anchorage and the Eagle River area constituted an “unconstitutional political gerrymander.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state Senate on Monday opened an ethics investigation into a firebrand Republican member who tweeted inflammatory comments about last weekend’s racist attack at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that left 10 people dead. The referral of Sen. Wendy Rogers of Flagstaff to the Ethics Committee was in lieu of the immediate expulsion that Democratic lawmakers were planning, GOP Majority Leader Rick Gray said. Due process considerations require no less than an ethics investigation, he said. But Democrats were furious, noting that Rogers was just censured in March for a repeated series of tweets and statements that embraced white nationalism and called for violence. On Saturday, as news came out of the mass shooting by a white suspect who had posted a racist screed on the internet and driven about 200 miles to a primarily Black neighborhood in Buffalo, Rogers tweeted: “Fed boy summer has started in Buffalo.” Many in both parties took that tweet to mean that Rogers was blaming the attack on the federal government, especially in light of Rogers’ history of embracing conspiracy theories and posting of racist tropes. GOP Senate leaders tried to get in front of the controversy Monday, putting out a statement condemning the violence and “all hate speech that has served as an inspiration for these kinds of heinous crimes.”\n\nArkansas\n\nKingsland: The silhouette of “The Man in Black” is painted on the side of the town’s water tower. But someone shot the painting of Johnny Cash just to watch it leak. The tower was still leaking the town’s drinking water Tuesday. The gunshot hit the image of the iconic country singer in the crotch. The water tower in Kingsland, a small town of 400 about an hour south of Little Rock, features a mural of country music legend Johnny Cash, according to the Cleveland County Herald. The shooter fired the shot May 11, and repairs continued this week. The town had just spent $300,000 on the water tower. Cash was born in 1932 in Kingsland. The Cleveland County Sheriff’s Department is investigating the case of vandalism. Anyone with information can call the sheriff at 870-325-6222.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Homelessness increased nearly 9% in the San Francisco Bay Area over the past three years, despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent to keep people off the streets during the coronavirus pandemic, preliminary numbers released Monday show. San Francisco proper appeared to be the one bright spot, seeing homelessness decline slightly. Alameda County, which includes the city of Oakland, reported a 22% increase in this year’s point-in-time survey, while neighboring Contra Costa County saw a 35% jump in people spotted living in shelters, vehicles or outdoors. The largest county in the region, Santa Clara, reported a 3% increase from 2019, including an 11% increase in the city of San Jose. San Francisco reported a 3.5% decline to nearly 7,800 homeless residents, which housing advocates chalked up in part to a wealth tax approved by voters in 2018. In total, seven of the Bay Area’s nine counties reported counting more than 35,000 people experiencing homelessness in late February. The count is required every other year by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and helps determine funding. San Mateo and Solano counties did not report preliminary numbers Monday. Housing advocates said increases across the region would have been worse without strong and speedy intervention from the state and local government.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The partner of an embattled former police chief in suburban Denver is accused of falsely reporting that a vocal opponent of the chief was sexually abusing her son, authorities alleged in court documents filed Monday. Robin Niceta, a county social worker at the time, allegedly made an anonymous call to a child abuse hotline Jan. 28 alleging that she saw Aurora City Councilmember Danielle Jurinsky inappropriately touching Jurinsky’s son, an affidavit for an arrest warrant for Niceta said. The call came a day after Jurinsky called for police Chief Vanessa Wilson to resign, saying on a talk radio show that Wilson was “trash.” An investigation cleared Jurinsky of any wrongdoing, and she told investigators she thought the tip was retaliation for her comments about Wilson. According to an affidavit seeking Niceta’s arrest, the call came from Niceta’s personal cellphone on file with the county, and a search of her laptop showed a search for the hotline number and Jurinsky’s address just before the call was made. Niceta denied making the call. She said Wilson and her two children also had access to her phone, though she said her children would not have called. When pressed about who could have called, Niceta said that “it wasn’t me,” the affidavit said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Britain: A fire official has been fired and seven other firefighters have been disciplined following an investigation into drug use at firehouses around the city, the mayor said. The investigation began after the apparent drug-related death of a 36-year-old off-duty firefighter in his home in January. A lieutenant in the department was fired in February after an investigation showed he was “knowingly supplying, giving, selling, sharing and using illegal drugs and (his) prescription Adderall pills,” according to a termination letter from Mayor Erin Stewart that was first obtained by The Hartford Courant. The other seven, including four with the rank of lieutenant or above, have been required to take 30 days of unpaid leave, demoted to the rank of private and placed on probation for three years, during which time they cannot seek promotion and will be subject to random drug testing, according to the mayor’s office. The drugs involved include prescription Adderall as well as fentanyl, heroin and marijuana, Stewart said. A criminal investigation is ongoing, but no charges have been filed. Several other firefighters have resigned since January’s death. The results of toxicology tests were pending, but officials have said it was an apparent drug overdose.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge has refused to dismiss a criminal charge accusing the embattled state auditor of deliberately breaking up payments for a contract into which she entered with a former campaign consultant in order to avoid compliance with state procurement law. In a ruling dated Friday, Superior Court Judge William Carpenter Jr. ruled that an indictment against Kathleen McGuiness sufficiently alleged that she willfully fragmented or structured the payments to circumvent the state procurement code. Defense attorney Steve Wood argued that the indictment failed to charge an offense or provide fair notice of what McGuiness needed to defend against. He also argued that the indictment failed to allege that she structured two or more no-bid contracts and that it didn’t specify which section of the procurement code or state Budget and Accounting Policy Manual she intended to violate. McGuiness, a Democrat who was elected in 2018 and is responsible for rooting out government fraud, waste and abuse, was indicted in October on felony counts of theft and witness intimidation, as well as misdemeanor charges of official misconduct, conflict of interest and noncompliance with procurement laws. A trial is scheduled to start later this month. McGuiness has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Karine Jean-Pierre held her first briefing as the new White House press secretary Monday, crediting “barrier-breaking people” who came before her for making it possible for a Black, gay, immigrant woman like herself to rise to one of the most high-profile jobs in American government. “I stand on their shoulders. If it were not for generations of barrier-breaking people before me, I would not be here,” Jean-Pierre said. “But I benefit from their sacrifices. I have learned from their excellence, and I am forever grateful to them.” President Joe Biden entrusted Jean-Pierre, 47, with the responsibility of being his chief spokesperson earlier this month. Jen Psaki, who had held the job since the start of the administration, stepped down last Friday. Jean-Pierre, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, is the first Black woman and the first openly LGBTQ person to serve as White House press secretary. She had been the principal deputy press secretary and led the briefing on several occasions, making history in May 2021 when she first subbed for Psaki. She also held regular off-camera “gaggles” with the much smaller group of reporters who travel aboard Air Force One with the president.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey Largo: The 20th anniversary of the storied intentional sinking of a former Naval ship to become an artificial reef in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary was celebrated Tuesday. The 510-foot-long Spiegel Grove earned international notoriety when it sank prematurely May 17, 2002, and landed with its upside-down bow protruding above the ocean’s surface about 6 miles off Key Largo. A massive remediation effort began, resulting in the former Landing Ship Dock being fully sunk on its starboard side June 10, 2002. Three years later, strong currents and waves generated from Hurricane Dennis when it was east of Cuba pushed the ship into the intended upright position on the ocean bottom about 130 feet below the surface. “Ultimately, the Spiegel Grove is a story that Hollywood would never have been able to script in a million years,” said Rob Bleser, a Key Largo dive operator and the vessel’s sinking project manager. Bleser and other key individuals planned to gather Tuesday evening at a local cultural center for a reception and panel discussion on the fascinating events surrounding the ship. On Sunday, divers affixed a commemorative plaque to the Spiegel Grove, sponsored by a group of Navy veterans who had served on it, recognizing the multimillion-dollar project’s supporters, as well as military personnel who were stationed on the ship commissioned in 1956.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Several Black students who were suspended for trying to protest Confederate flag displays at their school have filed a federal lawsuit against the school district and its board members, accusing them of allowing an extensive pattern of racism including “overt bigotry and animosity by some white students and teachers against African American students.” The students, joined by their mothers as plaintiffs, already made news when their protest at Coosa High School was stifled last fall. Now, in their lawsuit filed Tuesday against the Floyd County school district and its board members, they allege an extensive pattern of racism, including white students reenacting the murder of George Floyd and posting it on social media, as well as a student who carried what appeared to be a whip and told a Black student, “We used to whip you.” They also allege unfair punishment: Students are banned from wearing Black Lives Matter shirts, but Confederate flag apparel is acceptable under the school’s dress code, the lawsuit says. The suit faults administrators for “deliberate indifference to acts of racial animosity toward black students perpetrated by white students and teachers; as well as the school’s viewpoint discrimination in its dress code and the inconsistent administration of disciplinary policies to the detriment of Black students.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state is on course to receive $14 million in federal funding to help protect endangered forest birds and other species, officials said Monday. U.S. Rep. Ed Case, D-Hawaii, said the funding will help the state fight mosquitoes that threaten birds found nowhere else in the world. There are an estimated 45 akikiki left on Kauai and 135 kiwikiu remaining on Maui, said Lainie Berry, the wildlife program manager for the state Department of Land and Natural Resources. “This tremendous level of additional federal dollars will go a long way toward supplementing and increasing earnest efforts already in place to save these species, as well as the akekee and akohekohe, whose wild population numbers are slightly higher,” Berry said. Avian malaria carried by mosquitoes is wiping out Hawaii’s forest birds. Neither the disease nor the mosquitoes that carry them are native to Hawaii. An April report from federal and state conservation officials concluded the birds have grim prospects without intervention. There are fewer of these birds compared to the past two decades and even years. Their available range has been significantly reduced as species move higher into the mountains to escape mosquitoes.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A hospital that went on lockdown in March after far-right activists protested outside is suing Ammon Bundy, Diego Rodriguez and their various political organizations for defamation and “sustained online attacks.” St. Luke’s Health System filed the lawsuit Wednesday against Bundy, his gubernatorial campaign and his People’s Rights Network organization. The hospital system is also suing Rodriguez – the grandfather of the child involved in the protection case – as well as Rodriguez’s website Freedom Man Press and the Freedom Man political action committee. Rodriguez is an associate of Bundy who has been active in Bundy’s political campaign. The child protection case involved a 10-month-old baby who was temporarily removed from family custody in March after officials determined the infant was “suffering from severe malnourishment” and at risk of injury or death, the Meridian Police Department said at the time. The baby’s parents had refused to let officers check on the child’s welfare after the family canceled a medical appointment, the police statement said. Bundy, well-known for participating in armed standoffs with law enforcement, was arrested the following day on a misdemeanor trespassing charge after he protested at a different hospital where he believed the baby was being treated. He also asked his followers to protest at the hospital and the homes of child protection service workers, law enforcement officers and others involved in the child protection case.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Three women who were found dead at a senior living facility on Chicago’s North Side amid high heat have been identified, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office said Monday. The women found dead Saturday were 76-year-old Delores McNeely, 72-year-old Gwendolyn Osborne and 68-year-old Janice Reed, the office said. All three women were found unresponsive over a 12-hour span at the James Sneider Apartments, where residents started complaining of oppressively hot conditions days earlier. Alderwoman Maria Hadden said she believes a lack of air conditioning in the building likely caused the deaths. Paul Roldan, the president and chief executive of the Hispanic Housing Development Corporation, said his team was “deeply saddened” by the news of the deaths. “The safety and security of our residents has always been our highest priority at HHDC,” Roldan said. Hadden said she went to the building Thursday and learned no one had air conditioning. She said a facilities manager told her the company was still running heat to avoid potentially being cited by the city for shutting it off too early. A city ordinance requires rental properties to be at least 68 degrees during overnight hours between Sept. 15 and June 1.\n\nIndiana\n\nPalmyra: Two men were fatally shot after a police officer and two good Samaritans stopped along a southern Indiana highway to help a driver who was stopped in the roadway, police said. The shooting happened Monday night after an officer with the Palmyra Police Department stopped to assist the “apparent stranded motorist” on State Road 135, Indiana State Police said, but they didn’t say what precipitated the gunfire or who fired the shots. As the officer arrived, two good Samaritans also stopped in a pickup truck to help, but “within seconds of exiting their cars, shots were fired” at the scene just south of Palmyra, about 20 miles northwest of Louisville, Kentucky, police said in a statement. State police did not provide additional details, saying in the news release that investigators have not said how many weapons were involved, how many shots were fired or who fired them. The shooting killed the SUV’s driver, 31-year-old Justin Moore of Owensboro, Kentucky, and one of the good Samaritans, 24-year-old Jacob Tyler McClanahan, of Corydon, Indiana, police said. Autopsies were scheduled for Wednesday, according to Indiana State Police, who were investigating at the request of Harrison County authorities.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Elaine Bohling, of Creston, earned the title Iowan of the Day in 2015 for her volunteer work. Ralph Hodson, of Ackworth, never missed a fair since 1947, but it was his volunteer work that earned him the honor in 2018. Even former Gov. Robert Ray earned the honor – a first for an elected official – in 2014. With less than 100 days until the Fairgrounds open for the Iowa State Fair, the Blue Ribbon Foundation and Cookies Food Products are ready to find a new group of Iowans to select for the honor. The tradition, now in its 25th year, honors Iowans with a “strong work ethic, loyalty to helping others, and an exceptional sense of Iowa pride.” The Iowa State Fair Blue Ribbon Foundation founded the Iowan of the Day in 1997 to celebrate the dedication residents have for their communities all over the state. Every year, the foundation selects 10 Iowans, who are celebrated on 10 out of 11 days of the State Fair. Anyone can nominate someone to become Iowan of the Day by going to blueribbonfoundation.org/IOTD for the nomination form before July 1. Nominations must come with references attesting to the nominee’s efforts along with supplementary materials to showcase the nominee’s awards, photos, articles or documents that showcase their work. Even letters of recommendation can be part of the nomination.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: In a historic first, lawyers faced off before the Kansas Supreme Court on Monday over the constitutionality of a set of GOP-authored congressional maps struck down by a lower court judge last month. It was unclear from the arguments which way the justices are set to rule on the matter, which marks the first time they have been asked to adjudicate whether the Kansas Constitution can be interpreted to apply to redistricting. Attorneys defending the maps argued politically slanted lines were an inherent part of allowing legislators to handle redistricting, though this perspective earned pushback from some members of the high court. Meanwhile, lawyers representing three sets of challengers to the maps’ allowability argued they were produced from a clear intent to hamstring certain racial and political groups, clashing with one of the court’s conservative judges in the process. At issue is whether the district lines illicitly divide the Kansas City, Kansas, area or improperly place Lawrence in the sweeping 1st Congressional District dominated by western Kansas. The maps were enacted by the Legislature over the veto of Gov. Laura Kelly but were later struck down when Wyandotte County District Court Judge Bill Klapper ruled the maps to be racial and partisan gerrymandering in an April ruling.\n\nKentucky\n\nPineville: The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration has cited the owners of an eastern Kentucky surface mine where a worker was killed by a falling tree, according to a published report. Nally & Hamilton Enterprises was cited for not following a plan that required removing trees on top of the mine’s high wall and for failing to identify, report and correct a hazardous situation, the federal agency said, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. A tree fell from the high wall above the roadway at the Bell County mine in January and struck a vehicle with two workers as it passed. One worker died, and another was seriously injured. The federal agency said Nally & Hamilton did not make sure that trees were cleared a safe distance from the edge of the top of the high wall. In addition, inspections for possible hazardous conditions at the mine were inadequate and contributed to the accident, the mine safety agency concluded. Weather conditions also likely played a role, with heavy precipitation and cycles of freezing and thawing that caused conditions which loosened support for the tree, the report said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Now is the time to head off a COVID-19 surge like the one that swamped area hospitals last summer, the head of the New Orleans Health Department said Tuesday. Case counts average 155 a day, five times higher than a month ago, and wastewater tests show increased coronavirus concentrations in both residential and tourist areas, Dr. Jennifer Avegno said. She noted that many people use home tests, so the case count “is a big underrepresentation.” She asked residents and visitors to mask up in indoor public spaces, get tested if they have been exposed to someone with the disease and get treated if appropriate. “We’re not surprised at a summer surge. This is the third year in a row,” Avegno said in a livestreamed news conference. “But none of us want to have the surge we did last year” from the delta variant of the coronavirus. She said the city is not ordering masks and noted that many residents followed previous recommendations. “Short-term but widespread indoor masking can return to not needing masks much quicker,” she said. Wastewater testing for coronavirus concentration, new since last summer, let the city “see this coming and predict the rise in cases and mobilize resources more quickly than we have in the past,” Avegno said.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: Attorney General Aaron Frey said the state is preparing for a lawsuit against manufacturers of so-called forever chemicals. Frey said at the Democratic State Convention last weekend that steps are being taken to “hold these chemical manufacturers to account.” He said an announcement could be made within weeks. The Bangor Daily News reports that the attorney general is enlisting outside counsel to assist his office. In September, the state asked law firms to submit proposals for the work. The last time that happened was during negotiations on the multistate tobacco settlement of 1998, Frey said. The lawsuit is expected to target manufacturers of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and similar chemicals that have been used in a variety of products. PFAS-contaminated soil has been found in several locations around the state. Gov. Janet Mills and lawmakers set aside $60 million of a $1.2 billion spending package this year for PFAS relief.\n\nMaryland\n\nSnow Hill: The Black-Eyed Susan riverboat will undergo partial repairs. Town Council members voted 2-1 in favor of committing to repairs that would allow the stern-wheel paddleboat to stay in service at a reduced capacity while officials seek additional funding for a full restoration. The move will preserve the boat’s purpose “as a tourist attraction and economic driver for the Lower Eastern Shore,” according to a news release from Town Manager Rick Pollitt. Snow Hill purchased the riverboat in 2020 using a combination of grant money and loans from the county and state. The Black-Eyed Susan was then in the fourth year of a five-year mandated U.S. Coast Guard inspection routine, the release said. Voyages started in August 2021 with Washington’s Inc. as the operator responsible for catered cruises along the Pocomoke River. The Black-Eyed Susan was then taken in February to Colonna’s Shipyard in Norfolk for an extensive inspection that revealed multiple issues with the hull, hydraulics system and paddlewheel frame, according to the release. Repairs were estimated at more than $600,000, a price tag outside the town budgetary means. Consultation with legal counsel determined it would also be expensive for the town to try to sell the Black-Eyed Susan on the open market.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state has agreed to pay $56 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by the families of veterans who died or became sick after contracting COVID-19 at a state-run veterans’ care center during one of the deadliest outbreaks at a long-term care facility in the U.S., officials said Thursday. The families of 84 veterans who died during the outbreak at the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home will receive a minimum of $400,000 each, while 84 veterans who contracted the disease and survived will receive a minimum of $10,000 under terms of the settlement that requires a federal judge’s approval. “The suit contends that what happened at the Soldiers’ Home was so severe that it rose to the level of a deprivation of the veterans’ constitutional rights to be free from harms recklessly created by the government,” Tom Lesser, one of the families’ attorneys, said in a statement. “No amount of money can bring back the veterans who died or erase the pain and suffering that this tragedy needlessly caused those veterans and their families, but justice required that those wrongs not go unaddressed,” he said. “This settlement recognizes that the tragedy was preventable and never should have happened.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A judge on Tuesday suspended the state’s dormant, decades-old ban on abortion, which means the procedure would not be illegal in Michigan even if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its historic Roe v. Wade decision. The Michigan law, which makes it a crime to assist in an abortion, has been on the books since 1931. But it has had no practical effect since the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide in 1973. The court, however, could throw out that landmark ruling before July, leaving abortion issues for each state to decide. Court of Claims Judge Elizabeth Gleicher granted a preliminary injunction sought by Planned Parenthood of Michigan, saying the abortion ban likely violates the state constitution. “After 50 years of legal abortion in Michigan, there can be no doubt but that the right of personal autonomy and bodily integrity enjoyed by our citizens includes the right of a woman, in consultation with her physician, to terminate a pregnancy,” the judge said. “From a constitutional standpoint, the right to obtain a safe medical treatment is indistinguishable from the right of a patient to refuse treatment.” Gleicher said other Michigan laws regulating abortion will remain in full effect.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Former broadcaster Cory Hepola, who’s running for governor with the upstart Forward Party of Minnesota, named school administrator Tamara Uselman as his running mate Tuesday. Uselman, who lives in Pelican Rapids, is director of equity and inclusion for Fargo Public Schools in North Dakota. Before that, she was assistant superintendent for Moorhead Public Schools in Minnesota. She has also been superintendent of Bismarck Public Schools in North Dakota and superintendent of Perham-Dent Public Schools in Minnesota. “I’m pretty passionate about creating an education system that is ready to deliver what kids need today,” Uselman said at a news conference. “I also believe strongly that taxpayers deserve an academic return on their investment for education.” Hepola said he will unveil an education platform next month that will include “streaming schooling” as an option so kids, no matter where they live, can choose to focus on things like science, technology, engineering, mathematics or language arts. He said it would be in addition to in-person classes, not like the distance learning that schools used earlier in the pandemic. Democrats have criticized Hepola as a spoiler because of the chance he could peel away votes from incumbent Gov. Tim Walz in what’s expected to be a close election.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Nearly 45 million gallons of untreated wastewater were released into the environment over a four-month period due to sewer failures in Jackson, according to the latest quarterly report the city submitted to federal regulators. The report, required under Jackson’s sewer consent decree, covers the period from Dec. 1 through March 21, WLBT-TV reports. It was submitted April 30. During the reporting period, 259 sewer overflows were reported in Jackson, which released more than 44.7 million gallons of sewage into the environment. An estimated 33.9 million gallons went into waters classified as “Waters of the U.S.” Under terms of its sewer decree, the city is fined for each overflow that reaches one of those waters. Jackson entered into the decree in 2012 with the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Justice to bring its sewer system into compliance with federal water quality laws. According to the city’s annual report, Jackson does not have the funding or the manpower to address overflows or other decree mandates. City officials said Jackson also has equipment issues. According to the report, two of the city’s four trucks used to clean grease and solids out of clogged lines were down for repairs.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Workers at a public library system based in the city are voting this week on whether to become the only active public librarians union in the state. If employees at the Daniel Boone Regional Library, which has branches in Columbia, Fulton, Ashland and Holts Summit, ratify the union, they would join a growing movement toward unionization across the country, sparked in part by the coronavirus pandemic. The issues supporters cite are typical of most union efforts: the need for better pay and benefits, career opportunities, and safety concerns, as well as a lack of communication with administrators. Union supporters say the pandemic produced a variety of issues and underscored some that already existed: high staff turnover, differing treatment of employees, abuse of staff by patrons over masking, and a lack of clear direction for pandemic-related work. Tori Patrick, a full-time circulation assistant at the library, said there was strong support for the union but acknowledged some employees do not think a union is necessary, particularly in the smaller branches outside Columbia. “That was a hard connection to make. We didn’t know who worked there and how to talk to them,” Patrick said. “We have made some strong inroads, but we’re still facing a difficult path to connection with some workers.”\n\nMontana\n\nWarm Springs: The state health department confirmed Tuesday that it is investigating an allegation of a patient-on-patient sexual assault that occurred at the Montana State Hospital over the weekend, the Daily Montanan reports. According to an employee who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution, the alleged assault happened about 11 p.m. Friday. When a nurse checked on patients at shift change, the nurse found two male patients in the unit’s TV room, where one patient was sexually assaulting the other, according to the employee, who spoke to the nurse about the incident and relayed the information to the Daily Montanan. The employee said police were called, and the hospital’s new administrator, Carter Anderson, was aware of the incident. While Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for the Department of Public Health and Human Services, would not comment on the specifics of the matter, he confirmed that the state was investigating and that police had been called to the facility, as reported to the Daily Montanan by two staff members. “Due to confidentiality, we cannot comment on the matter at this point in time,” Ebelt said in an email.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts said he would push to outlaw abortion, without exceptions for rape or incest, if the U.S. Supreme Court follows through with a draft opinion suggesting it plans to overturn Roe v. Wade. Ricketts told “State of the Union” host Dana Bash on CNN on Sunday that Roe was a “horrible constitutional decision” and, when pressed about the possibility of the exceptions, said that “they’re still babies,” according to the Omaha World-Herald.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A judge has vacated the murder conviction of a 78-year-old Las Vegas woman who spent 20 years in prison for the 1994 killing of her millionaire husband before she was paroled. Margaret Rudin was found guilty in 2001 of murder in the death of real estate mogul Ron Rudin. Prosecutors said he had been shot in the head as he slept and his body dumped in the desert. U.S. District Judge Richard Boulware ruled Sunday that Margaret Rudin had received ineffective assistance of counsel from her late defense attorney, Michael Amador, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The Clark County district attorney’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from the Associated Press about whether prosecutors were considering appealing or retrying her. Rudin, who maintained her innocence all along, was paroled in 2020. “I will be 79 years old at the end of this month, so I am very, very grateful,” she told the newspaper Monday. A socialite antiques shop owner the media later dubbed the “Black Widow,” she was indicted in 1997 in what authorities portrayed as a crime committed for financial gain. She vanished before she was indicted and spent two years as a fugitive until a tip generated by a “most wanted” TV show led to her arrest in 1999 in Massachusetts.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State House and Senate negotiators approved yet another congressional map Monday with time running out to meet both legislative and judicial deadlines. New Hampshire is one of a few states that have yet to complete the redistricting process required every 10 years to bring districts in line with population changes. Democrats hold both U.S. seats, but Republicans hold majorities in the Legislature and thus control the redistricting process. Lawmakers passed a plan in March that would have given the GOP an advantage in the 1st District, but Republican Gov. Chris Sununu promised to veto it. The House later passed a second plan that would clump together communities along the I-93 corridor, but the Senate rejected it, sending the matter to a committee of conference to come up with a compromise. Under the plan approved by the committee Monday, the 1st District would cover the southeast corner of the state, while the 2nd District would cover the western half of the state and the north country. Lawmakers said it would give Republicans an edge in the 1st District, though not as prominently as the previous plans. The only Democrat on the conference committee, Sen. Donna Soucy, of Manchester, said putting the state’s two largest cities in the same district was a disservice to rural communities.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: More than a century after its birth in North Jersey, the film industry is in the midst of a Garden State resurgence. Gov. Phil Murphy and local officials were in Newark on Tuesday to announce the latest project: a $125 million film and television studio to be built over the next two years at the site of a former public housing project in the South Ward. The facility, to be anchored by Lionsgate Studio, is expected to create more than 600 jobs for the region, with a priority given to Newark residents, as well as internships and educational opportunities to be overseen by the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, state officials said. “One of my administration’s priorities has been to enhance New Jersey’s film industry and create new revenue streams for our state,” Murphy said in a statement released Tuesday. “With the addition of the Lionsgate Newark Studio, New Jersey will cement its position as a hub for television and film production.” Set to open in 2024, the 300,000 square-foot facility will be a joint project by Lionsgate, the arts center and Great Points Studio, a studio management business that will own the site. The property has sat unoccupied since 2015, when the Seth Boyden Housing project was abandoned. The buildings were demolished in February.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: In a marked departure from his recent findings, the independent monitor overseeing the Albuquerque Police Department reforms wrote in his latest report that he saw – “perhaps for the first time” – a serious willingness to identify and correct behavior that is counter to the effort. Also for the first time, the chief and his top brass have articulated an end date to the process. In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal, Police Chief Harold Medina said their goal is that the department will be in full compliance with the Court Approved Settlement Agreement in two years. The agreement made between the city of Albuquerque and the U.S. Department of Justice in 2014 lays out the requirements for reforming APD after federal investigators found officers had a pattern and practice of using excessive force. “We may not meet that goal, and we could get criticized later that we didn’t meet our goal,” Medina said. “But we’re going to set the goal. … We’re going to believe in ourselves, and we’re going to try our best. If, two years from now, we recognize we need one more period, well, you know what, it’s a whole lot better than anybody else has done.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A court-appointed expert has released a draft of new congressional maps for the state that are more favorable to Republicans than the original gerrymandered political maps drawn by Democrats. The draft maps released Monday would help the GOP by creating five districts that lean Republican and at least four other districts where Republicans would be competitive. Maps drawn by the Democratic-controlled Legislature as part of the redistricting process occurring every 10 years would have given Democrats a strong majority in 22 of 26 congressional districts, starting with this year’s election, but those maps were struck down by a court. Currently, the state has 27 congressional districts but is losing one as a result of the 2020 census. Republicans hold eight of those seats. The proposed maps could also pit several incumbents against each other or force them to run in new areas. The new maps are a blow to national Democrats’ plans draw favorable maps in New York in order to maximize the number of seats they could win in the U.S. House of Representatives. Last month, New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, ruled those maps and others for the state Senate were unconstitutional and failed to abide by an anti-gerrymandering process approved by voters.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Last fall, the General Assembly approved $30 million to address a lack of air conditioning in the state’s prison system. But with summer approaching, none of the actual construction has begun. WRAL-TV reports that although most prisons have at least some air conditioning, about 15,400 beds are in rooms without it, according to a breakdown provided by the state. Prison officials in Gov. Roy Cooper’s administration hope to have the first three projects complete around the start of next year. At the North Carolina Correctional Institute for Women in Raleigh – the system’s largest facility for women – three-quarters of the beds don’t have air conditioning. Kristie Puckett Williams, the North Carolina American Civil Liberties Union’s deputy director for engagement and mobilization, said the temperature can surpass 100 degrees inside the prison in the summer. The campus will be one of the first prisons retrofitted with air conditioning. Prisons spokesman John Bull said Dan River Prison Work Farm and Caswell Correctional Center are also top priorities. Bull said several things complicate the effort, including the high demand right now for construction crews across the economy, as well as supply chain issues.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Despite millions of dollars in promised subsidies, a unit of the state’s only Fortune 500 company says it won’t pursue plans to build a natural gas pipeline from western North Dakota’s oil patch to the eastern part of the state. WBI Energy, a subsidiary of Bismarck-based MDU Resources Group, said the project is not viable due to regulatory uncertainty, limited in-state demand, and rising construction, labor and land-acquisition costs. In a letter to North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad, the company said materials and construction costs have risen up to 50% in just the past nine months. “The recent and potential future inflationary pressure presents a significant challenge to a large-scale pipeline project from western to eastern North Dakota,” the company said. “This challenge is further compounded by the fact that the actual construction of a major pipeline project, if it were to proceed, would occur four to five years in the future, following an uncertain siting/regulatory process.” The Legislature in November set aside $150 million in federal coronavirus aid to help construct such a trans-state pipeline for natural gas, which is a byproduct of oil production. The idea, backed by Republican Gov. Doug Burgum, was to help cut down on the wasteful flaring at well sites and send the gas elsewhere to spur industrial development.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: High school principals in the state have overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to allow prep athletes to sign deals cashing in on their name, image and likeness, the Ohio High School Athletic Association said Tuesday. In voting that began May 1 and finished Monday, principals from OHSAA member schools voted 538-254 not to allow the marketing deals for high school athletes. Students would lose their athletic eligibility were they to sign such a deal. The principals could vote again on the deals at a later date. “If NIL is going to enter the Ohio interscholastic landscape, we want the schools to be the ones to make that determination,” said OHSAA Executive Director Doug Ute in a statement. “Whatever we do moving forward, it will include discussion on this issue with our school administrators, Board of Directors, staff and leaders of other state high school athletic associations.” OHSAA spokesperson Tim Stried previously said the organization opposed marketing deals for high school athletes. While there are exceptions, the amounts college athletes are earning from NIL deals are small. According to data gathered by Opendorse Deals, the average payout since July for large-school Division I athletes is $664. It’s just $59 for Division II athletes and $43 for Division III athletes.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The three known living survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre are receiving a $1 million donation from a New York philanthropic organization. Business for Good co-founders Ed and Lisa Mitzen say 108-year-old Viola Ford Fletcher, 107-year-old Lessie Benningfield Randle and 101-year-old Hughes Van Ellis will share the donation. Ed Mitzen, a businessman and philanthropist, told reporters in Tulsa that he was prompted to make the donation after reading news reports about the massacre. Business for Good did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment Tuesday. Fletcher, Randle and Ellis previously received $100,000 each from the Justice for Greenwood Foundation, a Tulsa-based nonprofit. The three and descendants of victims are currently suing the city of Tulsa and other entities for reparations for the destruction and lost wealth as a result of the massacre, in which a white mob attacked and killed hundreds of Black residents. The mob destroyed what had been the nation’s most prosperous Black business district in the northeastern Oklahoma city. A Tulsa judge earlier this month rejected a request to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state remains poised to see a potentially “challenging” wildfire season this summer, despite a wet and cool spring in much of western Oregon, one of the state’s top fire watchers said Monday. The rain and snow have helped to push back a fire season that threatened to start as early as this month, according to Mike Shaw, fire chief with the Oregon Department of Forestry. But he noted much of the precipitation on the coast and in the Willamette Valley hasn’t made it over the Cascade Mountains to central, southern and eastern Oregon, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Expanding drought conditions there have set the stage for fires to spread rapidly later this summer, Shaw said. “This will likely translate to a very challenging fire season,” Shaw said at a news conference. “The fires that start in these regions will be very hard to suppress.” Gov. Kate Brown said climate change has added complexity to the state’s wildfire response. She has declared drought in 15 counties – the earliest Oregon has seen that level of water scarcity in recent history. The state is preparing with help from Senate Bill 762, which Brown signed into law last year. The bill provided for additional firefighting aircraft and money to hire more wildland firefighters. Crews are expected to be strategically placed around the state.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nLancaster: It will take several days for Lancaster County to count all its mail ballots because some of them will not scan, officials announced at a news conference Tuesday. Elections officials found Tuesday morning that many of the mail ballots would not scan because they contained the wrong identification code, according to a news release. The county faced a similar problem in the 2021 primary with a different mail ballot vendor, which the county fired. As of early Tuesday morning, the office had received more than 21,000 completed mail ballots, said Christa L. Miller, chief registrar/chief clerk of elections. To fix the issue, the elections staff will remark the affected mail ballots so they can be scanned into the scanner, but it will take longer than normal, Lancaster County Vice Chairman Commissioner Joshua G. Parsons said. The last time this happened, Miller said, it took about four days. “We’ll do it as fast as possible, but our main priority is accuracy and not how fast we can do something,” Miller said. A Pennsylvania Department of State spokesperson said it is not aware of any other counties reporting this problem. Lancaster County has the sixth-largest population in the state.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State lawmakers unveiled changes Tuesday to a bill to legalize and regulate recreational marijuana, aiming to ensure the legislation passes the General Assembly. The amended bill was released Tuesday in advance of committee votes scheduled for Wednesday. Both the House and Senate are expected to vote next week. The bill now provides for the automatic expungement of any prior conviction for possession of cannabis that would be decriminalized by the legislation, without requiring a person to file a request, pay a fee or have a hearing. The expungements would occur by July 1, 2024, with an expedited process offered for anyone who wants to have their record expunged sooner. In the original bill, an expungement had to be requested. The start date for recreational sales was pushed from Oct. 1 to Dec. 1. The amended bill would eliminate current fees charged to patients and caregivers for registration in the state’s medical marijuana program. Lawmakers also changed how people would be appointed to the commission that would oversee the industry, to address concerns raised by the governor about separation of powers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The governor has quietly signed into law a bill that would ban transgender students from playing girls’ or women’s sports in public schools and colleges as the state joins about a dozen others that have passed similar laws in the past two years. The bill was one of 43 acts Gov. Henry McMaster signed into law Monday with no fanfare or ceremony. McMaster posted on Twitter the next day that he was proud to enact the proposal to protect young men and women. Just before the Republican-dominated General Assembly passed the proposal earlier this month, McMaster said that “I think the girls ought to play girls, and the boys ought to play boys. That’s the way we’ve always done it.” When asked if he meant biological boys, the Republican governor responded: “Are there any other kind?” The law requires transgender students to compete with the “biological sex” listed on their birth certificates “filed at or near the time” of birth. Supporters of a ban warn that in a rapidly changing society, transgender girls would have an unfair biological advantage from having been born stronger males. Opponents of the bill said it is a cruel idea, singling out students who are not elite athletes but are just looking for a way to be a regular student, hang out with friends and learn life lessons through competition.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: In a private 2020 meeting, Republicans in the state Senate planned how to achieve an already-negotiated outcome to a committee investigating a pair of lawmakers for being intoxicated during legislative proceedings even before the committee had a chance to meet, according to a television report. A transcript of the April 2020 Republican caucus meeting obtained by KELO-TV showed how Republicans held a private caucus meeting to discuss how to quickly and quietly resolve a legislative investigation into the two most powerful senators at the time, Sens. Kris Langer and Brock Greenfield. The pair were accused of showing up intoxicated at a legislative session that had stretched into the early morning hours as lawmakers discussed the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For critics of Republican rule in South Dakota’s Statehouse, the revelation of the meeting’s details provided an egregious example of how the fate of bills and the workings of state government are often decided in closed-door GOP meetings. “It’s very closed, very secretive,” said Peggy Gibson, a former Democratic House member who spent years advocating, mostly without success, for ethics reforms in the Legislature. “Everything is decided ahead of time.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Tuesday struck down the state’s first-of-its-kind law requiring businesses to post special signs if they allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger makes permanent her previous decision from July 2021 that blocked enforcement of the law just days after it took effect. Businesses had sued over the law, arguing the signs would violate their First Amendment rights by compelling them to communicate language they find offensive. In her latest decision, the judge deemed the law “a brazen attempt to single out trans-inclusive establishments and force them to parrot a message that they reasonably believe would sow fear and misunderstanding about the very transgender Tennesseans whom those establishments are trying to provide with some semblance of a safe and welcoming environment.” The 2021 law was signed by Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who has approved a wide range of bills targeting the LGBTQ community with the support of the state’s GOP-controlled Legislature. In the past several years, Tennessee has enacted more anti-LGBTQ laws than almost any other state in the country, with five approved last year and more signed this year.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: With an unseasonably hot May giving the state’s strained power grid about all it can handle, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas says it’s ready for demand for electricity to hit anticipated record levels amid even hotter temperatures this summer. ERCOT, the state agency charged with operating the grid, said this week that generation capacity is expected to be sufficient to serve peak summer demand “under normal system conditions” and most of the scenarios it has modeled for moderately worse to extreme weather and grid conditions. But it remains to be seen if Texans will find the agency’s annual summer assessment of the grid reassuring. ERCOT issued a call for conservation Friday, urging people to turn up thermostats and avoid using big appliances during peak hours through Sunday. It attributed the need for conservation to high demand amid hotter-than-normal temperatures and unanticipated outages at six generation plants. In addition, ERCOT has spent much of May asking power generators to postpone taking their plants offline for scheduled maintenance. Power generators in Texas often perform maintenance in the spring to prepare for the hot summer months.\n\nUtah\n\nKanab: A teenager visiting Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park died Sunday after he was entrapped beneath a sand dune that had collapsed on him a day prior. Ian Spendlove, a 13-year-old from the St. George suburbs, was pronounced dead Sunday after not regaining brain activity lost in the incident, the Utah State Parks Department said Monday. After a family member alerted authorities, park rangers arrived at Spendlove’s location Saturday evening to dig him out from what they said was about 6.5 feet of sand. Rangers said they believed Spendlove had been digging a tunnel into the sand dune when it collapsed on him. After rangers and Kane County Sheriff’s deputies rescued him and found he had a pulse, Spendlove was transported to St. George Regional Hospital and then to Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City, where he was declared dead. The department said the incident remains under investigation and urged visitors to be safe, wear helmets or life jackets, and alert others of recreation plans when in state parks. “The Utah Division of State Parks extends our condolences to Ian Spendlove’s friends and family impacted by this tragedy,” it said in the press release.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he’s running for reelection. Scott said he is seeking a fourth two-year term in November because there’s much more work to do. The governor said in a campaign email that he has worked to bring people together at a time when the country seems more polarized than ever. “We’ve proven that when we put politics aside and pull together, we can successfully navigate a once-in-a-century pandemic better than most every other state across the country,” Scott said. He said his priority will be on doing his job as governor and not campaigning. “I’ve never run a negative campaign and never will, because Vermonters, and all Americans, deserve a better and more civil political space – if for no other reason than to be better role models for our children, because they’re watching us,” he said. No candidates have filed paperwork with the state yet, but activist Brenda Siegel, a Democrat, has announced she is running for the seat.\n\nVirginia\n\nOrange: The board that manages former President James Madison’s Montpelier estate has elected 11 new members representing descendants of people once enslaved there. Monday’s vote came two months after the board had retracted a commitment to share power with a group representing African Americans who trace their roots to the historic estate. New members were selected from 20 nominees submitted last month by the Montpelier Descendants Committee, a nationwide group drawn from the descendants’ community of the historic site in Orange County, Virginia, the Culpeper Star-Exponent reports. The new board members include scholars, historians, two university deans and former CNN anchor Soledad O’Brien. They will oversee management of the home of Madison, the fourth president known as the father of the Constitution; his wife, Dolley; and their enslaved workers. The committee and the foundation’s new appointees invited the candidates who were not chosen to join an advisory council so they all can help, said Cultural Heritage Partners, a law firm representing the descendants committee. All of the candidates agreed to serve. The board now has 25 members, including 14 endorsed by the committee, according to Greg Werkheiser of Cultural Heritage Partners, general counsel to the committee.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: State Supreme Court Justice Raquel Montoya-Lewis announced Monday that she will be on family medical leave for the court’s spring term to concentrate on her health, but officials with the court didn’t release additional details, citing the justice’s desire for privacy. The high court’s spring oral arguments began Tuesday and end June 28. “I look forward to returning to the Court as quickly as possible and would like to express my appreciation of the support of my staff and colleagues during this time,” Montoya-Lewis said in a statement released by the Administrative Office of the Courts. Wendy Ferrell, associate director of the Administrative Office of the Courts, said in an email that Montoya-Lewis has been meeting with her medical team “and appreciates privacy during this time while she concentrates on her well-being.” Montoya-Lewis, an enrolled member of the Pueblo of Isleta who is the court’s first Native American justice, was appointed by Gov. Jay Inslee in December 2019 and sworn in the following month to fulfill the remaining year of the late Chief Justice Mary Fairhurst, who had been battling cancer and stepped down to focus on her treatment. Fairhurst died in December at age 64.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A city has been ordered to stop opening its council meetings with the Lord’s Prayer. U.S. District Judge John T. Copenhaver Jr. ruled Tuesday that Parkersburg City Council’s practice of opening its meetings with the New Testament prayer violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits government from favoring one religion over others. The judge issued a permanent injunction against the prayer recitation and awarded $1 in damages to each plaintiff. Copenhaver ruled in a lawsuit filed by the Freedom from Religion Foundation. The Madison, Wisconsin-based group and two of its members sued the city in 2018. The judge issued a permanent injunction against the prayer recital and awarded $1 in damages to each plaintiff. The lawsuit said residents stood at each Parkersburg City Council meeting to recite the prayer with council members. Plaintiffs Daryl Cobranchi and Eric Engle of Parkersburg attended some meetings, remained seated and did not participate in the prayer’s recital.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two Democratic electors and a voter on Tuesday sued Republicans who attempted to cast electoral ballots for Donald Trump in 2020 despite Joe Biden’s victory in the battleground state. Their lawsuit filed in Dane County Circuit Court alleges a conspiracy by Trump and his allies to overturn his loss in the presidential race, calling it “as legally baseless as it was repugnant to democracy.” It seeks up to $2.4 million in damages as well as disqualifying the Republicans from ever serving as electors again. The plaintiffs say it’s the first such lawsuit in the seven swing states where GOP electors falsely declared Trump the winner and cast their votes for him in December 2020. “It’s essential to have accountability and to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” said Jeffrey Mandell, an attorney for the plaintiffs. “We have heard in the more than a year since the fraudulent electors met the excuse that what they did was not wrong, it was totally fine. We want a court to make clear that is not true.” Republican electors named in the lawsuit who have spoken publicly about what they did have long argued that they weren’t trying to change the Wisconsin result. Instead, they said, they were trying to preserve all their legal options in case a court ruled in favor of Trump.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The state has the nation’s worst rate of workplace fatalities, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. Wyoming ranked worst in the U.S. in 2020 and consistently has one of the highest rates of occupational fatalities, according to U.S. Labor Department data cited by the newspaper. From 2008 to 2018, the state saw one worker die every 12 days, the News&Guide reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/26/burro-bandits-sugarcane-shake-naked-bike-ride-news-around-states/40010601/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state will require new forms for getting married beginning Thursday. The Alabama Department of Public Health issued guidance about the new process last week. Instead of a marriage license, couples will fill out a new form, have it notarized and then take it to the probate judge within 30 days. A wedding ceremony is no longer required, but a couple can still have one if they choose. The Legislature this year voted to change marriage procedures to accommodate conservative probate judges who objected to same-sex marriage. A few probate judges had refused to issue marriage licenses to anyone so they didn’t have to give them to gay couples. Republican Sen. Greg Albritton proposed the change, saying it should allow people to get marriage documents everywhere.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Charlene Zanoria used her summer internship to give underrepresented cultures a moment in the spotlight. Zanoria, a freshman at University of Alaska Southeast and graduate of Thunder Mountain High School, interned for Juneau Public Libraries this summer. For her connected learning project – an effort that combines interests, supportive relationships and learning – she came up with a celebration of people of color that featured music, dancing and food, Capital City Weekly reports. “I wanted to make an event that would include minorities that aren’t normally represented in the library,” she said. Zanoria, who is Filipina, said she hoped P.O.C. Palooza, which was held Aug. 16, reminded people Juneau Public Libraries are for the entire community. Among featured songs and performances were some that incorporated the Maori culture of New Zealand.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state starts a first-of-its-kind experiment Tuesday. Ninety days after the legislative session ended, the state will roll out a professional licensing law that Gov. Doug Ducey has touted as a game-changing tool to make it easier to move to Arizona and work in a range of regulated fields, from cosmetology to real estate and optometry. Known as universal recognition, the policy was a central part of Ducey’s legislative agenda this year and just one of several steps to roll back the power of state boards that oversee numerous skilled professions. The governor argues that those bodies have, at times, abused their power or gotten in the way of job-seekers. Arizona is the first state to try universal recognition, but the policy’s potential for real change remains unclear.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Cheryl Maples, an attorney who successfully challenged the state’s gay marriage ban before the nation’s highest court said same-sex couples could wed, has died at age 69. Melina Maples-Granger, Maples’ daughter, said Maples died Thursday in Little Rock from complications of congestive heart failure. Maples represented same-sex couples who challenged Arkansas’ constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. A county judge struck the amendment down in 2014, which led to more than 500 same-sex couples marrying before the ruling was suspended by the state Supreme Court. Justices didn’t rule before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015. Maples also represented same-sex couples who successfully challenged Arkansas’ birth certificate law.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Someone has been killing the wild burros of the Mojave Desert, and the Bureau of Land Management is offering up to $10,000 to anyone who can help catch the culprit or culprits. Over the past three months, 42 burro carcasses containing gunshot wounds have been found scattered along a 60-mile stretch of Interstate 15, the main highway linking Los Angeles to Las Vegas. The animals, like wild horses, are protected under federal law. Anyone found guilty of harassing, branding or killing one faces a fine of up to $2,000 and a year in jail. More than that, burros are an enduring symbol of the American Southwest. With their pointy ears and distinctive “Hee-Haw” voices, they evoke a time when their sure-footedness in rocky terrain and ability to carry heavy loads long distances without complaint made them perfect pack animals for prospectors and others.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The U.S. Air Force Academy has announced it will close its cadet chapel for extensive renovations beginning next month. KOAA-TV reports the military academy says Sept. 3 is the final day scheduled for visits prior to the chapel’s three-year closure. Officials at the academy near Colorado Springs say a $158 million restoration and preservation project is scheduled to begin Nov. 1. Officials say work crews are expected to remove furniture and conduct other preparation work between Sept. 3 and Nov. 1. The chapel was originally scheduled to close in June, but the project was delayed. The Air Force says the funds were reallocated for repairs at Florida’s Tyndall Air Force Base following Hurricane Michael in October 2018. The chapel is registered as a national historic landmark.\n\nConnecticut\n\nVoluntown: The state plans to conduct mosquito control spraying in parts of Pachaug State Forest considered to be at high risk for mosquito-borne illnesses. Spraying will be conducted Monday at Mount Misery campground, the nearby horse camp, and roads leading from the main forest entrance to Hell Hollow Road. Spraying will begin at 7 p.m., weather permitting. It will continue overnight, and roads will be closed to vehicular traffic. The state’s mosquito management program, an interagency response to mosquito-borne diseases, says there’s a high concentration of mosquitoes in the area infected with Eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. The state is using a pesticide called Anvil. Officials say the location is not a residential area, and those living in surrounding areas do not need to take precautions during the spraying.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A high-profile case of a doctor convicted of raping and abusing more than 85 children has led to major changes in how the state investigates and disciplines doctors. Since Earl Bradley’s arrest in 2009, 178 Delaware doctors have received some form of disciplinary action from the state. In the decade before that, licensing records show only 48 doctors were disciplined by the state. Bradley’s ability to keep practicing exposed several failures in how the state’s medical community reported and disciplined doctors. The case led to the General Assembly passing a series of laws, one of which made it easier to suspend the license of a doctor who poses a “clear and immediate danger.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: As D.C. kids get ready to go back to school Monday, some have more to worry about than the grades, WUSA-TV reports. Those living and going to school in Southeast face the specter of violence every day, with some parents reporting hearing gunfire “almost every night.” One parent tweeted Saturday: “I see DC Public Schools Turner Elementary in Ward 8 still has bullet holes in glass over the front doors after months … kids left being greeted by tape & bullet holes daily, they shouldn’t come back to it.” Within a couple of hours, the D.C. Department of General Services had tweeted that it was investigating. When WUSA paid a visit to Turner Elementary to check out the damage, crews were already working on repairs.\n\nFlorida\n\nMarathon: A non-native, juvenile olive ridley sea turtle has been released off the Florida Keys. Officials say the 30-pound turtle named Harry was released Thursday with a small satellite transmitter affixed to the top of its shell. The electronic device should provide tracking data to help marine biologists gain insights into the reptile’s movements in unfamiliar territory, before it detaches in two to six months. Harry was rescued by recreational boaters in early February, entangled in a large fishing net, off the Upper Keys. Emaciated and near death, the reptile was transported to the Florida Keys-based Turtle Hospital for treatment. Hospital officials say olive ridley turtles typically live in the southern Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They say only six olive ridleys have been documented in Florida waters.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A new report says the state’s public colleges and universities had an economic impact worth $17.7 billion statewide during the 2018 fiscal year. The University System of Georgia said in a news release that the economic impact of its 26 schools increased by 5% over the previous fiscal year. It credited Georgia’s public colleges with creating 168,284 jobs – 70% of which were off-campus positions in the private and public sector. The annual study was conducted by University of Georgia economist Jeffrey Humphreys. The latest report covers the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2018. University system Chancellor Steve Wrigley says the results show that Georgia’s colleges and universities play an “important role in generating jobs and boosting businesses across the state.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Scientists in the state have started to prepare for a major coral reef bleaching event due to warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. The Star-Advertiser reports the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration analyzed ocean temperatures across the islands and found they’ve risen by 3 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists say coral bleaching has occurred before, but they are already seeing worse signs at Kealakekua Bay on Hawaii island and at Kaneohe Bay and Hanauma Bay on Oahu. Experts say coral bleaching is a change from normal coloration of browns, yellows and greens to a nearly white color because of increased exposure to environmental stressors, including temperature increases. Scientists say coral reefs are important for marine habitats; have cultural, recreational and economic benefits; and also provide protection for coastal shorelines during storms.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state must provide gender confirmation surgery to a transgender inmate who has been living as a woman for years but has continuously been housed in a men’s prison, a federal appeals court said Friday. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with a federal judge in Idaho that the state’s denying the surgery for 31-year-old Adree Edmo amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, a violation of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Under the ruling, Edmo would become the first Idaho inmate to receive gender confirmation surgery while in Idaho Department of Correction custody. “This is a complete win for Ms. Edmo,” said her attorney, Lori Rifkin. “Our client is immensely relieved and grateful that the court recognized her basic right to medical treatment.” Republican Gov. Brad Little said he planned to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIllinois\n\nWaukegan: The Chicago-area hometown of the late, famed science fiction writer Ray Bradbury marked his birthday with the dedication of a statue in his honor. The 12-foot-tall stainless steel statue outside the Waukegan Public Library depicts Bradbury astride a rocket ship while holding a book. The (Lake County) News-Sun reports artist Zachary Oxman told those at Thursday’s ceremony that the statue tells the story of a man “beaming with unbridled imagination, curiosity and surprise.” Bradbury was born in Waukegan in 1920 and often spoke of the hours he spent at the city’s library before his family moved to Los Angeles when he was a teenager. He died in 2012. He wrote hundreds of works, including “Fahrenheit 451” and “The Martian Chronicles.” The $125,000 project was financed primarily through donations.\n\nIndiana\n\nPortage: The National Park Service has reopened beaches in northwestern Indiana, more than a week after a spill of cyanide and ammonia from a steel factory along Lake Michigan. The agency says three consecutive days of tests came out positive, including two days with no detection of cyanide. The government says samples were taken by Indiana environmental regulators and ArcelorMittal and reviewed by independent labs. The Park Service had closed the Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk beach areas at Indiana Dunes National Park. Fish were killed. ArcelorMittal says the spill occurred after its Burns Harbor mill had a failure at a blast furnace water recirculation system. Wastewater containing elevated levels of ammonia and cyanide was released in the Little Calumet River’s east branch. The company has apologized.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Google gave two local nonprofits $175,000 on Friday through the company’s Impact Challenge Iowa grant program. Five judges picked Iowa Jobs for America’s Graduates and Ethnic Minorities of Burma Advocacy and Resources as winners, along with three other nonprofits. Voters can cast ballots through Friday to pick the “People’s Choice” grant winner, which will receive another $125,000. IJAG is a mentor program that partners graduating students with employers in industries with a lot of job openings. The reward for EMBARC is for its RISE program, which helps prepare refugees for the workforce. The refugees work for other nonprofits in the state through the program, giving them job skills and helping them market themselves in the workforce.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: City police will begin using a system that places alerts on addresses where potential swatting targets could be living. Swatting involves someone making a hoax emergency call to send law enforcement officers, particularly SWAT teams, to a particular address. The program announced Friday is voluntary and open to people who think they might become victims of swatting. The alerts would be available to first responders. Officer Paul Cruz says the alerts wouldn’t slow emergency responders but would make them aware they might be responding to a hoax call. In 2017, Wichita police fatally shot Andrew Finch after a caller falsely claimed a murder and hostage situation was occurring at his home. The call was aimed at someone who lived at the home before Finch.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A print shop owner who refused to make a gay pride T-shirt argued before the state Supreme Court that he shouldn’t be compelled to promote messages that go against his religious beliefs. Blaine Adamson, owner of Hands-On Originals in Lexington, declined to print a shirt promoting an LGBT pride festival in 2012. The city’s Human Rights Commission said that refusal violated its gay-rights fairness ordinance. On Friday, the high court heard an attorney for the T-shirt maker argue that the First Amendment protects him from having to print that message. An attorney for the Human Rights Commission says the T-shirt maker cannot pick and choose who it wants to serve in the community. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments from attorneys and will issue a ruling at a later date.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: One of the world’s northernmost sugarcane fields has been planted at a Louisiana State University research station in central Louisiana. The LSU AgCenter is looking into how well various varieties can survive chilly weather. The Dean Lee Research and Extension Center is generally considered too far north for the tall tropical grass. However, steady yields and prices have prompted some of the state’s farmers to push the limits, planting sugarcane in what has traditionally been corn and soybean country, an AgCenter news release says. One farmer is growing sugarcane a few miles south in the Lecompte area. There’s little data to indicate which varieties can best withstand central Louisiana’s deeper, more frequent freezes. So the AgCenter is working to get such information on eight varieties, some commercially available and some still experimental.\n\nMaine\n\nMillinocket: The Friends of Katahdin Woods and Waters group says it’s pleased with progress in the three years since the national monument was created in northern Maine. The group says improvements include a new bridge over Katahdin Brook, improved trails along the Loop Road at Deasey Pond and the Esker Trail built by Appalachian Mountain Club, and new trail signs put up by the National Park Service. Superintendent Tim Hudson says long-awaited road signs along I-95 and local roads should be going up by year’s end. As the Friends group hosted a celebration Saturday night to mark the third anniversary with music, dinner, awards and an auction, director Andrew Bossie thanked volunteer groups including the Baxter Youth Conservation Corps for their help.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City fire officials say they plan to dispatch fewer firefighters to initial fire alarms, as departments see the number of medical emergency calls rise above those of fires. A Wednesday memo said three engines, one truck and one battalion chief will respond to alarms starting Sept. 1, down from the five engines, two trucks, two battalion chiefs and one medic unit that’s considered a full assignment. Seventeen personnel will respond, still higher than the National Fire Protection Association standard of 15. Chief Niles R. Ford told The Baltimore Sun the reduction will free units for medical calls. More responders can be dispatched if needed. Baltimore’s firefighters union criticized the plan, saying it’d put responders and citizens in danger, but Ford pushed back.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSherborn: A “peace park” in this Boston suburb has been forced to take down a United Nations flag after residents objected. Pacifist Memorial founder Lewis Randa recently removed the flag at the Sherborn site because residents of the condo development where it’s located argue that it violates their property agreement. The Abbey Road Condominium Trust says the 2012 land deal with Randa only allows him to maintain the memorial’s permanent installations, not to add new or temporary ones. But Randa says that while the U.N. flag was not part of the original memorial, one had flown for decades on the grounds. He suggests the dispute is rooted in long-simmering opposition to the memorial. Loretta Heuer, who heads the condo association, says the issue isn’t the flag but respecting property rights.\n\nMichigan\n\nIshpeming: An arsonist has severely hampered Santa’s toy production this fall. Mlive.com reports that Ishpeming Police on Saturday asked for the public’s help in solving the overnight arson and property damage case involving the Santa’s Workshop building used at Christmastime. Police said officers were dispatched to the site where the building is stored to find the structure destroyed. A city-owned pickup parked in the area was also damaged. Residents expressed their dismay on the police department’s Facebook page. Some offered to rebuild it for free in time for Christmas. One commenter suggested the guilty party rebuild it at no cost in addition to facing criminal charges. Another said that it’s “sad that the actions of a few people can ruin it for so many.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The ever-present danger of rip currents in Lake Superior has some people in Duluth calling for more to be done to improve public safety. Retired police officer Dennis Hoelscher tells Minnesota Public Radio News that lifeguard services need to be improved. Lifeguards don’t work on “red flag” days that have high risk of rip currents. Hoelscher and others think guards should work on those days, work longer hours in general, work more beaches and be trained to work in big waves. The Duluth YMCA, which runs the lifeguard program on Park Point, says posting lifeguards misleads people to think it’s safe. And expanding services is difficult in what is currently mostly a break-even arrangement. MPR reports communities across the Great Lakes struggle with how to pay for lifeguards.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: Officials say the city was on its way into debt but has turned its finances around, saving about $805,000 since March. The Commercial Dispatch reports Mayor Robert Smith told councilmen last week that the city saved about $329,000 while adding $476,000 to unbudgeted revenue. Accountant Mike Crowder in March told the city it’d be more than $300,000 in debt by September if spending continued. Smith says several decisions helped the city save, like freezes on hiring and wages, upping the employee health insurance deductible from $100 to $500, and opening the court clerk’s office on Fridays, which collected $26,206 in additional fees. Smith says the city had $7 million in its coffers, including about $2 million in the operating funds. It’s unclear whether the fund will finish the fiscal year at a deficit.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Authorities say a shirtless man reportedly dragging a topless, unconscious woman through downtown was actually lugging around a life-size doll. Police said in a tweet that callers reported the man looked like he wanted to throw the woman over a bridge, had dropped her and appeared to be trying to dress her. One caller said he was yelling “savior” while holding the woman. Police said that when officers learned the woman actually was a doll that the man had found in a trash bin, he was told “not to carry it around in public anymore.” Police titled the tweet: “And here is today’s episode of ‘Not What We Expected Going Into That.’ ” A traffic camera captured some of the incident.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State officials say U.S. health officials have approved Montana’s plan to create a reinsurance pool that aims to lower individual health insurance premium costs. Gov. Steve Bullock and State Auditor Matt Rosendale say the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a waiver that authorizes the reinsurance program. A bill passed by state lawmakers this year creates a pool to help reimburse insurers for high-cost claims from $40,000 to $1 million. It will be funded with money that otherwise would have been used as premium tax credits and through a premium tax on all major medical plans sold in the state. The three Montana companies that offer health insurance policies on the individual marketplace are proposing reduced rates in 2020, in part because of the reinsurance program.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state’s highest court lifted one of the last major hurdles for the Keystone XL pipeline in the state Friday when it rejected another attempt to derail the project by opponents who wanted to force the developer to reapply for state approval. The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld the decision of regulators who voted in November 2017 to greenlight a route through the state. The court’s decision was a victory for the $8 billion project, which has been mired in lawsuits and regulatory hearings since it was proposed in 2008. Despite the victory for Canada-based TC Energy, opponents vowed Friday that the legal fight to block construction was far from over. “The risky pipeline project’s fate is still very much in doubt, as three separate federal lawsuits continue to proceed that challenge the controversial project’s permits,” leading pipeline opposition group Bold Alliance said in a statement.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Safari Club International plans to hold its national convention in Las Vegas in 2021 instead of Reno. The sportsman’s club is ending its initial three-year agreement with the Biggest Little City a year early. The 2020 convention will continue in Reno in February. The club hasn’t officially announced the venue change, but the move has been confirmed by the Reno Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority. RSCVA Board Chairman Bob Lucy says it’s disappointing, but the board continues to have a good relationship with the club and hopes it returns someday. Safari Club returned to Reno this year following a five-year absence and declining attendance in Las Vegas. The RSCVA says this year’s convention generated an estimated $20 million in economic impact for the Reno-Tahoe area, including more than 17,000 room nights for the region’s hotels.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A year after Gov. Chris Sununu’s unsuccessful push to prolong school summer vacation until Labor Day, the vast majority of the state’s communities are sticking with their earlier start dates. Schools in 80% of districts will be starting before Labor Day this year. While four districts that started earlier last year will now start after Labor Day, two other districts went the other way. Sununu, a Republican, created a “Save Our Summers Study Commission” last August to explore a mandatory post-Labor Day start date. The group issued a report without taking sides, though it emphasized the economic benefits. Subsequent legislation to enact a mandate, however, was retained in the Senate Education Committee for reconsideration next year. Businesses tied to tourism support later start dates, while teachers oppose the idea.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Brunswick: Rutgers University’s daily student newspaper will cease print publication on Fridays and shift to reporting more news online. The Daily Targum’s student leaders say the decision to cut their printing days to Mondays to Thursdays is meant to help it stay afloat after a devastating vote last spring resulted in a loss of all student fee funding. NJ.com reports the student newspaper will save money in its $750,000 budget by cutting printing to four days a week. The organization will also save money by tapping into advertising revenue and donations raised online. Rutgers says it will hold another vote to ask students if they want to use student fees to fund the campus newspaper. The paper says it will continue to pay its student reporters, photographers, editors and three-member professional staff.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nBloomfield: The city has asked residents to help fund the remaining balance of fees resulting from a Ten Commandments monument lawsuit. Bloomfield launched an online fundraiser asking for help coming up with $467,000 it owes the American Civil Liberties Union lawyers after courts ruled against the city. Officials say the ACLU represented several residents who said the monument violated their First Amendment rights. Officials say the city owes lawyers $700,000 by June 30, 2021, and has already paid more than $200,000. Anything not raised will be paid for using the gross receipts tax and is currently budgeted. Officials say the resident-funded monument was displayed in front of city hall before being moved to a nearby church.\n\nNew York\n\nTupper Lake: Organizers of a new semi-pro baseball team in the Adirondacks are rooting around for a new nickname after some residents grunted at the proposed moniker “River Pigs.” The Adirondack Daily Enterprise reports that Tupper Lake Village Board Trustee David Maroun posted on Facebook that the name of the new Empire League team will be changed. The name River Pigs was chosen to reflect the region’s logging history. River pigs were skilled loggers who broke up logjams on rivers. But when the team was announced in late July, some Tupper Lake residents said the name “Pigs” sounded demeaning. Fire Chief Royce Cole says the village baseball committee will discuss other options over the weekend. The team is slated to arrive in Tupper Lake next summer.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State election officials on Friday certified bar code ballots for use in elections starting next year despite an outcry that they can’t be trusted by voters uncertain their choices are accurately counted. The State Board of Elections voted 3-2 to allow a voting-machine maker to sell equipment that digitizes votes into bar code data, which is then tallied by the company’s counting machines. Almost two dozen speakers urged the elections board to reject bar code systems because voters can’t read the bar codes to check that they’re correct. But Democratic board chairman Damon Circosta sided with two Republicans on the five-member panel, citing the risk of delay after touchscreen-only equipment is disallowed in December. New voting machines in about a quarter of the state’s counties need to be replaced as primary elections loom in March.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A study finds that converting a historic railroad bridge into a pedestrian bridge can be done but would be expensive. Landscape architecture professors at North Dakota State University looked at repurposing the Bismarck-Mandan Rail Bridge as a footbridge. The Bismarck Tribune reports the study concluded that would cost almost $6.9 million. Proponents of saving the structure acknowledge they don’t yet have any funding commitments. Bridge owner BNSF Railway maintains that converting the 136-year-old bridge – rather than demolishing it – would delay a needed new bridge and also cause safety concerns. The bridge over the Missouri River connects Bismarck and Mandan. Friends of the Rail Bridge is proposing to convert the bridge into a pedestrian and bicycle path.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: Celebrities and musicians came out Sunday evening for Dave Chappelle’s Gem City Shine benefit. Earlier in the day, Kanye West brought a surprise Sunday Service gospel experience to RiverScape Metro Park. Actor and comedian Jon Stewart made a surprise appearance to help Chappelle introduce Chance the Rapper. Chapelle escorted music legend Stevie Wonder out to perform following Chance the Rapper’s set. The Gem City Shine block party kicked off at 4 p.m. to benefit the families and survivors of the Aug. 4 mass shooting that rocked the city. The sold-out event was held in the Oregon District, blocks away from where a gunman killed nine people and injured 27 others.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city council is expected to set a citywide vote for a one-cent sales tax that would generate nearly $980 million over eight years to fund dozens of city projects, including money for social services like mental health and homelessness. The proposal outlined Friday is the fourth iteration of Metropolitan Area Projects, a comprehensive capital improvement program first approved by city voters in 1993. The council is expected to consider a resolution Tuesday that calls for a special election Dec. 10. Funding in the MAPS 4 proposal includes $40 million for mental health and addiction services and $38 million for a family justice center offering services to victims of abuse. Another $50 million would be earmarked for affordable housing for the homeless.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: After two walkouts this year by minority Republican senators in the Legislature, Democrats say they’ll ask voters to change quorum rules, allowing the Statehouse to convene with only a simple majority of lawmakers present instead of the current two-thirds requirement. The boycotts by the Republicans prevented the Senate from convening. Democrats dropped proposals on gun control and vaccines, and Democratic Gov. Kate Brown ordered state police to bring the missing lawmakers back during the second walkout. The Republicans left the state to avoid apprehension and returned only after a sweeping bill to combat global warming was moot. Senate Democrats said Majority Leader Ginny Burdick will introduce a constitutional amendment next year to lower quorum requirements. Voters would then decide on the proposed change in the 2020 election.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Hundreds of bicyclists have been caught with their pants down – and their shirts and underwear off, too. The cyclists gathered in a Philadelphia park Saturday to disrobe before saddling up and setting off on the annual Philly Naked Bike Ride. About 3,000 riders pedal a 10-mile course around the City of Brotherly Love while taking in sights including Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, organizers say. Some riders wear their birthday suits, while others flaunt their underwear or sport just a splash of body paint and glitter. The ride is intended to promote positive body image, advocate for the safety of cyclists and protest dependence on fossil fuels. It used to be held in September but was moved up to August because the nude and scantily clad participants complained about chilly weather.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A state lawmaker says he’s frustrated that mandated replacement license plates will have a design similar to the state’s distinctive “wave” plates in use since 1996. Sen. Louis DiPalma tells the Providence Journal the new design is supposed to make it easier for police to tell from a distance that a plate is old. The Department of Motor Vehicles told lawmakers last week the new plates would maintain the integrity of the current wave design with enough differences to serve the purpose of the plate reissue. Gov. Gina Raimondo’s spokesman says the new design will “closely mirror” existing plates. DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, wants to meet with Raimondo and DMV officials to get an explanation. Rhode Islanders with existing wave plates will have to get new ones starting next year.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nNorth Charleston: The city is giving $1 million to a new African American history museum and asking it to include the city’s story. The North Charleston City Council voted unanimously Thursday to give the money from the city’s taxes on hotels to the International African American Museum being built in Charleston. Mayor Keith Summey says he hopes the money helps tell the story of North Charleston’s predecessor Liberty Hill, where a black couple bought farmland during the Civil War that was later sold to other African Americans. North Charleston’s history also includes racial struggles. The city paid a $6.5 million settlement to the family of a black man, Walter Scott, who was shot in the back and killed by a white police officer in 2015.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A state board is weighing whether to raise bonding requirements for natural gas and oil drillers. The Rapid City Journal reports the Board of Minerals and Environment is considering the increase as the state pursues a $15.5 million lawsuit against a Texas-based company for abandoning gas wells in western South Dakota. Spyglass Cedar Creek drilled 40 natural gas wells near Buffalo and then abandoned them after natural gas prices plummeted. Board members called the Spyglass saga a “perfect storm.” Department of Environment and Natural Resources Minerals and Mining program administrator Mike Lees says the state has not had similar issues with other oil and gas developers in the state.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: A baby giraffe has officially been named Big Girl Two but will be called Bea. Zoo Knoxville officials announced the 2-month-old giraffe’s name at a Saturday event for zoo members. They also celebrated the fourth birthday of Bea’s mother, Frances. Frances gave birth to Bea, her first calf, on July 1. Zookeepers found mother and her healthy baby when they arrived for work that morning. Bea is the first giraffe calf born at the zoo in 17 years. She’s part of herd made up of her mother; her father, Jumbe; and female giraffe Lucille. The four live in the zoo’s Africa Grasslands natural habitat.\n\nTexas\n\nWaco: More farmers in the state are wading into the whiskey business, but their end users are far removed from the era of moonshine stills and midnight raids by ax-toting lawmen. The Waco Tribune-Herald reports the burgeoning Texas whiskey industry is doubling down on Lone Star pride by recruiting growers. An ode to this phenomenon is High Plains Texas Single Malt, a whiskey produced at Balcones Distilling in Waco using Texas-grown barley malted by Blacklands Malt in Leander. The finished product had its roots in an experiment involving Balcones, Blacklands and Texas A&M University Agrilife, which was exploring ways to develop a barley industry in Texas. Now, after more than two years of aging, High Plains Texas Single Malt has arrived. It is priced at $80 a bottle and available exclusively at Balcones.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A new U.S. government management plan unveiled Friday clears the way for coal mining and oil and gas drilling on land that used to be off limits as part of a sprawling national monument in the state before President Donald Trump downsized the protected area two years ago. The plan released by the Bureau of Land Management would also open more lands to cattle grazing and recreation and acknowledges there could be “adverse effects” on land and resources in the monument. But while allowing more activities, the plan would also add a few safeguards for the cliffs, canyons, waterfalls and arches still inside Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument that weren’t in a proposed plan issued last year. Among them are opening fewer acres to ATVs and canceling a plan that would have allowed people to collect some non-dinosaur fossils in certain areas.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: Police are investigating the theft of about $37,000 worth of equipment stolen from a music center during the Lake Champlain Chamber Music Festival. The Tuesday night or Wednesday morning burglary at the Elley Long Music Center in Colchester occurred when at least one person broke into an engineering room and stole a case of audio equipment. Rosina Cannizzaro, the executive director for the Vermont Youth Orchestra Association, calls it a “cowardly act.” She says she hopes the equipment can be returned to the owner. MyNBC5 reports the music center says it has implemented overnight security and will be removing all valuable items like sound gear and cash from the building every night.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: Gov. Ralph Northam and other state officials are observing the arrival of enslaved Africans to what is now Virginia 400 years ago. Northam said he signed a directive Saturday to create a commission on African American history in the state. He says it will review educational standards and instructional practices to teach black history in the state. Northam says the state must ensure that all students develop a full understanding of the African American voices that contribute to the nation’s story. He made the announcement at the 2019 African Landing Commemorative Ceremony in Hampton. The landing in August 1619 is considered a pivotal moment that presaged a system of race-based slavery.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium is celebrating the birth of its first tamandua pup, which is the size of an avocado. KING-TV reports the southern tamandua is a species of anteaters native to South America that lives in trees. The healthy pup was born Aug. 18 and weighs just more than a half-pound. The baby tamandua will make a public debut once it is stronger and more confident. Until then, it will practice riding on its mother’s back and begin eating fruit and insects in about two months. Zookeepers won’t know the baby’s gender until it is older.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPipestem: Fans of all things horror gathered at Pipestem Event Center on Saturday to visit the first-ever FearFestWV. “It’s important to bring something like this to this area. There are fans of all ages here from age 5 to 75,” said event hostess and personality Coen Beck, also known as Coen the Butcher. Guests enjoyed vendors specializing in horror merchandise, live music of the metal genre and big-name horror actors. With VIP tickets, guests could meet and speak one-on-one with their favorite big-screen menaces. Actors present included Bill Moseley (“The Devil’s Rejects,” “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” and “House of 1000 Corpses”), Michael Berryman (“The Hills Have Eyes,” “The Devil’s Rejects”) and Tony Moran, known for his iconic role of Michael Myers in “Halloween.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A rare bee not seen in the state in more than a century has turned up in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. U.S. Forest Service scientists found the bee in July while surveying pollinators as part of an inventory of native bees in the Great Lakes region. It’s known commonly as a cuckoo bee, but its scientific name is a mouthful: Epeoloides pilosulus. The bee was once widespread in eastern and central America but was thought to have gone extinct. It was then found in 2002 in Nova Scotia, Canada – and only two such bees have been found since, in Connecticut in 2006 and New York in 2014. Wisconsin has about 500 native bee species.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The city will begin restoring another stretch of the North Platte River in October, the next step in a long-term project expected to cost at least $23 million. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the upcoming work will cost $2.5 million and cover about half a mile of the river. It will include adjusting the channel, stabilizing the banks, removing debris, restoring native vegetation and installing a boat ramp. The river suffered from decades of pollution from industry and a landfill. The city launched the restoration project in 2015, and the upcoming work will be the fourth of seven planned phases. The city and the Two Fly Foundation, a fly-fishing group, started an annual volunteer cleanup day for the river in 2005. The next event is next month.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/26"}]}

Hindu belief holds that Lakshmi cannot enter a dark space, according to the Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art.\n\nThe festival, which is spread over a period of five days, also marks the beginning of the new year in the Hindu calendar and celebrates the year’s last rice-crop harvest, according to Journal Storage (JSTOR).\n\nWhile Diwali is a major religious festival for Hindus, the Associated Press reported that Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists also observe it, and that the holiday's origin story varies depending on the region. However, all of them follow the same underlying themes of good triumphing over evil and light over darkness.\n\nFor example, for Sikhs, Diwali celebrates the sixth Guru, who serves as a source of inspiration and a symbol for freedom. The guru was in prison and refused to leave prison without the other 52 political prisoners being released. The day of Diwali celebrates his release, along with the political prisoners he fought for. While the reason behind the celebrations may differ, to commemorate the festival, Sikhs will also go to the Gurdwara to pray, meditate, light diyas and set off fireworks.\n\nInitially a religious event, Diwali has evolved over the years into a festive occasion, much like Christmas and Hannukkah, with people of all communities and religions joining in to celebrate.\n\nWhen is Diwali?\n\nDiwali is celebrated during the Hindu month of Kartik, which typically falls between the middle of October and the middle of November. This year, Diwali begins on Monday, Oct. 20.\n\nThe festival is celebrated over five days, and Dhanteras, the preparation period leading up to the peak of Diwali, begins two days earlier on Saturday, Oct. 18.\n\nHow is Diwali celebrated?\n\nDiwali celebrations begin with devotees deep cleaning their homes and surroundings to prepare for the goddess's arrival, according to the Smithsonian. The next day, devotees decorate using clay lamps, candles and other lights, drawing colorful patterns of flowers, powder, rice or sand on the floor, which is an artistic practice called rangoli that's meant to bring good luck.\n\nThe main celebration takes place on the night of the third day, which marks the end of the Hindu calendar year. Devotees dress up in their finest outfits, make offerings to Lakshmi, light fireworks and sparklers, and enjoy a sweet feast.\n\nOver the next two days, the celebrations continue as people host gatherings and visit family and friends to celebrate the new year.\n\nFor Hindus, Diwali is also a time for dana (charitable giving) and seva (selfless service), according to the Hindu American Foundation.\n\nIs Diwali a federal holiday?\n\nWhile Diwali itself is not a federal holiday, several states, including Pennsylvania and Connecticut, recognize it as a state holiday, according to the Los Angeles Times. Schools, government offices and businesses aren’t required to close in observance, CBS News reported. On Oct. 10, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill by Assemblymember Ash Kalra (D-San José) to designate Diwali as an official state holiday. The bill, which takes effect on Jan. 1, 2026, will allow community colleges and public schools to close on Diwali and give state employees the choice to take the day off with pay.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Education allows its students to observe Diwali, so they can take the day off without any consequences. In New York City, public schools are closed on Diwali under an education law that was enacted in 2023.\n\nContributing: Michelle Shen, USA TODAY / Mariyam Muhammad, Columbus Dispatch\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Dates, history of the Jewish celebration", "text": "Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated the day of week in which Hanukkah starts in 2023.\n\nHanukkah – the Jewish festival of lights – arrives late each year, marking a time for both celebration and reflection. Rich with history and laced with just a bit of latke grease, Hanukkah is a time for Jews to gather with family and friends and retell a fabled story of resistance.\n\nWhile certain symbols of the holiday like the menorah (a decorative candelabra) and the dreidel (a four-sided spinning top) may be more easily recognizable in popular culture, there is plenty more to learn about Hanukkah and why it is celebrated.\n\nHere's everything to know about Hanukkah 2023, including when it begins and why it lasts eight nights.\n\nWhen does Hanukkah start?\n\nThis year Hanukkah runs from sundown on Thursday, Dec. 7, to sundown on Friday, Dec. 15.\n\nHow many days does Hanukkah last?\n\nEight. The festival of lights lasts for eight days, and eight nights. This year it will begin the evening of Dec. 7, and end the evening of Dec. 15.\n\nWhat is Hanukkah, and why is it celebrated?\n\n\"Hanukkah\" is Hebrew for dedication. Though the holiday is popularly known as the festival of lights, it is also the festival of rededication, meant to honor the victory of the Macabee soldiers over the Syrian Greek army.\n\nIn their victory, the Maccabees, led by Judah, reclaimed the holy temple in Jerusalem and rededicated it to God. They had only enough oil to ignite the temple light for one night, and yet the light burned for eight days.\n\nIn the Jewish faith, this instance is referred to as the miracle of Hanukkah. A candle on the menorah, or hanukkiah, is lit each night to mimic the one that burned in the holy temple so many years ago.\n\nHanukkah in photos: The Jewish Festival of Lights is celebrated around the world\n\nWhat do the 8 days of Hanukkah stand for?\n\nHanukkah is celebrated for eight days to mark the miracle of an oil lamp which had only enough supply to burn for one day when the Macabee army recaptured the holy temple in Jerusalem but astonishingly burnt for eight.\n\nWhy does Hanukkah change every year?\n\nThe dates of Hanukkah are determined by the Hebrew calendar and not the Gregorian calendar, which is used by most of the world. This creates a shift in when the holiday is celebrated each year.\n\nThe first day of Hanukkah is always on the 25th day of Kislev on the Hebrew calendar, which is based on the movements of the sun and moon.\n\nHoliday gift guide: 10 Gifts I Love for Hanukkah\n\nWhere is Hanukkah celebrated?\n\nHanukkah is celebrated all around the world. Anywhere you can find a Jewish community, you can find Hanukkah celebrations.\n\nTraditions may vary based on family and sect.\n\nWhat are some traditions of Hanukkah?\n\nAside from the lighting of the menorah, Hanukkah is also celebrated with traditional games and foods.\n\nJewish celebrants will often cook potato pancakes known as latkes throughout the holiday, serving them at times with apple sauce or sour cream. Another traditional dish is a jelly donut, or sufganiyot.\n\nAnother honored tradition involves the game of dreidel, in which a four-sided top is spun. Each side is painted with a Hebrew letter. Whichever face it lands on, it instructs players to add or remove coins from a poker-style pot. The \"coins\" in question are actually made of chocolate. Wrapped in gold tin foil to resemble money, they are called \"gelt.\"\n\nWhat should I wear? Stylish Hanukkah outfit ideas\n\nHow many sides does a dreidel have?\n\nA dreidel had four sides, each with a different Hebrew letter on it.\n\nThe fours faces can display:\n\nNun\n\nGimel\n\nHey or Chai\n\nShin\n\nEach letter corresponds to a different directive -- much like poker, you put chocolate coins in the pot or take them out and whoever has the most at the end wins.\n\nWhat do Jews do on Christmas?\n\nSome Jews are in mixed-faith families and celebrate Christmas while others choose to participate in traditions of their own to mark the day.\n\nSome Jews spend the day going to the movies or eating out at Chinese restaurants while for others it is a day that punctuates difference, Andrew Wolfson writes for the Louisville Courier Journal.\n\nHanukkah recipes", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2024/10/31/diwali-2024-what-to-know-hindu-festival-of-lights-michigan/75960949007/", "title": "When is Diwali 2024?

Diwali is a major Hindu festival but is also celebrated by some Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains. The date of Diwali fluctuates.

The event occurred when Jews rose up against Greek-Syrian rulers in the Maccabean Revolt and drove them out of Jerusalem, according the History Channel.\n\nTo mark their victory, Jews wanted to reclaim the temple and light its menorah, but only found enough pure olive oil for one day, according to Chabad.org. That one-day supply lasted eight and is considered a miracle in Jewish faith.\n\nFrom last year: Celebrating Hanukkah in the Holy Land\n\nWhat happens during Hanukkah?\n\nTo mark the holiday, Jews light one candle each evening on a nine-branched menorah. The ninth candle — the shamash, (\"helper\" or \"attendant\") — is used to light the other eight.\n\n\"Special blessings are recited, often to a traditional melody, before the menorah is lit, and traditional songs are sung afterward,\" according to Chabad.org.\n\nMenorahs are also placed prominently in houses, often in windows. Playing with tops called dreidels and exchanging gifts are other Hanukkah traditions to celebrate the holiday.\n\nWhat about food?\n\nGiven the holiday's link to oil, traditional dishes are often fried in oil, too. Potato pancakes (latkes) and doughnuts (sufganiyot) are among the most popular food items, according to Chabad.org.\n\nSo, is it Hanukkah or Chanukah?\n\nBoth are correct. In fact, there are more than a dozen variations of how to spell the holiday's name in English, according to the Oxford Dictionaries and Merriam-Webster.\n\nThe differences arise because the holiday's name comes from Hebrew, which doesn't use the Latin alphabet. According to Merriam-Webster, some sounds in Hebrew don't have exact matches for Latin letters, creating the multiple spellings.\n\nToday, the most common spelling Hanukkah, but don't be surprised if you also see Chanukah or Hanukah, according to the two dictionaries.\n\nFollow Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2018/10/24/aseana-fall-festival-diwali/1661633002/", "title": "ASEANA fall festival celebrates India's culture, religious holiday, Diwali", "text": "Beads of lights will shine across the sky as India lands in downtown Shreveport\n\nThe ASEANA Foundation will present its 7th annual Fall Festival from 4:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 27, at the Asian Gardens, 800 Texas Ave. The event will celebrate Diwali and Asian street food.\n\n“Diwali is one of the biggest holidays and festivals in India,” said Deepika Reddy, a festival volunteer. \"It’s a celebration of lights — it literally means ‘a row of lamps.’ It represents good overcoming evil.”\n\nThe ASEANA (Association of South East Asians and North Americans) Fall Festival is free. It will include food, live performances — on the newly installed permanent stage — music, fireworks and lots of light displays.\n\nDiwali – known as The Festival of Lights — is celebrated by multiple religions in India, said Rimi Singh, a festival dancer.\n\n“In America, we’re a big melting pot, and in India it’s the same way,” Singh said. “It has so many different cultures and religions and traditions. Diwali is one of those inclusive holidays.”\n\nDiwali represents a new beginning, great wealth, happiness and the lifting of darkness.\n\n“There are many stories associated, but essentially it’s a way for people to come together to celebrate that ultimately good triumphs over evil,” said Sanjay Menon, director of LSUS' India Studies program.\n\nIn India, Diwali is observed over five days around Nov. 7. Diwali is comparable to the New Year holiday as it marks a new beginning, Singh said. It’s celebrated through parties, festivals, prayer and gift exchanges.\n\nLocal flavors\n\nIn Shreveport, ASEANA Fall Festival-goers will get a glimpse of a traditional Diwali celebration and a taste of many Asian cultures through dances, music, fashion and food.\n\nLocal performers will present dances from various regions of India.\n\n“It makes me feel involved,” said Manisha Menon, a Caddo Magnet High School student and festival dancer. “Around here you don’t see a lot of Indian things. It’s fun to do, it makes me feel involved and I like performing in front of people.”\n\nIn the spirit of Diwali, the Asian Gardens will be illuminated with scones and strings of lights. A dancer will perform in a lighted costume after sunset. And at 7 p.m., a firework display over the gardens will close the event.\n\nMore than 25 vendors will sell dishes and treats one would find across Asia.\n\nRecommended festival eats\n\nASEANA board member Sophy Rama's favorite dish is meat kabobs. The beef is marinated in yogurt, ginger and Indian spices and served on a stick.\n\nDeepika Reddy’s pick is the Biryani, which may be made of mixed rice, Indian spices, vegetables, meat, dried fruits or other flavorful ingredients.\n\nManisha Menon's preferred treat is samosas — stuffed with spiced potatoes, onions, peas, lentils and/or meat then fried or baked within a triangular-shaped dough.\n\nOr festival-goers may choose to sample a variety of dishes, as Rimi Singh opts to do.\n\n“Snacks are the best thing — the samosas, kabobs,\" Singh said. \"The chaat is a medley of rice puffs with all of these chutney sauces and onions and freshly cut veggies. There's a different kick to it.”\n\nA couple of beverages to try at the festival are the mango and guava juice, as well as the Boba, or bubble tea, made with tapioca balls. Another of the organizers' favorites is the mango lassi, a drink blending mango, yogurt, milk, sugar and cardamom.\n\nIn 2006, the ASEANA Foundation partnered with the Shreveport Downtown Development Association to transform the once-dilapidated area of downtown into a lush garden with landscaping representing Asia.\n\nThe ASEANA Foundation hosts spring and fall festivals with themes that highlight a different country in Asia and further introduce others in Shreveport-Bossier City to the local Asian community and customs and gardens.\n\nRama, the foundation's landscaper, designed India’s garden in anticipation of the Diwali festival. The area features decorative, colorful stones set in patterns, statues and floral displays.\n\n“Giving back to community means using my talents, using what I can do to contribute to beautify this little section of town,” Rama said. “We want the community to come enjoy our garden and join us for spring festival and fall festival, as well.”\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: ASEANA Foundation's 7th annual Fall Festival\n\nWhere: Asian Gardens, 800 Texas Ave., downtownShreveport\n\nWhen: 4:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 27\n\nCost: Free\n\nInfo: For updates, visit facebook.com/Aseana-Foundation-437588336358802/.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2023/11/16/when-is-hanukkah-2023/71604307007/", "title": "When does Hanukkah begin in 2023 and why is it celebrated?", "text": "Hanukkah — the Jewish eight-day “festival of lights” — begins this year during the first full week of December.\n\nThe Jewish holiday is a time for both celebration and reflection on the religion's history.

Johnson\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nHanukkah starts at sundown on Dec. 2, 2018, and many Phoenix-area residents will be celebrating the Jewish holiday also known as the Festival of Lights. The celebration runs for eight days, ending this year on Dec. 10.\n\nHere are some things you should know about Hanukkah.\n\nWhat is Hanukkah?\n\nIt is not Jewish Christmas, first of all. The two celebrations often overlap (though not this year) and there are gifts involved, but that’s where the similarities end.\n\nHanukkah celebrates the rededication (Hanukkah means dedication or consecration in Hebrew) of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem following the Maccabee revolt in 165 B.C. against Greek-Syrian rule. The temple had been defiled by occupying forces before it was liberated by a small army led by Judah the Maccabee.\n\nAccording to Chabad.org, the celebration is sometimes referred to as the Festival of Lights because when the Jewish people retook the temple, they found just one bottle of oil to light the menorah (a seven-branched candelabrum) that had not been contaminated. They thought that would only be enough oil for one day’s worth of light but it lasted for the eight days it took to prepare more purified oil.\n\nSo the menorah is part of the celebration?\n\nActually, the type of candelabrum used for Hanukkah celebrations is called a hanukkiah. It has nine branches. Eight branches of the hanukkiah signify the eight days that the oil lasted in the temple. The ninth branch, usually elevated slightly above the others, holds the candle that's used to light the others.\n\nWhat's the correct spelling?\n\nYou've probably seen the word spelled in a variety of ways. The most common acceptable variations are Hanukkah, Hanukah, Chanukah and Chanukkah. Some of the confusion stems from the transliteration of the word from the Hebrew alphabet into English.\n\nWhy does the start date change?\n\nHanukkah can begin any time between Nov. 28 and Dec. 26. The variation is a result of the Jewish calendar being based on the lunar cycle so its dates vary in comparison to other calendars. Hanukkah starts on the 25th day of the month of Kislev on the Jewish calendar.\n\nHow important is Hanukkah?\n\nIn a 2016 interview with The Arizona Republic, Arthur Lavinsky the now-retired rabbi of the Beth El Congregation in Phoenix, said Hanukkah is a minor holiday on the Jewish calendar. He said the celebration is “wonderful and joyous” but does not compare in holiness to holidays such as Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish new year) or Yom Kippur (the day of atonement).\n\nHe said the proximity of Hanukkah to Christmas plays a role in the attention it receives in our society.\n\nWhat does gift giving have to do with Hanukkah?\n\nThe custom of giving gifts is relatively recent, having become more popular in the 20th century. Lavinsky said the influence of Christmas played a role in gifts becoming a part of Hanukkah celebrations in recent years.\n\n“Cultures tend to borrow from one another,” he said, mentioning Judaism’s influence on the Christian rite of baptism.\n\nWhat kind of foods are part of the celebration?\n\nFried foods are part of Hanukkah traditions because of the significance of oil to the celebration.\n\nLatkes, a potato pancake, are popular during Hanukkah. Jelly-filled donuts known as sufganiyot and other sweet treats are popular as well.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/08"}]}

For the latest news on the Iran-Israel conflict, read USA TODAY's live updates on the conflict for Tuesday, June 24.\n\nIsrael said that Iran had committed a ''severe violation\" of the Trump-announced ceasefire, and vowed to respond with force, only hours after Iran signaled it was willing to abide by the deal.Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel had detected Iranian missile launches and ordered \"high-intensity operations\" targeting Iran. Iranian media reported that the country has denied a ceasefire violation.\n\nEarlier, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office thanked President Donald Trump and said it achieved its objective of \"eliminating the Iranian nuclear threat.\" Iranian officials said their government would halt attacks if Israel did.\n\nTrump had first announced the deal in a social media post and urged both countries not to violated it. He said that Israel and Iran agreed to a \"total ceasefire\" after the Iranian military retaliated for U.S. strikes on three of the country's nuclear facilities.\n\nA senior White House official told USA TODAY that Trump communicated directly with Netanyahu about the ceasefire, which Israel also agreed to as long as it was not struck again by Iran.\n\nVice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and special envoy Steve Witkoff negotiated with the Iranians, through both direct and indirect channels, the person said. Qatar's emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani helped broker the agreement, and Trump called the Gulf leader to thank him, the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump thanked Iran for providing a warning of its Monday attack, and he made a peace offering to end the brief but intense war. Trump said Iran fired 14 missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar, and 13 of them were intercepted, while the other one was deemed nonthreatening.\n\nTrump reported there were no American or Qatari casualties and very little damage from the attack.\n\nIran’s military had claimed it had carried out a “devastating and powerful” missile assault on the Al Udeid U.S. military base in Doha, but Qatar said the missiles were intercepted. U.S. officials said the base had been emptied out, lending credence to the notion Iran was merely saving face with the missile launch.\n\n\"They’ve gotten it all out of their 'system,' and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE,'' Trump said in his earlier post. \"I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured. Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same.''\n\nContributing: Zac Anderson\n\nIran fires missiles at US base in Qatar: Where else could it strike?\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The State Department said it has evacuated approximately 250 U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents and their immediate family members from Israel on seven flights since June 21.\n\n∎ Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Iran's foreign minister in Moscow and told him there was no justification for the U.S. bombing of Iran, which he described as \"unprovoked aggression,\" according to the Kremlin. Putin added that Moscow is making efforts to assist the Iranian people.\n\n∎ Iranian official Ebrahim Zolfaqari warned that the U.S. should expect severe consequences. \"Mr. Trump, the gambler, you may start this war, but we will be the ones to end it,\" Zolfaqari said in English in a video shared Monday.\n\nReported attacks in Israel and Iran\n\nTrump's ceasefire announcement came after Iran had launched a fresh wave of missiles, killing four people, according to Israel's ambulance service, and as Iranian authorities reported nine people killed in an attack in northern Iran on Tuesday morning.\n\nWitnesses said they heard explosions near Tel Aviv and Beersheba in southern Israel. Iran's semi-official SNN news agency reported that Tehran fired its last round of missiles before the ceasefire came into effect.\n\nIn Iran, the deputy governor of the northern province of Gilan said four residential units were destroyed in a \"terrorist attack\" on Tuesday morning, killing nine people and injuring 33, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.\n\n--Reuters\n\nTrump celebrates ceasefire while Israeli Forces say attacks continue\n\nThe president took to his social media platform Truth Social on Monday evening to celebrate the end of fighting between the two countries.\n\n“Israel & Iran came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, ‘PEACE!’ Trump proclaimed on the platform. “I knew the time was NOW. The World, and the Middle East, are the real WINNERS! Both Nations will see tremendous LOVE, PEACE, AND PROSPERITY in their futures. They have so much to gain, and yet, so much to lose if they stray from the road of RIGHTEOUSNESS & TRUTH. The future for Israel & Iran is UNLIMITED, & filled with great PROMISE. GOD BLESS YOU BOTH!”\n\nThe White House told USA TODAY earlier in the evening that Trump spoke to Netanyahu and the emir of Qatar. Top-ranking U.S. officials spoke directly and indirectly to Tehran.\n\nIranian state media said the ceasefire came as a result of the nation’s retaliatory strikes, according to reporting by CNN. Trump called for the ceasefire “in a begging-like manner” after the attacks on U.S. bases in Qatar, an Iranian state anchor said.\n\nIranian attacks haven’t ceased yet, according to the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nMinutes before the president’s celebratory post, Israeli Defense Forces in a post on X announced an incoming attack: “Sirens sounding in Israel due to a missile launch from Iran.”\n\nAn hour later, Israeli forces said “for the third time in the last hour, Israelis are currently running to shelter due to another missile launch from Iran.”\n\nVance says Trump is working on long-term deal\n\nVice President JD Vance was about to do a live, in-studio interview on Fox News when Trump posted the cease-fire message. Vance said the administration had been working on the truce when he left the White House. \"So that's good news that the president was able to get that across the finish line,\" Vance said.\n\nHe said the United States must now talk to Iran and Israel about what comes next, following days of strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites. \"I think that is what the president is really trying to figure out here, is to build a long-term settlement,\" Vance said.\n\nVance said Trump told his team the U.S. would now work to make sure Iran doesn't rebuild its nuclear capability in the future.\n\nAs for the six hours that Trump referred to, Vance said the fighting may continue for a few hours. \"And tomorrow really is a new day. The end of the 12-day war, the end of the Iranian nuclear program, and I really do believe, something big for peace in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nUS was ready for missiles, evacuated base\n\nA U.S. defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly confirmed to USA TODAY that Al Udeid Air Base was attacked by short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles originating from Iran. There were no reports of U.S. casualties, the official said.\n\nAnother U.S. official said on condition of anonymity that the base had been mostly evacuated, and that it appeared the Qatari military had fended off most missiles.\n\nMajed Al Ansari, foreign affairs spokesman for Qatar, issued a statement strongly condemning the missile launch, calling it \"a flagrant violation'' of the country's sovereignty. \"We reassure that Qatar’s air defenses successfully thwarted the attack,\" the statement said.\n\nThe U.S. has remained on alert with its 40,000 troops in the region two days after Trump ordered the bombing of Fordow, a uranium-enrichment facility deep inside a remote mountain in Iran, and facilities at Natanz and Isfahan. Trump convened his national security team Monday afternoon in the Situation Room.\n\nMany world leaders − including those from the UK, France and Germany − called for restraint and a return to diplomatic negotiations. The extent of the damage to the Iran nuclear sites remains in question because so far there has been no independent assessment.\n\nThe U.S. Ain al-Asad air base in Iraq had activated its air defense system out of concern of a potential attack, military officials told Reuters.\n\nWhat is the Al Udeid US military base in Qatar?\n\nAl Udeid is the sprawling hub of U.S. military air operations in the Middle East. There about 10,000 U.S. troops stationed there, on the outskirts of the capital of Doha.\n\nIts air operations center has overseen fighters, bombers and drones that have conducted combat missions in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nDignitaries make stops there frequently, including Trump and secretaries of Defense.\n\nTrump warns other countries not to supply nukes to Iran\n\nTrump warned other countries Monday not to supply nuclear weapons to Iran in response to the U.S. bombing, after a former Russian president suggested the option.\n\n“The ‘N word’ should not be treated so casually,” Trump said in a social media post, referring to nuclear weapons.Trump was alluding to a social media post by Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia, but questioned its accuracy. Medvedev’s post suggested “a number of countries are ready to directly support Iran with their own nuclear warheads.”−Bart Jansen\n\nSpeaker says no to House vote on war powers resolution\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Monday he didn’t think it was “an appropriate time” for the House to vote on a bipartisan war powers resolution pushed by two representatives, Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie and California Democrat Ro Khanna.\n\n“I don’t think it’s necessary,” Johnson said, according to Punchbowl News. “For 80 years, presidents of both parties have acted with the same Commander in Chief authority under Article 2.''\n\nJohnson said President Joe Biden used the authority in three Middle East operations, and added: \"President Obama went on an eight-month campaign bombing Libya to take down the regime there. I never heard a Democrat balk about any of that. And suddenly now they're just up in arms. It's all politics. This is not a time for politics.”\n\nHis remarks will likely earn pushback from Massie and Khanna, who were looking to bring their measure to the floor for a vote, seeking to forbid the U.S. from \"unauthorized hostilities” in Iran after Trump ordered airstrikes at three nuclear sites in Iran.\n\nLawmakers across the aisle have alleged that Trump’s order violated the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action. Some of Trump’s staunchest allies have split with him over Iran.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nStocks waver but regain footing, end up higher\n\nStocks wavered but quickly moved back into positive ground after Iran said it attacked a U.S. military base Monday. The market wound up on a high note upon news the assault caused no casualties or disruptions to oil supplies.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow closed up 0.89%, or 374.96 points, to 42,581.78; the broad S&P 500 added 0.96%, or 57.33 points, to 6025.17 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.94%, or 183.57 points, to 19630.98. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slipped to 4.34%.\n\nU.S. oil prices initially rose on the news of explosions over Qatar but settled back to trade down about 7.94% to $67.98 per barrel. Qatar said it intercepted Iran's missiles.\n\n− Medora Lee\n\nIsrael flags Tehran residents: More strikes to come\n\nThe Israeli military released an urgent warning to residents in Tehran urging them to stay away from \"security institutions\" as they plan to continue pounding the capital city with airstrikes.\n\n\"Dear citizens of Tehran, In the coming days, the Israeli army will continue its attacks against military targets in the Tehran region,\" read the statement posed Monday on X. \"To maintain your personal safety, we ask you to stay away from weapons production centers, military bases, and security institutions affiliated with the regime.\"\n\nTehran is one of the largest cities in the Middle East and is home to an estimated 9.5 million people. On Monday, Israel launched several strikes on the city, hitting near Evin Prison and several command and security operations centers.\n\nOil spikes on Iran strikes but drops again\n\nOil prices initially rose on reports of explosions over Qatar but dropped again as analysts said oil supplies remained safe. Just after 1:30 p.m. ET, oil prices were down 4.97% at $70.17 per barrel.\n\nAnalysts’ primary concern is if Iran retaliates by closing the Strait of Hormuz, the main artery that carries global oil supplies.\n\nIf transport through the Strait of Hormuz is significantly disrupted, oil prices could surge to $130-150 per barrel, said David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics.\n\n− Medora Lee\n\nNo U.S. forces present at Syrian military base reportedly attacked\n\nThere are no U.S. forces at the military base in Syria that reportedly had come under mortar fire, a U.S. official said Monday.\n\nThe official, who could not confirm whether an attack had occurred at the base, was not authorized to speak publicly about U.S. troop movements in the region. The alleged attack at a base in western Syria was first reported by Mehr, a news agency affiliated with the Iranian government.\n\nThe Pentagon has been bracing for a counterattack after the U.S. airstrikes Saturday on three nuclear facilities in Iran. The Pentagon has sent an additional aircraft carrier strike group to the region and bolstered air defenses to protect troops in recent weeks following Israel’s ongoing attacks on Iran.\n\nMilitia groups, funded and supplied by Iran, have regularly fired rockets, mortars and drones at bases with U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria. Those attacks typically do not cause casualties or major damage.\n\nIs it safe to travel abroad right now? Worldwide caution issued after US strikes on Iran\n\n'Bait and switch': Marjorie Taylor Greene blasts Trump on strike\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has been one of Trump’s most loyal supporters, but she’s not holding back in slamming his decision to bomb Iran. In a second lengthy social media post since the bombing, Greene accused Trump of a “bait and switch” with his supporters.\n\nGreene wrote in the Monday post that she campaigned with Trump on a “MAGA agenda” that included “NO MORE FOREIGN WARS. NO MORE REGIME CHANGE. WORLD PEACE.” Now, less than six months into Trump’s second administration, Greene wrote “we are back into foreign wars, regime change, and world war 3.”\n\n“It feels like a complete bait and switch to please the neocons, warmongers, military industrial complex contracts, and neocon tv personalities that MAGA hates and who were NEVER TRUMPERS!” Greene added.\n\nGreene was among a vocal MAGA contingent warning against attacking Iran before Trump decided to go forward with the strike. Greene has remained outspoken, saying in an earlier social media post that “I can also support President Trump … while disagreeing on bombing Iran and getting involved in a hot war that Israel started.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi, Zac Anderson\n\nTrump calls for low oil prices after U.S. airstrikes on Iran\n\nTrump called for oil prices not to increase after U.S. airstrikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran.\n\n“EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I’M WATCHING! YOU’RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON’T DO IT!” he wrote in a Truth Social post. It wasn’t clear who he was referring to in the post.\n\nIn a follow-up Truth Social post, Trump urged the Department of Energy to “DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!! And I mean NOW!!!”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi and Savannah Kuchar\n\nLeavitt says posture unchanged after Trump's 'regime change' comment\n\nWhen asked about Trump's recent musings on regime change in Iran, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday that the administration and the U.S. military posture has not changed from its stated goal of taking out Iran's nuclear capabilities.\n\n\"The president was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world are asking,\" she said, adding that if Iran's government \"refuse(s) to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn’t the Iranian people rise up against this brutal terrorist regime?”\n\nShe also told Fox News that Trump “believes the Iranian people can control their own destiny” — including by toppling their country’s theocratic regime.\n\nWhere is the Strait of Hormuz? See map of vital trade route\n\nLeavitt says U.S. strikes 'took away' Iran's nuclear capability\n\nLeavitt said Iran was an “imminent threat” and that the U.S. strikes \"took away Iran's ability to create a nuclear bomb.\"\n\n\"They no longer have the capability to build this nuclear weapon and threaten the world,\" Leavitt said in an interview on ABC News.\n\nHer statement comes amid questions around the success of the strikes to destroy Iran's nuclear sites. While Trump and his administration remain adamant that the strikes caused \"monumental damage,\" no independent assessment of the facilities has taken place.\n\nMisinformation and fears: Gen Z, Iran and the mass panic happening on TikTok\n\nU.S. Embassy in Qatar tells American citizens to 'shelter in place'\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Qatar issued an alert on its website warning American citizens to \"shelter in place until further notice.\"\n\nIt's unclear what exactly triggered the alert, though it comes amid high tensions in the region after the U.S. bombed several nuclear facilities in Iran. On Sunday, the State Department released an advisory urging U.S. citizens worldwide to \"exercise increased caution\" as the conflict between Israel and Iran continued to escalate.\n\nQatar's foreign ministry in a statement on Monday said recent advisories issued by embassies \"do not necessarily reflect the existence of specific threats.\" The statement added the the security situation in Qatar is \"stable.\"\n\nGas price effects: Can Iran close the Strait of Hormuz?\n\nIran’s parliament voted Sunday in support of closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital trade route that carries an estimated 20% of the world's oil and gas.\n\nThe decision to close the strait ultimately belongs to Iran's Supreme National Security Council, which has yet to officially weigh in.\n\nLeavitt said the Iranian regime would be “foolish” to close the strait when asked whether the Trump administration would release more oil to dampen potential price hikes.\n\n“I can assure you the administration is actively and closely monitoring the situation in the Strait of Hormuz,” Leavitt told ABC News. “The Iranian regime would be foolish to make that decision.”\n\n− Savannah Kuchar and Bart Jansen\n\nTrump's floats notion of Iran regime change\n\nTrump met with his national security team as tensions in the Middle East grew after he ordered a trio of strikes at Iranian nuclear facilities Saturday.\n\nIn a post on his social media platform, Trump raised the prospect of regime change while officials in his administration said they were seeking to resume negotiations talks with Iran.\n\n\"It’s not politically correct to use the term, 'Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!\" Trump wrote.\n\nEvin Prison among sites hit by Israel missiles, reports say\n\nFollowing the latest round of Israeli missile strikes on Tehran, the Iranian judiciary’s Mizan news agency said electricity was cut off in several city districts and that the situation at Evin Prison is \"under control.\"\n\nThe judiciary said on of the strikes in northern Tehran hit one of the main lines supplying the area, resulting in power outages.\n\nThe notorious Evin Prison was built in 1971 and has housed political prisoners, Westerners and journalists used as bargaining chips by Iran. It has previously been targeted by sanctions, and human rights groups have long condemned the treatment of prisoners there.\n\nIAEA chief says he expects 'very significant damage' at Fordow site\n\nU.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said he expects that U.S. bombing on Iran's Fordow nuclear enrichment site caused \"very significant damage,\" but he added that the extent of any damage remains unclear as the International Atomic Energy Agency has not been able to carry out an inspection.\n\n\"Given the explosive payload utilized and the extreme(ly) vibration-sensitive nature of centrifuges, very significant damage is expected to have occurred,\" Grossi said in a statement Monday to an emergency meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation Board of Governors.\n\nPutin talks with Iranian foreign minister\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Monday told Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in Moscow that aggression against Iran was groundless.\n\nPutin made the comments at the start of Kremlin talks and said Russia, which has condemned the U.S. strikes, was ready to help the Iranian people.\n\nWill Iran strike back at the US?\n\nIran and its hard-line supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei are almost certainly going to strike back in response to historic U.S. military strikes on three of its suspected nuclear facilities.\n\nBut if history is any guide, that response could happen at any time − and anywhere, and in any form, former U.S. intelligence officials and diplomatic experts say.\n\n“Missiles, militias and acts of hostage-taking – that’s their go-to” range of options, the Biden administration coordinator for the Middle East, Brett McGurk, said on CNN June 21. “I suspect Iran will have to do something.” Read more here.\n\n−Josh Meyer\n\nOperation Midnight Hammer used 'bunker busters'\n\nThe U.S. used more than a dozen multimillion-dollar, 30,000-pound \"bunker busters\" to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities in the strike, known as Operation Midnight Hammer, marking the weapon's first operational use, according to the Pentagon.\n\nU.S. bomber planes dropped 14 of the massive bombs on three of Iran's nuclear facilities, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said.\n\nThe bombs used in the strikes, called Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs, weigh 30,000 pounds each and cost millions to produce.

Trump also hiked China’s so-called \"reciprocal'' tariff to 125%, raising its total rate 145% when combined with previously imposed 20% duties.\n\nAdministration officials have said about 75 countries have contacted the U.S. seeking trade deals. “I'm not sure we could ever have enough time in the day to talk to all these countries,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.\n\nTrump said he will revive the higher country-specific tariffs he paused Wednesday if the U.S. is unable to reach trade deals with those nations.\n\n\"If we can't make the deal that we want to make, or we have to make, or that's good for both parties − it's got to be good for both parties − and then we go back to where we were,” Trump told reporters.\n\nWhite House downplays latest market plunge\n\nThe Trump administration downplayed Thursday’s massive drop in the stock market, one day after stocks soared when Trump announced he’s pausing tit-for-tat tariffs on most countries.\n\n“Up two, down one is not a bad ratio, or up 10, down five,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters during a Cabinet meeting, ignoring the four-day slump that preceded Wednesday's rally.\n\nTrump, known for being acutely aware of how the market performs, said he had not seen it Thursday.\n\nBessent said the administration will gain certainty on the tariffs as it negotiates trade deals with other countries over the next three months.\n\n“But we had very good inflation numbers today,'' he said. \"Oil’s down. We had a successful bond market, so I don't think you’re seeing anything unusual today.”\n\nDemocrats question timing of Trump's tariffs pause\n\nThe timing of Trump's pause of some country-specific tariffs on dozens of nations Wednesday struck some Democrats as more than a little curious. Less than four hours before the announcement, Trump had written, \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT\" on his social media site.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Adam Schiff of California and Ruben Gallego of Arizona said in a letter the sequence of events raised \"grave legal and ethics concerns,\" noting the posting propelled financial markets to huge gains and boosted the stock of carmaker Tesla, partly owned by Trump ally Elon Musk, by 18%.\n\n\"The president, his family, and his advisors are uniquely positioned to be privy and take advantage of non-public information to inform their investment decisions,\" Schiff and Gallego wrote in the letter.\n\nAt Thursday's Cabinet meeting, Trump brushed off a reporter's question about the Democrats' concerns. The White House denied any impropriety.\n\n− Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat does the tariff pause mean for you?\n\nAmerican consumers should brace for “more bad days in the stock market” and a “massive” increase in prices, not to mention the possibility of a recession, said Mark Zandi, chief economist for financial services company Moody's Analytics. The pause in tariffs won't pause big price increases for \"everything from clothing to cars to cellphones,\" he told USA TODAY. China is a key reason why.\n\nChina accounted for 16.5% of the $3.2 trillion worth of imports brought into the U.S. in 2022, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\n“The tariff mix is actually worse,” Bloomberg LP’s chief economist Anna Wong said on the X social media platform. “China exports more consumer goods to (the) US than other countries, so boosting that relative to others will boost the hit to consumption goods.” Read more here.\n\n− Bailey Schulz, Jessica Guynn\n\nWhat the tariff pause means: How it impacts your wallet\n\nAgriculture Secretary Rollins: Aid package to farmers will be considered\n\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Thursday that the White House is weighing potential aid packages for American farmers and egg producers to help mitigate damage done by tariffs − but she hopes they will not be necessary.\n\nWhile farmers welcomed Trump's pause on tariffs for many countries, the continued escalation of the duties with China is concerning to soybean farmers because China is a critical export market for U.S. soy, according to the American Soybean Association.\n\n“We run the risk of immediate impacts this growing season, along with the impacts a prolonged trade war with China will inflict on our industry,” said Caleb Ragland, the association's president and a Kentucky soybean farmer.\n\nRollins said it would take time to determine the tariffs' implications for U.S. crops, “especially for our wheat, corn, soybean, etc., that they're just in planting season right now.” She said a firm decision on the aid will be made toward late summer and early fall.\n\nTrump trying to fix issue that's not broken, expert says\n\nTrump “blinked” when he admitted the financial markets’ turmoil was a factor in putting a 90-day pause on tariffs, one economics expert believes.\n\n“He’s trying to reframe this as part of ‘The Art of the Deal,’” said Peter Ricchiuti, a senior finance professor at Tulane University and founder of the Burkenroad Reports student stocks research program, referring to Trump's 1987 book. “I don’t believe a pause was part of the president’s strategy. This was all his silly way of looking at tariffs as a balance of trade.”\n\nWith the major markets closing a fifth negative session in the last six Thursdays, there’s “a 90% chance” the U.S. will enter a recession because of Trump’s overuse of tariffs, Ricchiuti said, predicting the 90-day pause on some tariffs won't result in a correction.\n\nRicchiuti said there’s always going to be some inequity when rich nations like the U.S. trade with others that are not as wealthy. “You don't have to hurt another country to make yours stronger,” Ricchiuti said. “The president made it sound like this is a great issue we needed to fix, but there was really no need for it.”\n\n− Terry Collins\n\nUS stock market today: Latest news on the market\n\nSome tariffs remain despite pauses\n\nTrump's reversal on tariffs was encouraging but far from universal. A 10% blanket duty on almost all U.S. imports will remain in effect, the White House said, and it appeared the duties on autos, steel and aluminium would remain in place. The U.S. tariff pause also does not apply to duties paid by Canada and Mexico because their goods are still subject to 25% fentanyl-related tariffs.\n\nThe EU had been due to impose extra tariffs on U.S. imports including maize, wheat, motorcycles, poultry, fruit and clothing. Those are now suspended.\n\nHow did Trump's 3-month tariff pause come about?\n\nThe three-month tariffs suspension announced Wednesday marks a dramatic retreat for Trump, who on Monday said he wasn’t interested in a pause and just hours before Wednesday’s announcement urged Americans to “BE COOL!” in a post on social media.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, explaining the sudden shift, told reporters the Trump administration has been “overwhelmed” by the more than 75 countries that have approached the U.S. seeking trade deals after the president first announced the sweeping tariffs last week. Trump, speaking to reporters late Wednesday, acknowledged the volatile stock markets and turmoil in the bond market played a role in his decision.\n\n\"I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid,\" Trump said. \"You have to have flexibility.\"\n\nWhat top traded items between US, China could be impacted?\n\nOf the $3.2 trillion the U.S. imported in 2022, 16.5% of that came from China, making it America's top supplier, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. China is also one of the USA's top export destinations, falling behind Canada and Mexico with $150.4 billion of U.S. goods being bought by China in the same year.\n\nMechanical appliances, sound recorders and TV sets were the most commonly traded commodity sectors between China and the U.S. in 2022, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Industry and Security report.

Trump said he supported the causes.\n\n\"She's really been doing an excellent job,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday.

Former President Donald Trump’s controversial trade war with China began in 2018 when he slapped tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese-made goods. Over the next year, he added duties to more items after Beijing retaliated with tariffs on some American-made products.\n\nAfter months of escalation, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping came to a truce at the beginning of 2020, signing what’s known as the Phase One agreement. It reduced the rate of some of the tariffs, but left them in place, and China agreed to increase its purchases of US goods and agricultural products – setting an ambitious target of buying $200 billion more than it did before the trade war began.\n\nBut it’s becoming clear that China has failed to meet those targets. It’s on track to purchase only 60% of the goods it committed to buy, according to Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who tracks China’s purchases.\n\nBiden suggested recently that’s the reason he’s leaving the tariffs in place, despite pressure from the American business community to remove them as companies struggle with inflation and supply chain disruptions. US importers have paid nearly $123 billion to cover the cost of the China tariffs since 2018, according to US Customs and Border Protection.\n\n“It’s uncertain,” Biden said last week at a news conference when asked if it’s time to begin lifting some of the tariffs.\n\n“I’d like to be able to be in a position where I can say they’re meeting the commitments, or more of their commitments, and be able to lift some of it. But we’re not there yet,” he added.\n\nChina falls short of Phase One commitments\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, China committed to ramp up its purchases of US goods and agricultural projects, setting specific amounts for different categories to be bought over the next two years.\n\nEven at the time the agreement was signed, experts were skeptical China would be able to meet its pledge. When the Covid-19 pandemic slowed trade around the globe just weeks after the deal was signed, it made it even harder for Beijing to meet the targets.\n\nWhile China is importing more from the United States than it did before the tariffs were put in place, it has fallen short of its commitments.\n\nExports of US-manufactured goods, including aircraft and autos, have yet to recover to pre-trade-war levels. China has come closer to meeting its pledge when it comes to US agricultural exports, increasing its purchases of soybeans, wheat and corn. Those exports came to a near standstill in 2018.\n\nBut the Phase One agreement doesn’t dictate any repercussions in the event that China misses its goals. It’s up to Biden to decide whether to keep the tariffs in place.\n\nBiden faces pressure from the business community\n\nThe tariffs hit a wide range of Chinese-made goods, including baseball hats, luggage, bicycles, TVs and sneakers. The duties make it more expensive for American businesses to import these goods from China, many of which are not manufactured in the US at a pace that meets the demand.\n\nAs inflation rises and supply chain disruptions continue, pressure from the business community is ramping up on the Biden administration to lift the tariffs. The move wouldn’t solve the supply chain problems, but it could help alleviate some of the inflationary pressure facing importers.\n\n“It’s never been a good time for these tariffs, and now is a particularly bad time for them,” said Steve Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association.\n\nThe new year is “really a continuation of the worst of the problems we’ve seen,” Lamar added, noting that supply chain disruptions are still causing shipping delays, some holiday goods still haven’t arrived on store shelves, and the Omicron variant of the coronavirus caused some factories and retail stores to temporarily close.\n\nBiden moves ‘slow’ on trade policy\n\nAt the start of Biden’s tenure, a large part of his focus was on domestic policy, successfully pushing an economic pandemic relief bill and eventually an infrastructure investment package through Congress.\n\nBut in October, the Biden administration made some trade policy changes. It reached an agreement with the European Union to ease Trump-era sanctions on aluminum and steel. As part of the deal, the EU also agreed to drop retaliatory tariffs against American products including Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Kentucky bourbon.\n\nThe Biden administration also announced in October that it would reinstate some China tariff waivers that US importers had previously received. The process to apply for a reinstatement of expired waivers launched in the fall, but the requests are still under review. More than 2,000 exclusions were granted under the Trump administration but only 549 are eligible for another extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress allowed two longstanding trade programs to expire at the end of 2020 – effectively raising tariffs on a range of goods from various countries. Legislation has been introduced to renew the programs, but has yet to pass both chambers of Congress.\n\n“When it comes to trade policy, the administration is moving very slowly,” Lamar said.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/02/24/trump-russia-ukraine-shakeup-anniversary/79459527007/", "title": "Trump rattles with Russia-Ukraine shakeup on war's anniversary", "text": "WASHINGTON – Talk about a U-turn.\n\nWhen Vladimir Putin’s Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago, Joe Biden rallied the world. The U.S. and its partners isolated Russia and poured tens of billions of dollars in arms, cash and loans into Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s battered country – even as Putin refused to yield.\n\n“America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom. This is who we are,” Biden said from the White House.\n\nThat was then.\n\nNow, on the anniversary of the Russian invasion, the Biden administration’s position of “nothing about Ukraine, without Ukraine” has been tossed aside by President Donald Trump and his advisers. Trump has lashed out at Ukraine, blaming its leaders for Putin’s invasion and cutting Kyiv out of early negotiations with Russia – to the shock of America's allies.\n\nHis taunting of Zelenskyy, who he called “dictator,” was rebuked by European leaders and peeved Ukraine-supporting lawmakers in the U.S.\n\n\"I'm just here to try and get peace,\" Trump said this month. \"I don't care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed.\"\n\nWho started it?\n\nThe president’s team says he deserves credit for shifting the conversation to how the war ends after more than a year of grim stalemate on the battlefront. But his repetition of Russian talking points about who’s to blame for the war has put the the White House in an uncomfortable position.\n\nTrump national security adviser Michael Waltz would not say whether Trump believes Putin or Zelenskyy is more responsible for the Russian invasion at a White House briefing Thursday. Waltz pointedly underscored Trump's frustration with the Ukrainian president, who said Trump was living in a \"disinformation\" bubble informed by the aggressor’s narrative.\n\n\"There has been ongoing fighting on both sides. It is World War I-style trench warfare,\" Waltz said. \"Some of the rhetoric coming out of Kyiv, frankly, and – and insults to President Trump – were unacceptable,\" he added.\n\nIn a floor speech later that day, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the ranking member on the Foreign Relations committee, said Ukraine still has bipartisan support.\n\n\"Vladimir Putin is responsible for this. He's responsible for the bodies in Bucha and for thousands across Ukraine,” Shaheen said, recalling the 2022 massacre of hundreds of Ukrainian townspeople by Russia’s 234th Guards Air Assault Regiment. “And he's got to be held accountable. We cannot let him get away with this.\"\n\n20,000 stolen children\n\nThe full civilian toll isn’t known. Ukraine does not release casualty figures and lacks access to Russian-occupied areas of the country – about 20% of its territory.\n\nAccording to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, at least 40,838 civilians had been killed or wounded in Ukraine as of December 2024, including 2,500 children. Kyiv estimates 20,000 Ukrainian kids have been forcibly taken to Russia – the International Criminal Court has charged Putin with approving their abductions – with only a fraction returned.\n\nIn addition to the Black Sea region of Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014, Moscow controls large swathes of Ukraine.\n\nIn a surprise move last year, Ukraine seized territory in the western region of Kursk. Russia said last week it’s retaken much of that territory and now controls 75% of the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of eastern Ukraine, in addition to almost all of the Luhansk region.\n\nTrump sparks panic\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth alarmed U.S. allies earlier this month when he said in a speech that “returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective” and that eventual NATO membership for Ukraine – a pillar of Kyiv’s security strategy – is not \"a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement.\"\n\nTrump said later Hegseth was \"probably\" right about NATO membership. \"I'm backing Ukraine,\" the president told reporters. \"I'm approving, but I do want security for our money.\"\n\nThe comments came after a call with Putin, in which Trump said they discussed the “great benefit that we will someday have in working together” and raised an in-person meeting in Saudi Arabia. The call was the first known conversation between a U.S. president and Putin since the war began. His team then traveled to Riyadh to meet with Russian officials, including foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, who is under U.S. sanctions.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio touted “the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians, geopolitically on issues of common interest and, frankly, economically.”\n\nThe talks incensed Ukraine. Zelenskyy postponed a trip of his own to Saudi Arabia that was due to follow.\n\n\"We want no one to decide anything behind our backs,\" he said. \"No decision can be made without Ukraine on how to end the war in Ukraine.\"\n\nTrump responded tersely. “You’ve been there for three years. You should have ended it. Three years. You should have never started it,” he said. “You could have made a deal.”\n\nRelations sour between Trump and Zelenskyy\n\nTrump’s complicated history with Zelenskyy dates back to an infamous 2019 phone call the leaders shared two months after the former comedian was sworn in as Ukraine’s president.\n\nFrom the White House, Trump asked Zelenskyy to investigate Biden, then Trump's top rival for the presidency, his son Hunter – who had served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company – and a discredited conspiracy theory involving a hack on the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election that U.S. prosecutors say was done by Russian agents.\n\nThe phone call led to Trump’s first impeachment trial. He was accused by House Democrats of withholding military aid to Ukraine and dangling a White House visit in front of Zelenskyy in a quid pro quo, a charge he denied.\n\nTrump eventually provided Ukraine with weapons. He was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate in February 2020. Zelenskyy did not visit the White House until after Biden took office.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, leading to the protracted war.\n\nTrump has repeatedly derided Zelenskyy in the years since, most recently calling him a \"dictator\" and demanding elections in Ukraine despite the ongoing invasion. Ukraine's constitution bars elections while the country is under martial law.\n\nTensions flared last fall ahead of the U.S. election when Zelenskyy visited an ammunition plant in Pennsylvania, a major U.S. battleground state, and said Trump, who’d boasted he could end the war in a single day, didn't know how to conclude the war.\n\nZelenskyy sought to bring the temperature down at a New York meeting immediately afterward. The leaders spoke by phone after the election and met in Paris in December alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. (Macron is due in Washington on Monday where, he said on social media, he will warn Trump against appearing weak to Putin.)\n\nA tit-for-tat broke out anew after Trump hit out at Zelenskyy for refusing a deal to provide the U.S. with access to its mineral resources in exchange for aid. The Ukrainian leader returned fire, saying Trump was buying into disinformation. Trump demanded $500 billion in Ukraine's minerals as repayment for U.S. assistance, but Zelenskyy retorted that American aid hasn't come close to that enormous figure.\n\nFormer U.S. officials say the spat has hurt both leaders.\n\n\"Trump needs Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy needs Trump,” Charles Kupchan, a former senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council said recently on a call with reporters.\n\n“This kind of mutual insult game only plays into the hands of Russia at a time when the Trump administration should be doing everything to increase Ukraine's leverage, not undermine it,\" he said.\n\nKupchan, who supports direct talks with the Russians, added, \"I appreciate what Trump is trying to do.

All they could do was take a guess,\" Trump said of the intelligence assessment. He later posted this on social media: \"We've collected additional intelligence, and we've also spoken to people who have seen the site − and the site is obliterated!\"\n\nRafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the focus on how much damage Iran's nuclear sites sustained and how long it might take to rebuild them misses the larger point that a long-term solution is required.\n\n“The technological knowledge is there and the industrial capacity is there. That, no one can deny. So we need to work together with them,” said Grossi, emphasizing the need for IAEA inspectors to be allowed back in the facilities to assess them.\n\nTrump envoy hopeful of peace with Iran, absent nuclear weapon\n\nWhile saying the United States will engage in talks with Iranian leaders next week, Trump downplayed the need for any kind of deal because, in his estimation, Iran’s nuclear capabilities have been decimated.\n\nBut Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said he's hopeful a peace accord can be reached with the regime. He also reiterated in an interview with CNBC the administration’s position that Iran – deemed by the U.S. a state sponsor of terrorism – can’t be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.\n\n“We can’t have weaponization,’’ Witkoff said Wednesday. “That will destabilize the entire region. Everyone will then need a bomb and we just can’t have that.’’\n\nAt the Hague, Trump also suggested sanctions on Iran might be eased, though he did not commit to that and said his policy of maximum pressure on the regime remains in place.\n\n“They’re going to need money to put that country back into shape. We want to see that happen,” Trump said when asked at a news conference if he's softening oil sanctions on Iran.\n\nWhat's Trump's schedule today?\n\nTrump began his day in The Hague and will end it in Washington. He left the Netherlands after holding a news conference that mainly focused on the extent of the damage caused by U.S. strikes to Iran's nuclear sites and conversations he's having with the leaders of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nHe had morning meetings with the king and queen of the Netherlands and the secretary-general of NATO before participating in a discussion with the leaders of NATO nations.\n\nTrump sat down later with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and met privately with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He'll spend much of the rest of his day on a long flight back to the United States. He's due to arrive at the White House in the evening local time.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nNATO nations raising defense spending target\n\nNATO's European members pledged June 25 to more than double their military spending over the next decade, to 5% of their gross domestic product. The agreement, more a goal than finite percentage, is a bow to Trump's long-held complaint that Europe should pay more of NATO's bills.\n\n\"This is a monumental win for the United States because we were carrying much more than our fair share,\" Trump said. \"This is a big win for Europe and actually for western civilization.\"\n\nThe plan is for spending 3.5% on military equipment and 1.5% on infrastructure upgrades such as roads, ports, bridges and airfields. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country won't comply, and Trump said the US. would address that issue with its trade deal with Spain.\n\nTrump says Europe should spend its defense funds on US equipment\n\nTrump said it was important that Europe spend the additional defense funds on \"very serious military hardware, not bureaucracy.\" And he suggested America would be a good place for Europe to shop for its weaponry. He used Iran's assault on a U.S. air base in Qatar as an example of U.S. military might. Fourteen missiles were fired at the base, 13 were shot down and one fell harmlessly far from its target, he has said.\n\n\"They were very nice, they gave us warning. They said, 'We are going to shoot them, is 1 o'clock OK?'\" Trump said, drawing laughter at his NATO news conference. \"We said, 'It's fine.' Everybody was emptied off the base so they could not get hurt.\"\n\nNATO leaders heap praise on 'daddy' Trump, get his commitment\n\nFlattery and acquiescence to Trump's desires seems to have worked for NATO leaders, who got a concession they desperately wanted at the summit − the U.S. president's commitment to the alliance's principle of mutual defense among its 32 members.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte started the charm offensive even before the gathering started with a highly complimentary personal letter that Trump made public. And after an angry Trump used profanity in ripping Israel and Iran on Tuesday for violating the terms of the ceasefire he had helped negotiate, Rutte cheekily said, \"Daddy has to sometimes use strong language.\"\n\nAt the summit, the vast majority of the NATO countries went on to agree to Trump's demands that they increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP over the next 10 years.\n\nA clearly pleased Trump then joined his colleagues in endorsing a five-point communique that reaffirmed NATO's commitment to collective defense, \"as enshrined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty – that an attack on one is an attack on all.\"\n\nAsked about his stance in that regard after previous ambiguous comments, Trump said: \"I stand with it. That's why I'm here. If I didn't stand with it, I wouldn't be here.\" He also told reporters: \"I left here saying that these people really love their countries. It's not a rip-off, and we're here to help them, protect them.\"\n\nIsraeli spy chief commends agents for Iran mission, vows to remain vigilant\n\nMossad spy chief David Barnea praised his agents for their role in Israel's operation against Iran, expressed gratitude to America's CIA, and pledged ongoing vigilance in remarks broadcast Wednesday.\n\n\"We will remain vigilant, keeping a close eye on all the projects in Iran, which we know of, in the deepest way. We will be there as we have been until now,\" Barnea said in a video of his remarks to agents.\n\nIsrael sent Mossad operatives into Iran to destroy weapons systems, an Israeli security source told Reuters on June 13 at the start of a 12-day air war on Iranian nuclear and military targets that ended Tuesday in a U.S.-brokered ceasefire.\n\n\"I want to express appreciation and recognition of our main partner – the CIA – for the joint activities,\" Barnea said of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. He said the CIA had supported the Mossad and made the operation possible.\n\n− Reuters\n\nTrump stands by claim that Iran program was 'obliterated'\n\nIran and Israel were both claiming victory in the short but deadly conflict as the world waited to determine whether a ceasefire would hold.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had achieved the goals of its attacks on Iran by destroying the nation's nuclear program. Israel’s Atomic Energy Commission on June 25 issued an assessment of the damage, saying Iran’s nuclear program has been set back “many years.”\n\nA Pentagon intelligence assessment was less definitive, saying the 30,000-pound weapons may not have reached deep enough to destroy the underground installations and likely only delayed Iran's nuclear program by a few months. Trump said Wednesday the intelligence was inconclusive.\n\n\"The intelligence says we don't know. It could've been very severe, that's what the intelligence suggests,\" Trump told reporters while meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. \"It was very severe. There was obliteration.\"\n\nFBI investigating leak of damage assessment report\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, speaking at the NATO summit June 25, said the FBI was investigating the leak of the Pentagon intelligence assessment, which he said was \"top secret.\"\n\n\"It was devastation,\" Hegseth said at a briefing with Trump. \"Any assessment that tells you it was something otherwise is speculating with other motives.\"\n\nHegseth said the assessment was preliminary, low confidence and for \"internal purposes.\" He said it estimated the damage was \"moderate to severe and we believe far more likely severe and obliterated.\"\n\nBombing set back Iran’s nuclear program ‘many years,’ Israel says\n\nIsrael’s Atomic Energy Commission says the combination of U.S. and Israeli assaults on Iran’s nuclear sites set back Iran's program \"many years\" and possibly \"indefinitely.\"\n\n\"The devastating US strike on Fordow destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable,'' the agency said in a report. \"We assess that the American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, combined with Israeli strikes on other elements of Iran's military nuclear program, has set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years.\"\n\nThe report said the \"achievement can continue indefinitely\" if Iran is kept from gaining access to nuclear material.\n\nAtomic agency reports radioactive, chemical release\n\nThe attack resulted in \"extensive damage\" to Iran's uranium conversion and enrichment facilities, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog.\n\nDirector General Rafael Mariano Grossi said the agency's early report shows some \"localized radioactive as well as chemical release\" inside the facilities that contained nuclear material – mainly enriched uranium. But there has been no report of increased off-site radiation, he said.\n\nThe IAEA is aware of concerns in the region regarding radiological consequences as a result of the strikes, he said.\n\n“Based on the data available to us, the IAEA can provide assurances that there has been no radiological impact to the population and the environment in neighboring countries. Crucially in terms of nuclear safety, Iran’s research and power reactors were not targeted,” Grossi said.\n\nIran executes three men accused of spying for Israel\n\nIran on Wednesday executed three Kurdish men accused of helping Israel’s Mossad spy agency conduct assassinations inside the country. The semi-official Tasnim news agency said the three had been caught trying to “import equipment into the country under the guise of a shipment of alcoholic beverages.”\n\nThe Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights said the three were executed at Urmia prison “without a fair trial and based on confessions obtained under torture,” adding that Iran is conducting hangings as a form of suppression to cover up military failures in its war against Israel.\n\nTwo of the men executed were kolbars, or border mules, “who were arrested on charges of smuggling alcoholic beverages but were forced to confess to espionage for Israel,\" the group said.\n\nTasnim reported the defendants had smuggled equipment that “ultimately led to the assassination” of a government figure. The report did not specify whose assassination they had allegedly assisted. Israel killed numerous top Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists in the opening salvo of its 12-day war with Iran. The three were convicted of “enmity against God” and “corruption on earth,” Tasnim reported. − Dan Morrison\n\nA clash 70 years in the making\n\nThe saga between Iran and the United States goes back seven decades and 13 presidents, a relationship that broke down after the people of Iran rose up in 1978 against a regime the United States helped install in 1953. While Trump's decision to bomb the country's nuclear sites has Americans on edge, the United States has a long history of punishing Iran's government, most often through sanctions.\n\nAt the center of it all is the state of Israel, the United States' key ally in the region − one that consistently finds itself at war with Iran or with the Islamic extremist groups that are proxies for Iran's interests. For some key moments in the relationship between the U.S. and Iran, read more here.\n\nIran says nuclear program still on track\n\nIn Iran, the Supreme National Security Council declared that the Islamic Republic’s military response to the attack forced Israel and its Western supporters to unilaterally halt offensive operations. And Iran's top nuclear official, Mohammad Eslami, told the Mehr News Agency that preparations made ahead of the attack will prevent any hiatus in progress for Iran's nuclear industry.\n\nIsrael’s sweeping assault, which began June 13, targeted military leaders, nuclear scientists, uranium enrichment facilities and Iran’s ballistic missile program.\n\nThe war has been costly. Iranian Health Minister Mohammad Reza Zafarqandi said more than 600 Iranians have been killed by Israeli missiles. Iran’s missile attacks in response killed about 30 and wounded thousands in Israel, severely damaging apartment buildings, a university and a hospital, according to the Times of Israel.\n\nTrump says ceasefire 'in effect': President scolds Iran, Israel\n\nSome Americans fear war's violence could reach US\n\nSome residents and tourists in major American cities say they feel uneasy about the possibility of violence breaking out at home. At New York's Penn Station, Catherine Wagoner, a kindergarten teacher from Boston waiting for her train home after visiting friends, told USA TODAY she felt less safe traveling since the attacks in Iran.\n\n“Being in New York feels more of a threat – more of a target,” she said, adding, “I definitely have a lot of privilege, and I don't feel like I'm necessarily the target, so I can recognize that. But I just have a constant state of anxiety about the state of the world.”\n\nWagoner's feelings were echoed in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll that surveyed 1,139 U.S. adults nationwide and found that some 79% of respondents said they worried \"that Iran may target U.S. civilians in response to the U.S. airstrikes.\" Read more here.\n\n− Christopher Cann and Michael Collins\n\nWhat nuclear capability does Iran have?\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has been consistent: It does not believe Iran has been building a nuclear weapon. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said as much when she testified to Congress about Iran’s nuclear program in March.\n\nU.S. spy agencies, Gabbard said, “continue to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.\"\n\nTrump and Netanyahu dismissed that assessment. Trump has doubted U.S. intelligence agencies before − for example, over who was responsible for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi (it was Saudi Arabia). Netanyahu, meanwhile, has been talking about Iran's existential nuclear threat to Israel for as along as he's been in the public eye.\n\nStill, U.S. intelligence agencies, Trump, Netanyahu and the United Nations' nuclear watchdog − the International Atomic Energy Agency − agree on the issue of Iran's uranium.\n\nAll believe Iran has developed a large stockpile, and at a sufficiently enriched level, to sustain a nuclear reaction that could be used in a bomb if it decided to. But how quickly Iran could then \"sprint to a nuclear weapon,\" as Gen. Michael E. Kurilla put it on June 10, is also a matter of dispute, and estimates range from one week to one year.\n\n−Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nWhy did the US strike Iran nuke facilities?\n\nTrump ordered the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities − Operation Midnight Hammer − effectively joining a war that Israel started on June 13 when it began bombing Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure. Israel said it helped the U.S. coordinate and plan the strikes.\n\nTrump said all three sites were \"totally obliterated.\" But an independent assessment has not yet been carried out. The International Atomic Energy Agency − the United Nation's nuclear watchdog − released a statement saying that so far it had not detected an increase in \"off-site radiation levels,\" one of the feared consequences of the strikes.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/19/iran-israel-trump-us-live-updates/84272625007/", "title": "Iran-Israel: Trump to decide within 2 weeks on US intervening", "text": "At least 240 people have been killed in Iran since Israel began airstrikes on June 13.

All they need is a decision from the supreme leader to do that. And it would take a couple weeks to complete the production of that weapon,” she said.\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump intellegence chief said Iran wasn't chasing a bomb, flagged high uranium enrichment\n\nJust three months ago, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, testified before Congress that the U.S. intelligence community had assessed that Iran “is not building a nuclear weapon.”\n\nIn her prepared testimony before the House and Senate Intelligence committees on March 25, Gabbard provided an overview of all threats to U.S. national security, including Iran. She was unequivocal in the assessment provided by the 18 U.S. intelligence agencies she oversees, including the CIA and the National Security Agency.\n\n“The IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamanei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003,” Gabbard said. “We continue to monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons program.”\n\nOver the past year, Gabbard said, U.S. spies, intelligence analysts and specialized satellites have “seen an erosion of a decades long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public, likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus.”\n\n“Iran's enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons,” Gabbard said. “Iran will likely continue efforts to counter Israel and press for U.S. military withdrawal from the region by aiding, arming, and helping to reconstitute its loose consortium of like-minded terrorists, actors, which it refers to as its ‘Axis of Resistance.’“\n\n-Josh Meyer\n\nWhat does Trump need to see in a deal?\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Iran would have to agree to stop all uranium enrichment for Trump to find an agreement acceptable.\n\n“Iran is absolutely not able to achieve a nuclear weapon,” she added. “The president has been very clear about that.”\n\nLeavitt said a deal that the U.S. proposed through special envoy Steve Witkoff prior to the Israeli strikes was “realistic and acceptable.” She did not provide specifics on what was in it.\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nWhere's President Trump today?\n\nPresident Trump joined an 11:30 am meeting with members of his national security team in the White House Situation Room.\n\nIn the afternoon, he’ll hold a private, swearing-in ceremony for his ambassador to Ireland, Edward Walsh, a businessman from New Jersey.\n\nTrump has no public events on his schedule – but he posted on Truth Social throughout the morning about various topics − including his extension of the deadline for a deal to save TikTok.

Iran has loaded 2.2 million barrels per day of crude oil so far this week, marking a five-week high, analytics firm Kpler said.\n\nEnergy infrastructure in both countries has been targeted in missile exchanges, including the Haifa oil refinery in Israel and Iran's South Pars gas field, though Iran's major crude exporting facility at Kharg island has so far been spared.\n\nIran has moved part of its 40 million barrel floating storage fleet, which sits on 36 different vessels, much closer to China to minimize the impact of any disrupions on buyers, ship tracking firm Vortexa told Reuters.\n\n-Reuters\n\nPakistan worries Iranian collapse could energize jihadis on the border\n\nSeparatist and jihadist militants on the Pakistan-Iran border could take advantage of any collapse of authority in Iran, fears that Pakistan’s army chief pressed in a meeting this week with the President Donald Trump.\n\nAnti-Iranian and anti-Pakistan outfits operate on both sides of the 560-mile long border. As Israel bombs Iran's nuclear program, its officials have repeatedly indicated that they are seeking to destabilize the Iranian government or see it toppled.\n\nAs well as worrying about chaos spilling over from Iran, Pakistan is concerned about the precedent set by Israel of attacking the nuclear installations of another country. Nuclear-armed rivals Pakistan and India fought a four-day conflict in May.\n\nFollowing a June 18 lunch at the White House with Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, Trump said: “They’re not happy about anything,” referring to Pakistan's views on the Israel-Iran conflict.\n\n-Reuters\n\nIsrael eyes regime change in Tehran\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said the military had been instructed to intensify strikes on strategic-related targets in Tehran to eliminate the threat to Israel and destabilise what he called the \"Ayatollah regime.\"\n\nHe called Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \"the modern Hitler\" and said \"this man should not continue to exist.\"\n\nNetanyahu has said Israel's military attacks could result in the toppling of Iran's leaders, and Israel would do whatever is necessary to remove the \"existential threat\" posed by Tehran. But Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said regime change was not an official goal, \"for the time being.\"\n\n\"The matter of changing the regime or the fall of this regime is first and foremost a matter for the Iranian people,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told public broadcaster Kan late on June 19. \"There is no substitute for this.\"\n\nPresident Trump has focused on ending Iran's nuclear program, but on June 17 he mused about the possiblity of killing Khamenei, calling him an \"easy target.\"\n\nTrump has 40,000 reasons to worry\n\nThe Trump administration has at least 40,000 reasons to worry about the aftermath of a potential attack on Iran.\n\nThat’s the rough number of U.S. troops stationed in the Middle East, in bases from Bahrain to Syria and points in between. Not to mention U.S. citizens who live and work in the region.\n\nThey would be vulnerable to counterattacks that could involve Iranian ballistic missiles, drones or terrorism should the United States join Israel in its ongoing attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.\n\nIran can strike “all of them,” a U.S. Defense official said.\n\n-Tom Vanden Brook and Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nIran targeted Israeli intelligence site when hospital was struck, foreign minister says\n\nIran's foreign minister said that the Soroka hospital in Beersheba, Israel, was damaged in an attack on a nearby military command center, which Israel denied.\n\n\"Earlier today, our powerful Armed Forces accurately eliminated an Israeli Military Command, Control & Intelligence HQ and another vital target,\" Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araqchi said on X. \"The blast wave caused superficial damage to a small section\" of the Soroka hospital.\n\nAraqchi pointed out Israel's repeated attacks on hospital facilities in Gaza.\n\n“The claim of an attack on an intelligence base or the presence of military equipment under the hospital is another lie. We are not so despicable as to endanger civilians,” the IDF said in a Persian-language statement, the Times of Israel reported. “Attacking hospitals is a crime.

On the other hand, Russia \"makes most of its own weapons\" and is \"buying drones from Iran and ammunition from North Korea\" with no limitations on how they are used. It also enjoys an advantage in raw manpower, bolstered by yet another massive conscription drive last month. Putin's aim is to have a bigger army than America's, with 1.5 million active servicemen, \"a sign of Russia's relentless militarisation\", said Sky News' Moscow correspondent Ivor Bennett.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nData from the Ukrainian military revealed that Russia has increased its production of ballistic missiles by 66% in the past year, and has ramped up the scale of its barrages consistently through the summer.\n\nIts superiority in personnel and materials – along with the use of new \"infiltration tactics\", reported by Deutsche Welle – has seen it make slow but steady progress on the battlefield, gradually expanding the amount of Ukrainian territory it controls over the past year.\n\nIn August, Russian forces took the key strategic town of Chasiv Yar in the eastern Donetsk region after months of fighting. Now its focus is on Pokrovsk, described by the BBC in August as \"the hottest spot on the front line at this point of the war\".\n\nYet optimism in Moscow that the thinly stretched Ukrainian army was close to collapse has, for now at least, proved to be wide of the mark. Putin had hoped a summer offensive would finally break Ukraine's resistance but the Russian army \"has been unable to secure any front line breakthroughs\", said the Atlantic Council. \"The Kremlin's ambitious plans to expand the war into northern Ukraine's Sumy and Kharkiv regions have also fallen flat.\"\n\nWhat does victory look like for each side?\n\nBefore Russia launched its invasion in February 2022, Putin outlined the objectives of what he called a \"special military operation\". His goal, he claimed, was to \"denazify\" and \"demilitarise\" Ukraine, and to defend Donetsk and Luhansk, the two eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014.\n\nAnother objective, although never explicitly stated, was to topple the Ukrainian government and remove Zelenskyy. \"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,\" said Zelenskyy shortly after the invasion. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound.\n\nRussia shifted its objectives, however, about a month into the invasion, after Russian forces were forced to retreat from Kyiv and Chernihiv. According to the Kremlin, its main goal became the \"liberation of the Donbas\", including the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – but Moscow has made little progress in achieving this aim.\n\nRussia has since scaled back its objectives. The Kremlin's \"minimum requirement\" appears to be \"occupying the entirety of the Donbas region (comprising the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk)\", said The Economist. It also wants to regain \"control of Russia's own Kursk region, which Ukraine has partly occupied\", and hold on to \"the 'land bridge' it seized in the early stages of the war connecting Crimea to Russia\".\n\nThe Russian leader has repeatedly reiterated that the root causes of the conflict must first be eliminated before any ceasefire agreement. This is the language Putin \"often uses as code to mean the removal\" of Zelenskyy \"and the installation of a Russian proxy government, as well as the incorporation of five illegally annexed Ukrainian regions into Russia\", said Sky News.\n\nAs it stands, there is \"no reason\" to believe Putin wants long-term peace, said Sky News military analyst Michael Clarke, because \"that's not good for his rule\".\n\nUkraine's main objective remains the liberation of its occupied territories. That includes not just those held by Russia since the February 2022 invasion, but a return to its internationally recognised borders, including Crimea. Recently, however, Zelenskyy appears to have softened this red line, suggesting he might be open to freezing the war along the current frontlines, formalising Russian control over the territory it occupies in exchange for an end to fighting and security guarantees from the West.\n\nHow many Russian and Ukrainian troops have died in the conflict?\n\nTrue casualty figures are \"notoriously difficult to pin down\", said Newsweek, and \"experts caution that both sides likely inflate the other's reported losses\".\n\nMore than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and 380,000 injured on the battlefield, Zelenskyy said in an interview with NBC in February, with \"tens of thousands\" missing or in Russian captivity. However, as of July, UALosses , a web project that records Ukrainian casualty data from open sources, lists 77,607 as having been killed in the war so far.\n\nMoscow has fared even worse. Figures released in the summer by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies think tank put Russian military deaths at up to 250,000 and total casualties, including the wounded, at over 950,000. In June, Russia's wartime toll reached a \"historic milestone\", said The Guardian , with more than a million troops killed or injured since the start of the invasion, according to the UK Ministry of Defence.\n\nEven Russia's recent \"extremely modest recent gains have come at a terrible price\", said the Atlantic Council. \"While the Kremlin does not release information about its war dead, conservative estimates of Russian casualties based on open source data suggest catastrophic losses during the summer months numbering tens of thousands.\"", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/08/us-uk-trade-deal-trump-announces-agreement/83508333007/", "title": "Recap: Trump unveils trade agreement with Britain", "text": "WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump touted a “breakthrough trade deal” between the U.S. and United Kingdom as he announced the first agreement since he imposed sweeping tariffs in April that ignited a global trade war and rattled financial markets.\n\nJoined in the Oval Office by U.S. and UK officials who helped broker the agreement, Trump said the pact would boost trade between the two allies and remove \"non-tariff barriers\" he said \"unfairly discriminate\" against American products.\n\n“There could be no more perfect morning to reach this historic agreement,\" Trump said, noting that the agreement happened to fall on \"Victory Day\" in celebration of the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nYet it is unclear whether the deal with Britain ‒ the ninth largest trading partner with the U.S. ‒ will provide momentum for future trade agreements as the Trump administration seeks to rapidly hammer out deals with 170 countries. The U.S. has a $12 billion trade surplus with Britain, making it an outlier from other countries like China that export more goods to the U.S. than it imports.\n\nUnder the still-evolving deal, Trump kept a 10% baseline tariff on British products imported to the United States, but he said that's a \"low number\" compared to the tariffs he wants to maintain for other counties.\n\nThe agreement lowers 25% universal tariffs on automobiles from the UK to 10%, while the 25% rate still applies to vehicles from other countries. Trump also agreed to eliminate 25% tariffs on steel from the UK.\n\nOther details are still in the works, Trump said. Still, U.S. stocks traded higher in the immediate hours of the news spreading of a broad deal between the two longstanding global allies. Trump promised that their efforts would provide billions of dollars in access for U.S. agricultural products such as beef and ethanol.\n\n“They’re opening up their country,” Trump said. “Their country is a little closed and we appreciate it.”\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Keri Starmer was put on a speaker phone for the announcement and called it a “really fantastic, historic day” coinciding with the 80th anniversary of the key moment at the end of World War II.\n\n“This is going to boost trade between and across our countries,” Starmer siad.\n\nTrump had imposed reciprocal tariffs on a slew of countries April 2 but later paused most of them for 90 days, saying those nations' leaders were eager to negotiate trade deals. Since then administration officials repeatedly have said they are close to making deals.\n\nThe UK wasn't hit with a reciprocal tariff during Trump's April roll out, but faced a 10% universal tariff and 25% tariffs that Trump imposed on foreign automobiles, steel and aluminum.\n\nBritons will buy U.S. beef and chicken despite additives: Navarro\n\nPeter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, disputed concerns that growth additives would discourage sales of beef and chicken to the United Kingdom.\n\nKansas, Nebraska and Texas are expected to sell more beef, Navarro said of the trade deal President Donald Trump negotiated with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Wisconsin and California are expected to sell more dairy products, he said. Iowa is expected to sell more corn as ethanol, he said.\n\n“There’s joy in farm-ville today,” Navarro told reporters May 8.\n\nAsked if Britons would buy beef raised with hormones or chicken rinsed with chlorine, Navarro said the markets would decide. He argued that “so-called phytosanitary standards” are “simply a tool to suppress” fine agricultural products.\n\n“If more of that comes into the market and the British people don’t want to buy it, that’s one set of facts,” Navarro said. “We believe that once they’ve tasted American beef and chicken that they’d prefer to have it.” - Bart Jansen\n\nTrump: Reduced UK auto tariffs to help Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar cars\n\nPresident Trump said he made a special exception for the United Kingdom by lowering auto tariffs from 25% to 10% to help high-end vehicles such as Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar vehicles that are manufactured in Britain.\n\n“It's a very special car, and it's very limited number, too,” Trump said. “It’s not one of the monster car companies that makes millions of cars. They make a very small number of cars that are super luxury.”\n\n“That’s really handmade stuff, they've been doing it for a long time in the same location,” he said. “So I said, ‘Let’s help the out with that one.’”\n\nTrump said he will “rarely” make the same decision in negotiations with other countries when it comes to other foreign automobiles. - Joey Garrison\n\nSchumer casts doubt on longevity of Trump’s UK trade deal\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer cast doubt on the durability of President Donald Trump’s trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the details of which are not fully known.\n\nSchumer, D-New York, said in a morning Senate floor speech, ahead of Trump’s announcement, that the trade deal “is likely to be built on quicksand.”\n\n“And with this president, if past is prologue, who knows if this ‘deal’ will actually stick,” Schumer, D-N.Y., said.\n\nSchumer added: “It would be hard to take anything the president says about this deal today seriously, because in all likelihood he will likely change his mind again.” – Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump says 10% tariff could still increase for other countries\n\nTrump’s trade deal with the United Kingdom maintained a 10% universal tariff on the country.\n\nAsked if trade deals with other countries also could result in tariffs staying at 10%, rather than the higher reciprocal tariffs the president threatened last month before pausing most of them, Trump said no.\n\n“The template of 10 is probably the lowest,” he said, suggesting other countries could have a higher tariff. - Zac Anderson\n\nJames Bond cars, films at heart of trade discussions\n\nThe United Kingdom could begin sending more Aston Martin cars – the iconic ride for fictional spy James Bond – to the U.S. under the trade deal, but Trump said potential tariffs on foreign films were still open to discussion.\n\n“James Bond has nothing to worry about, that I can tell you,” Trump said to laughter in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump noted that he was friends with Sean Connery, the late Scottish actor who created the Bond character in film. Trump has two golf courses in Scotland, and Connery helped resolve a zoning dispute for the one in Aberdeen.\n\n“Sean Connery was a friend of mine. He was a great guy,” Trump said. “He said, ‘Let the bloody bloke build his golf courses.’” - Bart Jansen\n\nUK says trade deal with the US eliminates steel tariffs\n\nThe United Kingdom said in a press release that the trade deal with the United States will help a steel industry “on the brink of collapse.”\n\nThe U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on foreign steel. The UK won’t face those tariffs now, according to the release.\n\n“The Prime Minister negotiated the 25% tariff down to zero, meaning UK steelmakers can carry on exporting to the US,” the release states. - Zac Anderson\n\nTrump says he’s not overstating deal\n\nResponding to a question about the significance of the trade deal announced with the UK, Trump said it’s incorrect to suggest he’s overstating its importance.\n\n“This is a maxed out deal,” he said, adding: “It’s a very big deal right now but I think it’s going to grow.” - Zac Anderson\n\nU.S. keeps 10% tariffs on UK goods: Lutnick\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said 10% tariffs would remain under the trade deal, but that the United Kingdom was opening its markets for an estimated $5 billion in U.S. beef, ethanol and machinery.\n\nLutnick said a 25% U.S. tariff on automobiles would be reduced to 10% for the first 100,000 vehicles. Lutnick also said a British airline would announce later May 8 that it would buy $10 billion of Boeing planes. - Bart Jansen and Joey Garrison\n\nTrump says UK has agreed to eliminate ‘non-tariff barriers’\n\nAlthough the details of the trade deal are still unclear, Trump said the United Kingdom has agreed to reduce or eliminate the number of “non-tariff barriers that unfairly discriminated against American products.\"\n\n“This is now turning out, I think, really to be a great deal for both countries because it will be really great for the UK also,” Trump said.\n\nUK’s Starmer says deal will boost trade between countries\n\nUnited Kingdom Keir Starmer, talking through a speaker phone, touted the moment as a “fantastic, historic day” as the U.S. and Britain agreed to a trade deal.\n\n“Really important deal,” Starmer said. “This is going to boost trade across our countries. It's going to not only protect jobs, but create jobs, opening market access. And as you say, Donald, the timing couldn't be more apt.” - Joey Garrison\n\nTreasury sanctions 4 Chinese companies for buying, delivering Iranian oil\n\nIn another trade arena, the Treasury Department announced May 8 it sanctioned a Chinese refinery and three port terminal operators for buying or helping deliver hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian oil.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had signed an executive order to block sales of Iranian oil as part of an economic pressure campaign against the Middle East country working to develop its own nuclear weapon.\n\n“The United States remains resolved to intensify pressure on all elements of Iran’s oil supply chain to prevent the regime from generating revenue to further its destabilizing agenda,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. - Bart Jansen\n\nRubio calls trade deal ‘an important step’ toward more\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio praised the trade deal with the United Kingdom as “an important step towards fair and reciprocal trade” with other countries around the world.\n\n“Looking forward to the many great deals your administration will deliver for the American people!” Rubio wrote on social media. -Bart Jansen\n\nStocks up on word of trade deal\n\nU.S. stock markets rose in initial trading after Trump’s announcement of a trade deal with the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 198.6 points or 0.48% at the opening of trading May 8. The S&P 500 rose 32.3 points or 0.57% in initial trading. And the Nasdaq composite rose 182 points or 1.03% at the opening bell. - Reuters\n\nThe United Kingdom is the ninth-largest trading partner with U.S.\n\nFinal details on Trump's trade deal with the United Kingdom remain under wraps.\n\nBut the two nations exchange a much smaller amount of goods and services – largely cars and chemicals heading to the U.S. – than the U.S. does with its largest trading partners.\n\nThe U.S. exported nearly $80 billion in goods and services in 2024, according to the Census Department, while importing about $68 billion. That ranks the United Kingdom ninth in trade with the U.S.Machinery and transport equipment was also the main goods exported from the United Kingdom to the U.S. in 2023. Cars represented nearly half the UK exports to the U.S., ahead of Germany and the Netherlands, according to that country’s trade office.\n\nChemical exports, mostly for pharmaceuticals, account for nearly one-quarter of the exports to the U.S. They were the second largest group of UK commodities exported to the U.S.\n\nThe United Kingdom figures are dwarfed by U.S. trade with Mexico at $839 billion in goods and serves exchanging across the U.S.-Mexico border last year. Canada traded $762 billion in goods and services with the U.S., while China coming in at $582 billion in trade with the U.S.\n\nTrump met with Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney on May 6, and talks are set to begin with China. - Bart Jansen\n\nU-Michigan economist: Not a major trade deal\n\nTrump’s announcement already is being met with skepticism.\n\nUniversity of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers told CNN he wouldn’t consider it a major trade deal, noting the United Kingdom only accounts for about 3% of U.S. trade.\n\n“The president’s a showman, he’s going to tell you there’s all sorts of wonderful things about it,” Wolfers said. - Zac Anderson\n\nTrump: 'We don't have to sign deals'\n\nTrump commented about the intense interest in the trade deals during a May 6 meeting with the prime minister of Canada.\n\n\"Everyone says: 'When, when, when are you going to sign deals?\" Trump said. \"We don't have to sign deals. We could sign 25 deals right now . . . if we wanted. We don't have to sign deals. They have to sign deals with us. They want a piece of our market.\"\n\nThe president also expressed frustration with the constant questions. \"I wish they'd stop asking how many deals are you signing this week,\" he said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers during a May 6 committee hearing that deals could be signed soon.\n\n\"I would think that perhaps as early as this week we will be announcing trade deals with some of our largest trading partners,\" Bessent said. - Zac Anderson\n\nWhat's the status of U.S.-China trade talks?\n\nThere are 18 countries that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described as \"major trading partners.\" He said negotiations have begun with all of them except China, but talks between U.S. and Chinese officials are now scheduled.\n\nBessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are traveling to Switzerland on May 8, where they will meet with China's \"lead representative on economic matters.\"\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is also meeting on May 8 with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Jinping told Putin their two countries should be \"friends of steel\", as they pledged to boost cooperation to a new level at a time of heightened confrontation with the West.\n\nAt talks in the Kremlin, the two leaders cast themselves as defenders of a new world order no longer dominated by the United States. - Reuters/Zac Anderson\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/06/22/us-iran-nuclear-trump-live-updates/84304617007/", "title": "Iran-US live updates: Trump floats regime change after strikes", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites for Sunday, June 22. For the latest news, view our story for Monday, June 23.\n\nThe United States went on high alert on June 22 over concerns of retaliation from Tehran after the bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites a day earlier.\n\nMajor U.S. cities from New York to Los Angeles stepped up their security as the weekend came to a close. Government agencies issued warnings to U.S. citizens at home and abroad. And with Mideast tensions heightened, all eyes stayed glued to Iran and its response.\n\nFrom the Department of Homeland Security came notice in the United States of a \"heightened threat environment.\" Hours later, the State Department blasted out a “worldwide caution security alert” advising U.S. citizens overseas to exercise increased vigilance amid the ongoing Israel-Iran war.\n\nU.S. officials have heaped praise on the military operation conducted June 21, saying U.S. bombers shattered Iran's nuclear program in precision strikes − ones planned for weeks that involved 125 warplanes.\n\nWhile Israel hailed the strikes, many world leaders urged speedy de-escalation over fears of a widening Mideast conflict. Some lawmakers in the U.S. − including key progressives and rigid conservatives − questioned President Donald Trump's authority to launch the attack.\n\nFor his part, Trump wrote on social media that \"regime change\" may be needed in Iran just hours after Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was not aiming for a change in leadership in Tehran.\n\nPutin to meet with Iran's foreign minister in Moscow\n\nAs Tehran weighed its options, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi is expected to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday.\n\nThe Kremlin has a strategic partnership with Iran, but also close links with Israel. Speaking in Istanbul on Sunday, Araqchi said his country would consider all possible responses and there would be no return to diplomacy until it had retaliated.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry condemned the U.S. attacks, which it said had undermined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and warned of conflict spreading in the Middle East.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nIran's military warns US of heavy consequences for siding with Israel\n\nRecent hostile action by the United States expanded the scope of legitimate targets for Iran's armed forces, a spokesperson for its Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters said in a video shared on Monday.\n\nEbrahim Zolfaqari said the U.S. should expect heavy consequences for its actions.\n\n\"Mr. Trump, the gambler, you may start this war, but we will be the ones to end it,\" Zolfaqari said in English at the end of his recorded statement.-- Reuters\n\nTrump says he's open to regime change in Iran\n\nJust hours after Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States did not want “regime change” in Iran, President Donald Trump said that might be a desired outcome.\n\n“It’s not politically correct to use the term, “Regime Change,” but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on June 22 as Mideast tensions continued to escalate the day after the U.S. military bombed three Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nTrump's post signaling an openness to new leadership in Tehran followed Vance and Rubio appearing on the Sunday morning talk shows, arguing the U.S. focus was not on launching a war with Iran.\n\nIsrael carried out airstrikes on military infrastructure in western Iran\n\nThe Israeli military said on Monday that about 20 jets had conducted a wave of strikes against military targets in western Iran and Tehran overnight.\n\n⁠In Kermanshah, in western Iran, missile and radar infrastructure was targeted, and in Tehran a surface-to-air missile launcher was struck, the Israeli military said, Reuters reported. The Israeli military added that a missile launched from Iran in the early hours of Monday was intercepted by Israeli defenses.\n\n--Reuters\n\nHow attacks unfolded: Visual details of US bombing in Iran\n\nJapan calls for de-escalation of Iran conflict\n\nJapan called on June 23 for de-escalation of the conflict in Iran and said U.S. strikes demonstrated Washington's determination to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nJapan also said it was \"extremely regrettable\" the situation between Israel and Iran had escalated into a cycle of retaliation, according to Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya.\n\n\"Japan continues to strongly hope that the path to dialogue will be reopened by efforts toward a resolution of Iran's nuclear issue through talks between the U.S. and Iran,\" Iwaya said in a statement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the U.S. had \"obliterated\" Tehran's key nuclear sites, joining Israel in the biggest Western military action against the Islamic Republic since its 1979 revolution.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba earlier this month condemned Israel's military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities, saying deployment for military use \"cannot be absolutely condemned.\"\n\n-- Reuters\n\nTrump to meet with his national security team\n\nPresident Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with his national security team in the Oval Office at 1 p.m. on June 23, according to the White House.

A now-defunct panel of experts monitoring U.N. sanctions said in 2021 that the two countries had resumed cooperation on long-range missile development projects, including the transfer of critical parts.\n\n\"Pyongyang could provide important assistance in helping Iran reconstitute destroyed missile production facilities, including at new sites to avoid scrutiny, perhaps,\" said Ankit Panda, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhether either country would be interested in substantively cooperating on any efforts to rebuild or accelerate Iran's nuclear weapons program is less certain, given the political and military sensitivities over such technology, Panda said.\n\n-- Reuters\n\n'Bullseye!!!': Trump again says Iran’s nuclear sites have been ‘obliterated’\n\nPresident Donald Trump doubled down on his assertion that Iranian nuclear sites had been obliterated by U.S. bombardments a day after the attacks amid the ongoing Israel-Iran war.\n\n“Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran, as shown by satellite images,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on June 22. “Obliteration is an accurate term! The white structure shown is deeply imbedded into the rock, with even its roof well below ground level, and completely shielded from flame.”\n\nExperts have raised questions about the extent to which recent Israeli and U.S. strikes have thwarted Iran's nuclear program. But that hasn’t given pause to Trump’s assessment of the damage.\n\n“The biggest damage took place far below ground level,” wrote Trump. “Bullseye!!!”\n\n-- Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nOil hits five-month high after US strikes key Iranian nuclear sites\n\nOil prices jumped on June 23, local time, to their highest since January as Washington's weekend move to join Israel in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities stoked supply worries.\n\nBrent crude futures rose $1.88 or 2.44% at $78.89 a barrel as of 11:22 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude advanced $1.87 or 2.53% at $75.71.\n\nBoth contracts jumped by more than 3% earlier in the session to $81.40 and $78.40, respectively, five-month highs, before giving up some gains.\n\nThe rise in prices came after President Donald Trump said he had \"obliterated\" Iran's main nuclear sites in strikes over the weekend, joining an Israeli assault in an escalation of conflict in the Middle East as Tehran vowed to defend itself.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nState Department issues worldwide caution alert and travel advisory\n\nThe State Department issued a “worldwide caution security alert” advising U.S. citizens overseas to exercise increased vigilance on June 22, amid the ongoing Israel-Iran war.\n\nThe department cited periodic closure of airspace across the Middle East and the potential for “demonstrations against U.S. citizens and interests abroad.”\n\nTravel advisories with threat levels ranging from levels 1 (exercise normal precautions) to 4 (do not travel) by country are listed in a searchable database online on the department’s website: Worldwide Caution - United States Department of State.\n\nPortugal, for example, has been designated Level 1; France is Level 2 (exercise increased caution) and Lebanon is Level 4.\n\n-- Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nAustralia says it supports US strike, calls for return to diplomacy\n\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on June 23 that Canberra supported the United States strike on Iran and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy.\n\n\"We support action that the U.S. has taken to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,\" Wong said in a television interview.\n\nIn a series of interviews, Wong said the strike was a unilateral action by its security ally the United States, and Australia was joining calls from Britain and other countries for Iran to return to the negotiating table.\n\n\"We do not want to see escalation,\" she told reporters in Canberra.\n\nThere are around 2,900 Australians in Iran and 1,300 in Iraq who are seeking to leave.\n\nMeanwhile, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said on June 22 he was examining the evidence surrounding Iran's nuclear enrichment program, while Prime Minister Christopher Luxon called for a return to dialogue, Radio New Zealand reported.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nLaw enforcement agencies on alert after US attacks on Iran\n\nSeveral law enforcement agencies across the United States are deploying additional forces to protect potential targets from retaliatory attacks.\n\nThe New York Police Department, the nation’s largest police department, said it issued an advisory and deployed more resources hours after the June 21 attack.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, we’re deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites across NYC and coordinating with our federal partners. We’ll continue to monitor for any potential impact to NYC,\" the police department said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass echoed a similar message regarding the city's police department.\n\n\"There are no known credible threats at this time and out of an abundance of caution, LAPD is stepping up patrols near places of worship, community gathering spaces and other sensitive sites,\" Bass said in a statement. \"We will remain vigilant in protecting our communities.\"\n\n-- Terry Collins\n\nTrump congratulates B-2 pilots upon landing in Missouri\n\nPresident Trump congratulated the group of B-2 Spirit stealth bomber pilots who returned to the U.S. after conducting airstrikes against three nuclear sites in Iran.\n\nThe B-2s departed from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri early on the morning of June 21 for the flight to Iran and returned in the early evening on June 22.\n\n\"The GREAT B-2 pilots have just landed, safely, in Missouri,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Thank you for a job well done!!! DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!\"In an earlier version of the same post, Trump misspelled his own name, calling himself “Donakd.” as he congratulated the pilots.\n\n- Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nUS leaders vow to 'defend ourselves' if Iran attacks\n\nU.S. leaders said earlier on June 22 that they remain ready to defend the country from any retaliatory actions from Iran.\n\n\"Our forces remain on high alert and are fully postured to respond to any Iranian retaliation or proxy attacks, which would be an incredibly poor choice. We will defend ourselves. The safety of our service members and civilians remains our highest priority,\" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said at a Pentagon briefing.\n\nArmy Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, has elevated force protection measures in the region, Caine said, “especially in Iraq, Syria and the Gulf.” There are about 40,000 U.S. troops in the region.\n\nIran strikes raise concerns about oil prices\n\nInvestors are bracing for higher oil prices after the U.S. bombed Iran’s nuclear facilities over the weekend. Brent crude oil, which is the global benchmark, closed at $77 a barrel on June 20, up about 10% over the previous week as Iran and Israel traded attacks. That’s the highest since January.\n\nOil trading begins at 11 p.m. UK time on June 22, and prices are likely to jump at the open, but then stabilize relatively quickly until it becomes more clear that there is a sustained supply shock, said oil analyst Rachel Ziemba in an interview.\n\nIran produces less than 5% of the world’s oil supply, and almost all of that is exported to China illicitly, said Ziemba, who runs Ziemba Insights. Analysts are more concerned about the country’s ability to choke off the Strait of Hormuz, a possibility Ziemba calls “low probability, high risk.”\n\nStill, energy investors will struggle to price in that risk, which could make oil prices more volatile over the coming days and weeks, she said.\n\n− Andrea Riquier\n\nNot what 'MAGA wanted to hear': Tensions within GOP remain about Trump's Iran strike\n\nUS officials say Iran's nuke program is 'obliterated.' But is it?\n\nTrump and his defense chief say American warplanes completely \"obliterated\" Iran's three major nuclear complexes at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan using bunker-busting bombs that have the ability to penetrate underground targets.\n\nWhile that may be the case, there has so far been no independent assessment of that assertion from nuclear watchdogs, international officials or others with direct information of the situation on the ground. And other U.S. officials have not used such definitive rhetoric.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the main agency that assesses the scale and evolution of Iran's nuclear program, said hostilities would need to cease for it to resume inspections. The organization, housed within the United Nations, said it would hold an emergency meeting on June 23.\n\nThe IAEA did say June 22 that craters were visible at the Fordow site, Iran’s main location for enriching uranium But said: \"At this time, no one - including the IAEA - is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow.\" Read more here.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nIran almost certainly will retaliate: But when, where and how?\n\nEuropean leaders react to US strikes: We urge Iran to negotiate\n\nThe leaders of the UK, France and Germany said in a joint statement June 22 that they would continue their diplomatic efforts to try and defuse tensions and ensure conflict does not spread further. They urged Iran not to take any actions that would further destabilize the region and called for the country to negotiate to address concerns with the nuclear program.\n\n\"We have consistently been clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon and can no longer pose a threat to regional security,\" the government heads of the three countries said.\n\nMidnight Hammer operation uses 'bunker busters,' a first in US history\n\nThe U.S. used more than a dozen multi-million-dollar, 30,000-pound \"bunker busters\" to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities in the strike, marking the weapon's first operational use, according to the Pentagon.\n\nU.S. bomber planes dropped 14 of the massive bombs on three of Iran's nuclear facilities, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine told reporters.\n\nThe bombs used in the strikes, called Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs, weigh 30,000 pounds each and cost millions to produce. MOPs, also known as the Guided Bomb Unit, or GBU-57, are GPS-guided weapons designed to burrow deep into underground targets, like fortified tunnels or bunkers. The bombs are about 20 feet long and span 6 feet at their widest point.\n\nWhile Israel has bunker-busters a fraction of its weight, only the MOP has the capability to destroy or severely damage Iran's nuclear facilities, experts previously told USA TODAY.\n\nIran government might close Strait of Hormuz, a major oil route\n\nThe Iranian parliament backed a measure to close the Strait of Hormuz following the U.S. strikes on the country, but the final decision will rest with Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Iran's Press TV reported June 22.\n\nAbout 20% of global oil and gas flow through the strait, which lies between Oman and Iran, and its closure could mean rising fuel prices for American consumers. The strait is 21 miles at its narrowest point, and the shipping lane is 2 miles wide in either direction.\n\nAsked whether Tehran would close Hormuz, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi didn't give a straight answer, saying: \"A variety of options are available to Iran.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio criticized any decision to block the narrow channel between Iran and Oman.\n\n“That would be a suicidal move on their part, because I think the whole world would come against them if they did that,” Rubio said in an interview with CBS.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar and Reuters\n\nLawmakers push back on Trump’s strikes under War Powers Act\n\nTrump’s ordered airstrikes have attracted criticism from both sides of the political aisle, and some lawmakers are charging that the president did not have the authority to call for the attack.\n\n“Our framers did not believe in the old way that a king could order a nation to war,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, said in an interview on Fox News Sunday. “Instead, the framers gave the power to Congress so we would have a debate in front of all the American public whose sons’ and daughters’ lives could potentially be at risk.”\n\nThe Constitution puts the power to declare war in Congress' hands, and the War Powers Resolution of 1973 mandates that the president notifies Congress within 48 hours of military action. The law also limits the deployment of armed forces beyond 90 days, in the absence of a formal declaration of war.\n\nKaine has introduced a resolution in the Senate seeking to block Trump’s actions in Iran. In the House, Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, have filed a similar measure based on the War Powers Act.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\n'We're not at war' with Iran, Vance insists\n\nVice President JD Vance argued in interviews on June 22 that the U.S. is not entering an open-ended conflict in the Middle East. “We’re not at war with Iran. We’re at war with Iran’s nuclear program.” Vance told NBC’s Kristen Welker.\n\n“We do not want war with Iran,” Vance added while on Meet The Press. “We actually want peace. But we want peace in the context of them not having a nuclear weapons program.”\n\nSeparately, on ABC, Vance described the strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran as “targeted.” The Pentagon’s attack on Iran’s nuclear facility employed its most powerful bunker-buster bomb as well as Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from submarines, according to Pentagon officials.\n\nPentagon planners coordinated the attack with Israel to enter Iran’s airspace, said the official who had been briefed on the mission but was not authorized to speak publicly. B-2 bombers dropped GBU-57 bunker-buster bombs, the first time they have been used in combat.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar and Francesca Chambers\n\nOperation Midnight Hammer used sophisticated weapons\n\nThe U.S. attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, called Operation Midnight Hammer, differs in character, scope and destructive power from those that Trump ordered in his first administration.\n\nThose missions included a missile attack in Syria to punish Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons, the raid to kill ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and the drone that killed Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian who led its Quds force.\n\nThe Iranian attacks on Saturday involved some of the most sophisticated weapons in the Pentagon’s arsenal and tapped into its commands overseeing operations from the Middle East to outer space, Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Sunday.\n\nIt took weeks to plan the Saturday attack, which involved 125 warplanes − including nearly one-third of its most sophisticated stealth bomber fleet – and submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles.\n\nInside the attack: Details revealed of secret US mission to bomb Iran\n\nStrikes weren't aimed at Iran regime change, US officials say\n\nThe goal of the U.S. strikes on Iran was not to prompt a regime change, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during the news briefing on the morning of June 22.\n\n\"This mission was not, has not been about regime change,\" Hegseth said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hasn't denied that an Iran regime change is part of Israel's military objectives, however.\n\n\"It could certainly be the result because the Iran regime is very weak,\" Netanyahu said in an interview on Fox News' \"Special Report With Bret Baier\" a week ago. \"I think it's basically left with two things. Its plans to have atomic bombs and ballistic missiles. That's basically what Iran has. They certainly don't have the people. Eighty percent of the people would throw these theological thugs out.\"\n\nNuclear energy head fears Mideast dynamic has changed\n\nThe head of an international agency that encourages the peaceful use of nuclear technology said June 22 that the U.S. decision to bomb Iran has completely reset what was once slowly simmering tensions between Iran and Israel.\n\n“This changes the whole dynamic,” Rafel Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview on CNN.\n\nGrossi said Iran’s current governmental regime, which has been in place since 1979, has been one of the few stabilizing forces in an otherwise “very very unstable” international scene.”\n\n“I think the unraveling of the nonproliferation regime would be a tremendously serious consequence,” he said. “I think that now we need to try to go back to the negotiating table as soon as possible.”\n\n-- Erin Mansfield\n\nIsraeli president says US involvement in Iran is Trump’s decision\n\nThe president of Israel said on June 22 that the United States is acting in its interests and declined to say whether Israel would need additional resources.\n\n“We are not dragging America into a war, and we are leaving aid to the decision of the president of the United States and to the team,” Isaac Herzog said in an interview on CNN.\n\nHerzog said the U.S. decision to bomb Iran was made “because the Iranian nuclear program was (a) clear and present danger to the security interests of the free world, and the United States is the leader of the free world.”\n\n-- Erin Mansfield\n\nWas Iran's nuclear material really 'obliterated'?\n\nTrump and his top defense official, Hegseth, say U.S. bombers completely \"obliterated\" Iran's three major nuclear complexes at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.\n\nThat may turn out to be the case, though there has so far been no independent assessment of that assertion from nuclear watchdogs, international officials or others with direct information of the situation on the ground. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the main window for how the world assesses the scale and evolution of Iran's nuclear program, has not commented.\n\nAll wars are information wars, as well as ones fought with conventional weapons. One example: Iran's IRIB state broadcaster claimed that its stockpiles of enriched uranium were \"evacuated\" from all three sites before the U.S. strikes, another assertion that has not been independently verified.\n\nHegseth: Trump seeks peace, urges Iran to do the same\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth lauded the U.S. strikes on Iran as an \"incredible and overwhelming success.\"\n\nThe strikes did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people, Hegseth said. Trump \"seeks peace, and Iran should take that path,\" Hegseth said.\n\nHe noted that fighter pilots and sailors aboard ships and submarines joined the attack.\n\nUS: All 3 nuke sites sustained 'severe damage'\n\nCaine said the U.S. was \"currently unaware of any shots fired at the U.S. strike package on the way in.\"\n\nThe three nuclear targets were struck from 6:40 p.m. to 7:10 p.m. ET, Caine said. He said the U.S. was also unaware of any shots fired on the way out of Iran.\n\nAll three nuclear sites \"sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" initial assessments indicate, Caine said.\n\nPope Leo urges peace, international diplomacy\n\nIn a weekly prayer on Sunday, Pope Leo XIV, the Catholic Church's first pope from the United States, called for diplomacy and peace efforts, not \"violence and bloody conflicts,\" shortly after the U.S.' military action against Iran.\n\n\"Every member of the international community has a moral responsibility: to stop the tragedy of war before it becomes an irreparable abyss,\" Leo said.\n\n\"In this dramatic scenario, which includes Israel and Palestine, the daily suffering of the population, especially in Gaza and other territories, risks being forgotten, where the need for adequate humanitarian support is becoming increasingly urgent,\" he said.\n\nIranians disconnected from world\n\nIranians have been intermittently cut off from the world since the start of Israel's air war on its military and nuclear sites more than a week ago, now joined by the United States.\n\nIran's government has imposed a near countrywide internet blackout in recent days, saying it was necessary to prevent Israeli cyberattacks and for unspecified security reasons, though some residents have reported the shutdown's efficacy has varied and sometimes they were able to get online. There have also been reported disruptions to cellphone text messages in Iran.\n\nOn June 22, NetBlocks, an organization that monitors global Internet access, reported that connectivity in Iran \"again collapsed\" in the hours before the U.S. strikes. NetBlocks also reported that Trump's Truth Social platform was \"experiencing international outages for many users,\" a scenario it said was not related to \"country-level Internet disruptions or filtering.\"\n\nUN watchdog to hold emergency meeting\n\nThe United Nations' nuclear watchdog will hold an emergency meeting in Vienna on Monday following the U.S. attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, created in 1957 amid growing concern over nuclear weapons, called for an end to \"hostilities\" so that it can continue inspections in Iran.\n\n\"In view of the increasingly serious situation in terms of nuclear safety and security, the Board of Governors will meet in an extraordinary session tomorrow, which I will address,” Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said.\n\nThe sites targeted by the U.S. strikes contained nuclear material in the form of uranium enriched to different levels, the IAEA said, according to its most recent information before Israel's strikes on Iran on June 13. The material \"may cause radioactive and chemical contamination within the facilities that were hit,\" the IAEA said. Grossi said no health impacts outside the targeted sites are expected after the U.S. strikes.\n\n“I have repeatedly stated that nuclear facilities should never be attacked,” Grossi said.\n\nWorld reacts to US bombing of Iran\n\nIsrael hailed the United States' decision to bomb three Iranian nuclear sites as an action that would \"deny the world's most dangerous regime the world's most dangerous weapons.\"\n\nElsewhere around the world the reaction was far more constrained. The United Nations and some leaders from Britain to Mexico called for swift de-escalation while other longtime U.S. adversaries such as Cuba and Venezuela were deeply critical of the attacks.\n\n\"There is a growing risk that this conflict could rapidly get out of control − with catastrophic consequences for civilians, the region and the world,\" U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. Guterres said he was \"gravely alarmed\" by the use of U.S. force on Iran.\n\nRussia, China condemn US attacks on Iran\n\nRussia and China on Sunday condemned the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, the countries' foreign ministries said.\n\n\"The irresponsible decision to subject the territory of a sovereign state to missile and bomb attacks, whatever the arguments it may be presented with, flagrantly violates international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council,\" the Russian foreign ministry said in its statement. \"We call for an end to aggression and for increased efforts to create conditions for returning the situation to a political and diplomatic track.\"\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, launching a drawn-out conflict that is ongoing over three years later. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, recently suggested that the \"whole of Ukraine\" belongs to his country, even though Russia only controls about a fifth of Ukrainian territory.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said the move violates the United Nations Charter and would worsen tensions in the Middle East. The ministry urged an end to attacks for all parties to the conflict, particularly Israel.\n\nWhat we know about the US strikes on Iran\n\nTrump ordered the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, effectively joining a war that Israel started on June 13 when it started bombing Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure. One of the U.S. targets was Fordow, a uranium enrichment facility hidden deep inside a remote mountain in the desert.\n\nNuclear sites at Natanz and Isfahan were also struck. Israel said it helped the U.S. coordinate and plan the strikes.\n\nTrump said all three sites were \"totally obliterated\" but an independent assessment has not yet been carried out. The International Atomic Energy Agency − the United Nation's nuclear watchdog − released a statement saying that so far it had not detected an increase in \"off-site radiation levels,\" one of the feared consequences of the strikes.\n\nWhat will Iran do now?\n\nIran's next move is being closely watched. The country has already ramped up its rhetoric.\n\n\"Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said. Ahead of the U.S. strikes, Tehran signaled that if the Pentagon were to join Israel's war U.S. military bases and Navy ships in the region could be attacked.\n\nIran has a large arsenal of drones and ballistic missiles. It has been using these on Israel for days. It launched a fresh wave of missiles toward Israel hours after the U.S. bombing started. Iran might even opt for a diplomatic route, which Trump was encouraging before authorizing the U.S. attack.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/04/19/trump-peace-talks-russia-ukraine-war/83166114007/", "title": "Trump weighs end to peace negotiations in Russia's war on Ukraine", "text": "WASHINGTON – With talks stalling, President Donald Trump is weighing whether to abandon his efforts to achieve a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe president has grown increasingly frustrated as negotiations have dragged out and is nearing his limit, three sources familiar with the situation said. They spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to speak on the record.\n\nTrump famously promised during his White House campaign to end the war in one day. He then gave himself a longer timeline, saying in January that he expected a deal within six months. His special envoy to Ukraine set a goal of negotiating an agreement even quicker during the first 100 days of Trump's term.\n\nBut a month after Russian President Vladimir Putin effectively rejected a U.S.-proposed unconditional ceasefire, which Ukraine accepted, in favor of a narrow agreement on energy infrastructure, Trump has determined that a peace deal may not be possible and could instruct his administration to pull out of talks.\n\n“My whole life has been one big negotiation, and I know when people are playing us, and I know when they’re not, and I have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it,” Trump said Friday. “And I think I see that enthusiasm to want to end it. ... I think I see it from both sides.”\n\nThe president had indicated a week earlier, as he spoke to reporters on Air Force One, that his administration would not hold endless rounds of talks. “There’s a point at which you have to either put up or shut up,” Trump said April 12.\n\nAnd after a trip to Paris on April 18, where U.S. negotiators met with Europeans and representatives from Ukraine, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Trump was likely to move on within days if no real progress toward peace was made.\n\n“We’ve dedicated the – almost the entirety of the president’s first hundred days in office at the highest levels possible to trying to achieve a peace here,” Rubio said. “And if it’s going to happen, we want to help. But if it’s not going to happen, we need to know now because we have other things we have to deal with.”\n\nA White House official not authorized to speak on the record told USA TODAY that Trump’s domestic priorities would be a factor in the decision: The president is more likely to pull his team back if he feels the negotiations are getting in the way of his domestic policy agenda.\n\nIn the Oval Office after Rubio's remarks, Trump would not say whether he was prepared to walk away.\n\nBut he affirmed Rubio’s comments and said that if “for some reason” one of the countries makes it very difficult, “we’re just going to say 'You’re foolish, you’re fools, you’re horrible people, and we’re going to just take a pass.'”\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Poland Daniel Fried said it was not clear from Rubio’s remarks what moving on from peace talks would entail.\n\n“What does walk away mean? Walk away from Ukraine? Pull our support? Leave Ukraine to the mercy of the Russians?” said Fried, a fellow at the Atlantic Council. “Or does it mean walk away from the talks and then decide to put more pressure on Putin and more military support for Ukraine? His language could be interpreted either way.”\n\nThe administration also has not said publicly whether it would allow Ukraine to purchase weapons from the United States under such a scenario.\n\nTrump has threatened additional sanctions on Russia and secondary tariffs on its oil exports if Moscow refuses to engage in the peace process, but he has held off as Steve Witkoff, his special envoy to Russia, has met privately with Putin.\n\nRetired U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, a former director for transnational threats at the National Security Council, said Russia has not been committed to the process because it has not felt enough pain from the United States.\n\n“There is a 0 degrees Kelvin chance that Putin is going to enter into a deal without a maximum level of pressure applied to him, whether it's by sanctions, by increased military support, whatever,” Montgomery said. “Those are the kind of things that will move Vladimir Putin.”\n\nU.S. presents peace framework\n\nUkraine accepted the temporary ceasefire proposal the United States put forward on March 11. The two sides then agreed in principle to a ceasefire on energy that was never fully implemented amid disputes over the terms. A halt in fighting in the Black Sea did not go forward after Russia said it wanted sanctions lifted on its some of its financial institutions to implement a maritime deal.\n\nWith the prospects of a ceasefire dimming, the United States said it presented a framework peace agreement this week to Russia, Ukraine and Europe. The administration has not made the document public.\n\nIn an interview that The Times of London published before the announcement, Trump special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg suggested the country could “look like what happened with Berlin,” with British, French and other troops serving as a “reassurance force” in the western part of the country.\n\nUkrainian troops could patrol an 18-mile demilitarized zone, he said, that would separate the western part of the country, which is under Ukraine’s control, from territory in the east now occupied by Russia.\n\nHe said later on social media that he was discussing zones of responsibility for allied forces to patrol, without U.S. troops, after a ceasefire and was not referring to a partitioning Ukraine.\n\nRubio told reporters as he left Paris that the blueprint the U.S. presented was broad and did not get into the specifics of potential security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\nUkraine’s delegation, which included President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s top adviser, is taking the framework back to Kyiv, he said. Rubio said he spoke to his Russian counterpart, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, on the phone on Thursday.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the negotiations “fairly complex” after Rubio's remarks and said: “Russia is striving toward resolving this conflict, securing its own interests, and is open to dialogue. We are continuing to do this.\"\n\nTrump slammed Zelenskyy before the Paris talks for requesting air defense systems from the United States and suggested again that the Ukrainian leader had started the war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\n“I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job,” Trump said as he as met with Italy’s prime minister at the White House later in the week. “I’m not a big fan.”\n\nTrump told NBC he was “pissed off” at Putin at the end of March. He also told reporters he set a “psychological deadline” for Putin to agree to a ceasefire. As Witkoff prepared to meet with Putin in St. Petersburg, Trump said in a social media post April 11 that Russia had to “get moving” on negotiations to end the war.\n\nBrian Taylor, a professor at Syracuse University and author of the book “The Code of Putinism,” said the positions of Moscow and Kyiv are still “extremely far apart” as Russia fights to subjugate and control Ukraine. Leaders of Ukraine, meanwhile, are pushing to maintain independence and sovereignty.\n\nHe noted that in early April, Putin sent his foreign investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, to meet with Witkoff in Washington.\n\n“Putin isn't really interested in a deal at this moment, but he is trying very hard to shift the blame for the lack of a deal onto Zelenskyy and Ukraine and also to entice Trump with this whole parallel line of discussions about the broader U.S.-Russia relationship.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/19"}]}

For sites like Netflix, Spotify, Pinterest and Buzzfeed, as well as tens of thousands of smaller sites, it provides cloud-based storage and web services for companies so they don’t have to build their own server farms, allowing them to rapidly deploy computing power without having to invest in infrastructure.\n\nFor example, a business might store its videos, images or databases on an AWS server and access it via the Internet.\n\nWhile not all AWS clients were affected by the outage at one of AWS's main storage systems, some experienced slowdowns, after a big portion of its S3 system went offline Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAmazon wasn't able to update its own service health dashboard for the first two hours of the outage because the dashboard itself was hosted on AWS.\n\n\"This is a pretty big outage,\" said Dave Bartoletti, a cloud analyst with Forrester. \"AWS had not had a lot of outages and when they happen, they're famous. People still talk about the one in September of 2015 that lasted five hours,\" he said.\n\nThe S3 system is used by 148,213 sites according to market research firm SimilarTech. It has \"north of three to four trillion pieces of data stored in it,\" Bartoletti said.\n\nThe outage appeared to have begun around 12:35 pm ET, according to Catchpoint Systems, a digital experience monitoring company. Operations were fully recovered by 4:49 pm ET, Amazon said. The Seattle-based company did not comment on the cause of the outage.\n\nThe most common causes of this type of outage are software related, said Lydia Leong, a cloud analyst with Gartner. \"Either a bug in the code or human error. Right now we don't know what it was.\"\n\nThe system that went down was the first of what now are three AWS regions in the United States. It is still the largest and is also where AWS rolls out new features, \"so it's disproportionately big,\" she said.\n\nAWS began as a profitable sideline to Amazon’s main online sales business but has since grown to become the major player in the arena as well as a major money-maker in its own right for Amazon. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the division accounted for 8% of Amazon’s total revenue.\n\nMORE:\n\nCloud warriors led by Amazon, Microsoft battle for $300B in spoils\n\nAmazon, Netflix elbow into Oscars with 4 wins\n\nCoolest tech to see at Barcelona's Mobile World Congress\n\nAWS S3 is used by businesses both large and small. “More than anything else, S3 customers need to be able to get at their data, because often S3 is used to store images. So no S3, no nice picture or fancy logo on your website,” said Leong.\n\nAlabama bamboo site\n\nThat was exactly the problem faced by Lewis Bamboo, a small, family-owned bamboo nursery in Oakman, Alabama.\n\n“As our business is in bamboo plants, pictures are a very important part of selling our product online. We use Amazon S3 to store and distribute our website images. When Amazon’s servers went down, so did the majority of our website,” said the company's chief technology officer Daniel Mullaly.\n\n“Thankfully we also store the images locally and I was able to serve the images directly from our server instead,” he said.\n\nThe effects of the outage varied depending on the site and how it used AWS. Modern websites usually pull data from multiple databases in the cloud that can be stored all over the world, so a photo might come from one place, a price list from another and a customer database from a third.\n\nFor that reason, entire websites rarely go down but various part of them may take a long time to load or not load at all, leaving broken links or images.\n\nCompanies have been steadily moving storage to the cloud because it is cheaper, easily accessible and more resilient. But the downside is that when there are problems, there's a cascade effect.\n\nIt's possible to contract with multiple companies to avoid potential problems, but that strategy is pricey, so many companies make peace with the knowledge that on rare occasions they're going to have a very bad day.\n\n\"Only the most paranoid, and very large companies, distribute their files across not just AWS but also Microsoft and Google, and replicate them geographically across regions — but that's very, very expensive,\" Gartner's Leong said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/06/08/fastly-outage-many-websites-disrupted-outage-internet-cloud-services-company/7598277002/", "title": "Internet outage: Many websites disrupted by issue at cloud company ...", "text": "Associated Press\n\nLONDON — Multiple major websites went offline briefly Tuesday after an apparent outage at the cloud service company Fastly, and there were still reports of sporadic disruptions after the company patched the problem about an hour later.\n\nDozens of sites including the New York Times, CNN, Twitch, Reddit, the Guardian, and the U.K. government's home page, could not be reached.\n\nSan Francisco-based Fastly acknowledged a problem just before 1000 GMT.

Although a fix was deployed to restore most systems by the afternoon to return to normal, ripple effects may be felt throughout the weekend, experts warn.\n\nCrowdStrike, which advertises being used by over half of Fortune 500 companies, said one of its recent content updates had a defect that impacted Microsoft's Windows Operating System, adding the incident was \"not a security incident or cyberattack.\"\n\n\"Earlier today, a CrowdStrike update was responsible for bringing down a number of IT systems globally,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement on Friday afternoon. \"We are actively supporting customers to assist in their recovery.\"\n\nThe company's CEO, George Kurtz, apologized for the disruptions in a post on X, noting the issue has been identified and isolated and a fix has been deployed. CrowdStrike is \"working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.\" Meanwhile, Microsoft said, \"the underlying cause has been fixed\" and impacted Microsoft 365 apps and services have been recovered, though the company continues to monitor the issue.\n\nKurtz went on to warn in his statement, \"We know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this. I encourage everyone to remain vigilant and ensure that you’re engaging with official CrowdStrike representatives.\"\n\nIn the U.S., thousands of flights were canceled Friday morning. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines were among those who grounded flights less than an hour after Microsoft said it resolved a cloud-services-related outage that impacted several low-cost carriers.\n\n“Every line is long,” said Chance Ortego, 31, whose flight to New York was canceled Friday morning.\n\nPublic transit systems in the U.S. also reported temporary impacts, but for the most part, trains and buses were running as scheduled. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority in Washington, D.C., said its \"website and some of our internal systems are currently down,\" but trip-planning applications were later restored. In New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority also said some of its MTA customer information systems were temporarily offline until around 5:30 p.m.\n\nAround the world, the outages disrupted London's Stock Exchange, caused major train delays in the U.K., sent British broadcaster Sky News off air, forced medical facilities in Europe and the U.S. to cancel some services and caused disruptions at airports in Europe, Singapore, Hong Kong and India.\n\nWidespread economic impact from the outage is expected to be small, even though many companies were still trying to resume full operations by the time the stock market closed.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾ More than 5,000 flights were canceled globally as of 3:30 p.m. Eastern, about 4.6% of all scheduled commercial flights for the day, according to aviation analytics company Cirium.\n\n◾ Some U.S. border crossings saw impacts amid the outage: Traffic stalled on the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Detroit with Windsor, Ontario, Canada, as well as at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, the Detroit Free Press reported. CBP One, the Customs and Border Patrol app, and the agency’s border wait times website, each appeared to experience outages.\n\n◾ U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, in the wake of the outage. CrowdStrike shares closed down 11.1% at $304.96, with analysts predicting the outage would cost the company money to fix and restore trust with its customers. It was the lowest close for the shares since May 2.

A post on X says a \"partial\" activation is for incidents that require \"significant monitoring or resources,\" with additional emergency operations staffing from other agencies, functions and supporting organizations.\n\n- Bailey Schulz\n\nWhat is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a popular cybersecurity software company created in 2012 by CEO George Kurtz, along with Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston.\n\nAccording to its website, CrowdStrike has the \"world's most advanced cloud-native platform that protects and enables the people, processes and technologies that drive modern enterprise.\"\n\nAlperovitch, CrowdStrike's former Chief Technology Officer, is a member of the Biden administration's Homeland Security Advisory Council, which is meant to provide advice and expertise to support decision-making \"across the spectrum of homeland security operations.\"\n\n-Gabe Hauari, Bailey Schulz\n\nWhat caused the CrowdStrike outage?\n\nAccording to an alert sent by CrowdStrike to its clients and reviewed by Reuters, the company's \"Falcon Sensor\" software caused Microsoft Windows to crash and display a blue screen, known informally as the \"Blue Screen of Death.\"\n\nKurtz said \"there was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts\" but customers “remain fully protected,” according to a post on X. He also reiterated that Friday's outage \"was not a security or cyber incident.\"\n\nAnne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, said she spoke to Kurtz Friday and confirmed the incident did not appear to be related to a cyber attack.\n\n“At this point, we believe that it is an IT-related patch, an issue with that patch,” she said while speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. \"I think they're determining what went wrong there.\"\n\n-Gabe Hauari, Bailey Schulz\n\n‘I’m just hoping to make it onto a flight’\n\nChance Ortego had reached the finish line of a nearly two-week work trip when he saw the news all air travelers dread: his flight was delayed.\n\nOrtego was in the AirTrain en route to his flight from San Francisco International Airport when he heard other travelers discussing the outage. After checking the status of his 7:05 a.m. Delta Air Lines flight to New York – which was pushed back nearly three hours – he rebooked another flight at 9:15 a.m.\n\nHe later learned his original flight had been canceled. Ortego was among the thousands of passengers around the world facing delays, cancellations and problems checking in as airports and airlines were caught up in a massive IT outage that grounded U.S. flights early Friday.\n\n“I was already planning to sleep,” said Ortego, who works in health care. “Now I'm just hoping to make it onto a flight.”\n\nInside the airport, there was more chaos than a typical travel day as airlines recovered from the outage. Many screens were blank except for an error message and airport personnel made announcements directing questions about flights to airlines.\n\nAll U.S. airlines issued travel waivers for those affected to easily rebook their plans. Those who opted to cancel can rest easy knowing the Department of Transportation classified the cancellations and delays as controllable, thus airlines are responsible for upholding the commitments they've made to customers when it comes to policies like rebooking or hotel and meal vouchers as the mess gets sorted out.\n\n- Nathan Diller\n\nImpact on the economy\n\nThe outage isn’t expected to have any effect on the broader economy unless it persists for days.\n\n“At this point, the IT outage is more a nuisance than an economic event,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “If it drags on into early next week, the economic damage will begin to mount.”\n\nIf the outage is limited to a day or two, canceled flights can be rebooked and banking transactions can be completed later.\n\n“There is plenty of time for activity to be recovered over the remainder of the month,” says Jonathan Miller, senior U.S. economist at Barclays.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nOutage impacts US public transit websites, ticketing\n\nMajor cities were generally able to keep trains and busses running, but tech issues have been causing problems with ticketing and other tech systems, leading to delays in some cases.\n\nThe Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported website and other tech issues, but said trains and buses were running as scheduled.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City reported problems with \"customer information systems\" but said it's buses and trains were unaffected. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it was not affected but urged riders who might be using public transit to any area airports to check with their airlines before traveling for updates.\n\nNew Jersey Transit said some of its ticketing machines may have been impacted but its buses and trains were, for the most part, running on time. Some trains were out of operation Friday due to repairs that had to be made because of the intense heat that blanketed the region all week.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported Friday morning that commuter rail lines were affected, though it noted traffic is typically lighter on Fridays than other days. Delays on some lines were as long as 45 minutes, the Tribune reported. Chicago Transit bus and rail service was not affected but some CTA customers were unable to add value to their payment cards via the app or machines overnight, but the issue has been resolved.\n\nSome transit systems, including Metro Transit in Minneapolis and Cincinnati Metro reported temporary disruptions to websites, trip planners, social media and other applications but no impact to its bus or trains.\n\n- Phaedra Trethan\n\nDespite summer break, schools disrupted by IT issues\n\nThe CrowdStrike outage crashed some computers at colleges Friday and hampered a popular software for enrolling students in K-12 schools for the fall.\n\nThe University of Rochester, a private school in New York, told students to keep rebooting their systems until the problem was fixed. The University of Alabama’s technology office said its campus computers using Microsoft Windows crashed. Rutgers University and the University of Kentucky also reported disruptions.\n\nDespite the summer break, K-12 schools in Maryland and Kansas said they were having problems with PowerSchool, a widely used software for grading and student enrollment. An update posted to the company’s webpage Friday morning said the outage was impacting all its major products, including its enrollment feature.\n\n- Zachary Schermele\n\n911 call centers disrupted\n\nState and local law enforcement agencies across the country reported disruptions to 911 services after the outage hit.\n\nNational reports of 911 outages peaked at more than 100 on Friday just before 3 a.m. according to Downdetector.\n\nAgencies in at least seven states reported temporary outages, including the St. Louis County Sheriff's Office and Faribault Police Department in Minnesota, 911 systems New Hampshire, Fulton County, Indiana, and Middletown, Ohio.\n\nNon-emergency and 911 calls to multiple dispatch centers in Alaska \"were not able to be answered\" for around seven hours overnight, Austin McDaniel, communications director for the Alaska Department of Public Safety, told USA TODAY in an email.\n\n\"Dispatch centers switched to analog phone systems or to partner dispatch centers that were not impacted to continue taking calls,\" he wrote. Systems in the state were back up as of 4:23 a.m. local time.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department was also impacted ‒ 911 call centers could take calls, but had to dispatch officers manually, the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission said in an email to USA TODAY that it was aware of reports of disruptions to 911.\n\n\"We’re closely working with other federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of these service disruptions.”\n\n- Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBiden briefed on global outage as federal agencies assess impacts\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with the cybersecurity firm, as well as with impacted companies and agencies, according to the White House. Biden will receive \"sector-by-sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,\" the White House added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it is working to \"fully assess and address system outages.\"\n\nDHS added it's working alongside the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as well as CrowdStrike, Microsoft and federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to get a grasp on the incident and its impacts.\n\nOver 2K US flights canceled amid outage\n\nSeveral U.S. carriers, including American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, issued ground stops for all their flights early on Friday due to communication problems, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe FAA said operations were no longer impacted as of 10:53 a.m. ET, but it continues to monitor the situation and warned the global IT issue could continue to affect flights this weekend.\n\nThere were more than 2,500 U.S. flights canceled and more than 7,900 delays as of 3:25 p.m. EDT, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nMost airlines were able to resume operations as the morning progressed, but many said they expected disruptions to continue throughout the day.\n\nRead more about the outage's travel impacts\n\nHospitals cancel nonemergency services\n\nHospitals across the U.S. and overseas were impacted by the outage, which forced some to cancel elective surgeries and halt visitations as well as outpatient services.\n\nMass General Brigham in Boston canceled previously scheduled nonurgent surgeries, procedures and medical visits, according to a statement sent to USA TODAY. In the same area, Tufts Medical Center told media outlet WHDH it’s still assessing the outage’s effect on clinical and surgical operations.\n\nIn Texas, Ben Taub Hospital and Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital suspended \"hospital visitation and patient information,\" citing a \"Microsoft Windows failure,\" according to a statement from Harris Health System. Cincinnati Children's Hospital said many of its Microsoft-based computer systems are down because of the outage, which forced the hospital to cancel early morning appointments.\n\n\"We are in touch with the hospital field and the federal government and monitoring the situation closely to better understand its scope and impact,\" said John Riggi, the American Hospital Association's national adviser for cybersecurity and risk.\n\nTwo hospitals in northern German cities canceled elective operations scheduled for Friday but continued to provide patient care and emergency services.\n\nOutages exposes fragility of internet infrastructure\n\nWhile there were reports of companies gradually restoring their services, analysts weighed the potential of what one called the biggest-ever outage in the industry and the broader economy.\n\n\"This is a very, very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world’s core Internet infrastructure,\" Ciaran Martin, Professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government and former head of the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre, told Reuters.\n\n\"IT security tools are all designed to ensure that companies can continue to operate in the worst-case scenario of a data breach, so to be the root cause of a global IT outage is an unmitigated disaster,\" said Ajay Unni, CEO of StickmanCyber, one of Australia's largest cybersecurity services companies.\n\n– Reuters\n\nOutages ripple far and wide\n\nFrom the United Kingdom to Singapore, the effects of tech outages were far-reaching on Friday.\n\nBritish broadcaster Sky News went off-air and train companies in the U.K. reported long delays. Departure boards at several U.K. airports appeared to freeze, according to passengers who posted reports on social media.\n\nLondon's Stock Exchange reported experiencing disruptions. Some hospitals also reported difficulties processing appointments and several chain retail stores said they couldn't take payments. The soccer club Manchester United said on X that it had to postpone a scheduled release of tickets.\n\nIn Australia, media, banks and telecoms companies suffered outages.\n\nThere was no information to suggest the outage was a cybersecurity incident, the office of Australia's National Cyber Security Coordinator Michelle McGuinness said in a post on X.\n\nNew York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority said some of its systems were offline due to a worldwide technical outage, but have since been restored. It said MTA train and bus services were unaffected.\n\nSpanish authorities reported a \"computer incident\" at all its airports.\n\nBerlin's main airport said check-ins were delayed because of a \"technical fault.\"\n\nRyanair, Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers, warned passengers of potential disruptions which it said would affect \"all airlines operating across the Network.\" It did not specify the nature of the disruptions.\n\nThere were reports a shipping terminal in Gdansk on Poland's Baltic coast was not operating normally.\n\nNetBlocks, a digital-connectivity watchdog, said that the outage reported by global airlines, corporates and infrastructure services firms and others was having \"minimal\" impact on global Internet connectivity.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2024/09/30/verizon-outage-michigan-detroit/75452567007/", "title": "Verizon: Phone outage for some users in Michigan is fixed", "text": "(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nThe mobile phone outage that affected Verizon customers in Michigan and nationwide on Monday, was fully restored and had returned to normal levels after being out for several hours, the company announced.\n\n\"If you are still having issues, we recommend restarting your device,\" Verizon said in an email to the Free Press just before 8 p.m. \"We know how much people rely on Verizon and apologize for any inconvenience.

Two of those servers ran some important systems for the whole East Coast region, such as the ones that let all those trillions of files be placed into customers' websites.\n\nTo get it back, both systems required a full restart, which takes a lot longer than simply rebooting your laptop.\n\nAll of this wasn't just affecting Amazon's S3 customers, it was also hitting other Amazon cloud customers as well — because it turns out those systems use S3, too.\n\nWhile Amazon says it designed its system to work even if big parts failed, it also acknowledged that it hadn't actually done a full restart on the main subsystems that went offline \"for many years.\"\n\nDuring that time, the S3 system had gotten a whole lot bigger, so restarting it, and doing all the safety checks to make sure its files hadn't gotten corrupted in the process, took much longer than expected.\n\nIt wasn't until 1:54 pm Pacific time, four hours and 17 minutes after the mistyped command was first entered, that the entire system was back up and running.\n\nTo make sure the problem doesn't happen again, Amazon has rewritten its software tools so its engineers can't make the same mistake, and it's doing safety checks elsewhere in the system.\n\nAmazon apologized to its customers for the event, saying it \"will do everything we can to learn from this event and use it to improve our availability even further.\"\n\nDoes Amazon control the Internet, or does it just feel that way?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2025/10/20/is-amazon-alexa-down-aws-outage/86804925007/", "title": "Is Amazon Alexa down?

A majority could not be mustered to stop her taking office by one vote.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nHer decision to step aside, however, “followed a turbulent series of events” that began when Sweden’s “Centre Party withdrew its support for Andersson’s budget, due to the concessions made to the Left” in order to form a coalition, The Local reported.\n\n“That meant the new PM’s budget didn’t have enough votes to pass in parliament”, meaning MPs “instead adopted an alternative budget” presented by the conservative Moderates, Christian Democrats and far-right Sweden Democrats”, the site added.\n\nAfter the Swedish parliament voted in favour of the opposition budget, the Greens then left Andersson’s coalition “in protest after parliament refused to back the government’s spending plans”, the Financial Times (FT) said.\n\n“There is a constitutional practice that a coalition government should resign when one party quits,” Andersson said after the Greens’ decision to withdraw from her governing group. “I don’t want to lead a government whose legitimacy will be questioned.”\n\nAndersson has said that she will “try to become prime minister again as a single party government leader”, the BBC reported, while the speaker of the Swedish parliament has already begun “contacting party leaders on the next move”.\n\nThe Greens have “said they would back Andersson as prime minister in the new vote”, paving a way forward for her to reclaim the premiership, “but it is unclear how other parties would react”, the FT added.\n\nNo confidence\n\nSweden has long been considered “a bastion of political stability”, with the Social Democrats coming “first in every election in more than a century”, the FT said. But it is “facing an extended period of political turmoil as a result of the rapid rise of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats”.\n\nThe party, which euronews said is “rooted in a neo-Nazi movement”, “first entered parliament in 2010” and “has broken up the traditional system of left-wing and right-wing blocs”, the FT added. This means that “new uneasy constellations are only starting to be formed”.\n\nStefan Lofven, Andersson’s predecessor as both prime minister and Social Democrat leader, in June became the first Swedish head of government to be forced to resign after a no-confidence vote.\n\nDubbed “the Harry Houdini of European politics” by Politico, Lofven successfully governed a number of historically weak coalition governments from 2014. But he faced criticism over his handling of the pandemic before the Left Party withdrew its support following the publication of a government report on removing rent controls.\n\nAndersson has “built a reputation for being direct and blunt”, The Guardian said, and was recently described by Swedish national broadcaster SVT as a “bulldozer”.\n\nAnders Lindberg, political editor of social democratic paper Aftonbladet, told the paper: “People even say they are scared of her which is kind of funny, these elite political scientists or professors of economics saying they are afraid of her.\n\n“She has a little bit of an Angela Merkel way of arguing. It’s not completely clear what she wants to say all the time, but [she] ends up winning the argument because no one else can really answer because she masters all the details.”\n\nShe “now faces the challenge of uniting the disparate parties – ranging from the ex-communists of the Left party to the nominally centre-right Centre party – which backed her in a new vote”, the FT said. The speaker of Sweden’s parliament is expected to lay out a timetable for forming a new governing bloc this afternoon.\n\nWriting on the BBC, Sweden-watcher Maddy Savage said that “if there’s another prime ministerial vote, Andersson will probably get voted in again” given that the Green Party “has promised to support her, despite quitting as a formal coalition partner”.\n\nBut she would be “in a vulnerable position at the helm of a fragile minority government”, meaning she would “have to stick to the right-wing budget already voted on by parliament.\n\n“What all this political chaos has underlined is just how divided Swedish politics is right now,” she added", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/11/25"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/957980/giorgia-meloni-who-is-italys-next-potential-prime-minister", "title": "Giorgia Meloni: who is Italy's new prime minister? | The Week", "text": "Italy’s first ever female prime minister has taken power after being sworn in as head of a coalition described as the country’s most right-wing government since that of Benito Mussolini.\n\nGiorgia Meloni and her Fratelli d’Italia (Brothers of Italy) party won last month’s election with 26% of the vote. Following weeks of negotiations, Meloni announced a new coalition government on Friday that includes Matteo Salvini’s far-right League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia.\n\nMeloni is the “first politician with a post-fascist lineage” to lead Italy since the end of the Second World War, said The New York Times (NYT), after winning power by reassuring her “hard-right base” that she “hasn’t changed” while seemingly convincing more moderate voters and “international sceptics” that she is “no extremist”.\n\nThe Week Escape your echo chamber.

She was raised by her mother after being “abandoned by her father, who sailed off to the Canary Islands”, said The Washington Post.\n\nMeloni’s mother, Anna, was a “right-winger who wrote romance novels”, the paper added, while her father, Francesco, was left-wing – prompting speculation that her choice of “political path was motivated in part by a desire to seek revenge on her absent father”, said the BBC.\n\nAged 15 she joined the neo-fascist Youth Front, part of the Italian Social Movement, before becoming student president of the National Alliance.

She has accused those “well-embedded in the nerve centres of power” of staging “a smear campaign” against her.\n\nYet Meloni is “adept at both courting and distancing herself from such extremists whenever it suits her”, wrote Jamie Mackay in The Guardian. She has celebrated “‘patriots’ and ‘the natural family’ while attacking ‘the LGBT lobby’ and ‘enemies of civilisation’”.\n\nThe Washington Post noted that the new PM has “avoided the pitfalls of nationalist figures elsewhere” during the Ukraine war, condemning Russia’s invasion and Vladimir Putin, while also voicing strong support for Nato. But though Meloni has pledged that Italy won’t take an “authoritarian turn”, the paper added, “those on the left have sounded the alarm” over her views on immigration, gay adoption and her close ties to anti-abortion groups.\n\nHer party’s “close relationship” with Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán is “particularly concerning”, wrote Mackay in The Guardian. Human rights groups are warning that she is “hoping to impose a similar authoritarian regime in Italy”.\n\nFor her allies, however, she represents “the radical political shift that Italy needs”, said the BBC.\n\nHow will she govern?\n\nThe “flipside” of Italy’s recent “executive instability” has been the “resilience of the country’s democracy”, wrote Rosa Balfour, director of the Carnegie Europe think tank, in the Financial Times. A right-wing coalition government led by Meloni that holds a small majority will not be “able to do serious damage to Italy’s laws and society”, Balfour continued. However, the economy “hangs in the balance”.\n\n“Shielding households from rising inflation and the surge in energy prices brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are among the prime minister’s most pressing tasks,” said The Guardian’s Rome correspondent Angela Giuffrida. Meloni is “significantly short of the financial resources required to fulfil election campaign resources”.\n\nThe new PM also faces the challenge of balancing Italy’s relations with the EU while managing her party’s nationalist tendencies.\n\nThe Financial Times predicted that “her government’s relationship with Brussels will be a litmus test of the credibility of Italy’s right-wing and the EU’s solidity” at a time when Europe is likewise “grappling with the repercussions of Russia’s war in Ukraine and worried about the risk of recession”.\n\nBack at home, “her coalition appears united”, said the BBC’s Paul Kirby, “but that unity may not last”. According to Kirby, “Forza Italia in particular could become an awkward ally, with veteran ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi consigned to little more than a walk-on part”.\n\nGiven those tensions, Mackay wrote in The Guardian, the coalition could “break down even sooner than the average 13-month Italian government”. But “however short-lived”, the economic and social consequences of a Meloni administration may still be “terrible”.", "authors": ["Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/10/28/nepals-parliament-elects-nations-first-female-president/74744860/", "title": "Nepal's parliament elects nation's first female president", "text": "BINAJ GURUBACHARYA\n\nAssociated Press\n\nKATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Nepalese lawmakers elected a longtime women's rights campaigner to become the country's first female president Wednesday, as the Himalayan nation pushes for more gender equality in politics and work life.\n\nBidhya Devi Bhandari, the 54-year-old deputy leader of Nepal's Communist Party ofNepal Unified Marxist-Leninist, had lobbied actively for the new constitution to require that either the president or vice president be a woman.\n\nNepal has been trying to shift from a traditionally male-dominated society, where women are mostly limited to working at homes or on farms, to one in which women have equal access to opportunities and legal rights.\n\nLawmakers cheered as Bhandari's name was announced as the new president.

Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed is the longest-serving female leader of any country, at 19 years.\n\nThe UK has had three female PMs: Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May and Truss. All three resigned following challenges from within their own party.\n\nCurrent female presidents include Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-wen, Nepal’s Bidhya Devi Bhandari, Xiomara Castro in Honduras and Peru’s Dina Boluarte, who replaced the impeached Pedro Castillo in December.\n\nDespite Ardern’s recent resignation, New Zealand has achieved gender equality at the highest level of government, with 10 women sitting with 10 men in cabinet. Parity was reached with the appointment of Willow-Jean Prime as conservation minister by Prime Minister Chris Hipkins.\n\nUN Women reported that while gender quotas in parliaments have helped to increase the numbers of female lawmakers, only 13 countries were at “gender parity”. At the current rate, said the agency, gender equality in power will not be reached “for another 130 years”.\n\nNot designed for women\n\nLooking at the data, “it’s little wonder” that so many female leaders are quitting, wrote Susan Armstrong for euronews. The workplace in general “often isn’t designed for women” and staying in top jobs “takes a massive toll – in time, emotional labour, and physical labour”.\n\n“As the viral quote goes, ‘Women are expected to work like they don’t have families, and parent like they don’t have jobs,’” Armstrong added.\n\nIn a survey by the Fawcett Society of of female MPs in the UK, 93% said that online abuse or harassment had a negative impact on how they felt about holding their role.\n\nNew Zealand’s Ardern said she no longer had “enough in the tank” when she quit, after experiencing violent threats over her stance on lockdown and Covid vaccinations.

I responded with 20 bottles of Lambrusco and a similarly sweet letter.” None of which should surprise us, said Claudio Tito in La Repubblica (Rome). The former prime minister has long been close to Putin, and the Italian Right as a whole is increasingly “polluted by the Kremlin”. Salvini, for example is “constantly recalling his relations with Russia”, and rarely misses a chance to defend Moscow. The new speaker of the Italian parliament, Lorenzo Fontana, is also known for sympathising with Russia.\n\nBut the comments by Berlusconi risk doing real harm to our standing abroad. His apparent willingness to blame Ukraine for starting Putin’s war puts us on a “collision course with Washington, Berlin and Paris”, and sends a message to our Nato allies that we cannot be trusted.\n\nMeloni said to be ‘livid’\n\nMeloni’s “far-right credentials and long history of eurosceptic tirades have raised eyebrows in some European capitals”, said Benjamin Dodman on France 24 (Paris). But she has staunchly supported Ukraine’s war effort, offered strong backing to EU sanctions on Russia, and insisted that anyone joining her government must be an opponent of Putin’s war. Unsurprisingly, she was said to be “livid” after hearing the Berlusconi recording, and responded with a statement saying that support for Europe and Nato would be a “cornerstone” of her government.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nBerlusconi’s comments are typical of a man who always craves the limelight, said Alessandro Campi in Il Mattino (Naples). But they also betray his weakness. Finding himself in his “advancing years” having to negotiate a role for his party in government from a minority position, he let his vanity and desire for publicity get the better of him.

Pound at record low against dollar\n\nThe pound has fallen to a record low against the dollar as markets continue to react to the UK’s biggest tax cuts in 50 years. In early trade in Asia, sterling slipped just below $1.04 – the lowest level since decimalisation in 1971 – before regaining some ground to stand at about $1.05, the BBC reported. If sterling falls to parity with the US dollar, it could trigger a rebellion among Tory backbenchers who could refuse to vote for the government’s finance bill or even submit letters of no confidence in PM Liz Truss, said The Telegraph.\n\nMini-budget 2022: Kwasi Kwarteng’s ‘growth plan’ in seven bullet points\n\n2.

The right-wing coalition is thought to have won 41-45% of the vote, according to a Consorzio Opinio Italia exit poll, causing alarm in other European capitals. Speaking after the vote, Meloni said her Brothers of Italy party would “govern for everyone” and would not betray people’s trust.

US issues nuclear warning\n\nThe US has told Russia that the West’s reaction would be “catastrophic” if Vladimir Putin decides to employ the use of nuclear weapons. “If Russia crosses this line, there will be catastrophic consequences. The United States will respond decisively,” US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC’s public affairs programme Meet the Press. Meanwhile, said the FT, capital cities in the West are making contingency plans in case the Russian president moves to use nuclear weapons against Kyiv.\n\nVladimir Putin’s dilemma: can he turn the tide in Ukraine?\n\n4. Poll predicts easy Labour win\n\nLabour is on course to win a 56-seat majority at the next election, according to a major new poll from Savanta ComRes. Voting intention shows Labour in the lead with 45%, the Conservatives at 33%, the Lib Dems at 10%, the Greens at 4% and Reform at 3%. The modelling suggested that with such a lead, Labour would regain many so-called Red Wall seats. The i news site said the results will “pile pressure” on Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng to demonstrate that their plans for the economy will work.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhat does Liz Truss win mean for Labour?\n\n5. Truss chief of staff promised election gig\n\nLiz Truss promised her chief of staff Mark Fullbrook that his company would run the Conservatives’ next general election campaign if he joined her No. 10 operation. According to sources, a “quid pro quo” arrangement, which could be highly lucrative for his lobbying company, Fullbrook Associates, was a condition of the strategist taking the job. The news followed the revelation that Fullbrook will receive his salary through his company, “which may help him minimise tax” and is a “highly unusual move”, said The Guardian.\n\n6. Clashes at Iranian embassy demo\n\nDemonstrators have clashed with police officers at protests outside the Iranian embassy in London. The Met Police said members of the crowd threw missiles at officers and breached police lines in Princes Gate, Knightsbridge, on Sunday afternoon. Protesters chanted “Death to the Islamic republic” and waved Iran’s national flag from before 1979, when the Shah of Iran was overthrown in a revolution by religious hardliners. The protest was sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in custody after she was arrested by the country’s morality police.\n\nHow Mahsa Amini’s death sparked days of protests in Iran\n\n7. Starmer will reverse tax reform\n\nKeir Starmer is expected to pledge today to reinstate the top rate of income tax and inject the “ensuing billions” into the NHS and other public services, said The Guardian. On the first day of the Labour party conference, the Labour leader said it was “‘hugely divisive’ of ministers to hand out a tax cut to the extremely well paid”, added the paper. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said Labour should also reverse Kwasi Kwarteng’s decision to cut the basic rate of income tax from 20-19%.\n\n8. Travel ‘booming’ despite crisis\n\nDemand for travel is still “booming” despite concern over the global economy and cost of living, said the FT. Hotel bookings for the fourth quarter have outpaced 2019 levels, according to figures compiled by travel company Amadeus, which collates data from 35,000 global hotel properties. Henrik Kjellberg, the boss of a European holiday rentals company, told the paper that bookings were “holding up well over winter both in terms of volume and price”, adding that “even in the event of a recession, I expect the travel industry will still perform well”.\n\n9. Black people face medical prejudice\n\nA study has found that the majority of black people living in Britain have reported being discriminated against by healthcare professionals because of their race. The research, commissioned by the national civil rights group Black Equity Organisation, found that 75% of black people aged between 18-34 have experienced prejudice while visiting doctors and hospitals. The Independent said the study is “thought to be the most comprehensive piece of research into black people’s lived experiences of racism in the UK to be produced in the past ten years”.\n\n10. Electric vehicle charges soar\n\nThe RAC said that the cost of charging an electric car using public charge points on a pay-as-you-go basis has risen by 42% in just four months. The average price for using the chargers has increased by 18.75p per kilowatt hour (kWh) since May, reaching 63.29p per kWh, according to the motoring group. “However,” said the AA, “the reality is that even with the hike in domestic electricity costs, running an [electric vehicle] is considerably cheaper than a petrol or diesel car”.\n\nMG4 review: what the car critics say", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/959061/people-of-2022", "title": "People of 2022: from Meghan Markle to Matt Hancock | The Week", "text": "1.

From 2002 to 2003, May was the first female chairman of the Conservative Party. After the Conservatives took charge of the government in 2010, May was appointed home secretary, in charge of internal affairs of England and Wales and immigration, national security and citizenship for the U.K. May is the longest serving official in this post in over 50 years.\n\nPlace in history: The front-runner to replace Prime Minister David Cameron would be the second female prime minster.

In 2014, she joined the government as economic secretary to the Treasury. She moved to her current post last year.\n\nPlace in history: Leadsom would become the nation's leader after only six years in Parliament.\n\nHillary Clinton\n\nAge: 68\n\nCareer highlights: The former first lady won a seat in the U.S. Senate in 2001 and won re-election in November 2006. She ran for president in 2008 but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama, who went on to victory in November and named her as his secretary of State. She served from 2009 to 2013, becoming one of the most traveled occupants of that post during her tenure.\n\nPlace in history: Clinton is the first president's wife to be elected to the Senate and the first woman to represent New York in the chamber. She will set more records when she is formally nominated at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia later this month and if she wins the White House.\n\nAngela Merkel\n\nAge: 61\n\nCareer highlights: Merkel entered politics after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and became chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Union political party. In 2005, she became chancellor and won two additional terms in 2009 and 2013. Merkel was awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, and Time magazine named her Person of the Year in 2015 for her leadership on issues that included Europe's migrant crisis.\n\nPlace in history: Merkel became the first female leader of Germany since the nation was founded in 1871. She is also the first former citizen of East Germany to lead a reunited Germany.\n\nDalia Grybauskaitė\n\nAge: 60\n\nCareer highlights: Grybauskaitė has served as the president of Lithuania since July 12, 2009. She was appointed European Union commissioner in 2014, responsible for financial programming and budget. In November 2005, she was elected Commissioner of the Year for her efforts to reform the EU budget.\n\nPlace in history: Grybauskaitė is Lithuania's first female president and the first president of the country to be re-elected for a second consecutive term.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/07"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/956639/local-elections-what-the-results-will-mean-for-boris-johnson", "title": "What do the local election results mean for Boris Johnson? | The Week", "text": "Boris Johnson’s leadership could be under threat after his Conservative Party last night lost three London councils in the local elections.\n\nIt was a “mixed set of results” across the country for the two major parties, said The Times.

Conservative MPs will no doubt “ask why a well regarded and debt-free council was lost to Labour” and could conclude it has “something to do with the unpopularity of the prime minister”.\n\nAnd defeat in Westminster City Council is perhaps “even more damaging”, the paper added, because it is “unexpected”, transforming a “bad night in London into a capitulation”.\n\nSome senior Tories had warned that the party could lose “some 800 seats”, reported Politico’s London Playbook, although the Labour Party, in full management expectation mode, “claimed this analysis was nonsense”. The New Statesman had predicted more modest losses for the Conservatives, predicting they would lose more than 200 seats across the country, while Labour might gain about 150.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAs the country woke up this morning, Conservative losses were already nudging into the “triple digits” said Politico. At the time of writing, with more than half of councils still to declare, the Tories have lost 148 seats, with more expected.\n\nConservatives may have already been bracing for losses in London and the South, said The Guardian’s political editor Heather Stewart, but they had “hoped to show they are holding their ground” in areas “where they took seats from Labour in the 2019 general election”.\n\nThere is “scant evidence” of that so far, she added, with Labour analysts declaring that the vote share in key battlegrounds suggests they could be on course to take back the Westminster seats of Hartlepool, West Bromwich and Workington.\n\nWhile it may have been a bad night for the Conservatives in London, it was hardly a “Conservative bloodbath” in the rest of the country, said Janet Daley in The Telegraph.\n\nIt seems that Keir Starmer’s “new look Labour just doesn’t cut it”, she added, suggesting that while northern voters thought “Corbyn was a dangerous idiot”, they also consider Starmer to be “the very personification of the out-of-touch Islington elitism which knows nothing of the real lives lived by working class people”.\n\nThe feeling in Westminster appears to be, for now at least, that poor results in the local elections “won’t be a trigger for a no-confidence vote in Johnson”, said James Forsyth in The Spectator.\n\nThe magazine’s political editor wrote that “one well-connected minister predicts that the Tories are ‘entering a phase of it’s not great but let’s see where things are in six months’.”\n\nAnd another is “far more worried” about the privileges committee investigation into whether Johnson misled parliament than Sue Gray’s report, which is expected to be published at the end of May.\n\nWhat may come in the aftermath of the elections is a cabinet reshuffle, and discussions have reportedly now started “in earnest” in order to “bounce back” from the elections, and ahead of the Queen’s Speech, which will aim to reset the party’s levelling up programme, said Paul Waugh on the i news site.\n\nTory sources have reported that allies of the prime minister have been “privately discussing” the possibility of replacing Chancellor Rishi Sunak with Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, in a possible “job swap”.\n\n“Boris wants the first female Chancellor to be a Conservative and Liz makes no secret she’d love the job,” one MP told Waugh. “It also gives Rishi a way of saving face if he goes to Foreign. But to be honest, he may just walk anyway. He looks like a broken man when you see him up close.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/05/05"}]}

With over 27 years of experience in treating pregnant and birthing patients, here's her advice on the best ways of making sure a mom and baby both stay safe during pregnancy.\n\nWhy is Tylenol recommended for fever, pain during pregnancy?\n\nHigh body temperature during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can be dangerous due to the increased risk that the fetus will develop brain- or heart-related defects. Researchers have known this for decades, which is also why pregnant people are discouraged from using hot tubs or being outside for prolonged periods on a hot day.\n\n\"In the first trimester, as fetuses are developing, we're very concerned about the neurodevelopment, specifically neural tube development, also cardiac development,\" said Egbert. \"We don't really know why fever affects those things.\"\n\nAcetaminophen, also known by its brand-name Tylenol, is the safest and \"best\" option for pregnant people, said Egbert, to lower that fever.\n\nIt's also \"the best pain medicine we can offer during pregnancy,\" according to Egbert, who said that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Advil or aspirin are not recommended due to the potential to cause severe kidney problems in the fetus.\n\n\"In general, your doctor will tell you, hey, take what you need to take at the lowest dose for the least amount of time to help you with the symptom that you're having,\" said Egbert. \"The recommendation has always been exposed to the least amount you can for the least amount of time you can.\"\n\nDoes Tylenol use during pregnancy cause autism?\n\nThe issue of acetaminophen safety during pregnancy has been studied for over a decade, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a professional organization representing ob-gyns in the U.S.\n\nOn Sept. 22, the Food and Drug Administration announced a label change on Tylenol to reflect some studies that show a positive correlation between Tylenol use during pregnancy and subsequent diagnosis of conditions such as autism and ADHD. An association does not mean, as President Trump suggested, that Tylenol usage causes autism in the fetus and that pregnant moms should stop taking the medication because of it.\n\nThe FDA addressed this uncertainty in its announcement of the label change. \"While an association between acetaminophen and neurological conditions has been described in many studies,\" read the announcement, \"a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature.\"\n\nNotably, two studies from Sweden and Norway respectively found that when other potential causes of autism, such as genetics, were ruled out, there was no significant link between Tylenol use and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nStill, reviewing scientific research can be overwhelming, so if you're a parent who's confused on how best to keep yourself and your baby healthy, there's an easy solution.\n\nWhen in doubt, said Egbert, \"It's aways best to double check with your doctor.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/04/surgeon-general-alcohol-warning-dietary-guideline-review/77429888007/", "title": "Surgeon General Vivek Murthy's alcohol warning comes amid ...", "text": "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy's new Advisory on Alcohol and Cancer Risk outlining a direct link between drinking alcohol and increased risk of developing seven types of cancer was released Friday amid a review of federal guidelines for alcohol consumption.\n\nThe move drew praise from Dr. Michael B. Siegel, professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine, who said it is likely not a coincidence Murthy's advisory came as the fight over how much alcohol the U.S. should deem safe as part of a healthy diet is being debated.\n\nThe secretaries of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are conducting an every-five-year review of dietary guidelines, including for alcohol consumption, which is due to be released later this year. With just over two weeks left before the Biden administration ends, this could be one of Murthy's last chances to influence the outcome. Murthy didn't directly call for changing the dietary guidelines in his advisory, however.\n\n\"My sense is that he probably got fed up, and he basically has had enough of the alcohol industry influence, and is basically just saying, that's it. We're gonna have science decide this, not politics. So he came out with this definitive statement, unequivocally saying that alcohol is a carcinogen and that moderate drinking is a risk factor for cancer,\" Siegel said.\n\nThe dietary guidelines provide advice on what Americans should eat and drink to meet nutrition needs, promote health, and prevent disease. They are used by doctors to suggest lifestyle changes and by the federal government to determine how food assistance can be spent.\n\nThere are about 100,000 alcohol-related cancer cases and about 20,000 alcohol-related cancer deaths in the U.S. each year, the advisory states. Alcohol is the third-leading cause of cancer in the U.S., after tobacco and obesity.\n\nWhile research has shown a link between alcohol and cancer, “the majority of Americans are unaware of this risk,” Murthy said in a statement.\n\nMurthy will be replaced by a surgeon general nominated by President-elect Donald Trump after Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.\n\nDr. William Dietz, a professor at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at the George Washington University, said Murthy is using his position to draw attention to a major health issue while he can, the way previous surgeon generals waived flags about the dangers of tobacco use and obesity.\n\n“I think he safely added alcohol to what is now the big three, which is tobacco, obesity and alcohol,” Dietz said. “It's quite appropriate and within character of the position to use the position as a bully pulpit to call to the attention of the American public issues related to health.”\n\nPotential benefits to heart health from moderate drinking\n\nMurthy's advisory comes weeks after one of the reports expected to shape the next edition of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines broke with the emerging scientific consensus that alcohol has no health benefits. Instead, the evidence review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in December tentatively endorsed the former prevailing scientific theory that moderate drinking is linked to fewer heart attack and stroke deaths, and fewer deaths overall, compared with not drinking at all. Many scientific organizations now dispute that hypothesis, saying the harms of any alcohol outweigh any potential health benefits.\n\nDr. Laura Catena, a vintner and physician who divides her time between California and Argentina, said that it is important for the surgeon general speak about the health risks that come with heavy or binge drinking, but the public should look to the National Academies findings as well.\n\n\"I think it's also important for people who drink in moderation and who drink perhaps as a way to socialize, to gather with family and friends or as a part of their cultural traditions, like I do with my family in Argentina, to know that there are positives and negatives to drinking, as was revealed in the (National Academies) report,\" she said.\n\nThe National Academies report was commissioned by Congress, which provided $1.3 million for the work. Some public health experts raised concerns that the nongovernmental panel put together by the National Academies included researchers and experts with ties to the alcohol industry and failed to include many relevant studies about the harms of alcohol in their review.\n\n\"The alcohol industry has been hoping that they can get this recommendation to basically say that alcohol can be healthy for you, it can lower your risk of heart disease, and therefore, you know, it should be part of a healthy diet,\" Siegel said.\n\nA major alcohol trade group said they aren't telling people to drink for their health.\n\n\"We do not recommend that anyone drink to achieve health benefits and urge all adults who choose to consume alcohol to consult their health provider to determine what is best for them and to follow the recommendations of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines,\" Amanda Berger, senior vice president for science and research at the Distilled Spirits Council, said in a statement.\n\nSeveral alcohol industry associations responded to Murthy's advisory by pointing to the existing dietary guidelines or the National Academies report.\n\nThe secretaries will also rely on a second analysis by a governmental committee called the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking that is expected to be completed this month. That committee is made up of experts from the Department of Health and Human Services, Surgeon General, the Centers for Disease Control and other agencies and were tasked with reviewing the health effects of moderate drinking.\n\nFor the first time, the secretaries will rely on the findings of the two reports rather than evaluating the available scientific evidence about alcohol and make recommendations.\n\nWhen the U.S. dietary guidelines were last updated in 2020, the government rejected its scientific advisers' recommendation to lower alcohol consumption. The guidelines still suggest limiting drinks to one daily for women, two for men.\n\nIn recent years, the the World Health Organization and national health agencies around the world, have issued guidance that no amount of alcohol is safe.\n\nTobacco-style warning labels?\n\nMurthy also called on Congress to add cancer risk warnings on alcohol. Current label statements, which warn about drinking alcohol during pregnancy and the impact of alcohol on driving a car or operating machinery, have not been updated since 1988.\n\nChanging the existing warnings would need the support of Congress as well as the incoming Trump administration. Trump has tapped Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a medical director for a chain of urgent care clinics and a Fox News contributor, to be his surgeon general. The appointment requires Senate confirmation.\n\nNesheiwat has spoken on FOX about the benefits of reducing alcohol use. Trump has said he does not drink, and Robert F.

For the latest news on the Iran-Israel conflict, read USA TODAY's live updates on the conflict for Tuesday, June 24.\n\nIsrael said that Iran had committed a ''severe violation\" of the Trump-announced ceasefire, and vowed to respond with force, only hours after Iran signaled it was willing to abide by the deal.Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel had detected Iranian missile launches and ordered \"high-intensity operations\" targeting Iran. Iranian media reported that the country has denied a ceasefire violation.\n\nEarlier, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office thanked President Donald Trump and said it achieved its objective of \"eliminating the Iranian nuclear threat.\" Iranian officials said their government would halt attacks if Israel did.\n\nTrump had first announced the deal in a social media post and urged both countries not to violated it. He said that Israel and Iran agreed to a \"total ceasefire\" after the Iranian military retaliated for U.S. strikes on three of the country's nuclear facilities.\n\nA senior White House official told USA TODAY that Trump communicated directly with Netanyahu about the ceasefire, which Israel also agreed to as long as it was not struck again by Iran.\n\nVice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and special envoy Steve Witkoff negotiated with the Iranians, through both direct and indirect channels, the person said. Qatar's emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani helped broker the agreement, and Trump called the Gulf leader to thank him, the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump thanked Iran for providing a warning of its Monday attack, and he made a peace offering to end the brief but intense war. Trump said Iran fired 14 missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar, and 13 of them were intercepted, while the other one was deemed nonthreatening.\n\nTrump reported there were no American or Qatari casualties and very little damage from the attack.\n\nIran’s military had claimed it had carried out a “devastating and powerful” missile assault on the Al Udeid U.S. military base in Doha, but Qatar said the missiles were intercepted. U.S. officials said the base had been emptied out, lending credence to the notion Iran was merely saving face with the missile launch.\n\n\"They’ve gotten it all out of their 'system,' and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE,'' Trump said in his earlier post. \"I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured. Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same.''\n\nContributing: Zac Anderson\n\nIran fires missiles at US base in Qatar: Where else could it strike?\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The State Department said it has evacuated approximately 250 U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents and their immediate family members from Israel on seven flights since June 21.\n\n∎ Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Iran's foreign minister in Moscow and told him there was no justification for the U.S. bombing of Iran, which he described as \"unprovoked aggression,\" according to the Kremlin. Putin added that Moscow is making efforts to assist the Iranian people.\n\n∎ Iranian official Ebrahim Zolfaqari warned that the U.S. should expect severe consequences. \"Mr. Trump, the gambler, you may start this war, but we will be the ones to end it,\" Zolfaqari said in English in a video shared Monday.\n\nReported attacks in Israel and Iran\n\nTrump's ceasefire announcement came after Iran had launched a fresh wave of missiles, killing four people, according to Israel's ambulance service, and as Iranian authorities reported nine people killed in an attack in northern Iran on Tuesday morning.\n\nWitnesses said they heard explosions near Tel Aviv and Beersheba in southern Israel. Iran's semi-official SNN news agency reported that Tehran fired its last round of missiles before the ceasefire came into effect.\n\nIn Iran, the deputy governor of the northern province of Gilan said four residential units were destroyed in a \"terrorist attack\" on Tuesday morning, killing nine people and injuring 33, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.\n\n--Reuters\n\nTrump celebrates ceasefire while Israeli Forces say attacks continue\n\nThe president took to his social media platform Truth Social on Monday evening to celebrate the end of fighting between the two countries.\n\n“Israel & Iran came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, ‘PEACE!’ Trump proclaimed on the platform. “I knew the time was NOW. The World, and the Middle East, are the real WINNERS! Both Nations will see tremendous LOVE, PEACE, AND PROSPERITY in their futures. They have so much to gain, and yet, so much to lose if they stray from the road of RIGHTEOUSNESS & TRUTH. The future for Israel & Iran is UNLIMITED, & filled with great PROMISE. GOD BLESS YOU BOTH!”\n\nThe White House told USA TODAY earlier in the evening that Trump spoke to Netanyahu and the emir of Qatar. Top-ranking U.S. officials spoke directly and indirectly to Tehran.\n\nIranian state media said the ceasefire came as a result of the nation’s retaliatory strikes, according to reporting by CNN. Trump called for the ceasefire “in a begging-like manner” after the attacks on U.S. bases in Qatar, an Iranian state anchor said.\n\nIranian attacks haven’t ceased yet, according to the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nMinutes before the president’s celebratory post, Israeli Defense Forces in a post on X announced an incoming attack: “Sirens sounding in Israel due to a missile launch from Iran.”\n\nAn hour later, Israeli forces said “for the third time in the last hour, Israelis are currently running to shelter due to another missile launch from Iran.”\n\nVance says Trump is working on long-term deal\n\nVice President JD Vance was about to do a live, in-studio interview on Fox News when Trump posted the cease-fire message. Vance said the administration had been working on the truce when he left the White House. \"So that's good news that the president was able to get that across the finish line,\" Vance said.\n\nHe said the United States must now talk to Iran and Israel about what comes next, following days of strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites. \"I think that is what the president is really trying to figure out here, is to build a long-term settlement,\" Vance said.\n\nVance said Trump told his team the U.S. would now work to make sure Iran doesn't rebuild its nuclear capability in the future.\n\nAs for the six hours that Trump referred to, Vance said the fighting may continue for a few hours. \"And tomorrow really is a new day. The end of the 12-day war, the end of the Iranian nuclear program, and I really do believe, something big for peace in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nUS was ready for missiles, evacuated base\n\nA U.S. defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly confirmed to USA TODAY that Al Udeid Air Base was attacked by short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles originating from Iran. There were no reports of U.S. casualties, the official said.\n\nAnother U.S. official said on condition of anonymity that the base had been mostly evacuated, and that it appeared the Qatari military had fended off most missiles.\n\nMajed Al Ansari, foreign affairs spokesman for Qatar, issued a statement strongly condemning the missile launch, calling it \"a flagrant violation'' of the country's sovereignty. \"We reassure that Qatar’s air defenses successfully thwarted the attack,\" the statement said.\n\nThe U.S. has remained on alert with its 40,000 troops in the region two days after Trump ordered the bombing of Fordow, a uranium-enrichment facility deep inside a remote mountain in Iran, and facilities at Natanz and Isfahan. Trump convened his national security team Monday afternoon in the Situation Room.\n\nMany world leaders − including those from the UK, France and Germany − called for restraint and a return to diplomatic negotiations. The extent of the damage to the Iran nuclear sites remains in question because so far there has been no independent assessment.\n\nThe U.S. Ain al-Asad air base in Iraq had activated its air defense system out of concern of a potential attack, military officials told Reuters.\n\nWhat is the Al Udeid US military base in Qatar?\n\nAl Udeid is the sprawling hub of U.S. military air operations in the Middle East. There about 10,000 U.S. troops stationed there, on the outskirts of the capital of Doha.\n\nIts air operations center has overseen fighters, bombers and drones that have conducted combat missions in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nDignitaries make stops there frequently, including Trump and secretaries of Defense.\n\nTrump warns other countries not to supply nukes to Iran\n\nTrump warned other countries Monday not to supply nuclear weapons to Iran in response to the U.S. bombing, after a former Russian president suggested the option.\n\n“The ‘N word’ should not be treated so casually,” Trump said in a social media post, referring to nuclear weapons.Trump was alluding to a social media post by Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia, but questioned its accuracy. Medvedev’s post suggested “a number of countries are ready to directly support Iran with their own nuclear warheads.”−Bart Jansen\n\nSpeaker says no to House vote on war powers resolution\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Monday he didn’t think it was “an appropriate time” for the House to vote on a bipartisan war powers resolution pushed by two representatives, Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie and California Democrat Ro Khanna.\n\n“I don’t think it’s necessary,” Johnson said, according to Punchbowl News. “For 80 years, presidents of both parties have acted with the same Commander in Chief authority under Article 2.''\n\nJohnson said President Joe Biden used the authority in three Middle East operations, and added: \"President Obama went on an eight-month campaign bombing Libya to take down the regime there. I never heard a Democrat balk about any of that. And suddenly now they're just up in arms. It's all politics. This is not a time for politics.”\n\nHis remarks will likely earn pushback from Massie and Khanna, who were looking to bring their measure to the floor for a vote, seeking to forbid the U.S. from \"unauthorized hostilities” in Iran after Trump ordered airstrikes at three nuclear sites in Iran.\n\nLawmakers across the aisle have alleged that Trump’s order violated the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action.

USA TODAY is set to stream the announcement live here. - Bart Jansen\n\nAutism is increasingly diagnosed\n\nAutism spectrum disorder is the clinical name for the condition most people refer to as autism and is diagnosed based on challenges with social skills, communication and repetitive behaviors. Symptoms vary widely on the spectrum, with some people unable to communicate at all and others highly successful.\n\nAutism diagnoses nationwide have increased significantly since 2000. By 2020, the U.S. autism rate in 8-year-olds was 1 in 36, or 2.77%, up from 0.66% in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nResearch spanning decades hasn’t yielded firm answers on what contributes to autism, but many scientists believe genetics play a role, potentially in combination with environmental influences. Kennedy has argued the country has an \"autism epidemic\" fueled by \"environmental toxins.\"\n\nBecause traits and support levels vary widely, \"no single approach fits all people with autism,\" says Christopher Banks, president and CEO of the Autism Society of America.\n\n'Acetaminophen does not cause autism': Tylenol\n\nTylenol parent company Kenvue issued a statement saying independent scientific research shows that taking acetaminophen is \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"\n\nThe company said that a decade of rigorous research endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators found \"no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism.\"\n\n“We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" the statement said. \"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.\"\n\nStill, more than two dozen studies around the world have linked a pregnant person's frequent use of acetaminophen to autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in their child.\n\nBut several studies have also found competing evidence. A 2024 study in Sweden of about 2 million children, over 180,000 of whom were exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy, found no associations between the pain medication and children’s risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability.\n\nA federal judge ruled that 440 lawsuits against Tylenol makers do not have \"admissible evidence\" showing a link between prenatal use of Tylenol and autism or ADHD, according to reporting by ABC News. −Zac Anderson and Adrianna Rodriguez\n\nNo 'sound-bite answer to what causes autism': expert\n\nTrump signed an executive order in February creating the Make America Healthy Again Commission, which included studying the threats of certain medications.\n\nKennedy said at an April news conference that autism was \"preventable\" and he directed the National Institutes of Health to “identify precisely what the environmental toxins are that are causing it.”\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously found that the rising incidence of autism could be attributed to more access to diagnostic tools and improvements in early detection. Some people with autism spectrum disorder have a genetic condition while other “causes are not yet known,” according to the CDC.\n\n\"There will never be a sound-bite answer to what causes autism,” Helen Tager-Flusberg, a psychologist who studies neurodevelopmental conditions at Boston University, Massachusetts, told Nature magazine. − Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nWhat do doctors say about Tylenol?\n\nMedical guidelines say acetaminophen, the generic form of Tylenol, is safe to use. Acetaminophen is commonly used by pregnant women, who are already advised by the Food and Drug Administration not to use ibuprofen after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both endorsed using acetaminophen during pregnancy in Sept. 5 statements.\n\n“Acetaminophen remains a safe, trusted option for pain relief during pregnancy,” the statement said. “Despite recent unfounded claims, there’s no clear evidence linking prudent use to issues with fetal development.”\n\nContributing: Daryl Austin, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/09/24/tylenol-autism-pregnancy-oklahoma-responds-trump-rfk-jr/86326698007/", "title": "Oklahoma medical experts, advocates push back on Trump, RFK Jr ...", "text": "Jillian Taylor\n\nStateImpact Oklahoma\n\nMedical professionals and autism advocates, including one in Oklahoma, raised concerns about the Trump administration’s endorsement of claims linking autism and the usage of acetaminophen – the active ingredient in Tylenol – during pregnancy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump repeatedly said during a Monday press briefing featuring top health officials that pregnant women should not take the pain reliever “unless it’s absolutely necessary.”\n\n“Don't take Tylenol. Don't take it. … I mean, fight like hell not to take it,” Trump said. “There may be a point where you have to, and that you'll have to work out with yourself.”\n\nThe FDA issued a physician notice and will begin the process of issuing a safety label change, said U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Although the notice stated a causal relationship between acetaminophen and autism has not been established and acknowledged the existence of contrary studies. It said the association is “an ongoing area of scientific debate.”\n\nThe National Institutes of Health also announced the recipients of the Autism Data Science Initiative, which will fund 13 projects with more than $50 million to study autism.\n\nWhat are medical professionals saying?\n\nMany scientists believe autism – a neurodevelopmental condition – is influenced by genetic and environmental factors . And, for years, they have conducted research on potential connections between acetaminophen and autism. Those studies have produced inconclusive results.\n\nDr. Brian Lee, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Drexel University, is a co-author of a study that analyzed 2.5 million pregnancies and followed the moms and children for up to 20 years in Sweden. He said although the study found a slight statistical increase in children’s risk of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with acetaminophen use, that link disappeared when they compared siblings born to the same mother.\n\n“In other words, there was no increase in risk of autism or ADHD associated with acetaminophen use,” Lee said. “And what that told us was that familial confounding factors, such as maternal genetics, were likely explaining the apparent statistical association.”\n\nHe also acknowledged that rates of autism diagnoses are increasing – a point heavily made during Monday’s conference. But Lee said he doesn’t think acetaminophen is “a credible suspect.”\n\n“A large part of this is, of course, going to be due to increasing awareness, changing diagnostic criteria and just better recognition of autism symptoms in schools,” Lee said.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists affirmed the safety and benefits of acetaminophen during pregnancy in a Monday statement. Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, ACOG’s president, said acetaminophen is one of the few options available to pregnant patients to treat pain and fever.\n\n“The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus,” Fleischman said.\n\nWhat are advocates saying?\n\nAutism advocates also responded to the White House event. The Autism Society of America said in a Tuesday statement , “unfounded claims about the ‘cause’ and ‘treatment’ of Autism were presented.”\n\n“Announcing a cause or treatment without rigorous, replicated science undermines trust and distracts from critical work needed for the Autism Community,” said the Autism Society of America’s board of directors. “What Autistic individuals and their caregivers need are expanded services, inclusive policies, and research that helps improve quality of life.”\n\nCarley Marissa Dummitt is the engagement manager for the Autism Foundation of Oklahoma. The nonprofit’s mission is to “improve the lives of Oklahomans with autism and their families across the lifespan,” Dummitt said the group accomplishes that by focusing on education, advocacy and inclusion, with programs that hone in on things like children and youth, and transition and employment.\n\nIn response to the Trump administration’s announcement, Dummitt said a person having autism is not something that should be blamed on parents.\n\n“Do you love your child any less? I mean, children are a blessing that a lot of people, they want,” Dummitt said. “It's not the fault of what a parent did or did not do. And every caregiver's story is valid.”\n\nAs an autistic person, Dummitt said othering is something many people on the spectrum encounter. She said she was bullied as a child for being different, and that bullying can have severe consequences.\n\n“I just think it's important that we also highlight these things that are not often talked about when we're talking about autism,” Dummitt said. “Because, one way that we can improve people's lives and really help everyone understand autism is by talking about all of the things that go along with autism, not just theories on why we have it.”\n\nAs autism is discussed at a national level, she said she would like to see people focus more on shattering stigma.\n\n“The power of seeing someone and being seen, I think, is very underrated. I think we take it for granted. I think the people who are not able to put themselves in the shoes of other people should try it, because inclusion happens on the smallest scale and it happens on the largest scale,” Dummitt said. “And I think inclusion is something we should be focused on while we're having these conversations.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/04/29/anti-trump-petition-protests-presidents-alabama-graduation-speech/83276918007/", "title": "Anti-Trump petition protests president's Alabama graduation speech", "text": "Days after a protest against President Donald Trump appearing in Tuscaloosa went online, it has gained nearly 25,000 signatures as of April 28.\n\nIn a move that seemed to take many by surprise, as it had not been listed on any of the University of Alabama's materials, Trump announced on April 21 he'd be speaking at commencements for both UA and the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York.

Both officials underscored the need to pass the measure quickly.\n\n“They understood,” Kudlow said of senators after the meeting. “They understood the urgency. You know, we're trying to keep people from getting laid off. And we're trying to help people on sick leave or take care of their families, whatever the case may be. And we've got some pretty distressed industries.”\n\nThe officials also expanded on what is to come, offering a preview of the next package the Trump administration wants Congress to take up that would help workers and families but also give a boost to the healthcare and airline industries. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., left the meeting with a sense of urgency, noting the need to pass a third coronavirus package as soon as this week due to concerns the Senate might not be able to reconvene if the virus worsens.\n\n“I don't think we can assume that we can keep reconvening the Senate every week, like the way we did it this week. I just don't think we can make that assumption with the orders that are out there what might happen with airlines, with travel schedules, with individual members having to go into quarantine or being exposed,” he said. “I don't think we can operate as if we can just bring the Senate and the House back together whenever we want.”\n\nHe said help for airlines would be central to the next package, calling it a potential “national security threat” if airlines halt operations. He said bailouts for specific industries differed from the financial rescue during the 2008 economic crisis. The bank bailout proved unpopular with many Americans who viewed as unfair to help the companies whose risk-taking sowed the seeds for the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\n\n“This is not an example of industries that have failed and made bad decisions and are asking for the taxpayer to bail them out,” Rubio said. “We are asking -- we're begging people -- not to go out, not to go shopping, not to go to restaurants, not to go to bars and clubs and not to take trips. We are imposing restrictions for – and rightfully so, there is economic costs associated with that.”\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nLone GOP lawmaker withdraws objection to coronavirus bill\n\nThe House of Representatives passed an amended version of its coronavirus legislation after all-day negotiations and one lone Republican withdrawing his objection.\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, blocked the bill from passing in the chamber under unanimous consent earlier Monday, a move that could have forced the House to hold a full vote on technical changes it made to the legislation.\n\n“The – what are being called - technical corrections make the bill better than it was when it got passed in the wee hours Saturday morning, so because of that,” Gohmert said on the House floor, “I will withdraw my objection.”\n\nThe legislation will now move to the Senate. If it passes, it will head to Trump’s desk.\n\nThe bill will provide sick leave to American workers and bolster unemployment insurance, along with making coronavirus tests free for all who need them.\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nSenators wrestle with what to about coronavirus rescue package\n\nSenators were considering Monday whether to add or change a coronavirus relief bill that passed the House Saturday.\n\nThat measure would require paid leave for workers who need to stay home because of the virus. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., has raised concerns that the bill's provisions expanding paid sick leave would exacerbate financial hardships for small business by \"forcing them to pay wages they cannot afford.\"\n\nJohnson said he's worried not only about potential layoffs but also about “incentivizing people to not show up for work either.\"\n\n“People are going to have to work. People do need to recognize the fact that this is not Ebola. This is not MERS. It's not quite the seasonal flu,\" Johnson said. \"But we have to keep things in perspective and we got to keep our economy.\"\n\nIn addition to the paid leave provisions, the House measure would also increase money for food programs.\n\nUtah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney said some of his colleagues are floating the option of adding to the relief measures in the House bill to address other sectors of the economy.\n\n“There’s some who think ‘no, no we'd better do phase three at the same time,’ because we may not, you know, be coming back if somebody gets the coronavirus or whatever happens,” Romney said. “Maybe we need to get phase three done before phase two is out the door.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump, meanwhile, mentioned help for the struggling airline industry as among the priorities he is seeking in the next phase of the rescue package.\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nAbundance of caution: White House press secretary working from home\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham is working from home in what she describes as an abundance of caution. She was around members of the Brazilian delegation that visited Mar-a-Lago in early March. \"I feel good, but with my proximity to the president it’s better to be safe than sorry,\" Grisham said in an email. She did not say whether she will get a coronavirus test.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump acknowledges U.S. may be headed to recession\n\nPresident Donald Trump acknowledged Monday that the U.S. economy “may be” heading toward a recession because of the coronavirus but predicted growth would bounce back strongly.\n\n“Well, it may be,” Trump said in the White House in response to a question about whether the economy is “headed” toward a recession.\n\n“We’re not thinking in terms of recession. We’re thinking in terms of the virus,” the president continued. “Once we stop, I think there’s a tremendous pent-up demand both in terms of the stock market, in terms of the economy.”\n\nThe president’s remarks came as rising fears about the impact of the coronavirus on the economy sent stock prices into freefall Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average collapsed 2,999 points, or 12.9%, to close at 20,188.52 – its second worst percentage loss in history behind the \"Black Monday\" crash in 1987.\n\nUnlike during his Rose Garden appearance on Friday, when his decision to declare a national emergency appeared to drive prices up, the president's remarks Monday did not appear to ease investor concerns. Instead, the market selloff continued as the president and other officials suggested that Americans would have to continue to practice social distancing into the summer.\n\nSocial distancing through August? Trump says it may be needed to help confront coronavirus\n\nThe benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index plunged 12% to finish at 2,386.13. The broad index briefly triggered an automatic shock absorber for the third time in six sessions when it fell more than 7% shortly after the opening bell. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 12% to end at 6,904.59, one of its worst days ever.\n\nThe White House and congressional leaders have been negotiating over a series of stimulus proposals to offset losses caused by the virus, but work on one of those measures appeared to slow in Congress this week over what House Democrats described as technical corrections to legislation approved early Saturday.\n\nSeveral economists predict the U.S. economy could be heading to a recession if the virus continues to disrupt Americans’ normal routines into the summer. Kevin Hassett, who previously served as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Trump, told CNN Monday that the \"odds of a global recession are close to 100% right now.\"\n\n– John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nMike Pence: `I’ve not been tested yet’\n\nVice President Mike Pence has not been tested for the coronavirus, he said Monday, two days after the White House announced that the president’s test had come back negative.\n\nPence said that the White House physician advised that he did not need to get tested because he hadn’t had a long exposure to anyone who had been infected and neither he nor his wife Karen Pence have symptoms.\n\n“I’ve not been tested yet,” Pence said. “But we’re checking our temperature regularly every day and we’ll continue to follow guidance.”\n\nHe used that point to emphasize that the priority for testing should be people with symptoms and health care workers. People people should consult a doctor before getting tested, he added.\n\n“That’s what my family is doing as well,” he said.\n\nBefore that disclosure at a White House briefing, President Donald Trump was asked if he and Pence are trying to stay separate to protect the chain of command in case one of them gets sick.\n\n“We haven’t thought about it, Trump said. “We’re very careful. We’re very careful with being together. Even the people behind me. They’ve been very strongly tested. I’ve been very strongly tested.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump dismisses false reports of national lockdown\n\nPresident Donald Trump appeared to suggest foreign groups could be behind a disinformation campaign that circulated rumors the government was close to placing the U.S. on lockdown.\n\nWhen asked if he agreed with U.S. officials who warned that foreign entities are behind a disinformation campaign to stoke fears of a nationwide quarantine, Trump said: \"I think it could be that you have some foreign groups that are playing games, but it doesn't matter. We haven't really determined to do that all. Hopefully, we won't have to.\"\n\nThe president said the administration was not at the point taking that step. He also said U.S. officials may look at restrictions for specific areas where there's an outbreak of coronvirus, or \"certain hot spots as they call them.\"\n\nTrump's comments came after the U.S. Health and Human Services Department confirmed Monday it was targeted in a cyberattack over the weekend as the agency battles the coronavirus pandemic that has killed 69 people across the U.S.\n\nThe attack prompted the National Security Council to issue a statement in a late Sunday tweet about text messages circulating about a looming national quarantine.\n\n\"Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID19,\" the statement said.\n\n– Courtney Subramanian and David Jackson\n\nTrump urges federal help for airlines\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday he believed the federal government should support airlines “very strongly” amid the losses they are taking because of the coronavirus.\n\n“We’re going to back the airlines 100%,” Trump told a news conference. “It’s not their fault.”\n\nThe trade group for most of the largest carriers, Airlines for America, requested $25 billion in grants for passenger airlines, $25 billion in loan guarantees and tax relief for the first three months of the year. The request Monday came after the U.S. blocked air travel from China and most of Europe and after declines in domestic travel because of concerns about the spread of coronavirus.\n\nFor comparison, Congress provided airlines with $5 billion in grants and $10 million in loan guarantees after the decline in travel terror attacks Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nTrump didn’t cite figures when he discussed his call for help for the airlines.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhite House issues new coronavirus guidelines\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued guidelines on Monday for Americans to follow over the next 15 days to help avoid spread of the novel coronavirus but did not take drastic measures such as imposing a national quarantine or curfew.\n\nThe new guidelines call on Americans to avoid social gatherings involving groups of 10 or more.\n\nThe guidelines also call for governors in states with evidence of community transmission to close schools in affected and surrounding areas. Bars, restaurants, food courts, gyms and other venues where groups of people congregate should also be closed in states with evidence of community transmission, according to the guidelines.\n\n“Each and every one of us has a critical role to play,” Trump said at a news conference with members of his coronavirus task force.\n\n“If everyone makes these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus,” he said.\n\nAmong the other guidelines:\n\nIf someone in your house has testified positive, keep the entire household at home. Do not go to work or school.\n\nIf you are an older person, stay home and away from other people\n\nIf you are a person with a serious underlying health condition, stay home and away from others.\n\nAvoid discretionary travel shopping trips and social visits.\n\nAvoid eating or drinking in restaurants bars, food courts. Use drive-through, pickup and delivery options.\n\nDo not visit nursing homes or retirement or long-term care facilities unless to provide critical assistance.\n\nPractice good hygiene such as washing your hands, especially after touching frequently used items or surfaces. Avoid touching your face.\n\nEarlier Monday, the White House pushed back on news reports that it is considering imposing curfews and a national quarantine in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus epidemic.\n\n\"This is not correct,\" tweeted Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading up the coronavirus task force.\n\n– Michael Collins and David Jackson\n\nTrump: Americans could be hunkered down until summer\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Americans could be hunkered down and practicing social distancing at least until July or August to confront the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDuring a White House briefing on Monday, Trump was asked whether the administration had any estimate of how quickly the country would “turn this corner.” Many Americans have been working from home, and states are increasingly closing schools, businesses and prohibiting large gatherings of people.\n\n“People are talking about July, August -- or something like that,” Trump told reporters, were spaced every other seat in the White House briefing room to practice distancing.\n\nThe president did not discuss specific practices that would have to be implement for that long, but the question was posed in terms of the steps that the country is currently taking.\n\nTrump said it could take at least that long until the virus “washes through,” a term he has used before that he acknowledged Monday that some around him don’t like. Reporters pressed Trump on whether the work from home order and closes would be the new normal until the height of the summer.\n\n“They think August, could be July,” Trump said. “Could be longer than that.”\n\nThe answer to that question could have enormous implications for not for people’s daily lives but for the economy. The White House and Congress are attempting to approve a first economic bill this week to help offset economic losses and are already contemplating other legislation to target particularly hard industries.\n\n-- John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nSeveral coronavirus relief packages up in the air\n\nSmall businesses. Cruise lines. Public transit agencies. Childcare for health workers. Tribal clinics.\n\nThe list of sectors potentially needing federal help keeps growing, yet efforts to deliver that aid remain bogged down.\n\nAmong the relief packages in play:\n\nCongress earlier this month passed a $8.3 billion package to ramp up development of testing kits among other programs to prepare for the virus.\n\nA coronavirus relief bill the House hustled to pass early Saturday morning, which expands paid sick leave and covers the cost of testing for all Americans whether insured or not, is on hold because at least one lawmaker objects to technical corrections needed for the bill to head to the Senate.\n\nThe administration already is working with Democrats on a third relief bill seeking help for cruise lines, air lines and other small businesses being directly affected by the fallout from the virus. The airlines are seeking $50 billion in grants, loans for losses from coronavirus.\n\nDemocratic Senate Leader Charles Schumer, D-NY., Monday unveiled a proposal to spend $750 billion to address a number of sectors, including emergency child care for health care workers and first responders; medicine and food delivery systems for seniors, and assistance to keep public transportation running.\n\n“We will need big, bold, urgent federal action to deal with this crisis,” Schumer said. “The kinds of targeted measures we are putting together will mainline money into the economy and directly into the hands of families that need it most. Importantly, this proposal will also ensure our medical professionals have all the resources – including physical space and equipment – they need to provide treatment and keep Americans safe, among other people-focused initiatives.”\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nU.S. passenger airlines seek $50 billion in grants, loans for losses from coronavirus\n\nU.S. airlines are asking the federal government for grants, loans and tax relief to cope with the lost business from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has suspended travel from most of Europe and other countries including China, which prompted airlines to greatly reduce their schedules.\n\nAdministration and congressional officials have suggested airlines will be among the industries targeted for aid in the next funding bill. But the administration and Congress are still haggling over legislation the House approved Saturday to provide paid leave and other assistance to families coping with the outbreak.\n\nThe trade group Airlines for America, which represents most of the largest U.S. carriers, said the industry employs 750,000 people directly and 10 million indirectly. But airlines have been hard hit from a dramatic decline in demand.\n\nThe group is urging immediate and long-term assistance including $25 billion in grants to passenger airlines, $25 billion in loan guarantees and a rebate in federal excise taxes that airlines owe for the first three months of the year.\n\n“This is a today problem, not a tomorrow problem. It requires urgent action,” said Nicholas Calio, the group’s CEO.\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump questions Cuomo’s response in tweet\n\nConfronted with a pandemic that will require the state and federal governments to work together, President Donald Trump used a tweet Monday to question the governor of New York’s response.\n\nTrump posted the tweet after a morning video conference with the nation’s governors to discuss the coronavirus outbreak and the government’s response to its widening impacts.\n\n“Just had a very good tele-conference with Nations’s Governors,” Trump posted to Twitter. “Went very well. Cuomo of New York has to ‘do more’.”\n\nThe president didn’t clarify what, specifically, he wanted New York State to do and the White House did not immediately respond to questions about the tweet. State officials announced Monday that all schools would close for at least two weeks.\n\nCuomo’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe president’s tweet followed a New York Times report that said Trump told state officials on the call to try to procure ventilators and other medical equipment themselves.\n\n“Try getting it yourselves,” Trump said, according to a recording of the call reviewed by the Times.\n\n\"I have to do more?\" Cuomo tweeted in response to the president's message minutes later. \"No — YOU have to do something! You’re supposed to be the President.\"\n\nTwo officials with knowledge of the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the contents of a conversation not released to the public, said Trump wasn’t offering governors an ultimatum but rather was suggesting they try to procure the equipment at the same time that the federal government works on redirecting ventilators and other needed equipment from the strategic national stockpile.\n\n-- John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nTrump, G-7 world leaders vow 'coordinated international approach'\n\nFollowing President Donald Trump's video teleconference call with G-7 world leaders, the White House released a statement from the group acknowledging COVID-19 as a \"human tragedy and a global health crisis,\" adding they are committed \"to do whatever is necessary to ensure a strong global response.\"\n\nTrump joined leaders from Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Japan in vowing a \"strongly coordinated international approach\" in the coronavirus pandemic. The group directed their health and finance ministers to continue coordinating on a weekly basis.\n\nThe group also promised to:\n\nCoordinate on necessary public health measures to protect people at risk from COVID-19\n\nRestore confidence, growth and protect jobs\n\nSupport global trade and investment\n\nCooperate on research and technology development\n\nPool epidemiologic and other data to combat the virus\n\nSupport the launch of joint research projects funded by both public and private resources\n\nTrump earlier held a phone call with the nation's governors to discuss the coronavirus response.\n\n\"Everybody is so well unified and working so hard. It is a beautiful thing to see,\" he tweeted earlier Monday when trading was suspended for a third time in a week after the stock market plunged. \"They love our great Country. We will end up being stronger than ever before!\"\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nAs stock market craters, Trump's economic adviser says there are 'buying opportunities' for investors\n\nTop White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow insisted Monday that the economy would weather the damage from coronavirus-related disruptions and said plunging stock prices presented \"buying opportunities\" for investors.\n\n\"The fundamentals of the economy are strong,\" Kudlow told reporters after a television interview. \"I believe this is a short term problem.\"\n\nHe added that \"these big dips\" in the stock market, including the ones last week, are \"buying opportunities if you're a long term investor.”\n\nAt 1:20 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.6% Monday. Trading was halted because of automatic circuit breakers that kick in when the market is falling dramatically. This marked the third time in a week that circuit breakers were set off during regular trading hours following sharp losses.\n\nKudlow also said the administration would continue to push for more economic stimulus to inject money into the economy, including a payroll tax cut. While Trump has pushed the payroll tax holiday, it's not included in a stimulus bill currently pending in Congress and has met with lawmaker skepticism, including among some Republicans.\n\n\"The payroll tax holiday is a serious proposal, a very serious proposal,\" Kudlow said.\n\nKudlow also said a future stimulus should include assistance to the hardline airline industry. \"If they get into a cash crunch, we're going to try to help them,\" Kudlow said. \"I see it as a liquidity fix, not as a bailout.\"\n\nHe also said there are a lot of ideas floating around to counter the economic problems wrought the coronavirus.\n\n\"We are going to be challenged.\" Kudlow said. \"There's no question about that.\"\n\nResponding to concerns about a global recession, Kudlow also said: \"We have a big challenge. I’ve been saying that and I’ll continue to say it. I’m not going to label it one thing or another.”\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nRomney: Send every adult $1,000\n\nSen. Mitt Romney proposed on Monday that the federal government immediately send every adult $1,000 to ease any personal financial strain caused by the coronavirus.\n\nThe Utah Republican said that will help families pay their bills while also boosting the economy.\n\nHe compared it to actions Congress took during the 2001 and 2008 recessions.\n\nOn Saturday, the House passed legislation still pending in the Senate that would ensure sick leave for affected workers, extend unemployment insurance for furloughed workers, and beef up food assistance for needy families, among other things.\n\nWhite House officials and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have both said more assistance is needed.\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Monday the White House would continue to push for more economic stimulus to inject money into the struggling economy. In addition to help for airlines, hotels and other travel-related industries hit hard by the virus, the administration continues to push for a payroll tax cut that was jettisoned from the bill the House just passed after bipartisan opposition emerged.\n\nPelosi wrote in a letter to colleagues over the weekend that lawmakers have already begun working on another emergency response package “that will continue to put families first.”\n\nRomney said he will be pushing for the $1,000 assistance, as well as other proposals he outlined Monday, to be included in the next round of help.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhite House says curfews not under consideration\n\nThe White House is pushing back on news reports that it is considering imposing curfews and a national quarantine in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus epidemic.\n\n\"This is not correct,\" tweeted Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading up the coronavirus task force appointed by President Donald Trump.\n\nMiller re-tweeted a CNN report that there are \"active discussions\" to encourage a possible nationwide curfew in which non-essential businesses would have to close by a certain time each night.\n\nAsked about rumors that the administration is considering some kind of national quarantine, Miller said: \"Consider it shot down.\"\n\nThe White House announcement follow a National Security Council tweet late Sunday about text messages floating around the Internet.\n\nSaid the NSC: \"Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID19. #coronavirus.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nSurgeon General: Americans should follow federal guidelines\n\nThe United States will end up with as high a mortality rate from the coronavirus as Italy without an aggressive response that includes Americans following the federal government’s guidance, Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on “Fox & Friends” Monday.\n\n“When you look at the projections, there's every chance that we could be Italy,” Adams said.\n\n“But there's every hope that we will be South Korea if people actually listen, if people actually social distance, if people do the basic public health measures that we've all been talking about as doctors all along, such as washing your hands, such as covering your cough, and cleaning surfaces.”\n\nAdams said there will be more guidance coming about the previous recommendation that people consider postponing elective surgeries to free up the system to respond to the coronavirus.\n\n“And we're going to be talking more today to try to figure out how we can give more guidance because elective doesn’t mean non-urgent,” he said of his recent conversations with the American College of Surgeons and the American Hospital Association.\n\nAdams noted that his wife just through cancer treatment, which is not something that can be delayed for six months. But procedures like hip and knee replacements need to be put off “until we can get a handle on this” and “we aren’t taking up ICU beds and hospital beds and then saying we're going to have to put our coronavirus patients out in tents in the streets.”\n\nAdams said people will start to see new testing sites in their communities, including in his hometown of Cumberland, Md., where a hospital is starting drive-thru testing. He said there will be “30 to 40 new pods” in up to 19 sates that will enable drive-thru and walk-thru tests.\n\nBut the testing will focus first on those most at risk, including health care workers and then people over age 65 who have a fever or other symptoms.\n\n“We are hopeful that if we lean into this then maybe in about six to eight weeks we'll get over the majority of the pain, we will have flattened the curve, and we can start to slowly get back to life as normal,” he said.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nSupreme Court postpones oral arguments for the first time since 1918\n\nThe Supreme Court announced Monday it is postponing oral arguments scheduled for later this month due to the coronavirus, something it has not done in more than 100 years.\n\nThe court already had closed its doors to the public last Thursday until further notice \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\n\nThe justices had several major cases scheduled for oral argument in March. Top on the list were several that will decide if President Donald Trump can shield his tax returns and financial records from congressional committees and New York prosecutors.\n\n\"In keeping with public health precautions recommended in response to COVID-19, the Supreme Court is postponing the oral arguments currently scheduled for the March session,\" the announcement said. The court will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances.\"\n\nThe last time oral arguments were postponed was in 1918, due to the Spanish flu epidemic. The court also shortened its argument calendars in August 1793 and August 1798 in response to yellow fever outbreaks.\n\n-Richard Wolf\n\nCoronavirus response bill could still be days away from reaching president\n\nThe coronavirus relief bill the House hustled to pass early Saturday morning to confront the intensifying crisis could still be days away from reaching President Donald Trump, who has already indicated he would sign it.\n\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which expands paid sick leave and covers the cost of testing for all Americans, needs a technical correction that leaders of both parties have agreed to.\n\nBut the bill would be brought up on what’s known as “unanimous consent,” or UC, meaning only one member would have to object to force a full vote by the House – problematic because the House lawmakers are back in their districts due to the recess and not due back until next week.\n\nAnd at least one member is objecting: Rep. Louis Gohmert. The Texas Republican was one of 40 GOP lawmakers who voted against the bill early Saturday morning.

During this time, I encourage everyone to listen to state and local officials and follow CDC guidelines in order to help protect the health and well-being of everyone.”\n\nThe annual tradition brings hundreds of children to the White House South Lawn to hunt for eggs and play games. This year’s celebration had been scheduled for April 13.\n\nThe Easter Egg Roll officially dates back to 1878 and the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes, but first-hand accounts suggest that informal festivities began with egg-rolling parties under President Abraham Lincoln, according to the White House website.\n\nThe Easter Egg Roll was not held from 1917 to 1920 because of World War I and was canceled again from 1943 to 1945 during World War II. Food conservation and construction on the White House prevented any celebrations from 1946 to 1952 as well. President Dwight Eisenhower reinstated the tradition in 1953.\n\n- Michael Collins\n\nTrump administration, Congress negotiate paid leave for coronavirus\n\n​WASHINGTON – While the House voted overwhelmingly to approve coronavirus legislation early Saturday, and President Donald Trump strongly endorsed it, senators have voiced reservations about because of the impact on smaller businesses.\n\nThe Senate could approve legislation immediately with unanimous support. But Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would prefer that the Senate change the bill to improve it or approve nothing at all. He suggested that workers who fall ill or are quarantined should use state unemployment benefits.\n\n“Although mandating that all employers must pay for sick leave might sound good, we need to consider the unintended consequences of this legislation,” Johnson said. “I fear that rather than offering a workable solution, the House bill will exacerbate the problem by forcing small businesses to pay wages they cannot afford and ‘helping’ them go further into debt.”\n\nThe National Federation of Independent Business, which advocates for 325,000 small businesses, wrote to congressional leaders Friday that coronavirus has already hurt 23% of its members and 43% expect an impact within three months.\n\nBut the group criticized several elements, including mandating small businesses comply while exempting those with at least 500 workers. Struggling small businesses could apply for a waiver from the secretary of the Labor Department, but the exemption process is poorly defined, according to the group. Federal tax credits to reimburse businesses for paid leave might not arrive quickly enough, according to the group.\n\n“Businesses experiencing cash flow difficulties due to disruptions caused by COVID-19, combined with new federally mandated paid family and medical leave, may not stay afloat until the next quarterly payroll tax credit is claimed,” said the letter from Kevin Kuhlman, the group’s senior director for federal government relations. “By requiring small businesses to shoulder additional burdens and costs, small businesses who cannot afford to keep up will close.”\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who negotiated the legislation with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Fox News Sunday said businesses would be able to get a cash advance from the Internal Revenue Service, to avoid delays in reimbursements.\n\n“We were very focused we need to get the money to people quickly,” Mnuchin said. “We don't want them to have to deal with big bureaucracy.”\n\nThe House and Mnuchin had announced that technical corrections were needed before the legislation moves to the Senate. But amid reports of broader concerns from small businesses, Mnuchin said he was working with the Senate to resolve them.\n\n“We hope they pass this bill,” Mnuchin said. “If not, we'll work with the center on whatever minor changes we need.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate would work to approve legislation swiftly.\n\n“I know senators on both sides are carefully reviewing the details and are eager to act swiftly to help American workers, families, and small businesses navigate this challenging time,” McConnell said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nCoronavirus task force expected hold briefing as death toll rises\n\nMembers of the coronavirus task force are scheduled to hold a press briefing at 3:30 Monday afternoon as the US death toll from the virus rose to 69, with over 3,770 cases confirmed as of Monday morning.\n\nAccording to President Donald Trump's daily schedule, Trump is also scheduled to hold video meetings with the G-7 world leaders and the nation's governors on the coronavirus response.\n\nSurgeon General Jerome Adams said on Fox and Friends Monday morning the government was in discussions about giving guidance on elective surgeries amid heightened concerns about the disease, which has been named COVID-19.\n\n\"We're going to be talking more today to try to figure out how we can give more guidance because elective doesn’t mean non-urgent,\" Adams said.\n\n\"Things like tonsils, things like total hips and total knees, we need to pull those down until we can get a handle on this and flatten the curve so that we aren’t using up our PPE (personal protective equipment) that's going to be necessary to respond to coronavirus cases,\" he continued.\n\nMcConnell: Senate still needs to receive House coronavirus bill\n\nAlthough the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended against holding gatherings of more than 50 people at a time, the Senate, where the average age is 63, remains in session this week to act on surveillance legislation and to take up the coronavirus legislation the House passed shortly after midnight last Friday.\n\nIn a statement released Sunday evening, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate was still waiting to receive the coronavirus bill from the House.\n\n\"We still need to receive the final version of the House’s coronavirus relief legislation,\" McConnell said. \"I commend Sec. Mnuchin for his hard work on this. I know Senators on both sides are carefully reviewing the details and are eager to act swiftly to help American workers, families, and small businesses navigate this challenging time.\"\n\nThe Kentucky Republican said more steps needed to be taken to help Americans, small businesses, and the healthcare system and medical professionals in future legislative packages to address the coronavirus.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said over the weekend \"technical corrections\" needed to be made to the House bill before the Senate could take it up.

The tariff whiplash and escalation in the trade war has rattled financial markets.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll of Americans conducted March 11-12 showed that 57% believe Trump's moves to shake up the economy, which include deep cuts in government spending and mass firings of federal workers, are too erratic, and 53% think the tariff war will do more harm than good.\n\n−Reuters\n\nFederal judge orders Team Trump to rehire workers\n\nOn Thursday night, a second federal judge hearing the cases of fired government workers issued a sweeping order directing the Trump administration to restore thousands of terminated probationary workers.\n\nIn Maryland, U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar granted a temporary restraining order in a case filed by Democratic attorneys general in 19 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nBredar ruled the terminations by form letter didn't meet the law for notice of mass layoffs, and leaves too great a burden on the states without time to prepare for the services provided to the laid off employees. The federal government is the nation’s largest employer.\n\nBredar stayed the dismissals of probationary employees across 18 department and agencies and ordered they be returned to work by 1 p.m. Monday. Included in the order were the Commerce, Education, and Health and Human Services departments, as well as USAID.\n\nThe judge also stayed what he referred to as the \"illegal RIFs,\" or reductions in force, for 14 days, and ordered the administration to stop layoffs until they meet the rules requiring adequate notice.\n\n−Dinah Pulver\n\nTrump applauds Democratic Senate leader\n\nPresident Trump commended Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, thanking him for “doing the right thing” as the potential for a government shutdown continues to loom.\n\n“Took ‘guts’ and courage!” Trump wrote on Truth Social Friday morning.\n\nSchumer announced his intent to vote for Republicans’ spending bill in order to keep the federal government open and operating.\n\n“While the CR bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse,” he said during a speech on the Senate floor Thursday, referring to the measure, called a continuing resolution. “I believe it is my job to make the best choice for the country to minimize the harms to the American people.”\n\nDemocrats have criticized Schumer for his position.

Many scientists believe genetics, combined with environmental influences, play a role. They also say the rising incidence of autism could be attributed to earlier diagnostics and changes in how we diagnose autism.\n\nPeople who received a different diagnosis or no diagnosis in prior generations now have an autism diagnosis, said Ari Ne’eman, an assistant professor of health policy and management at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nWhat patients can do to educate themselves about autism\n\nDoctors say they expect more patients will ask about vaccine safety, Tylenol safety as well as leucovorin as a potential treatment for autism.\n\nWhile family doctors want to fully understand the causes of autism, the American Academy of Family Physicians said promoting \"myths\" about vaccine-autism or acetaminophen-autism links \"distracts from research and resources that will benefit people living with autism.\"\n\nAlthough Trump warned pregnant women to \"fight like hell\" to not take Tylenol while pregnant, many medical experts disagreed with this advice.\n\nMarketa Wills, CEO and medical director of the American Psychiatric Association, urged consumers to listen to their doctors and professional medical organizations.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reiterated that acetaminophen is safe for pregnant women. The American Academy of Pediatrics said there's no credible link between childhood vaccines and autism.\n\nWillis also said the FDA's efforts to relabel leucovorin is premature.\n\n\"There are early studies that are demonstrating some promise, but we are at least three to five years away from conclusively proving this as a treatment using sound scientific principles,\" Wills said.\n\n\"It's really important that patients talk to their physicians, and that physicians are receiving guidance from the medical professional associations, who, at this time, are standing tall on science,\" Wills said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/24"}]}
