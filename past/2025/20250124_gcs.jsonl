Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his successor have ruled out any changes to the current legal definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman.\n\n“We will try and maintain a balance…to uphold a stable society with traditional, heterosexual family values, but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and contribute to society,” Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said in parliament this week.\n\nBoth the repeal and the constitutional amendment were passed with an overwhelming majority, thanks to the ruling People’s Action Party’s dominance in parliament. There is no timeline yet for when the new laws take effect.\n\nThe changes do, however, leave room for a future parliament to expand the definition of marriage to include same-sex relationships.\n\nBryan Choong, chair of LGBTQ advocacy group Oogachaga, said it was a historical moment for activists who have been campaigning for a repeal of the law known as Section 377A for 15 years. But he added that LGBT couples and families also “have the right to be recognized and protected.”\n\nIn Singapore, attitudes to LGBT issues have shifted toward a more liberal stance in recent years, especially among the young, though conservative attitudes remain among religious groups. Of those aged 18-25, about 42% accepted same-sex marriage in 2018, up from 17% just five years prior, according to a survey by the Institute of Policy Studies.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/27/asia/singapore-gay-sex-marriage-law-conservative-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Why Singapore's gay sex law change is a double-edged sword for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Singapore announced this week it would end a colonial-era law that criminalized sex between men, it looked like a big victory for gay rights advocates in the Southeast Asian country.\n\nOn second look, to many it appeared to be a double-edged sword.\n\nThat’s because as it put an end to that law, the Singapore government reiterated its opposition to gay marriage.\n\nSoon after announcing that consensual gay sex would no longer be illegal, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his annual August rally speech that his government would “uphold and safeguard the institution of marriage” – defined in the Constitution as a union between man and woman.\n\nThat move appeared to be aimed at striking a compromise with conservative segments of society still vociferously opposed to same-sex marriage. Christianity is the third most popular religion in Singapore after Buddhism and Taoism, covering nearly one in five Singaporeans according to the 2020 census. At the same time, the city-state is home to various evangelical mega churches that preach against homosexuality.\n\nLee noted in his speech that gay rights remains “a highly sensitive and contentious” issue to conservatives in the country.\n\n“What we seek is a political accommodation, one that balances legitimate views and aspirations among Singaporeans,” Lee said.\n\n“But everyone has to accept that no (one) group can have things their way,” he added.\n\nTo gay rights activists, the continuing ban on same-sex marriage is a significant blow. At stake is more than the option of having a white wedding in church: in Singapore, couples in registered marriages have access to greater housing subsidies and adoption rights than single people.\n\nSo while activists in the LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) community welcomed the repeal of the gay sex law, many were disappointed too.\n\nAnd that disappointment will only have deepened with the suggestion by some of Lee’s ministers that not only would the government remain opposed to gay marriage – it may even create extra hurdles to prevent people from seeking to challenge the marriage laws in court.\n\nLaw minister K Shanmugam said in an interview with state media that Parliament, rather than the courts, would hold the power to define marriage – effectively making it harder for people to legally challenge the government’s policies as several gay men have attempted in recent years.\n\nThat has played well with some conservative religious groups.\n\n“We are heartened that the government has indicated they will be taking steps to protect the prevailing norms and values of the Singaporean society on the issue of marriage,” said Bishop Titus Chung in a statement issued on behalf of the Diocese of Singapore.\n\nThe National Churches Council, made up of several local churches and Christian organizations, said that its members “further appreciated” the government’s assurance that it would “uphold and safeguard the institution of marriage.”\n\nAnd the Singapore Catholic Church also welcomed the government’s move. “Otherwise, we will be taking a slippery road of no return, weakening the fabric of a strong society which is founded on the bedrock of holistic families and marriages,” it said.\n\nActivists, meanwhile, have signaled their disappointment.\n\n“Any move by the government to introduce further legislation or constitutional amendments that signal LGBTQ+ people as unequal citizens is disappointing,” more than 20 activist groups said in a joint statement.\n\n‘This isn’t the end’\n\nStill, some activists say they prefer to focus on the positives, at least for now.\n\nAs associate law professor Eugene Tan of the Singapore Management University put it: “Singapore removed a law long regarded as being discriminatory towards gay men. To view the current situation as removing one prohibition in favor of preserving another is overlooking the progress made.”\n\nIn 2012, Gary Lim and Kenneth Chee, a gay couple who had been together for 15 years, challenged the law against gay sex at Singapore’s High Court.\n\n“For us, repealing (the gay sex law) was never about gay marriage,” the couple said. “We are just both relieved that after ten years, (its abolition) has happened during our lifetime.”\n\nA gay rights supporter at the annual Pink Dot event in Singapore. AFP Contributor/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHowever, they admit to being disappointed with the government’s remarks on marriage.\n\n“We expected that to happen, but it isn’t the end,” Lim said. “The work doesn’t stop and with this repeal, things will get stronger and move forward as the queer community heals.”\n\n“Getting married would be a nice acknowledgment of our relationship and love for each other but at this point, it isn’t the most important thing,” Chee said.\n\n“But it (puzzles me) how our marriage would affect straight marriages, that I don’t understand,” he added.\n\n“I hope that the conservatives can one day see gay people are not dangerous or a threat to them or their children. They don’t have to fear us.”\n\n“And maybe in the future we can all forge a relationship and work together.”", "authors": ["Heather Chen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/21/asia/japan-same-sex-marriage-ban-gay-rights-court-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Japanese court upholds ban on same-sex marriage | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nJapan’s ban on same-sex marriage is not unconstitutional, a court has ruled, dealing a blow to gay couples and activists seeking greater rights for the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe Osaka district court on Monday dismissed a lawsuit in which three same-sex couples were seeking compensation from the government of 1 million yen (about $7,400) per person, arguing the lack of recognition of same-sex marriages violated their constitutional right to equality.\n\nBut the court sided with the government, ruling that under the constitution the definition of marriage did not extend to partnerships between people of the same gender, public broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nThe ruling of the Osaka court dashed the hopes of gay rights activists who are pressuring the government to rethink its opposition to same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Osaka court’s ruling came in stark contrast to a historic judgment by the Sapporo district court in Japan’s northern Hokkaido prefecture in March 2021.\n\nOn that occasion, the Sapporo court ruled the government’s failure to recognize same-sex marriage violated the constitutional right to equality – though it too had dismissed a similar claim for damages.\n\nJapan remains the only Group of Seven (G7) country that has not recognized either same-sex civil unions or same-sex marriage at a national level.\n\nHowever, some parts of the country issue “partnership certificates” that grant some rights to same-sex couples, such as allowing them to rent properties and have hospital visitation rights.\n\nSame-sex marriages in Asia\n\nJapan, where homosexuality has been legal since 1880, is relatively liberal compared to some Asian nations.\n\nFor example, gay sex remains illegal in Singapore despite growing calls to change the colonial-era law.\n\nIndia’s Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that gay sex was no longer a criminal offense. However, the country does not recognize same-sex marriages.\n\nChina also does not recognize same-sex marriages despite growing awareness of LGBTQ issues in the country. While there are no laws against same-sex relationships in China, it remains a taboo topic that is routinely scrutinized and even censored on social media.\n\nSome corners of Asia have seen recent progress on the issue, however.\n\nIn 2019, the self-ruled island of Taiwan became the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nAnd this month, Thailand edged closer to becoming the first place in Southeast Asia to legalize same-sex unions when lawmakers passed four different bills aiming to provide greater rights to gay couples, such as the ability to adopt children and manage assets jointly.", "authors": ["Kathleen Magramo Jorge Engels Junko Ogura", "Kathleen Magramo", "Jorge Engels", "Junko Ogura"], "publish_date": "2022/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/11/church-study/15437001/", "title": "U.S. churches feel beat of change", "text": "Cathy Lynn Grossman\n\nReligion News Service\n\nCorrections and Clarifications: An earlier version of this story misidentified America's three largest denominations. The United Methodist Church is the country's third largest congregation. The churches referenced in the story are among the three largest.\n\nU.S. religious congregations are marching to their own drums more than ever.\n\nThe National Congregations Study's latest look at the country's churches, synagogues and mosques — the third wave of studies that began in 1998 — finds more congregations:\n\n•Open their doors to gays and lesbians in active membership and in leadership.\n\n•Show racial and ethnic diversity in the pews.\n\n•Encourage hand-waving, amen-shouting and dancing in the aisles during worship.\n\n•Disconnect from denominational ties, doctrines and rules that might slow or block change.\n\nThe study, released Thursday, draws on interviews with leaders at 1,331 nationally representative congregations and updates data from 1998 and 2006 studies. Non-Christian congregations were included in the study, but there are too few for statistical analysis by topics.\n\nDuke University sociology professor Mark Chaves, who directed the study, said he was surprised by how much the acceptance of gays and lesbians has risen since 2006, the first time the study asked about gay involvement in religious congregational life.\n\nCongregations that \"permit full-fledged membership for openly gay or lesbian couples in a committed relationship\" climbed to 48% in 2012, up from 37% in 2006.\n\nMost congregations still draw a line at permitting gays to take leadership positions, though the number of congregations allowing gays in leadership is rising; it stands at 26%, up from 18%.\n\nA look by regions shows this liberalization roughly mirrors the state-by-state legalization of same-sex marriage, which began in New England, then swept down to the mid-Atlantic and west to California by 2012. The stand-out exception: Only about 4% of white conservative evangelical or fundamentalist churches permit gays in leadership roles.\n\nRoman Catholic churches turned more sharply conservative during the years of the study focus. The percentage of Catholic churches permitting full-fledged membership for gays dropped to 53%, down from 74% of congregations. Those permitting gays in leadership roles fell to 26% from 39%.\n\nThe Rev. James Martin, editor at large for the Jesuit magazine America, observed, \"During those years, U.S. bishops were much more vocal against gay marriage. It's only been in the last year or two — since the election of Pope Francis — that the church has begun opening up on this.\"\n\nFor women, there's no statistical progress in the NCS study. Despite a handful of recently named women senior pastors, the percentage of congregations with women in the top post has been locked at roughly 11% since 1998. Some of America's largest denominations — the Catholic, the Southern Baptist Convention and Mormon churches — do not permit congregations to ordain women.\n\nFor diversity, look to the pews, particularly in predominantly white congregations.\n\nIn 2012, 11% of congregations had an all-white membership, down from 20% in 1998. About a third of congregations have some Hispanics, and nearly a quarter have some Asians. Behind the change, Chaves said, are factors such as upward mobility by blacks, increasing rates of interracial marriage and immigration.\n\nStill, in an upcoming issue of the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Chaves wrote, \"We do not want to overstate the significance of this increasing ethnic diversity within American congregations. Eighty-six percent of American congregations (containing 80% of religious service attendees) remain overwhelmingly white or black or Hispanic or Asian or whatever.\"\n\nChaves said in an interview, \"On the ground, this means there are more white congregations with a smattering of minorities. However, the percent of mainly black churches with some white people is not increasing.\"\n\nThe NCS finds distinctive religious denominational brands are losing congregational market share. Nearly one in four congregations — 23% — described themselves as non-denominational, up from 18% in 1998. Non-denominational churches can have greater leeway in leadership, teachings and style of worship.\n\nLook in the aisles for changes in the way people worship. The trend toward informal, entertaining and exuberant worship services, first marked in 1998, continues to climb, the study finds.\n\nMore people attend congregations where drums are played during the main service — up to 46% in 2012 from 25% in 1998. Every tradition from Catholic to Protestant to non-Christian pumped up the beat by 7 to 20 percentage points or more.\n\nThe margin of error was +/-3 percentage points for most findings for the survey.\n\nEighty percent of people attending black Protestant congregations reported that people jump, shout or dance during the main service, up from 66% in 1998.\n\nThis worship-in-motion trend is increasingly true for people who attend white evangelical conservative or fundamentalist congregations (25%, up from 16% in the first study). Other groups, particularly people who worship at white moderate or liberal churches and Catholics, still keep to their seats.\n\nMore Protestants, conservative or liberal, attend services where worshipers raise their hands during the main service (59% in 2012, up from 48% in 1998).\n\nHowever, Martin of America magazine observed, enthusiastic worship is growing among Catholics in ethnic congregations where the service \"has a different cultural flair. You might see something very different at a Hispanic Mass in Los Angeles than on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It's more a cultural divide than a religious one.\"\n\nChaves wondered whether all the spontaneous expressions of enthusiasm during worship affects the religious message. He speculates that there's \"more emphasis on generating a kind of religious experience as opposed to teaching religious knowledge or doctrine.\"\n\nHardly, countered Marcia McFee, a worship consultant and speaker who coaches subscribing church leaders at her website worshipdesignstudio.com. She works with mainline denominations and churches on enhancing their services with light, sound and motion.\n\nThe Christian message should be a \"deeply rich sensory experience,\" McFee said, so people \"can embody that which we proclaim.\"\n\nSit-still-and-listen is not the way many people connect with God, McFee said. \"For some, it doesn't feel like a spiritual pursuit unless they're engaged by dancing or drumming or raising a hand or absorbed in rich visuals.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/europe/russia-lgbtq-propaganda-law-signed-by-putin-intl/index.html", "title": "Putin signs expanded anti-LGBTQ laws in Russia, in latest ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed into law a bill that expands a ban on so-called LGBTQ “propaganda” in Russia, making it illegal for anyone to promote same-sex relationships or suggest that non-heterosexual orientations are “normal.”\n\nThe ban was rubber-stamped by Putin just days after a harsh new “foreign agents” law came into effect, as the Kremlin cracks down on free speech and human rights as its military operation in Ukraine falters.\n\nThe new laws significantly broaden the scope of a 2013 law which banned the dissemination of LGBTQ-related information to minors. The new iteration extends the ban on promoting such information to adults as well.\n\nThe new laws make it illegal to promote or “praise” LGBTQ relationships, publicly express non-heterosexual orientations or suggest that they are “normal.”\n\nThe package of amendments signed by Putin include heavier penalties for anyone promoting “non-traditional sexual relations and/or preferences,” as well as pedophilia and gender transition. Under the new law, it will be banned across the internet, media, books, audiovisual services, cinema, and advertising.\n\nUnder the new law, individuals can be fined up to 400,000 rubles ($6,370) for “LGBT propaganda” and up to 200,000 rubles ($3,185) for “demonstrations of LGBT and information that encourages a change of gender among teenagers.”\n\nThese fines rise to up to 5 million rubles ($80,000) and 4 million rubles ($64,000) respectively for legal entities.\n\nThe law was approved by the Russia’s upper and lower houses in recent weeks.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2017 that the 2013 law is discriminatory, promotes homophobia and violates the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe court found that the law “served no legitimate public interest,” rejecting suggestions that public debate on LGBT issues could influence children to become homosexual, or that it threatened public morals.\n\nHomosexuality was decriminalized in Russia in 1993, but homophobia and discrimination is still rife. It is ranked 46th out of 49 European countries for LGBTQ+ inclusion by watchdog ILGA-Europe.\n\nSpeaking before Putin signed the bill into the law on Monday, Tanya Lokshina, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch said: “The 2013 ‘gay propaganda’ law was an unabashed example of political homophobia, and the new draft legislation amplifies that in broader and harsher ways.”\n\nBut the broadening of the “LGBT propaganda” law is just the latest in many steps that Putin’s government has taken in recent months to crush the last pockets of opposition, liberal values and free speech in Russia.\n\nA new, expanded version of the 2012 law on foreign agents came into effect last week. While the original version required organizations engaging in political activity and receiving funding from abroad to register as foreign agents and adhere to draconian rules and restrictions, the new law extends that requirement to anyone who has “received support and (or) is under foreign influence”.\n\nIn early March, just days after Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian government adopted a law criminalizing the dissemination of what it called “deliberately false” information about the Russian armed forces.

Wade, the 50-year-old court precedent enshrining a right to abortion.\n\nDoing so now gives state lawmakers the green light to aggressively limit or ban abortion.\n\nSince a draft for Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was leaked last month, CNN readers have asked hundreds of questions about what a reversal of the Supreme Court’s abortion rights precedents would mean and how it will affect access to the procedure. The final decision released Friday closely tracked the leaked draft.\n\nWe’re reading as many questions as we can and answering some of the most popular here.\n\nIs the Supreme Court actually overturning the law or merely saying the decision belongs with each state’s law?\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned previous court precedent that preempted state laws banning abortion before the fetus is viable, a point around 23 weeks into the pregnancy. In overturning the Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood decisions, the Supreme Court allows states to pursue bans and other restrictions on pre-viability abortion.\n\nThe ruling will not have the effect of banning abortion nationwide. According to the logic expressed in the draft decision (and with the caveat that it can still be changed before the final opinion comes out), the question of abortion policy would then go to state and local lawmakers – and potentially federal lawmakers as well.\n\nWill women get arrested for having an abortion if the Supreme Court deems it illegal?\n\nAn abortion-seeker’s criminal liability will depend on the abortion policies that her state put into place.\n\nLeaders of the anti-abortion movement have said in the past that women shouldn’t be prosecuted for obtaining abortion, and that criminal laws prohibiting it should be aimed at abortion providers or others who facilitate the procedure. Several states with abortion prohibitions that would go into effect with a Roe reversal have language exempting from prosecution the woman who obtained the abortion, but an abortion ban in Wyoming appears to muddle this question with its reference to the “pregnant woman” in the relevant code.\n\nThere’s also nothing to stop lawmakers from passing laws calling for the prosecution of the people who sought the abortion. A state legislator in Louisiana recently proposed a bill that would charge women with murder for obtaining abortion, though that bill failed to advance. Critics of the anti-abortion movement also note that, even with Roe on the books, women have been prosecuted for pregnancies that ended in miscarriage or stillbirth.\n\nWhat methods do lawmakers propose to enforce these laws? What can they legally do to find out if someone is pregnant?\n\nThe state abortion prohibitions that will go into effect with the Roe reversal don’t spell out specific enforcement tactics. The lengths local prosecutors will go to enforce abortion restrictions is very much an unanswered question. Before Roe, the aggressiveness of the enforcement of abortion bans often depended on the political environment, including the local environment that prosecutors were navigating. Now, some prosecutors in Democratic-leaning jurisdictions are vowing to not bring criminal charges under abortion restrictions that go into effect with the new Supreme Court opinion.\n\nThe information the prosecutors will seek from health care providers in order to enforce abortion bans IS very much a concern for reproductive rights advocates. HIPAA protections that typically shield an individual’s medical information from disclosure have exemptions for certain law enforcement contexts that may come into play if Roe is overturned. Likewise, there are concerns that the data that can be obtained from an abortion-seeker’s digital devices may be used to determine if she obtained an abortion. That could include information about her menstrual cycle in a period-tracking application, some fear, or search terms she uses for internet searches.\n\nBased on the legal arguments contained in the leaked draft opinion, are there any other legal precedents and SCOTUS opinions that this ruling would overturn beyond Roe v Wade? What further rights and privileges could be at risk of being scaled back if the draft becomes the law of the land?\n\nThe draft Dobbs opinion – if it became the court’s formal ruling – wouldn’t overturn other closely watched precedents in areas like same-sex marriage, contraception and interracial marriage. Those cases, like abortion, are grounded in a right to privacy that is not explicitly laid out in the Constitution, but that the court has said is implied. The Supreme Court, in handing down Roe and its successor Casey, tied the right to an abortion to the precedents in 1965’s Griswold v. Connecticut and 1967’s Loving v. Virginia, which struck down state restrictions on contraceptives and interracial marriage, respectively. The 2003 Lawrence v. Texas ruling invalidating Texas’ anti-sodomy law and the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide relied on Loving and Griswold as well.\n\nIn the Dobbs draft that leaked, Alito went out of his way in his draft to describe Roe as distinct from those other rulings grounded in a right to privacy because, he wrote, “Abortion destroys…potential life.”\n\n“None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite,” Alito wrote. “They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way.”\n\nStill, skeptics see the Roe reversal as opening the door to challenges to those other precedents, with Obergefell being the most vulnerable. Alito himself wrote a dissent to the 2015 ruling that argued that “The Constitution says nothing about a right to same-sex marriage, but the Court holds that the term ‘liberty’ in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment encompasses this right.”\n\nConservative lawmakers and legal advocates have also argued the court’s Obergefell precedent makes the same errors the court made in enshrining abortion rights.\n\nThe Mississippi law at issue bans abortion starting from 15 weeks after the last menstrual period. If the Supreme Court allows this law to stand, will it then be legal to ban abortion at earlier points in pregnancy? Will it be possible for states to ban medication-induced first-trimester abortions, which are the most common type? Many states seem poised to do so.\n\nIf the draft opinion that was leaked was adopted, not only would the Mississippi 15-week ban be upheld, but states – and potentially the federal government – would be allowed to ban abortion earlier in the pregnancy, including medication-induced first trimester abortions. More than a dozen states have so-called “trigger laws,” under which bans on abortion would be implemented if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, and several more have other types of bans that could go into effect with the reversal of previous Supreme Court precedent.\n\nBut until the court issues its final opinion, we won’t know for sure how aggressively states will be allowed to restrict abortion under the court’s new precedent.\n\nIn the event of rape or incest or even underage pregnancy of say 14 years old, where does the law lie for these individuals if Roe vs Wade is overturned?\n\nIf Roe is overturned, exemptions in abortion bans for rape, incest or health of the mother will vary state by state. In the wave of abortion limits that have been passed by state legislatures recently in anticipation of the Supreme Court’s ruling, only a few of the proposals included exemptions for rape and incest.\n\nIt’s a question lawmakers will likely revisit once the Supreme Court’s ruling, assuming it overturns Roe, is handed down. While previewing plans to call a special legislative session once the opinion is issued, Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he opposed rape or incest exemptions. The six-week ban he signed into law last year – which is currently blocked by court order – included those exemptions.\n\nOn the flip side, Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson told CNN this May that he supported adding rape and incest exemptions in the trigger law currently on the books in the state.\n\nHow are in vitro fertilizations defined? If a state defines the fertilized egg as a human with rights, then if a doctor fertilizes four eggs, but does [not] implant all four in a woman, is that homicide?\n\nWhat a Roe reversal would mean for fertility treatments is a major uncertainty.\n\nPhysicians and legal experts in the field are currently grappling with state abortion policies frame their laws around the moment of fertilization, when the egg has united with the sperm. Some of those state laws have language that would appear to exempt the disposal of unused embryos created for IVF, but that language doesn’t necessarily exempt the process of selective reduction, when a woman whose fertility treatments lead to a multiple pregnancy has one or more of those fetuses terminated to protect the viability of the other fetuses and/or the health of the mother. More broadly, fertility law experts raise concerns about how a Roe reversal will embolden lawmakers to regulate IVF procedures – which have been largely shielded from the abortion debate because of the protections of Roe.\n\nIf the current heavily conservative Supreme Court can overturn Roe v. Wade, that’s been on the books for decades, what’s to stop a future heavily liberal court from overturning this current anti-Roe v. Wade decision in say, 20 years from now?\n\nTechnically, there’s nothing to stop a Supreme Court from revisiting abortion precedent and a court with a more liberal makeup may very well do so. However, one reason that a future liberal Supreme Court majority might be disinclined to change a major precedent again is if those justices feel more loyalty to the principle of stare decisis – the legal principle that discourages overturning precedent unless certain conditions are met – than the loyalty that has been shown by the conservative majority poised to reverse Roe.\n\nThis respect for precedence, for instance, is why Chief Justice John Roberts voted in 2020 to strike down a Louisiana abortion clinic regulation, after he dissented in a 2016 case where the majority struck down a similar Texas law.\n\nCan the right to an abortion be codified by a national vote?\n\nNot directly. A constitutional amendment could be enacted to extend that right. But the process of amending US Constitution begins with a proposal that has the support of either two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, or with a convention called for by two-thirds of the states. Ratification of an amendment requires the support of three-fourths of state legislatures or three-fourths of conventions in each state.\n\nWhy does the currently Democrat-controlled legislature not pass a federal law making abortion legal? This would make the SCOTUS decision a non issue.\n\nDemocrats currently lack the votes to dismantle the Senate filibuster, a 60-vote procedural mechanism that Republicans can use to block federal abortion rights legislation – so as long as 40 senators oppose abortion rights. But it’s worth noting that the Women’s Health Protection Act – a bill would codify and expand upon Roe – failed 49-51 when it was voted on in May in the Senate, meaning that, even without the filibuster, it would have not become law.\n\nThere are also legal questions about whether it would be constitutional for federal lawmakers to enact a nationwide ban. The late Justice Antonin Scalia stressed in his legal writings about abortion that the policy-decisions belonged in the hands of individual states, while expressing skepticism that Congress has the constitutional authority to regulate the procedure. Friday, Alito used notably open-ended language that doesn’t limit the provenance of abortion legislation to state lawmakers.\n\nCan anti-abortion states prevent women from crossing state lines to get an abortion in another state? It worries me that states could enact further laws restricting women the choice to leave the state to have an abortion.\n\nAnti-abortion state lawmakers have already expressed interest in regulating conduct around abortion that happens outside of their borders. Perhaps the most aggressive example is a failed bill in Missouri that would have extended its abortion laws to out-of-state abortions if the mother is a Missouri resident or if “Sexual intercourse occurred within this state and the child may have been conceived by that act of intercourse.” That proposal hasn’t advanced, but there are other examples of this tactic that might move forward in the future. A handful of Texas lawmakers, for instance, are calling for penalties for companies that cover the costs for employees who travel out of state to obtain abortions.\n\nThe legal authority that state lawmakers have to reach beyond state lines is very much an open question and the topic of a coming law review article that provides more information about the relevant precedents.\n\nIs it possible that women and men who are pro-choice could send abortion pills to women in other states with draconian anti-abortion laws?\n\nWith medication abortion – a two pill regimen that terminates a pregnancy – becoming the method used in a majority of abortions performed nationwide, red states have already been cracking down on the mailing of abortion pills and on administering the pills without an in-person visit with a physician. These state laws started gaining steam after the FDA allowed for the mailing of abortion pills in a pandemic-related move that has now been made permanent. If Roe is overturned, medication abortion will be covered by abortion bans and we might see other types of proposals to limit medication abortion.\n\nBut how to enforce these restrictions on mailing abortion pills is another question anti-abortion lawmakers are still working through. Texas last year updated its previously existing ban on mailing abortion pills to make it the type of crime that would warrant extradition. Blue states have countered with measures that would prohibit their state authorities from cooperating with such extradition requests.\n\nThere are also international sources from which women in anti-abortion states may seek delivery of medication abortion.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/us/five-things-november-30-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for Nov. 30: Rail strike, Jan. 6, Marriage bill, China ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet 5 Things in your inbox Your day is busy. 5 Things is your one-stop shop for the latest headlines, plus other stories and videos that people are clicking on.

The Justice Department alleged that the Oath Keepers conspired to forcibly stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power from then-President Donald Trump to Joe Biden and plotted to attack the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Rhodes and Meggs face a 20-year maximum prison sentence on the charge of seditious conspiracy.

Same-sex marriage\n\nThe Senate on Tuesday passed legislation to protect same-sex and interracial marriage in a landmark bipartisan vote. The bill, called the Respect for Marriage Act, was supported by all members of the Democratic caucus and 12 Republicans. The final vote was 61-36. “For millions of Americans, this legislation will safeguard the rights and protections to which LGBTQI+ and interracial couples and their children are entitled,” President Biden said in a statement after Senate passage. The bill would require individual states to recognize another state’s legal marriage, although it stops short of setting a national requirement that all states must legalize same-sex marriage. The House will now need to approve the legislation before sending it to Biden’s desk to be signed into law.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why Jim Obergefell is not celebrating the Senate's same-sex marriage bill 01:57 - Source: CNN Why Jim Obergefell is not celebrating the Senate's same-sex marriage bill 01:57\n\n4.

Yair Lapid takes over as caretaker prime ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nJerusalem CNN —\n\nYair Lapid is used to being in the spotlight.\n\nThe son of a prominent family, Lapid has dabbled in acting, screenwriting, music and even amateur boxing, before becoming best known to the Israeli public as a journalist-turned-politician.\n\nNow Lapid will be entering his biggest spotlight yet – as Israel’s caretaker prime minister.\n\nLapid officially took over as caretaker prime minister on Friday after the country’s parliament, the Knesset, passed a bill to dissolve itself a day earlier.\n\nHe’s now preparing for elections, trying to keep former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from climbing back to power.\n\nA media celebrity\n\nDespite his brief acting foray, Lapid became a mainstay in Israelis’ living rooms through the news. After briefly working as a print journalist, he made his way on to television in the mid-1990s, hosting one of the biggest talk shows of the era.\n\nBut in 2012 Lapid changed course following in the footsteps of his journalist-turned politician father. He created a new political party, dubbed “Yesh Atid” (There is a Future) and positioned himself as the centrist voice of the middle-class Israeli, focusing on domestic issues. He promised to tackle housing costs, end exemptions from the military draft for the Ultra-Orthodox, and to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\n“What unites all of (our supporters) is that they said yes for hope and yes for mutual responsibility and yes to the fact that the truth is not being held in any side,” Lapid said at the time.\n\nA centrist for all\n\nIn his first campaign, Lapid tried to portray his party as one all Israelis could be part of, even unveiling his diplomatic platform from a settlement in the occupied West Bank. He supports an independent Palestinian state, but says East Jerusalem shouldn’t be its capital. He opposes new settlement construction but says large existing settlement blocs should always be a part of Israel.\n\n“Yair Lapid is the quintessential product of Tel Aviv, of Israel’s main secular city, its main business and culture center, center of nightlife and so on,” Anshel Pfeffer, a correspondent for Haaretz and The Economist, told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.\n\n“Many Israelis, including Israelis who were close to his centrist perhaps leaning leftward politics and views, including many of my colleagues in Israeli media, didn’t take him seriously. They thought he’s a performer, he’s a presenter, there’s no real substance there, this will be a passing phase.”\n\nBut Lapid’s party shocked the Israeli political establishment by winning 19 seats in the 2013 elections, second only to Netanyahu’s Likud party. Lapid was dubbed Israel’s new political star, and Time Magazine named him as one of 2013’s “100 Most Influential People.”\n\nHe joined then-Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government as finance minister but was fired within less than two years and became one of the opposition’s top voices.\n\nThe most diverse coalition\n\nIn 2021 after four inconclusive elections in two years, it was Lapid who was the architect of the coalition that would ultimately oust Netanyahu and end his run as Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.\n\nPulling together parties from across the political spectrum, from the far left to those on the right, and even including the first Arab party in to sit in a governing coalition – the new government held a one-seat majority.\n\nBut it came at a cost to Lapid’s own political ambitions. As part of the deal to bring the right-winger Naftali Bennett on board as prime minister, Lapid would only take over after two years.\n\n“Lapid brought together this very unwieldy, almost unimaginable, unprecedented coalition of eight parties (and) managed to get them all to vote for Naftali Bennett as prime minister, managed to maintain them for an entire year, and above all for many Israelis he is now the only man in the last 12 years to beat Netanyahu – that by itself is a big achievement,” Pfeffer said.\n\nLapid was appointed foreign minister, where he traversed the globe meeting with world leaders and, notably, Israel’s new Arab-state allies. It was Lapid who hosted the historic Negev summit, where the top diplomatic representatives from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt and the United States met in southern Israel for the first time in March 2022.\n\nBut ultimately it was the coalition’s ideological diversity that was also the source of its fragility. It lost its parliamentary majority when two members of Bennett’s own right-wing party defected. And when some left-leaning members refused to support a recurring bill that among other things, gives Israeli settlers in the West Bank the same civil rights as citizens in Israel, the coalition reached a political impasse.\n\nIn a shock move, Lapid and Bennett announced last week they would dissolve their own government and trigger new elections, making Lapid interim prime minister.\n\nStanding together in a show of solidarity, Lapid told Bennett “I love you,” a moment of outward bromance that surprised many in the Israeli media.\n\nLapid will be the first non-right-wing prime minister of Israel in more than a decade. He now has four months to convince the public he should keep the job. Elections will be held on November 1.\n\nThe digest\n\nUnilever sells Ben & Jerry’s Israel business after controversy\n\nUnilever has sold its Ben & Jerry’s business in Israel for an undisclosed amount to American Quality Products (AQP), which distributes Ben & Jerry’s in the country, following the controversy related to its activities in Israel and the West Bank. Critics took the company to task for doing business in Israel – especially in West Bank settlements, considered illegal under international law – arguing it doesn’t align with Ben & Jerry’s liberal image. Ben & Jerry’s will now be sold under its Hebrew and Arabic names throughout Israel and the West Bank\n\nBackground: Unilever said Wednesday that it “has used the opportunity of the past year to listen to perspectives on this complex and sensitive matter and believes this is the best outcome for Ben & Jerry’s in Israel.” The ice cream company, however, tweeted that it doesn’t agree with Unilever’s announcement. “We continue to believe it is inconsistent with Ben & Jerry’s values for our ice cream to be sold in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,” it tweeted, adding it will no longer profit from Ben & Jerry’s in Israel.\n\nWhy it matters: The sale ends a long saga that had angered ice cream fans on every side of the Israel-Palestine conflict, but it also highlights the challenges facing consumer brands doing business in the region.\n\nEgyptian court sentences to death man accused of killing a 21-year-old student\n\nA man accused of fatally stabbing a woman last week after she rejected his advances was sentenced to death by a state court in Egypt, according to state-run Al Ahram on Tuesday.\n\nBackground: The verdict, issued after two court sessions, will be deferred to Egypt’s top Islamic authority, the Grand Mufti – a formality in death penalty cases in the country, Al-Ahram said.

In signing the agreement, Turkey has agreed to support Finland and Sweden’s NATO membership bids, removing the last major hurdle to the two countries joining the alliance. “If the promise is not kept, we will do what is necessary in the agreement,” Erdogan said at a news conference on Thursday, adding that Turkey would not ratify the agreement.\n\nBackground: Turkey previously said it would veto Sweden and Finland’s NATO membership bids claiming they harbor members of Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which Turkey, the EU and the US recognize as a terror organization. The 10-article memorandum says Sweden and Finland will address Turkey’s pending extradition requests of terror suspects in accordance with the European Convention on Extradition.\n\nWhy it matters: Sweden and Finland formally ending decades of neutrality and joining NATO would be a historic breakthrough for the alliance, and deal a blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAround the region\n\nA view of Saint Hilarion, another archaeological site in the Gaza Strip, on June 8. The site of Saint Hilarion is also being supported by French NGO Premiere Urgence Internationale Mahmud Hams/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAn ancient tomb dating as far back as 2,400 years to the Roman era has been unearthed by archeologists in the Gaza Strip, showcasing the coastal enclave’s rich history.\n\nSituated on the coast of northern Gaza, the tomb is a momentous find for the Palestinians living in the territory.\n\nThe tomb is part of a larger Roman cemetery that was discovered by accident earlier this year, said Jehad Abu Hassan, the Gaza Strip field coordinator for Premiere Urgence Internationale, a French NGO that is involved in helping to preserve Gaza’s heritage. “This is the first time a Roman cemetery has been found in Gaza.” The NGO has also supported work at another archeological site in central Gaza called Saint Hilarion.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for relics to be excavated in this region due to its historical geographic significance, which meant various civilizations moved through the area over the centuries.\n\nThe tomb is part of an ongoing archeological dig that has been in progress for months, where Abu Hassan says 40 graves have been found.\n\n“It’s great that we protect and keep this rich heritage of Gaza for future generations,” he told CNN. “When we talk to children about their heritage they are very happy to see that people were coming from everywhere [to Gaza].”\n\nThe tombs stand out due to the social standing of those people they belonged to, according to a Palestinian official in Gaza.\n\n“Some of the graves were decorated with elegant decorations,” said Mohammed Khalla, undersecretary for Gaza’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, speaking to Quds Press news agency. “Which indicates they belonged to figures who had a social and administrative status in Roman society at the time.”\n\nThe ministry said it is in the process of securing the necessary funding to preserve the site, according to Quds Press.\n\nInterest in protecting the tomb arises from its location near the Anthedon (Blakhiyah) harbor, Gaza’s first port and a landmark that played a crucial role in connecting the territory to Europe thousands of years ago.\n\nBy Ghazi Nasser\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Hadas Gold"], "publish_date": "2022/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/us/abortion-christian-debate-blake-cec/index.html", "title": "Abortion debate: These two Christians worship the same Jesus.

Stefani Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBoth personify the divisions over abortion in the church — and show how complex the issue can be when two smart and well-informed people cite scripture to support their point of view.\n\nThe US Supreme Court addressed a momentous legal question Friday when the court’s conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade, stripping away nationwide access to abortion. For the first time in almost 50 years, Americans are living in a country where abortion is not enshrined as a constitutional right.\n\nBut the debate will continue over access to abortion, which is both a moral and religious issue for many people of faith like Ellis and Horn.\n\nWhile much of the debate around abortion has been filtered through angry protests and shouted slogans, CNN chose to interview these two Christians because each has penned thoughtful public essays on the issue.\n\nTrent Horn, left, and Laura Ellis. Courtesy Trent Horn/Laura Ellis\n\nHorn, author of “Persuasive Pro-life,” wrote a recent essay, “Catholics Can’t Be Pro-Choice,” in which he argued that all “reasonable” people should oppose legal abortion because it is the taking of a life. “If the unborn are not human beings, then abortion is harmless surgery. But if the unborn are growing, they must be alive,” he wrote.\n\nEllis is author of a recent essay, “Why I’m a pro-choice Christian and believe you should be too.” One of her biggest criticisms of abortion rights opponents is that “often these activists fail to support other political causes that preserve the life of the child after being born.”\n\nWe asked both Ellis and Horn the same four questions and received dramatically different responses. Their answers were edited for brevity.\n\nHow does your faith shape your position on abortion?\n\nHorn: My faith informs me that God created human beings in His image. He loves human beings, and He wants us to share that same love and promote justice towards every other human being. Since my faith teaches me that every single human being, every single member of our species is equal in value and dignity, then my faith informs me that I should never directly kill an innocent member of our species just because they’re unwanted. My faith informs me that every single human being, from the moment they’re conceived until the moment they die, deserves equal protection under the law.\n\nAnti-abortion protesters pray as demonstrators gather outside the Houston, Texas, City Hall during a Bans Off Our Bodies rally on May 14, 2022. Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEllis: I do believe in the sanctity of human life, and I would love to see a world with less abortions. But I also know that banning abortion is going to most harshly affect people in society who are already really marginalized, and rich White women are always going to be able to have access to safe, affordable abortion. Making abortion illegal is going to disproportionately affect young women, women in poverty, women of color, in rural areas, women who don’t have a support system that some people are privileged to have. These are the kind of people that Jesus was always advocating for in his life and ministry. I first and foremost am always going to side with a living, breathing, human woman and what’s best for her and for her family situation.\n\nWhat Bible passages do you cite to justify your position?\n\nHorn: The Bible does not explicitly mention abortion, so it doesn’t say that abortion itself is wrong, but it also doesn’t say that infanticide is wrong or that pedophilia is wrong. Instead, I use scripture to inform me with general principles. The Bible is clear in Exodus 23:7 and Proverbs 6:16-17 that it is wrong to kill innocent human beings. Proverbs 6 says that God hates the hands that shed innocent blood.\n\nIf the Bible says that it’s wrong to kill innocent human beings, and science and sound reasoning tell us that human embryos and human fetuses are human beings, then the Bible informs me that it is wrong to kill them. The Bible doesn’t say that it’s wrong to lynch Black people, but clearly it is wrong because the Bible says it’s wrong to kill innocent human beings. That would apply to all born and unborn human beings.\n\nWhat’s more relevant is that the Bible says human life exists in the womb (Luke 1:41) and the Bible prohibits killing innocent human beings (Exodus 20:13). This prohibition would apply to abortion as it would to any other homicide. Because the unborn are just smaller, more dependent human beings, those differences don’t nullify their inalienable right to life.\n\nAbortion rights activists demonstrate in front of the US Supreme Court on June 13, 2022. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nEllis: We have to be really careful when we try to take a topic as complicated as abortion and try to justify it or condemn it through a single verse or a couple of verses that are taken out of context. The Bible is an incredibly complicated book written by multiple people over different historical and social contexts. It could be irresponsible to just pull out a sentence or two and relate them to 21st-century America. The Bible does not talk explicitly about abortion, pro or con in any kind of way. It’s just not there.\n\nWhen I think about the kind of scriptures that people who are anti-abortion pull out, they are often about murder, sexual immorality and blaming women. They are so taken out of context. I fall back to drawing from the life and ministry of Christ. Jesus really advocated for women in a beautiful, unique way for the time period he was living in. Even by being with women and speaking to women, he was honoring them and breaking social conventions. Both in Jesus’s day and in our day, women’s bodies are too often tossed aside. I Think Jesus would not approve of that.\n\nThere are biblical stories where Jesus advocated for and empowered women. In John 4: 1-42, Jesus engaged with the woman at the well and empowered her to spread his teachings. In Luke 8: 43-48, Jesus dropped everything to speak with and help the woman who touched his garment. And in Matthew 28: 1-20, Jesus entrusted the good news of his resurrection to women.\n\nWomen: In the face of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision, tell us how you’re doing\n\nWhat is the biggest myth people have about people who share your position?\n\nHorn: The biggest myth that people have about my position on abortion is that it is merely a religious position. There are many religious people who oppose abortion, just like there were many religious people who opposed racial segregation in the United States. Opposition to racial segregation and opposition to abortion are not merely religious positions. Rather these are human rights issues because they’re grounded in a basic truth that any reasonable person can come to, which is that we ought to give every single human being equal respect and protection under the law.\n\nJust as there are no morally relevant differences between Black and White people to justify Whites mistreating Blacks, there’s no morally relevant differences between born and unborn humans. Unborn humans are smaller, less developed, and more dependent than we are, but newborn infants are also smaller, less developed than we are and very dependent. But those reasons wouldn’t justify killing a born child and they don’t justify saying the unborn are not persons and can be killed.\n\nGabriel Oliver, who opposes abortion rights, reads from the Bible outside of an abortion clinic in Jackson, Mississippi, on December 1, 2021. Rogelio V. Solis/AP\n\nEllis: I wish people would understand that you can be a Christian and not oppose abortion. Just because somebody is pro-choice doesn’t mean that they hate life or babies or the Bible or God. The power of the religious right is so strong that so many Christians have a hard time conceiving that somebody could be on the other side of this issue. But to echo Randall Balmer [a historian who is an authority on the religious right], the religious right was created to oppose desegregated schools. The change in focus to being anti-abortion took place to gain political power. People have very real commitments and moral beliefs on both sides of it. So I’m not saying that someone who is “for life” is corrupt and just seeking power, but that is how the religious right movement was founded. It’s always going to be tainted because of that.\n\nCan a person who opposes your position on abortion still legitimately call themselves a Christian?\n\nHorn: There can be Christians who support legal abortion just like there were many Christians who supported legal slavery. Being a Christian means that you have a valid baptism, and you believe in the central tenets of the Christian faith. However, a Christian who endorses legal slavery or endorses legal abortion stands in contradiction to the moral law that Christianity gives us.

Here’s what you need to know about each of them.\n\nMeghan Markle vs. Associated Newspapers Limited\n\nBack in 2019, Markle sued Associated Newspapers over five articles published in 2019 that reproduced parts of a handwritten letter she had sent to her father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018.\n\nIn 2021, a High Court judge issued a ruling in favour of Markle, saying the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online had violated the Duchess of Sussex’s privacy by publishing excerpts of the private letter. The judge said Markle had a “reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAssociated Newspapers appealed the High Court’s decision, arguing that Markle had written the letter with the knowledge that it could be leaked and pushed for the case to go to trial. However, the appeal was dismissed, with judges ruling that the Duchess of Sussex had a “reasonable expectation of privacy” in regards to the contents of the letter.\n\nIn a statement made to the press after the ruling, Markle described the court’s decision as “precedent setting”. But, she added, “what matters most is that we are now collectively brave enough to reshape a tabloid industry that conditions people to be cruel, and profits from the lies and pain that they create”.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex was awarded a nominal sum of £1, but the publisher also agreed to pay a “confidential sum in damages for copyright infringement” and a “substantial part of Meghan’s legal costs”, said The Guardian.\n\nPrince Harry vs. News Group Newspapers and Reach\n\nThe same week in 2019 that Markle began legal action against Associated Newspapers, the Duke of Sussex launched a legal action against the owners of The Sun, the defunct News of the World and the Daily Mirror.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex’s claim related to alleged phone-hacking dating back to between January 1996 and December 2010, with Prince Harry claiming damages of more than £200,000, according to The Guardian.\n\nCourt papers said the illegal interception of Prince Harry’s voicemail messages by journalists “affected his relationships with friends and family” and impacted his relationship with Chelsy Davy, which ended in 2010.\n\nIn 2021, journalists at Newsweek obtained a court filing by lawyers for News Group Newspapers, the Rupert Murdoch-owned publisher of The Sun and formerly News of the World, which claimed that Prince Harry was “too late to sue” over alleged phone-hacking.\n\n“These [stories] were first published over 6 years prior to the issue of these proceedings and this claim is therefore statute-barred and it is denied that [Prince Harry] is entitled to any relief in relation to it,” the document read.\n\nA spokesperson for News Group Newspapers refused to comment on what it described as “historical allegations… many of which have been firmly rejected in proceedings over a number of years”. Reach, the owner of the Daily Mirror, has not commented on the allegations.\n\nThe Guardian expects this legal dispute to come to court this year, describing it as “another case that would pit one half of the Sussexes against powerful players in the tabloid press”.\n\nPrince Harry vs. the BBC\n\nPrince Harry complained to the BBC over the corporation’s decision to broadcast and publish online an image from a neo-Nazi social media site that called him a “race traitor” and depicted the royal with a gun pointed at his head.\n\nA spokesperson for Prince Harry told The Guardian in September 2019 that the image, first shared in August 2018, had “caused his family great distress specifically while his wife was nearly five months pregnant”.\n\nThe BBC internally and the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom rejected the complaint, ruling that the image’s use was clearly in the public interest. But the BBC did apologise for failing to warn the Duke of Sussex ahead of broadcasting and publishing the image.\n\nPrince Harry vs. Associated Newspapers\n\nIn 2020, Prince Harry sued Associated Newspapers for libel over two “almost identical” articles published in the Mail on Sunday and on Mail Online which claimed he had “turned his back” on the Royal Marines after stepping away from frontline royal duties earlier that year.\n\nThe articles, published in October 2020, claimed he had “not been in touch by phone, letter nor email since his last appearance as an honorary Marine” in March, said the BBC.\n\nA remote hearing at the High Court in London on 1 February 2021 accepted the claims were “false”. The Duke of Sussex accepted an apology and “substantial damages” from the publisher. Jenny Afia, his lawyer, said he would donate the money to his Invictus Games Foundation for wounded warriors.\n\n“The baseless, false and defamatory stories published in the Mail on Sunday and on the website Mail Online constituted not only a personal attack upon the Duke’s character but also wrongly brought into question his service to this country,” said Afia.\n\nDuke and Duchess of Sussex vs. the BBC\n\nIn June 2021, the law firm Schillings issued a legal letter to some news broadcasters and publishers on behalf of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, accusing the BBC of “false and defamatory” reporting.\n\nThe accusation related to a June 2021 article by the BBC’s royal correspondent Jonny Dymond, which claimed that the couple had not asked the Queen about naming their daughter Lilibet.\n\nDymond quoted an unnamed Buckingham Palace source who “disputed reports in the wake of the announcement of the name that Prince Harry and Meghan had spoken to the Queen before the birth”.\n\nThe letter said the BBC report was “false and defamatory and should not be repeated”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/05/23/prince-harry-duchess-meghan-lawsuits-explained/70243873007/", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: Their various lawsuits explained", "text": "Prince Harry's \"mission\" to take on an intrusive media continues, with an ongoing series of lawsuits brought by himself and Duchess Meghan.\n\nOver the past few years, the couple have filed more than a half-dozen lawsuits in both the U.S. and England against various media entities, who they accuse of not just invading their privacy but also of putting their lives at risk.\n\nHarry has a particular grievance against the press, anchored in part to his contention that paparazzi were to blame for the 1997 death of his mother, Princess Diana, as she tried to flee photographers in Paris. On May 16, the duke and duchess said they experienced their own \"near catastrophic car chase\" in New York.\n\nHarry has multiple lawsuits that are directly related to the safety and privacy of his family, which include the couple's two young children, Archie, 4, and Lilibet, 2.\n\nTwo are against separate newspaper companies, Mirror Group Newspapers and News Group Newspapers, accusing them of illegal information gathering; and two suits against Associated Newspapers Ltd. accused them of libel and illegal information gathering.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHere are more details about Prince Harry's present and past lawsuits.\n\nPrince Harry loses lawsuit to overturn the withdrawal of police protection\n\nWhat was it? In a lawsuit separate from his failed challenge to be able to pay for police protection, Prince Harry also filed suit to try and overturn the decision to eliminate state-funded protection given he and his wife are not part of the working-royal group.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex claimed he and his family were endangered when visiting the U.K. because of hostility toward him and his wife on social media and relentless hounding by news media.\n\nStatus: The case is closed.\n\nOn Feb. 28, a London judge ruled Harry was not improperly stripped of his publicly funded security detail during visits to Britain. Justice Peter Lane said in the High Court that the decision to provide security to Harry on a case-by-case basis was not unlawful, irrational or unjustified.\n\nPrince Harry wins phone hacking lawsuit against Daily Mirror\n\nWhat was it? Prince Harry sued Mirror Group Newspapers, owner of British tabloid Daily Mirror, in one of three similar suits filed by the Duke of Sussex against publishers accused of hacking the phones of celebrities. The lawsuit alleged that between 1996 and 2010 the Mirror hacked into phone voicemails in order to access private information.\n\nStatus: The case is closed. On Dec. 15, Prince Harry won the Daily Mirror lawsuit and was awarded over 140,000 pounds ($180,000).\n\nOn Feb. 9, Harry’s attorney, David Sherborne, said the tabloid publisher also agreed to pay the prince's legal costs plus \"substantial\" damages, and would make an interim payment of 400,000 pounds ($505,000) within 14 days. The final tab will be assessed later.\n\nIn a statement read outside the High Court in London by his lawyer, Harry said he had been vindicated: \"Our mission continues.\"\n\n\"We have uncovered and proved the shockingly dishonest way in which the Mirror acted for so many years, and then sought to conceal the truth,\" Harry said.\n\nJustice Timothy Fancourt in the High Court found phone hacking was \"widespread and habitual\" at Mirror Group Newspapers over many years and private investigators “were an integral part of the system” to gather information unlawfully.\n\nA similar lawsuit against The Sun is ongoing.\n\nContext:British tabloid publisher admits to unlawfully gathering information about Prince Harry\n\nPrince Harry is denied the right to pay for his own police protection in England\n\nWhat was it? The suit attempted to win back Harry's right to pay for his own police protection while visiting England. Police protection is granted at no cost to working royals, but that privilege was rescinded when Harry and Meghan announced in 2020 that they were stepping away for their royal duties.\n\nStatus: The case is closed.\n\nOn May 23, a London judge ruled against Harry. The duke and duchess can still opt to pay for a private security detail, but cannot hire active police officers. This case is separate from another Harry has brought against the state, in which he is seeking to have his state security restored despite no longer being a working royal.\n\nPrince William's settlement with Rupert Murdoch's media empire impacts Harry's cases\n\nWhat is it? In April, court documents related to Harry's aforementioned phone hacking lawsuit brought to light that his brother, Prince William, allegedly received a payout in a 2020 settlement with News Group Newspapers, the British arm of the media empire owned by Austrian mogul Rupert Murdoch.\n\nStatus: This case is ongoing.\n\nWilliam's settlement is being used by Harry's lawyers in his lawsuit against News Group Newspapers, which is the publisher of The Sun and now-defunct News Of The World.\n\nPrince Harry's legal team used that information to argue that Harry's lawsuit against the media companies should not be thrown out. Lawyers noted the payout agreement, which was said to have been authorized by the late Queen Elizabeth II, was aimed at preventing any future litigation from other royals.\n\nLawyers for the news organization deny there was a secret agreement, while Harry claims the arrangement was aimed at compensating members of the royal family without risking potential embarrassment on the witness stand.\n\nPrince Harry drops lawsuit against Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday owner\n\nWhat was it? In February 2022, Harry filed a suit in which he claimed that an article in the Mail on Sunday, sister paper to Daily Mail, both owned by Associated Newspapers Ltd., accused him of trying to mislead the public about a separate legal battle with the government over his police protection, which was stripped away when the couple announced they would no longer be working royals.\n\nStatus: Harry dropped the lawsuit against the publisher in January after he was unable to win the libel case before a trial and was ordered to pay tens of thousands of pounds in legal fees.\n\nHarry's lawyers told the High Court in London at the time that his case against the publisher won't proceed, without providing a reason. Harry must pay the publisher's legal fees, which the Daily Mail reported to be 250,000 pounds, or about $316,000.\n\nThis came after a judge in December ordered the Duke of Sussex to pay the publisher almost 50,000 pounds, or more than $60,000, in legal fees. At the time, Justice Matthew Nicklin said that a libel trial would be scheduled for between May and July.\n\nIn July, a London judge ruled that the article in question was defamatory, which allowed Harry to take another step towards taking the libel claim against Associated Newspapers Ltd. to trial. Harry also sued the company for illegally obtaining private information.\n\nMore:Prince Harry sues tabloid for defamation after story on police security protection\n\nDuchess Meghan wins case involving published extracts of private letter to her father\n\nWhat was it? Duchess Meghan made an invasion of privacy claim against Associated Newspapers Ltd. after the Mail on Sunday published extracts of a letter she wrote to her estranged father in 2018.\n\nStatus: Duchess Meghan won her case.\n\nIn February 2021, Meghan won and received a symbolic 1 British pound, or around $1.24, for the victory, which her lawyers said was mostly about the principle of privacy. The publication was ordered by the court to publish a notice that it had lost the case. The publisher's appeal was rejected.\n\nSettlement reached in case of aerial photos of Prince Archie\n\nWhat was it? In July 2020, the couple filed a lawsuit against U.S. celebrity photo agency X17, alleging that photographers used drones and helicopters to take aerial photos of their son Archie, then 14 months old, as he played at their private residence in Montecito, near Santa Barbara, California.\n\nStatus: The case was settled.\n\nIn October of that year, the couple reached a settlement with the agency, which apologized to the family and agreed to stop distributing the images in question.\n\nHelicopter shots of the couple's English home spurs lawsuit, settlement\n\nWhat was it? Harry sued Splash News and Picture Agency over aerial photographs taken of the home he shared with Meghan in the Cotswolds outside of London, after which the couple decided to move out of the house. Harry argued the photos, taken by helicopter, captured images of private rooms in their home, including the bedroom.\n\nStatus: The case was settled.\n\nIn May 2019, Harry received a financial settlement and an apology from Splash News and Picture Agency. Splash News had to also cover all legal costs of the suit as is customary in the British judicial system.\n\nContributing: Jill Lawless and Brian Melley, The Associated Press\n\nPrince Harrydrops libel lawsuit against Daily Mail publisher", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/03/02/meghan-markle-publisher-appeal-judges-ruling-privacy-lawsuit/6883538002/", "title": "Duchess Meghan wins legal fees from tabloid in privacy lawsuit ...", "text": "Duchess Meghan of Sussex won a preliminary payment of about $625,000 towards her $2 million legal costs from the losing tabloid publisher in her privacy infringement lawsuit, a British judge ruled Tuesday.\n\nBut she didn't get the front-page apology she demanded. Not yet, anyway.\n\nAt a virtual hearing in London, the judge, Mark Warby, also rejected Associated Newspapers' application for permission to appeal, saying there was no real prospect of another court reaching a different conclusion.\n\nBut he said the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline still has the right to renew the application to a Court of Appeals judge.\n\nAssociated Newspapers said it would do so, as a spokesman for the publisher told The Daily Mail that it was disappointed with the judge's decision.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIn a written submission to the court, Associated Newspapers’ lawyer, Antony White, said his clients believe a bid to overturn Warby’s ruling last month in Meghan's favor “would have a real prospect of success.”\n\nThe hearing Tuesday was scheduled after Warby granted Meghan summary judgment in her contentious lawsuit against the tabloid and its owners for violating her privacy in February 2019, when it published five stories featuring parts of a private letter she wrote to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, following her 2018 wedding to Prince Harry.\n\nThe hearing covered multiple issues in the aftermath of Meghan's victory in the case, including damages, legal fees and a still outstanding question about whether Meghan was the \"sole\" author of her letter to her father.\n\nUnder copyright law, the author of a private letter owns the copyright and thus her permission is needed in order to publish it. But Associated Newspapers contends that several palace officials helped Meghan write the letter. The publisher hopes to call Meghan and those officials to be cross-examined about her intentions and who else might hold authorship.\n\nMore:Will Harry and Meghan reveal 'shocking' royal secrets? What to expect from their Oprah interview\n\nThe judge set a hearing for October to take up the issue of copyright ownership.\n\nMeghan also sought a front-page apology from the Mail on Sunday and a court order that the newspaper hand over any copies of the letter, and to destroy any electronic copies of it or any notes made about it. She also wanted all the stories about the letter to be removed from the paper's website.\n\nIan Mill, one of Meghan's lawyers, said in a written submission to the court that “the defendant defiantly continues to do the very acts which the court has held are unlawful.”\n\nThe publisher's lawyers agreed to remove the articles from the website until the remaining legal issues are resolved. The judge didn't immediately rule on the request to hand over the letter.\n\nWarby's ruling last month, which came after more than a year of hearings and briefs, said a full trial on all issues in the case, set for the fall, was unnecessary, thus ending the case in Meghan's favor.\n\nIn a statement, Meghan called out the Mail on Sunday for \"illegal and dehumanizing practices.\"\n\n\"For these outlets, it’s a game,\" her statement said. \"For me and so many others, it’s real life, real relationships, and very real sadness. The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep.\"\n\nAssociated Newspapers was surprised and disappointed by the ruling and suggested at the time it might appeal. But losers in civil cases such as this have to first get permission from the ruling judge to appeal, and then go directly to a higher court if they are turned down.\n\nMore:It’s final: Harry and Meghan won’t return as working royals\n\nAnother outstanding issue involves the authorship of the letter. Did Meghan write it all herself or did she get substantial help from her former palace press staff, and if so, why?\n\nUnder British law (and American law), the authorship of a private letter belongs to the writer, not the recipient; therefore, when Thomas Markle gave the Mail on Sunday a copy of her letter and the paper published excerpts, that was a violation of copyright law.\n\nBut if members of Meghan's former palace staff helped her write the letter, in part or substantially, that might lead to another hearing at which the Mail on Sunday could call Meghan, her father, her former staffers and her friends to testify, which would mean days of gossipy and embarrassing testimony to tease tabloid readers.\n\n\"The (Mail on Sunday) is arguing that if she sought assistance of the (palace staffers) and they contributed to the letter, they might be joint authors and thus joint owners,\" says Amber Melville-Brown, head of the media and reputation practice at international law firm Withers, who has been closely following the Sussex battles with the media.\n\n\"If they can cross-examine her and them, they may be able to get to the purposes she sought their involvement and her intentions. They would see if it goes to whether she had reasonable expectation that her letter would stay private.\"\n\nThe lawyer for the tabloid, White, argued in January at a hearing that Meghan had no reasonable expectation of privacy for her letter because “it’s to be inferred that the letter was written and sent by the claimant with a view to it being disclosed to third parties and read by the public.”\n\nMeanwhile, British law also holds that losers in lawsuits not only have to pay damages, which are capped at a lower level than in the United States, they also have to pay the winner's legal fees.\n\nMeghan's legal team had asked for a little over $2 million in legal costs and they got at least part of what they sought, with \"further financial remedies\" to be dealt with later, the judge ruled.\n\nMeghan has said she would donate any damages she receives to charity.\n\nThe former American actress Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in May 2018 at Windsor Castle, a wedding watched by millions but not attended by her father, who said he was hospitalized for heart problems in California.\n\nAfter the wedding, Meghan, now the Duchess of Sussex, wrote to her father about their estrangement. This letter came to light when anonymous friends of the duchess mentioned it in a People magazine interview, and eventually the Mail obtained a copy from Thomas Markle and published parts of it in several stories in February 2019.\n\nShe filed her lawsuit in October 2019, arguing among other legal issues that publishing the letter without her permission violated long-established copyright law.\n\nAs the case moved through the British civil court, Meghan won some rulings and lost others. In May 2020, parts of her lawsuit were deleted in a ruling, leaving her the loser in an opening legal bout but keeping alive her core complaints of copyright and privacy infringement.\n\nThe couple announced in January 2020 that they were stepping away from their senior royal roles and moving to North America to pursue more freedom, financial independence and privacy.\n\nThey now live in Santa Barbara County as budding Hollywood producers, having signed deals with Netflix and Spotify to produce documentary and entertainment content.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/955115/sienna-miller-the-sun-scandal-explained", "title": "Sienna Miller and The Sun: the scandal explained | The Week", "text": "Sienna Miller has said The Sun “nearly ruined” her life after the newspaper found out she was in the early stages of pregnancy.\n\nAddressing reporters after agreeing to a settlement with the newspaper’s publisher, the actor, who ultimately did not have the baby, said the tabloid came to know about the pregnancy “in the most vulnerable moment of my life”.\n\nAdding that she was forced to make decisions “about my own body that I have to live with every single day”, Miller reiterated her belief that the information was obtained illegally, adding that the newspaper had behaved as if it was “above the law”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Brooks was cleared of phone hacking during a criminal trial in 2014.\n\nMiller’s lawyers said that the settlement was “tantamount” to an admission of illegal activity, reported the BBC. “The size of the payout is confidential – but it may be one of the largest settlements by Rupert Murdoch’s organisation to victims of phone hacking,” said the broadcaster.\n\nAddressing her decision not to pursue the paper in a full trial, Miller said: “It was not my choice to be standing here; I wanted to go to trial.\n\n“I wanted to expose the criminality that runs through the heart of this corporation. A criminality demonstrated clearly and irrevocably by the evidence which I have seen. Unfortunately, that legal recourse is not available to me or to anyone who does not have countless millions of pounds to spend on the pursuit of justice.”\n\nAdding that she wanted to “share News Group’s secrets just as they have shared mine”, she said that “until someone comes along who can confront the Murdoch’s endless means, all that I have left are these words.

For the first 22 years of his life he was second in line to the throne, behind Charles, and ahead of his older sister Princess Anne, until the birth of his nephew Prince William in 1982.\n\nThe birth of subsequent generations means he is now only ninth in the order of succession, following the latest arrivals: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s children, Archie and Lilibet.\n\nActive duty during the Falklands War\n\nAfter being educated at Gordonstoun School in Scotland, as his father Prince Philip and his brother Charles had been, Andrew entered Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, Devon, in 1979 to train as a naval officer and then underwent pilot training in fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.\n\nAt 22 he saw active service in the Royal Navy as a Sea King helicopter pilot on the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible. It was a role that “put him in the front line during the early stages of the conflict” when the Argentinian air force began a campaign targeting Royal Navy warships carrying Sear Harrier jump-jets and Sea Kings, said The Times.\n\n“There is little doubt that his life was in constant danger throughout the ten-week campaign,” said the newspaper, with one of his regular roles to act as a decoy to draw away incoming Exocet missiles from HMS Invincible by confusing their guidance system.\n\nOn his return he was “greeted by the Queen as his ship pulled into the harbour”, said The Mirror. “He came back a hero and was very much the golden boy of the royal family,” royal expert Katie Nicholl told the newspaper.\n\nMarriage to Sarah Ferguson\n\nOn 23 July 1986 Prince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson, popularly known as “Fergie”, in a grand ceremony at Westminster Abbey. They received the title of Duke and Duchess of York on the same day.\n\nBut the relationship is “believed to have begun unravelling soon after they were married”, as Prince Andrew’s naval career meant he was away for long periods, and “as a result, the couple reportedly only saw each other for around 40 days per year”, said The Independent.\n\nThe couple separated in March 1992 and divorced in May 1996. Soon after the separation Ferguson became embroiled in a scandal that would estrange her from the Royal Family for several years. Photographs of her and John Bryan, an American business manager, were published in the Daily Mirror which showed Bryan “kissing the duchess’s toes as she sunbathed topless”.\n\nBut the pair have always remained close, with friends of the one-time couple believing remarriage could “be on the cards”, said Vanity Fair. Talks of remarriage have reportedly “reignited” since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, as this was considered impossible while the Duke was alive due to a reported “long-term rift” between him and his former daughter-in-law.\n\nFriendship with Jeffrey Epstein\n\nThe prince’s friendships have long been a point of controversy, with his questionable associations ranging from “lunching at Buckingham Palace with a ‘notorious’ member of the former Tunisian regime, to taking a holiday with a Libyan gun smuggler”, said the BBC in 2011.\n\nBut it has been Andrew’s friendship with Epstein that has proved the most damaging to his reputation, and that of the Royal Family.\n\nThere was “huge controversy” after he was photographed meeting the disgraced financier in New York’s Central Park in December 2010, after the tycoon had served an 18-month prison sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution, said the broadcaster.\n\nAnd in 2015, in US court documents, he was accused of having sex with Virginia Giuffre at three of Epstein’s properties when she was 17 years old and a minor under US law. Prince Andrew has always denied the allegations.\n\nHis associations with Epstein hit the headlines once again in 2019 when the disgraced tycoon killed himself in prison while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.\n\nA Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis was intended to draw a line under Prince Andrew’s associations with Epstein and the allegations brought against him by Giuffre.\n\nDuring the interview, the duke denied he slept with Giuffre, saying an encounter alleged to have taken place in 2001 could not have taken place because he was at a Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey, with his daughter Princess Beatrice.\n\nHe also said Giuffre’s claim that he was sweaty at a nightclub could not be true because an “overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands war” had left him unable to sweat.\n\nThe interview ultimately led to Prince Andrew stepping back from Royal duties and public life.\n\nTwo years on, a New York judge is deciding whether to allow Giuffre to pursue her civil case. Judge Lewis Kaplan has said he will deliver his decision “pretty soon”, leaving Andrew’s hopes of having the case thrown out of court hanging in the balance, said the i news site.\n\nShould Kaplan dismiss the case, Andrew “will have won and will begin the long path to rebuilding his reputation”, added the website.\n\nBut if he allows the case to go forward, Andrew “could face damaging testimony”, said The New York Times, and that “would plunge the House of Windsor back into scandal at the very moment it hopes to use the Platinum Jubilee to remind Britons of the queen’s extraordinary longevity and largely blemish-free record of service”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "The Week Staff", "Jamie Timson", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Hollie Clemence", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/01/05"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/royals/959417/virginia-giuffre-memoir-prince-andrew", "title": "Virginia Giuffre to pen memoir as Prince Andrew 'plots to overturn ...", "text": "Prince Andrew’s accuser Virginia Giuffre is set to write a memoir, a year after agreeing to a multimillion dollar settlement with the royal in her sex-abuse lawsuit against him.\n\nGiuffre is believed to be working on a memoir detailing her abuse at the hands of convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his long-time confidante and “fixer” Ghislaine Maxwell. She has reportedly signed a book deal with an unnamed publisher worth “millions”, said The Telegraph.\n\nPrince Andrew settled a civil case with Giuffre last year, but has denied the accusations and did not admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The pair are thought to have signed a one-year agreement that means neither could publicly discuss the case – but this clause expires next month.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Nevertheless, insiders told the paper that any book from Giuffre is likely to be an “embarrassment” for the royal family, particularly after the damaging revelations contained in Prince Harry’s memoir, Spare, and because Prince Andrew is set to attend King Charles’s coronation in May.\n\nGiuffre has already written one unpublished manuscript, entitled The Billionaire’s Playboy Club, which was first made public in a batch of court records related to her lawsuit against Maxwell, which was settled in May 2017. In the manuscript, Giuffre details life as a teenager inside Epstein’s sex ring, and describes sexual encounters she claims to have had with Epstein and his associates, including with Prince Andrew. “It wasn’t easy meeting the sexual desires of these strange men, the Prince being one of them,” she wrote.\n\nThe publishing deal comes amid reports that Prince Andrew is preparing to launch a bid to overturn the £3m settlement he reached with Giuffre, after her abuse case against Alan Dershowitz, a US lawyer, collapsed. Dropping the lawsuit last year, Guiffre said she “may have made a mistake” in identifying him as one of them men she was forced to have sex with.\n\nThe Sun on Sunday reported that the Duke is now consulting US lawyers and “hopes to force a retraction or even an apology – which may clear the way for a return to royal duties”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Becca Stanek", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/uk/royal-news-newsletter-01-14-21-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Queen left with no choice but to cast Prince Andrew adrift ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in the January 14 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine a worse start to 2022 for Prince Andrew.\n\nThe Queen’s second son has been stripped of his cherished royal titles and will be the only one of his siblings no longer referred to as His (or Her) Royal Highness, Buckingham Palace announced Thursday. The extraordinary statement came a day after a federal judge rejected a bid to have a civil suit against him in New York thrown out. Judge Lewis Kaplan effectively said Andrew does have a case to answer after being accused of sexual assault.\n\nNow he’s facing the prospect of a very public trial later this year on allegations brought by Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was sexually trafficked to the royal by convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, when she was underage. Andrew has previously denied all allegations and has said that he does not recall ever meeting the then-17-year-old, nor does he remember ever having the picture taken with her that has been featured repeatedly in media around the world.\n\nA royal source told us that all Andrew’s titles – his military affiliations and other royal patronages – were returned to his mother effective immediately and will be redistributed to other members of the family.\n\nWe’ve been told the decision involved many of the Windsors, but the Queen will have had the final say, in close consultation with her direct heirs – Princes Charles and William.\n\nTo be clear: Andrew retains his own Duke of York title and he is still a member of the royal family, but, like the Sussexes, he will no longer represent the Queen in an official capacity.\n\nA statement from Buckingham Palace regarding The Duke of York: pic.twitter.com/OCeSqzCP38 — The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) January 13, 2022\n\nThe loss of the military titles in particular will be extremely painful for the prince, who, as a veteran of the Falklands War, took that part of the job most seriously.\n\nIn a press release on Thursday, announcing the Queen’s decision, it was made clear that Andrew will no longer have any royal public duties and will be defending himself as a private citizen in the allegations made by Giuffre.\n\nThe Duke of York does still have legal options he can pursue in the sexual assault lawsuit, but each comes with a degree of risk and no guarantee he’ll be able to mend his stained reputation. In a nutshell, the prince can opt to appeal the judge’s ruling, fight by going to trial, default or settle.\n\nSeveral legal experts we’ve spoken to in the past 48 hours have suggested an out-of-court settlement may be the best approach. But Giuffre’s lawyer, David Boies, has indicated his client may prefer to have her day in court.\n\n“I think it’s very important to Virginia Giuffre that this matter be resolved in a way that vindicates her and vindicates the other victims. I don’t think she has a firm view as to exactly what a solution should be,” he said in an interview with the BBC. “But I think what’s going to be important is that this resolution vindicates her and vindicates the claim she has made.”\n\nA source close to Prince Andrew told CNN Thursday that he will “continue to defend himself” against the sexual abuse lawsuit.\n\n“Given the robustness with which Judge Kaplan greeted our arguments, we are unsurprised by the ruling. However, it was not a judgement on the merits of Ms Giuffre’s allegations,” the source said.\n\n“This is a marathon not a sprint and the Duke will continue to defend himself against these claims,” the source added.\n\nThe Queen and her second son chat at the Windsor Horse Show in May 2017. Mark Cuthbert/UK Press/Getty Images\n\nAndrew’s permanent removal from royal duties will surely have been a tough call for the matriarch, but one she clearly felt was needed in her capacity as head of the institution. The message here is this: The case in New York is simply too damaging to the family and the reputation of the monarchy – so he had to go.\n\nWith no official duties to perform, he will no longer receive public funds but will be free as a private citizen to take paid work in the private sector or source money through other private means to fund his very expensive legal effort. That would have been seen as a conflict of interest while he was an HRH.\n\nThe sovereign herself has faced some criticism for not acting fast enough as the scandal began to engulf Andrew back in 2019, following his car crash interview with the BBC over his relationship with Epstein. Many at the time felt he lacked empathy for the disgraced financier’s victims and that his titles should have been revoked then, rather than more than two years later.\n\nMark Stephens, a media lawyer with the London-based firm Howard Kennedy, believes the family and public were “prepared to give him some latitude to defend himself on the grounds that you’re innocent until proven guilty.”\n\nThe prince’s attorneys had argued that Giuffre’s lawsuit violated the terms of her 2009 settlement agreement with Epstein in Florida, in which she agreed to a “general release” of claims against Epstein and others. That settlement, released to the public recently, shows that Epstein paid Giuffre $500,000 to drop the case without any admission of liability or fault. The prince’s name does not explicitly appear as a party.\n\nThe pair attended the Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn in London on December 13, 2018. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nHowever, Stephens continued, “When he sought to say, with one side of his mouth, ‘I never met this woman’ and with the other, ‘Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile, settled my case for me or any case for me,’ I think that that was too much for the British public to stomach, and that was when the public, I think, decisively moved against Andrew and anyone that was seen to support him.”\n\n“The criticism of the Queen and her tacit support for her son has really only occurred since Brettler (the duke’s lawyer) made that argument to Judge Kaplan, and it sounded more loudly since the results of that argument have come down,” he added.\n\nThe question now is: Will the duke’s permanent exile be enough reputational damage control in the eyes of the public? Legal experts say the Queen has responded authoritatively, acting promptly instead of waiting for any verdict should the case reach the trial stage. She only retains the crown by virtue of parliamentary support and that, in turn, relies on public support.\n\nNick Goldstone, head of dispute resolution at international law firm Ince, called the removal of military titles and royal patronages, combined with no longer being able to use the HRH style in an official capacity, a “significant development.”\n\nHe said it was “probably enough” to quell further criticism of inaction from the public, adding “it certainly appears to have brought the Duke of York’s public life as a royal to an end for the foreseeable future.”\n\nPrince Andrew stands with his mother and other members of the royal family during Trooping The Colour, the Queen's annual birthday parade, on June 8, 2019 in London. Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images\n\nStephens, too, believes the palace moved quickly and decisively. “Essentially, he’s been put out to pasture, and he’s been reduced in status to the same status as Prince Harry,” he said, adding: “The handing back of his titles and honorifics makes it clear that he has no part in the future of the public civic life of this country.”\n\nMost notably that means Andrew won’t have a front seat at the upcoming jubilee celebrations to mark the Queen’s 70 years on the throne. He will be there for group photos but without the prime position assumed by an HRH.\n\nAndrew will now be hoping the public are able to compartmentalize the lawsuit and allow 2022 to be defined as a royal jubilee year instead of a scandalized one. That’s clearly the hope of the rest of the family.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nSo, it’s been announced that Prince Andrew will stop using the “HRH” style in any official capacity. Let’s break down what it all means.\n\nThe letters stand for His or Her Royal Highness, a style used to denote senior members of the royal family.\n\nSince the early 18th century, it’s been customary for the title to be issued to sons and grandsons (and later, daughters and granddaughters) of the monarch.\n\nIt is bestowed upon royal members at the discretion of the monarch at the time, but was used liberally until World War I.\n\nThen, in 1917, George V restricted how many minor royals were getting the title – at a time when there was public suspicion about the German origins of the House of Windsor, speedily renamed that year from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nThe Duke of York at the 100th Anniversary Ceremony of The Royal Air Force at Westminster Abbey on July 10, 2018 STAR MAX/AP\n\nQueen Elizabeth II has loosened those guidelines, giving HRH status to a number of senior royals.\n\nToday, children and grandchildren of the monarch traditionally get the HRH title – though it was historically withheld from granddaughters. The title doesn’t stretch to all the minor royals, but does include family members like the Queen’s cousin Prince Michael of Kent, who is far down the line of succession.\n\nNot everyone has accepted the offer of an HRH. Princess Anne, the Queen’s daughter, declined the title for her own children, Peter and Zara. The move has allowed them to carve out relatively normal lives away from significant public scrutiny.\n\nAfter her divorce from Prince Charles, Diana had her HRH taken away. Instead, she was given the courtesy title of “Diana, Princess of Wales.” Similarly, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also stripped of her HRH following her divorce from Prince Andrew.\n\nMost recently, the Sussexes gave up their HRH titles after announcing they would step back from the royal family and relocating to the United States.\n\n(With reporting by CNN’s Rob Picheta)\n\nANNOUNCEMENTS\n\nQueen Elizabeth II visits the set of the long-running television series Coronation Street, in Manchester, England on July 8, 2021. Scott Heppell /WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nPalace reveals how Queen’s 70th year on the throne will be celebrated.\n\nA holiday weekend, a special “platinum pudding,” and a pageant of flags. June is shaping up to be a fun and flamboyant celebration of Britain’s longest-serving monarch.\n\nWe’ve mentioned before that to mark the unprecedented anniversary, a number of events will take place throughout the UK over the year – culminating in a four-day national holiday weekend from Thursday, June 2 until Sunday, June 5, known as the Jubilee Weekend.\n\nOne of the initiatives is the “Platinum Pudding” contest – a nationwide baking competition seeking out a new dessert dedicated to the Queen (Think “The Great British Baking Show” – but bigger!) UK residents aged eight and over are eligible to create a recipe, and finalists will be judged by a panel including famed baker Mary Berry, renowned chef and “Masterchef UK” judge Monica Galetti and Buckingham Palace head chef Mark Flanagan. The winning recipe will be made available to the public ahead of the long weekend.\n\nThe Trooping the Colour parade will return to kick off things off. But we’ll also have beacons lit across the nation, Buckingham Palace’s music concert and street parties. It all culminates with a pageant that will include 5,000 personnel, performers, key workers and volunteers from the UK and the Commonwealth.\n\nThis pageant will involve a “River of Hope” section, featuring 200 silk flags that will process down The Mall – the road in London that leads to Buckingham Palace – like a river. Schoolchildren are invited to create a picture of their hopes and aspirations for the planet over the next 70 years as the artwork for the flags. Get the full story here.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING\n\nDowning Street apologizes to the Queen.\n\nDowning Street officials have apologized to Buckingham Palace following a report in The Telegraph newspaper that alleged that two parties were held there on April 16 last year – the night before Prince Philip’s funeral. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s deputy official spokesman told journalists on Friday: “It is deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning, and Number 10 has apologised to the palace.” Under England’s coronavirus restrictions, social gatherings indoors were limited at this time. The very next day, the nation watched as the Queen sat alone in St. George’s Chapel in Windsor. The photograph of the solitary grieving monarch elicited enormous sympathy from the public, both at home and abroad.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II takes her seat during the funeral of Prince Philip. Jonathan Brady/Getty Images\n\nPrince Charles says painting ‘refreshes the soul.’\n\nAt the largest exhibition of his watercolors to date, painting enthusiast Prince Charles has described the restorative benefits of art, saying it “transports me to another dimension,” adding that his hobby “refreshes parts of the soul which other activities can’t reach.” A new show brings together nearly 80 of the prince’s landscape paintings. Like Queen Victoria, the prince is a “keen watercolorist” who “paints whenever his schedule allows,” according to his official website. He regularly depicts the royal family’s estates, including Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House, and has also produced watercolors in Turkey, Nepal and the Swiss Alps.

Connell also resigned, saying: “My view is that the person chairing any organisation should take responsibility if it appears that serious misconduct may have taken place within it,” Sky News reported.\n\nThe Prince of Wales has denied any knowledge of the alleged quid pro quo. Mahfouz has also denied any wrongdoing.\n\n‘Indispensable’ aid\n\nThe son of an accountant from Orpington, southeast London, Fawcett joined the staff at Buckingham Palace in 1981.\n\nHe initially worked as a footman to the Queen before becoming an “indispensable” aide to the Prince of Wales – so close that he would “[squeeze] Charles’s toothpaste so the heir could brush his teeth”, said The Sunday Times.\n\nThought to be in his late 50s, Fawcett worked as Prince Charles’s valet for 40 years, with the royal once saying that he could “manage without just about anyone except Michael”. He resigned in 2003 after a report by the Prince’s private secretary “identified mismanagement in Charles’s household”.\n\nSir Michael Peat’s probe found that “Fawcett had broken regulations by accepting presents from royal suppliers, including a £3,000 club membership and a Rolex watch”. He was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nIn 2018, Fawcett was appointed to run the Prince’s Foundation, a charity that organises educational programmes and training for people of all ages and backgrounds, with a sustainability focus.\n\n‘Doctored’ letter\n\nAn inquiry carried out independently by auditing firm Ernst & Young late last year concluded that Fawcett had co-ordinated with “fixers” to land an honour for Mahfouz, something that the charity’s trustees were unaware of, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nIt also found that Fawcett and an unnamed senior employee had been involved in directing money from Mahfouz’s charity to the Children and the Arts foundation (Cata), described by The Sunday Times as “a semi-defunct charity for disadvantaged youths which has the prince as its patron”.\n\nCharles’s charity had initially received a £100,000 donation from the Russian banker Dmitry Leus via the Mahfouz Foundation, but it had been rejected by the Prince’s Foundation’s ethics committee because of a money-laundering conviction that was later overturned.\n\nThe Sunday Times said that Fawcett “bypassed his own ethics committee” to retain Leus’s money by transferring it to Cata. The transfer was arranged by an intermediary, which meant that Leus “did not know what had happened to his money and the charity did not know the true provenance of the funds”.\n\nFawcett is said to have arranged a “thank you” letter for Leus from Cata. But the inquiry found that Cata “did not write it and believe that it was ‘doctored’”.\n\nFawcett did not respond to The Sunday Times’ questions about the supposedly doctored document, which is likely to be important in Scotland Yard’s probe.\n\n‘Timing couldn’t have been worse’\n\nThe timing of the Met’s investigation “couldn’t have been worse”, said the BBC’s royal correspondent Daniela Relph. Wednesday morning’s headlines were focused on Prince Charles’s brother Prince Andrew and his settlement with Virginia Giuffre. Just a few hours later, “things became more complicated”.\n\nRoyal sources told the Daily Mail that there had been “genuine shock” in Buckingham Palace that the cash-for-honours probe had come “on top of the Andrew fall-out”, with one telling the paper: “I can only see this getting worse.”\n\nQuestions have been raised over whether Prince Charles, who is currently recovering from Covid, will be interviewed by the Met as part of their investigation. Sources emphasised to the Daily Mail that the royal “would be willing to speak to detectives and help with their inquiry in whatever way he could”.\n\nIt’s been a turbulent 2022 for the royal family so far – a year that was meant to be all about celebrating the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, a historic first for a British monarch.

The publication also reported Hegseth was forced to leave a prior leadership post at the nonprofit Veterans for Freedom after the organization ran up substantial debt.\n\nThe whistleblower report included a complaint that Hegseth was “totally sloshed” at a 2014 event in Virginia Beach and needed to be carried to his room because “he was so intoxicated.” It cited another instance at a Louisiana strip club in 2015 in which a drunk Hegseth allegedly had to be restrained from joining the dancers on the stage.\n\nMore:Trump considering DeSantis to replace Hegseth for defense secretary post\n\nHegseth denied the episodes happened, insisting to Kelly that he didn't even visit this club with his co-workers.\n\n\"If they're making up an instance of something where I didn't even attend, how can you believe a single other thing that any of these people are saying in any instance, to include being carried up to my room?\" Hegseth said.\n\nHegseth faces an uphill Senate confirmation after revelations he was accused of sexual assault ‒ which he denies and for which he has never faced charges. Nevertheless, Hegseth vowed to push forward.\n\n\"I spoke to the president-elect this morning. He said: 'Keep going, keep fighting. I’m behind you all the way,'\" Hegseth told reporters Wednesday. \"Why would I back down? I’ve always been a fighter. I'm here for the war fighters.\"\n\nHegseth spent the day at the Capitol seeking to shore up support from Republican senators, while his mother, Penelope Hegseth, made an appeal for her son on Fox News.\n\n\"Pete is a new person. He's redeemed, forgiven, changed,\" Penelope Hegseth said, addressing her own email she sent to her son in 2018 that said Hegseth was an “abuser of women” and that she has “no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around, and uses women for his own power and ego.\"\n\nMore:'It isn't 1948': Defense Secretary Austin defends role of women in combat, swipes at Hegseth\n\nPenelope Hegseth said she wrote the email out of “haste” and with “deep emotions.” She explained that her son had been going through a contentious divorce with his second wife at the time she wrote it.\n\nMore:Pete Hegseth controversy explained: What to know amid backlash to Trump's Defense pick\n\nAlthough Trump has so far remained behind Hegseth publicly as his nominee for defense secretary, a source close to the Trump transition said the president-elect is considering replacing him with Florida Gov.

The former Fox and Friends co-host dodged and demurred when confronted over an 8-year-old rape complaint that resulted in no charges and allegations of mismanagement and drinking on the job and said he was the victim of a coordinated smear campaign.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., Armed Services Chair, said he was “encouraged” by the hearing. “I think he helped himself immensely.”\n\nMore:Pete Hegseth faces 'big issues of character' at make-or-break Senate hearing\n\nThere were no surprises. Democratic senators complained that Hegseth had not been subjected to a thorough FBI background check and that they were unable to gain access to a reportedly scathing whistleblower report from a veterans' nonprofit he had run.\n\nHegseth, an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, has scant executive experience. He has described himself as a change agent who will rid the Pentagon of \"woke\" policies he says have made U.S. forces less battle-ready.\n\nTuesday's hearing was an appetizer for a smorgasbord of questions and confrontations expected Wednesday, when six different Senate committees are scheduled to hear from Trump's picks to run the Homeland Security, Justice, State and Transportation departments, as well as the CIA, and the important White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\nStay with the USA TODAY Network for live updates.\n\nMore:Exclusive poll: For Trump, a strengthened hand but skepticism on tax cuts, tariffs\n\nHegseth confirmation hearing ends with cheers\n\nAfter friendly questions from Sen. Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL, the hearing comes to a close. Hegseth and his supporters are embracing and shaking hands as the senators and their staffers file out of the committee room.\n\nCheers break out as he exits.\n\nSlotkin presses on deploying the military at home\n\nSlotkin, a former intelligence officer and acting assistant defense secretary, pressed Hegseth if he would resist an order that conflicts with the Constitution.\n\nShe asked Hegseth if he had been involved in discussions about using the active-duty military within the United States, including detention camps and policing dangerous cities.\n\nHegseth acknowledged that mass deportations could take place in the new administration but declined to say if active-duty troops would take part.\n\nShe accused him of avoiding the questions, and “genuflecting” to Trump.\n\nAsked if Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joints of Staff, would be on a list of officers who could be fired if he becomes Defense secretary, Hegseth said any officer could.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nMore:Trump vows to declare national emergency, use military for mass deportations\n\nSen. Slotkin asks if Hegseth would 'push back' against an illegal order\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., asked Hegseth about orders that Trump gave his former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, to deploy the military against Black Lives Matter protesters in 2020.\n\n\"Are you saying you would stand in the breach and push back, if you were given an illegal order?\" she said.\n\nHegseth responded that he wouldn't \"get ahead\" of discussions with Trump. But he did not answer directly if he agreed with a public apology Esper made after the 2020 incident.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth brands allegations of public intoxication 'anonymous smears'\n\nSen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, read off several instances of Hegseth's alleged public intoxication through the years, including being drunk in public and in front of young female staffers. Hegseth branded all the allegations \"anonymous smears.\"\n\nWith Hegseth's admissions that he had issues with drinking in the past, \"it's hard to square the circle,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"It's clear to me that you're not being honest with us or the American people,\" because it would be disqualifying, he said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat has Pete Hegseth said about women in the military?\n\nDemocratic senators have taken aim at Hegseth’s past comments about women serving in the military. So, what's he said?\n\n“I’m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles,” Hegseth said on a podcast in November, five days before Trump named him the next Defense secretary. “It hasn't made us more effective, hasn’t made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.\"\n\nIn his recently published book, Hegseth argues that “women cannot physically meet the same standards as men.”\n\n“Dads push us to take risks. Moms put the training wheels on our bikes. We need moms. But not in the military, especially in combat units,” Hegseth wrote.\n\nHegseth appeared to backpedal under the scrutiny of the confirmation process, telling reporters in December, \"We support all women serving in our military today who do a fantastic job across the globe, in our Pentagon, and deliver critical aspects.\"\n\n\"So, I look forward to being a leader for every single member of this Pentagon, men and women.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Hegseth told the Senate Armed Services Committee he is \"incredibly grateful\" for the \"amazing contributions\" by women in the military – so long as they meet the required standards.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nRosen presses Hegseth on Ukraine\n\nSen. Jackie Rosen, D-Nev., asked Hegseth if he, and the Trump administration as a whole, would continue U.S. support Ukraine.\n\n\"Are you going to stand behind Ukraine?\" Rosen asked. \"Do you have knowledge of a plan\" Trump will use to end the war in Ukraine? she said.\n\n\"I will always give clear guidance, my best guidance...on matters like that,\" he replied.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nDuckworth reads soldiers' creed to Hegseth\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth read lines of the soldiers' creed to Hegseth: \"I will always place the mission first,\" and \"I am disciplined, physically and mentally tough, trained and proficient in my warrior tasks and drills.\"\n\nDuckworth said Hegseth was unqualified and unprepared to take on the position.\n\n\"You, sir, are a no-go at this station,\" she said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nDuckworth says Hegseth is 'unqualified' for office\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill.. called Hegseth unqualified for the office, questioning his management of the veterans organizations he led and his experience in international affairs.\n\nThe country needs a Defense secretary who is ready on the day he takes office, Duckworth said.\n\n“You are not that person,” Duckworth said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nWarren digs into Hegseth's women in combat comments\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren dug into Hegseth's comments on women in the military, saying \"I have serious concerns that your behavior toward women disqualifies you.\"\n\nWarren called his backtrack \"a very very big about face in a very very short amount of time.\"\n\n\"What extraordinary event\" in that period of time, she asked, \"made you change the core values you expressed?\"\n\nHegseth said \"standards had been changed\" in pursuit of quotas and percentages in the military.\n\nIf his opinions could be changed so fast, Hegseth could \"go back to the old guy who said, 'straight up, women do not belong in combat roles,'\" once in the role, Warren said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth asked if he would 'abandon' Ukraine\n\nSen. Angus King said he was concerned that Hegseth had not mentioned Ukraine or Russia in his opening statement. \"Is this code for we're going to abandon Ukraine?\" he asked\n\nHegseth said that would be up to Trump, who he said had expressed a desire to end the conflict.\n\nHegseth circumvents questions about Geneva conventions\n\nSen. Angus King, the committee's only independent, asked Hegseth about whether he was opposed to torture and past comments he made that rules of warfare held back the U.S. military.\n\n\"Are you saying that the Geneva Conventions... should not apply in the future?\" King said.\n\nHegseth said he did not condone waterboarding and torture, but he said enemies \"took advantage\" of restrictive rules of war.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nKaine presses Hegseth on disqualifying conduct\n\nUnder questioning from Kaine, Hegseth declined to say if sexual assault, domestic abuse or being drunk at work would disqualify a candidate for Defense secretary.\n\nKaine dismissed Hegseth’s claim that the allegations were from anonymous sources, noting that an email from Hegseth’s mother had been cited by the New York Times.\n\n“Don’t make this into some anonymous press thing,” Kaine said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nMore:Pete Hegseth's mother discusses angry email: 'He's redeemed, forgiven, changed'\n\nKaine delves into Hegseth's infidelity\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., clashed with Hegseth over the 2017 sexual assault allegation. Hegseth told police the encounter was consensual and no charges were filed.\n\nBut Kaine focused on the fact that Hegseth was married at the time of the incident, and had just fathered a child with a woman who was not his wife. \"I am shocked that you would sit here and say you're completely cleared,\" he told Hegseth.\n\n\"If it had been a sexual assault, that would be disqualifying to be Secretary of Defense, wouldn't it?\" Kaine said.\n\nHegseth responded that he was falsely accused.\n\nAsked if he was physically violent towards any of his wives, Hegseth said, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nSenator takes on 'woke' military\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, disparaged what he referred to as the Biden “woke” military and what he called the false narrative that the military ranks were filled with extremists.\n\nHegseth called the military one of the least racist institutions in America.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nHirono asks if Hegseth would carry out Trump military orders\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono asked Hegseth if he would comply with orders from President-elect Trump to deploy the military against protesters on U.S. soil and deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nHirono referred to the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 when, according to an account by former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Trump asked the army to shoot protesters during unrest in Washington, D.C.\n\nHegseth responded that he saw police injured by protesters, who he called destructive.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth denies sexual assault\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, asked Hegseth if he had sexually assaulted or harassed women.\n\n“No, senator,” Hegseth said.\n\nHegseth has made a disturbing pattern of making disparaging comments about women and minorities and walked them back, Hirono said.\n\n“You are no longer on Fox and Friends, Mr. Hegseth,\" she said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nWould Hegseth carry out order to invade Greenland?\n\nHirono asked Hegseth if he would carry out an order to take over Greenland or the Panama Canal, a proposal floated by President-elect Trump with increasing conviction in recent weeks.\n\n\"Senator, I will emphasize that President Trump received 77 million votes in the election,\" Hegseth said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nMore:'Buy us!': Greenlanders shocked, intrigued, bewildered by Trump zeal for Arctic territory\n\nHirono asks if Hegseth will resign if he drinks on the job\n\nHegseth told Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, he was \"falsely accused\" when a woman reported him to police over an alleged sexual assault in 2017.\n\nHirono noted Hegseth had paid the woman a confidential settlement.\n\nThe two sparred when Hirono asked Hegseth about his alleged history of heavy drinking.\n\n\"Will you resign as Secretary of Defense if you drink on the job?\" she said.\n\nHegseth did not answer directly, saying he is committed to serve.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth says 'women will have access' to combat roles\n\nSen. Ernst said it’s “incredibly important” for men and women to be allowed to serve as long as they meet standards. “I do believe in high standards,” Ernst said.\n\n“Yes, women will have access to ground combat roles” if they meet standards, Hegseth said. Those units include infantry, artillery and armor.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nSen. Ernst, key Republican vote, has the microphone\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, an Iraq veteran and a survivor of military sexual assault, and one of three Republican senators seen as crucial to the survival of Hegseth's nomination, now has the floor. She's opened by asking about balancing the books at the Pentagon and reducing waste before moving to the question of women in the military.\n\nHegseth told Ernst he would prioritize an audit for the Pentagon, the only agency in Washington that has not passed one.\n\n\"Previous secretaries of defense, with all due respect, haven't necessarily emphasized the strategic prerogative of an audit,\" he said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBlumenthal asks if Hegseth will submit to a thorough FBI check\n\nBlumenthal challenged Hegseth to submit to a thorough FBI investigation that included allegations of sexual assault and interviews with his former wives.\n\nHegseth demurred, saying he was not in charge of FBI background checks.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nBlumenthal questions Hegseth's financial management\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., questioned Hegseth on financial mismanagement at the two veterans organizations he headed, Concerned Veterans for America and Veterans for Freedom, which Blumenthal called \"the only test\" of Hegseth's ability to manage the military's $850 billion budget.\n\n\"Every dollar we raised was used intentionally for the execution of our mission,\" Hegseth said.\n\nDonors had in effect ousted Hegseth from one of the organizations, Blumenthal said, for mismanagement.\n\nHegseth said he was “extremely proud” of the work that he and others had done there.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Tom Vanden Brook\n\nGillibrand raps Hegseth quota claim\n\nIn the face of strident statements from Gillibrand, Hegseth maintained that infantry commanders had to meet quotas for women in their units.\n\n“That does not exist,” Gillibrand said.\n\nThere are no such quotas, a Defense official confirmed.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nSen. Gillibrand hits Hegseth's comments on women in the military\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand lambasted Hegseth for \"creating the impression\" that the military maintains quotas for women in service roles.\n\n\"I have never disparaged women serving in the military,\" Hegseth responded.\n\nBut Gillibrand chided Hegseth for his past comments, saying he had \"denigrated\" women and LGBTQ people in the military.\n\n\"You said in your statement you don't want politics. Everything you've said in these public statements is politics,\" she said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nCotton asks Hegseth if he is a 'Christian Zionist'\n\nAsked by Sen. Tom Cotton if he considered himself a \"Christian Zionist,\" as protesters in the chamber had called him, Hegseth said he was a Christian.\n\nHegseth said Israel is not committing genocide in Gaza and that he supports Israel \"destroying and killing every last member of Hamas.\"\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nMore:Why Pete Hegseth nomination is a milestone for the rightwing Christian movement he follows\n\nShaheen presses Hegseth on women in the military\n\nSen. Jean Shaheen, D-N.H., asks Hegseth to answer for his comments on women war fighters, citing, among many statements, a chapter in his new book called “The (deadly) obsession with women warriors.”\n\nShaheen asked Hegseth if he thought the two women on the committee who served in the military, Sen. Joni Ernst and Sen. Tammy Duckworth, were \"less effective and less capable,\" using his own words against him.\n\nHegseth said he was \"incredibly grateful\" for their service, but added, \"it's about standards.\"\n\nHegseth describes \"amazing contributions\" by women in the military.\n\nI appreciate your eleventh hour conversion,\" Shaheen said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth is asked about his efforts to clear fighters convicted of war crimes\n\nReed questioned Hegseth about his advocacy for the exoneration of several servicemembers convicted of war crimes.\n\n\"How will you be able to effectively lead a military in which one of the principle elements is discipline, respect for lawful authority?\"\n\nIn his response, Hegseth called U.S. rules of engagement \"restrictive\" and said they \"made it more difficult to defeat our enemies.\"\n\nHegseth came to prominence in part due to his advocacy on behalf of troops accused of war crimes.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump pardoned Maj. Matthew Golsteyn and reversed the demotion for Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.\n\nGolsteyn, a Green Beret, was charged with executing a suspected bomb maker who had been ordered to be released after questioning in Afghanistan in 2010. Golsteyn admitted during a polygraph test, taken when he tried to join the CIA, that he had killed the man. That launched an Army investigation that culminated in the murder charge.\n\nGallagher was convicted of posing with the corpse of an ISIS fighter but acquitted of charges of murder and attempted murder.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Tom Vanden Brook\n\nReed questions Hegseth on threatening emails sent to military officials\n\nHegseth said he was not aware of threatening emails Sen. Reed said were sent to military officials threatening their positions and pensions for following military policies during the Obama and Biden administrations.\n\nThe emails, Reed said, called the officials \"disloyal, corrupt, traitorous, liberal,\" and he said their language echoed some of Hegseth's own writing and statements.\n\nAsked if he supported those letters, Hegseth pivoted to what he called a lack of accountability for the disastrous 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth rails against media 'smear campaign'\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., offered Hegseth an opportunity to address allegations of sexual assault and harassment.\n\nHegseth blamed a “coordinated smear campaign in the media,” Hegseth said.\n\nIn particular, he singled out “left-wing” media for, he said, not presenting his side of the story.\n\n“All they were out to do was to destroy me,” Hegseth said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nHegseth calls himself 'a change agent'\n\nAddressing senators about to judge his qualifications to lead the Pentagon, Hegseth stressed his record in the military. \"I joined the military because I loved my country,\" he said.\n\n\"When I took off uniform, my mission never stopped.\"\n\nTo his lack of experience, Hegseth said, \"We've repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon with supposedly the right credentials, whether they are retired generals, academics or defense contractor executives, and where has it gotten us?\"\n\n\"It's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm,\" he said, calling himself \"a change agent.\"\n\nHegseth began his statement by thanking his wife, Jennifer, whom he said had changed his life, his parents and seven children. He also credited his faith in God.\n\nHe praised President-elect Donald Trump, who he said charged him with bringing back a “warrior culture” to the Pentagon.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook and Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nProtesters removed during Hegseth statement\n\nProtesters have interrupted Hegseth's opening statement with a series of outbursts. Chairman Wicker orders them removed.\n\n\"You are a misogynist,\" said one man, who identied himself as a Vietnam veteran and criticized Hegseth for his support for Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"Hey corrupt senators, when are you going to stop the war in Gaza?\" another woman yelled as she was pulled out of the chamber.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nGlowing introductions for Hegseth criticize Pentagon status quo\n\nNorm Coleman, a former U.S. Senator for Minnesota, introduced Hegseth as a \"son of Minnesota.\"\n\n\"He is young in the best sense of the word,\" Coleman said. \"He has struggled and overcome great personal challenges. Please don't get into the cynical notion that people can't change.\"\n\nRep. Mike Waltz, a Republican congressman and Trump's pick for National Security Advisor, called Hegseth a \"dear friend\" and said he was prepared to revamp a Pentagon that he said \"continuously failed\" at its mission.\n\n\"I have no doubt that he is going to get the Pentagon back to his primary mission - lethal readiness,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a man who can reinvigorate that warrior ethos.\"\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\n'You lack the character' to lead, Reed tells Hegseth\n\nReed criticized Hegseth for statements he’s made about diversity at the Pentagon. Hegseth has said that “Diversity is not our strength.”\n\nReed, who served in the Army in the 1970s, said the military was not stronger when women were prohibited from combat, and the Pentagon banned gay and lesbian people from serving.\n\n“Our military is more diverse than it has ever been, but more importantly, it is more lethal it has ever been,” Reed said. “This is not a coincidence. Mr. Hegseth, I hope you will explain why you believe such diversity is making the military weak, and how you propose to ‘undo’ that without undermining military leadership and harming readiness, recruitment, and retention.”\n\nReed noted that he has supported nine previous nominees for Defense secretary, but says he cannot vote in favor of Hegseth.\n\nRunning though a litany of allegations against Hegseth, including that he mismanaged two non-profit veterans' organizations, Reed winds up his statement: \"Unfortunately, you lack the character and composure to hold the position of secretary of Defense.\"\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nTop Democrat registers opposition to Pete Hegseth\n\nSen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat, makes clear his opposition to Hegseth in his opening statement, before the former TV host has heard a single question.\n\nReed listed the challenges facing the Pentagon: confronting China and Russia, dealing with turmoil in the Middle East, the threat of violent extremism. The next Defense secretary will need experience, wisdom and character, Reed said.\n\n“Mr. Hegseth, I do not believe that you are qualified to meet the overwhelming demands of this job,” Reed said.\n\nReed went on to question Hegseth’s alleged incidents of sexual assault and harassment, alcohol abuse, mismanagement of the non-profit veterans’ organizations he led, criticism of women in combat and championing the causes of troops convicted of war crimes.\n\n“I have reviewed many of these allegations and find them extremely alarming,” Reed said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nWicker praises Hegseth as unconventional but 'excellent' pick\n\nIn his opening statement, Sen. Roger Wicker, the Armed Services Committee's Republican chair, called Hegseth an \"excellent choice\" because of, not in spite of, his unconventional background.\n\nHe compared Hegseth's inexperience to Trump, \"that New York developer who rode down the escalator in 2015 to announce his candidacy for president.\"\n\n\"I'm confident that Mr. Hegseth, supported by a team of experienced top officials, will get the job done,\" he said.\n\nWicker described Hegseth as the right nominee to shake up a Pentagon \"no longer prepared for great power competition\" at a precarious global moment.\n\nOf Hegseth's past, Wicker said Hegseth had \"admitted to falling short, as we all do from time to time.\"\n\n\"It is noteworthy that the vast majority of the accusations leveled at Mr. Hegseth have come from anonymous sources,\" he said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna provides front row support\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., took a front row seat. As a \"veteran and also a female member of Congress,\" Luna said, \"I'm here today to show support for Pete Hegseth.\"\n\n\"They said that he was an alcoholic or implied it, that he was a womanizer, all this crazy stuff, a white nationalist,\" she said. \"Clearly, I would not support any of that, and I've looked through those allegations, they are categorically false.\"\n\nAsked about Hegseth's comments on women in combat, Paulina Luna said she agreed that women should be barred from some such roles. \"If you have a mixed team, I think it could jeopardize the value of that mission,\" she said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nMore:Defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth's confirmation hearing: What to know, how to watch\n\nApplause and chants as Hegseth enters\n\nHegseth enters the hearing room with members of his family to applause and chants of \"U-S-A!\" The chants quickly subside.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., chair of the Armed Services Committee, opens the hearing with a moment of silence for victims of the Southern California wildfires and a note of thanks to Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the ranking member and former chair.\n\nHe asks the audience to stay quiet and avoid disruptions.\n\nSenate prepares to question Hegseth\n\nThe brightly-lit Senate hearing room was buzzing with activity Tuesday morning as senators prepared to publicly question Hegseth.\n\nCommittee and media personnel streamed past the velvet barriers separating the audience from a semicircle of senators' desks.\n\nA line of Hegseth supporters wearing matching baseball caps and red pins reading \"Vets for Hegseth\" filled a full row.\n\nTwo protesters with antiwar group Code Pink held signs up at the front, one reading, \"No Hegseth, No Christian Jihad,\" before a guard ordered them not to hold the signs above their heads.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat questions does Pete Hegseth face?\n\nSenators on the Armed Services Committee are looking for answers from Hegseth on how he would manage the military's $850 billion budget and its 2 million servicemembers. Also on the table are how Hegseth would approach ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and increasing tension with China.\n\nMore:Why Pete Hegseth nomination is a milestone for the rightwing Christian movement he follows\n\nHegseth, a 44-year-old former Fox News host and veteran, could face tough questions about his personal life and past, including his reported history of heavy drinking, his treatment of women and a sexual assault allegation filed against him eight years ago. Hegseth has denied abusing alcohol on the job and says a disputed 2017 sexual encounter was consensual.\n\nSenators' sights are also trained on Hegseth's past comments opposing women serving in combat roles, which he walked back in the run-up to the hearing. A cultural critic of the military, Hegseth has accused the Pentagon of relaxing its personnel and training standards and adopting so-called \"woke\" ideology.\n\nDoes Hegseth have the votes for confirmation?\n\nHegseth needs a majority – 51 votes – to be confirmed in the Senate. With Republicans in the majority, he would win confirmation if every Republican voted for him.\n\nMore:Pressure piles on Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst over Pete Hegseth confirmation fight\n\nBut the Republican majority is slight, leaving Hegseth room to lose just three Republican votes. And some Republican senators have said they need to see more before they can cast a vote for him.\n\nThey include three women senators – Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Joni Ernst of Iowa. To Ernst, a veteran and sexual assault survivor, Hegseth's past comments and history have personal significance.\n\n2017 sexual assault allegation hangs over Hegseth hearing\n\nSince Hegseth's appointment in November, a murky sexual assault allegation filed in 2017 has dogged his attempts to win over senators.\n\nA staffer for California Federation of Republican Women filed a police report that year after she said he assaulted her at a hotel conference. No charges were filed.\n\nHegseth later paid the woman an undisclosed amount to settle a potential civil lawsuit, in a settlement that included a confidentiality clause barring her from talking about the incident, according to his attorney, Timothy Parlatore.\n\nHegseth said he was \"buzzed\" but not drunk at the time, and that the encounter was consensual. But Parlatore told news sources in the last few months that Hegseth was \"visibly intoxicated\" and the woman was \"the aggressor.\"\n\nWhat time is the Pete Hegseth hearing?\n\nHegseth's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee is set to begin on 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, January 14.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/14/trump-nominees-hegseth-cabinet-confirmation/77698416007/", "title": "Trump allies bullish Hegseth and other Cabinet picks will be confirmed", "text": "As the confirmation process for Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees kicked off with a blistering takedown of his defense secretary pick by Senate Democrats and strong support from Republicans, those around the president-elect are projecting confidence that his picks will be approved.\n\n“Everyone seems to be optimistic,” a source close to Trump said in relaying how the president-elect and his team are feeling about getting his nominees confirmed as Inauguration Day approaches in less than a week.\n\nRepublicans left Tuesday’s hearing for Trump Defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, among his more controversial picks, saying he improved his position.\n\n“I think he helped himself immensely.” said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee who presided over the hearing.\n\nA combat veteran, Hegseth doesn’t have the traditional qualifications to lead the Pentagon after leaving the National Guard as a midlevel officer, and his personal life has been in the spotlight. He was accused of sexual assault, which he denies, alcohol problems and mismanagement of veteran’s groups he led.\n\nThe blowback put Hegseth’s nomination on shaky ground, with some Republican senators appearing to waver, Trump allies expressing doubts and Trump flirting with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as a backup if Hegseth failed to get confirmed.\n\nDemocrats hammered Hegseth during Tuesday’s hearing.\n\nMoving from his lack of high-level management experience to the finances of the nonprofits he managed and his sexual history, Democratic senators picked apart Hegseth’s record and accused him of being well below the typical standards of a Pentagon leader.\n\n“You’re not qualified Mr. Hegseth. You’re not qualified,” said Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., had one of the most intense exchanges with Hegseth during the hearing, laying out multiple allegations of his personal misconduct. He suggested that Hegseth's oft-repeated claim that the allegations against him are anonymous are ridiculous.\n\n“His own mother wrote a letter! I've never seen anything like it,\" he said. \"She was on TV recently and said she wrote that letter out of love. That's what mothers do. They look their kids in the eye when their kids are doing something wrong and they give them a tough love message and that's exactly what she did.\"\n\nHegseth's mother wrote an email to him in 2018 criticizing his treatment of women but now says she regrets sending it and has defended him.\n\nWhile acknowledging he’s “not a perfect person,” Hegseth pushed back repeatedly Tuesday against the allegations.\n\n“There was a coordinated smear campaign orchestrated in the media against us,” Hegseth said.\n\nTrump and his allies have rallied around Hegseth and other controversial nominees in recent weeks and Republicans leapt to his defense at the hearing.\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla, called Senate Democrats hypocrites in highlighting accusations against Hegseth of drinking on the job and womanizing.\n\n“It is so ridiculous that you guys hold yourself as this higher standard and you forget you got a big plank in your eye,” he said.\n\nFormer Trump White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said after the hearing that Democrats’ questioning “backfired.”\n\nThe reception Hegseth received from Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, was notable. Ernst is a military veteran and sexual assault survivor. She is viewed as a key vote. Hegseth has been critical of women serving in the military, but recently walked that back.\n\nErnst received commitments from Hegseth on Tuesday to support women serving in combat and to appoint a senior official “dedicated to sexual assault prevention and response,\" and on Tuesday night she told local radio host Simon Conway that she would support the nomination.\n\nErnst earlier had made statements viewed as hostile to Hegseth, but has changed her tone amid intense pressure from the right.\n\nMAGA activists are pushing GOP senators to fall in line and vote for all Trump’s nominees, including other controversial choices such as Kash Patel to lead the FBI, Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for health and human services secretary.\n\n“When President Trump nominated Pete Hegseth, the DC crowd said his nomination was ‘dead on arrival,’” Mike Davis, founder of The Article III Project, told USA TODAY.\n\nDavis said his group led a “shock-and-awe media blitz” and enlisted 10,000 people to make 30,000 contacts with senators.\n\n“We gave the Senate an attitude adjustment,” Davis continued. “In about 3 days, Pete Hegseth went from ‘dead on arrival’ to ‘when can he start?’”\n\nDavis said he’s “very” confidant Hegseth will get confirmed and believes Trump’s other nominees will too. His group organized a similar pressure campaign to support Patel, who has generated concerns that he would pursue a retribution agenda on Trump’s behalf.\n\n“These Senate offices are calling us and asking us to make it stop. We will stop when he’s sworn into office,” Davis said.\n\nMore:Sen. Tim Kaine presses Pete Hegseth on assault allegations\n\nAsked about the allegations of sexual assault against Hegseth, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he thinks he “addressed those allegations” in the hearing.\n\n“He acquitted himself extremely well and made a strong argument for why he ought to be the next secretary of Defense,” he said.\n\nConfirmation hearings are scheduled to continue on Wednesday for secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, Attorney General nominee Pam Bondi and four others.\n\n(This file has been updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/12/04/pete-hegseth-controversy-defense-secretary/76760979007/", "title": "Pete Hegseth controversy, explained: What to know about Trump's ...", "text": "President-elect Donald Trump is considering dropping his pick for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, USA TODAY reported Wednesday.\n\nAfter Trump named Hegseth as a Cabinet nominee, allegations from Hegseth's past resurfaced and have left some wondering whether the controversy will thwart his Senate confirmation. Trump's former attorney general nominee Matt Gaetz already dropped out of consideration after concerns he would not gain enough support to be confirmed amid allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor.\n\nBut why might Hegseth reach a similar fate? Here is what to know about the controversy surrounding his nomination:\n\nMore:Pete Hegseth's mother discusses angry email: 'He's redeemed, forgiven, changed'\n\nWho is Pete Hegseth, Defense secretary nominee?\n\nTrump raised eyebrows when he named Hegseth as his Defense secretary pick, as he broke the tradition of filling the position with Pentagon chiefs with long resumes in government.\n\nHegseth, 44, worked with Fox News from 2014 until he left following the news of his nomination. Hegseth joined the Army ROTC in college and was deployed overseas with the Army National Guard after graduating, according to a 2022 article in Reserve + National Guard Magazine.\n\nHegseth's agenda for running the Pentagon appears to be stopping women from serving in combat roles, firing generals who promote \"woke\" military policies and easing restrictions on troops' conduct in war.\n\nThe Defense secretary position requires Senate confirmation. Hegseth has scheduled meetings with Senate Republicans ahead of confirmation hearings.\n\nPete Hegseth has been accused of sexual assault, no charges filed\n\nIn 2017, Hegseth was involved in a sexual encounter which he said was consensual but was later reported to the police as a sexual assault.\n\nPolice in Monterey, California said they investigated an incident occurring between Oct. 7-8, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa on Del Monte Golf Course.\n\nHegseth was at the hotel to speak at the California Federation of Republican Women convention, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nThe alleged victim was a staffer of the organization and had texted her husband about her dislike for Hegseth, saying he gave off \"creeper\" vibes, as USA TODAY previously reported. Hotel footage showed them in a verbal altercation at the pool area before she led Hegseth towards his room. She later told police she didn't know how she ended up in Hegseth's room, but she remembered he blocked the door and took her phone, she told police. Hegseth told police at the time he was \"buzzed\" but not drunk, though his lawyer recently claimed he was \"visibly intoxicated\" and the woman was the “the aggressor in the encounter.”\n\nHegseth was never charged, but he said in a statement that he paid the woman a settlement on the condition of confidentiality out of fear of losing his job at Fox News when she threatened litigation in 2020, according to multiple reports.\n\nReports of misconduct at former veterans' organizations\n\nHegseth formerly led a veterans' charity organization that he was allegedly ousted from over allegations of misconduct, according to media reports.\n\nOn Sunday, The New Yorker reported that Hegseth was forced to resign from at least one nonprofit group he ran before becoming a Fox News anchor. The magazine surfaced a whistle-blower report about Hegseth's tenure as the president of the Concerned Veterans for America nonprofit. The report alleged he was frequently intoxicated on the job and contributed to a hostile workplace due to sexual misconduct.\n\nCBS News also reported that there was a concerted effort to remove Hegseth as the head of the Concerned Veterans for America nonprofit due to complaints over intoxication and poor leadership.\n\nHegseth's lawyer Timothy Parlatore told USA TODAY these claims are \"totally false\" and have been \"thoroughly investigated and debunked.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to CVA representatives for more information.\n\nContributing: Riley Beggin, Tom Vanden Brook, Cybele Mayes-Osterman, Victor Hagan, Zac Anderson\n\nKinsey Crowley is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who has been tapped by Trump to lead the EPA, declined to commit to rolling back what Trump and other critics of the rules have called an \"EV mandate\" when asked, acknowledging only that he has heard concerns about regulations put in place by President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nAs to whether he would promise to reverse such regulations by U.S. Sen.

Gilbert is co-president of nonprofit consumer advocate group Public Citizen, which conducted a review of Bondi's past lobbying work.\n\nBondi represented 30 clients over the last five years, including Amazon and Geo Group, a private-prisons company. On Wednesday, she testified that she would consult with career ethics officials within the Justice Department over how to handle potential conflicts of interest.\n\n\"This level of corporate entanglement just speaks to exactly the wrong incentives,\" Gilbert said Thursday. \"We do not think that this level of corporate alignment can be addressed simply by recusals.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nBurgum pressed on whether he would apply conditions on federal aid\n\nSen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., whose state is reeling from the Los Angeles wildfires, asked Burgum whether he believes federal aid should come with conditions.\n\n“Well, I think … each situation would vary,” Burgum said.\n\nPadilla’s question comes as Trump and some Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have called for placing conditions on disaster aid to California amid an embittered relationship between the president-elect and Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom. Trump has blamed the wildfires on Newsom, while Newsom has called on Trump not to “play any politics.”\n\nThe Department of Interior plays a key role in wildfire response and determining how wildfire management budgets are allocated and spent.\n\nPadilla then asked Burgum whether he would commit to responding to every disaster, regardless of the state and jurisdiction. “Absolutely,” Burgum said.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhitehouse asks about fossil fuel influence on Trump EPA\n\nSen.

Hard,” Whitehouse said. “And they’ll be feeling very entitled based on their political spending toward a Trump victory.”\n\nZeldin is expected to support Trump’s agenda to deregulate and expand the fossil fuel industry.\n\nWhitehouse also asked about calls from some members of Trump world to slash staffing at agencies such as the EPA and whether Zeldin would comply.\n\n“I am not coming into this position with any threat,” Zeldin replied. “My position as I sit here is a promise, it is an obligation, and it is a commitment to do my part to do the best job possible in leading the EPA.”\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nSanders asks Bessent about capping credit card interest\n\nSen.

Gavin Newsom. Newsom has suspended landmark environmental laws to speed rebuilding in Los Angeles after the wildfire disaster.\n\n“And I assume, Mr. Zeldin, your response will not depend on whether disaster strikes a red state or a blue state, you will equally work to speed relief to those Americans affected?” Schiff asked Thursday.\n\n“Yes, Senator,” Zeldin replied.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nHirono raises climate change, Burgum parries with carbon capture\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii., pressed Burgum on climate change, noting Trump's call for more oil and gas drilling.\n\nMore than 23 million acres of public land are currently leased out for oil and gas drilling, and Trump has promised to expand that.\n\nHirono noted that two Republican defense secretaries, James Mattis and Chuck Hagel, had described climate change as a critical national security threat.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., asked.\n\nZeldin replied that he believes climate change is real, before defending his likely future boss.\n\n“As far as President Trump goes, the context that I have heard him speak about it was with a criticism of policies that have been enacted because of climate change,” Zeldin said. “And I think that he’s concerned about the economic costs of some policies where there’s a debate and a difference of opinion between parties.”\n\n“I would respectfully disagree with you,” Sanders said.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nDay 2 of Pam Bondi confirmation hearing starts: Who are the witnesses?\n\nThe second day of Pam Bondi's confirmation hearing has kicked off.

Mehta issued his brief order, which also applied to seven other defendants whose sentences were commuted Monday, following that visit.\n\nThe order states that all eight defendants need Mehta's permission to visit the Capitol in particular as well as Washington, D.C. in general.\n\nHowever, the Justice Department said in its motion that the commutation of Rhodes' sentence means he is no longer subject to the terms of probation or a supervised release from prison.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n−Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Quite a day': Devastated Pacific Palisades neighborhood abuzz ahead of Trump visit\n\nLOS ANGELES – Activity buzzed outside Fire Station No. 69 in the Pacific Palisades late Friday morning in anticipation of President Trump’s arrival to inspect the wildfire damage.\n\nThe throng gathered less than a block from burned-down neighborhoods included members of the Secret Service, Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department and Teddy’s Tacos.\n\n“It’s quite a day,’’ said Teddy Vasquez, 39, surveying the scene near his taco truck that has been serving free food outside the firehouse since less than 72 hours after the fires broke out Jan. 7. “Firefighters left their homes to be out here. The least I could do is come out here and feed them.’’\n\nWith Trump expected to arrive by helicopter at about 2:30 p.m. local time, law enforcement walked along nearby Fiske Street, a demolished block of homes that Trump is expected to survey after an aerial tour of the ruin.\n\nAlso, banquet tables have been set up inside the fire department for an emergency briefing that will include the president. Fire captain Jeff Brown, a key participant in the activities, declined comment. But Vasquez, the taco truck owner, was happy to chat about Trump’s impending arrival as his workers began to heat flour tortillas.\n\n“Hoping President Trump likes tacos,’’ said Vasquez, who lives in Long Beach. “I think he will after he tries Teddy’s.’’\n\n– Josh Peter\n\n“I want more babies,” Vance says in his first speech as vice president\n\nVice President JD Vance on Friday told anti-abortion activists at their annual March for Life rally in Washington that the country had failed its citizens.\n\n“We failed a generation not only by permitting a culture of abortion on demand, but also by neglecting to help young parents achieve the ingredients they need to lead a happy and meaningful life,” he said.\n\nHe said a “culture of radical individualism” had led to people viewing the “responsibilities and joys” of raising a family as obstacles.\n\n“Our society has failed to recognize the obligation that one generation has to another as a core part of living in a society,” he said. “So let me say very simply, I want more babies in the United States of America.”\n\nVance, a former senator from Ohio, has advocated boosting the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $5,000 per child to help with the cost of raising children.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\n‘Houses, trailers, bodies’ float past during Asheville flood: victim\n\nThomas Bright described for President Trump his harrowing escape from a home that had been in his family for 80 years and four generations before Hurricane Helene destroyed it.\n\nBright woke up at 5 a.m. to the sound of trees falling on the house in the Azalea Road area of East Asheville. He began moving five vehicles from around the house to a road about one-third of a mile away, as the floodwaters began to rise.\n\nWhen the water was ankle-deep inside the house, he retreated to a loft. When the water reached their hips, he made a makeshift ladder to climb onto the roof.\n\nHe spent four hours on the roof writing farewell notes on his cellphone to his two children and his two grandchildren as debris from the storm floated past. His garage floated away before the water crested at about 4 feet high on the roof.\n\n“We didn’t think we were going to make it at all,” Bright said. “We were watching houses, trailers, bodies coming by us.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\n‘Horrific’: Fairview resident tells Trump of flood and bodies\n\nMona Nix-Roper, who lives in the Fairview area of North Carolina, told President Donald Trump her home became like an island in September as floodwaters from Hurricane Helene rose around it.\n\nShe was home alone because her husband was staying with a 98-year-old neighbor to make sure she was alright. When Nix went out to check the road and bridge that provide access to her home, she found they were gone.\n\nFire Department officials urged her the next day to evacuate because of the risk of landslides. Her 21-year-old son Nathan hiked in five miles after roads became impassable to help her leave.\n\n“He said, ‘Mom, grab a bag, we’ve got to go,’” Nix said. “I said, ‘Son, there’s no way I can hike out of here.’ He said, ‘No, we’ve got to go.’”\n\nAs they walked out, they saw a neighbor’s body that had turned blue in the water.\n\n“Horrific is just all I can say,” Nix said. “There were people out everywhere looking for their loved ones. And there were dead bodies. My son’s like, ‘Mom, you’re going to see things you don’t want to see.’”\n\nNix’s home was without power for two months, so she lived in her church’s sound room. Others had lost everything, so she said she is embarrassed to ask for help.\n\n“We need help,” Nix said. “It’s just heartbreaking.”\n\nTrump appeared moved.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of bad things, but I’ve never seen anything like it,” Trump said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump thanks March for Life activists via video\n\nWhen Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, President Donald Trump on Friday said a “historic wrong was set right” thanks to the “tireless work and devotion across five decades” of anti-abortion rights activists as he addressed March for Life rallygoers at the National Mall.\n\n“Three years ago, I was so proud to be a participant,” he said. “Six courageous justices of the Supreme Court of the United States returned the issue to the state legislatures and to the people where it belongs.”\n\nIn his second term, Trump said he would “stand proudly for families and for life.”\n\n“Under my leadership, the reformed Department of Justice will finally investigate the radical left attacks on churches and crisis pregnancy centers, and we will bring perpetrator to justice,” he said.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nPastor describes generosity of volunteers helping recovery\n\nPastor Ramona Nix told President Donald Trump she had dedicated her Eagle Rock, North Carolina church a week before the storm arrived with Hurricane Helene in September.\n\nNix stayed in the church building for three months, sleeping on the floor for three weeks, because the community’s needs were so great. Her son ferried supplies in, Nix said.\n\n“Before the week was over, the church was so packed, we couldn’t even walk,” Nix said. “Even our sanctuary, it was up to the platform.”\n\nVolunteers arrived from Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana and Oklahoma to help with the recovery. “They were coming in day and night,” Nix said.\n\nAt one point, Nix asked a woman who arrived if she could do anything special for her.\n\n“She said, ‘I don’t want to be selfish, but could I have a cup of coffee,’” Nix said. “I handed her that coffee and she stood there. Tears just poured. She said, ‘You don’t realize how important the little things.’ It’s not the big things in life that we have, but it’s the little things.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\n‘I didn’t think I was going to make it’: NC victim to Trump\n\nKim West described her harrowing escape from her home as it flooded from Hurricane Helene in September, as President Donald Trump visited the storm-ravaged Swannanoa, North Carolina.\n\nAs the river waters rose near their house, Kim and her husband Chris West started moving vehicles to higher ground along the road. By then, water was ankle deep inside the house. Kim West grabbed her purse and pug dog and Chris West put dog food in a trash bag.\n\n“By the time we got into the driveway, it was already waist deep,” West said. “I didn’t think I was going to make it.”\n\nThey were stuck on local roads for hours because of flooding. The waters finally receded about midnight, after they began evacuating at 5 a.m.\n\n“We just lost everything that we had,” West said. “Didn’t even have a brush for like three days.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nThune and Johnson address March for Life rallygoers\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday addressed the annual March for Life rally at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., saying the anti-abortion rights protesters were “not alone.”\n\n“You are part of a great movement united around the truth. That every life is precious,” he said. “I stand with you in this fight and so do many of my colleagues in Congress.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., talked about being a “product of an unplanned teen pregnancy\" born in 1972, one year before abortion was legalized when Roe v. Wade became the law of the land.\n\n“I am so eternally grateful that my mom and dad ignored all the people who told them to just take care of that problem,” he said. “They chose to embrace life and to have me the first of their four children.”\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump granted pardons to 23 anti-abortion rights activists.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump suggests abolishing FEMA\n\nPresident Donald Trump ratcheted up his criticism with the suggestion he might abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency because of its response in North Carolina to lingering damage from Hurricane Helene in September.\n\n“I’ll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA or maybe even getting rid of FEMA,” Trump said after a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina. “Frankly, FEMA’s not good.”\n\nTrump accused FEMA crews of being unfamiliar with areas when responding to disasters. FEMA also imposes rules and requirements on crews that aren’t as good as what local officials provide, Trump said. The federal government should instead send funding to governors to manage their own response to disasters, he said.\n\n“FEMA has turned out to be a disaster,” Trump said. “I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly – we pay a percentage to the state.”\n\nAfter speaking with flood victims in Swannanoa, North Carolina, Trump later added, “If it was up to me right now, I’d end it right now.\"\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nPolitics shadow Trump's visit to North Carolina\n\nGlimpses of the politics behind disaster aid were visible as visited North Carolina to review damage from Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump recalled a whistleblower reported that Federal Emergency Management Agency crews refused to help people with Trump's 2024 presidential campaign signs in their yards. “That’s not good,” the president said.\n\nTrump noted that North Carolina and adjoining Tennessee each supported him in the last election – the Volunteer State slightly more.\n\nThe president also called for California to adopt voter ID, to ensure the citizenship of voters, to receive disaster aid for its wildfires around Los Angeles.\n\nThroughout his comments at a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina, Trump cited problems with former President Joe Biden’s response to the disaster that left 104 people in North Carolina dead, 73,000 homes severely damaged or destroyed and Asheville without running water for two months.\n\n“It doesn’t matter at this point: Biden did a bad job,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTennessee governor thanks Trump for helping Appalachia\n\nTennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee, whose state abuts North Carolina and was also damaged by Hurricane Helene, attended Trump’s briefing on the disaster and thanked him.\n\n“The people in this region – including Tennessee, the people of Appalachia – are grateful that you are here and that you haven’t forgotten them,” Lee said. “There are other disasters. This was enormous for both North Carolina and Tennessee.”\n\nTrump joked about which state gave him more votes. “I hate to tell you, North Carolina, it was Tennessee,\" the president said.\n\nLee said one of the counties hurt in the disaster supported Trump with 88% of the vote.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says Anthony Fauci can hire his own security\n\nTrump said the federal security detail for Dr. Anthony Fauci, a former head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease, had been removed Thursday because it can’t last a lifetime and he could hire his own protection.\n\nFauci led the federal health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to harsh criticism from Republicans about studies of the origin of the disease and the lockdowns to combat it during the first year.\n\n“When you work for government, at some point your security detail comes off,” Trump told reporters while visiting storm-damaged North Carolina. “You can’t have them forever.”\n\nTrump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, also lost their security details during the first week of his administration.\n\n“They all made a lot of money, they can hire their own security, too,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nNC Reps. Edwards, Foxx and Moore to help lead recovery\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, announced he would help guide recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene with three House Republicans from the region with the most damage.\n\nThe lawmakers are GOP Reps. Chuck Edwards, Virginia Foxx and Tim Moore.\n\nTrump announced that Whatley would lead the recovery effort with Democratic Gov. Josh Stein.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump wants voter ID in California for disaster aid\n\nTrump said on Friday he would like to see two changes in California – the adoption of voter ID and the redirection of water from the northern part of the state to the south – in exchange for disaster aid for wildfires.\n\nTrump said he wanted voter identification to ensure the citizenship of voters. He also repeated his complaint that the state should divert funding from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Los Angeles to fight fires.\n\n“I want two things,” Trump told reporters upon his arrival in Asheville, North Carolina. “After that, I will be the greatest president California has ever seen.”\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says OPEC lowering oil prices is key to stopping war in Ukraine\n\nTrump said his proposal for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce the price of oil is key to stopping the war in Ukraine.\n\n“We want to see OPEC cut the price of oil and that will automatically stop the tragedy that’s taking place in Ukraine,” Trump said in Asheville, North Carolina. “It’s a butchering tragedy, for both sides, by the way.”\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Trump said a key to stopping the war is for OPEC to cut its prices because “if you have it high, that war is not going to end so easily.”\n\n“OPEC ought to get on the ball and they ought to drop the price of oil and that war will stop right away,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump offers ‘a lot of money’ to NC, overhaul of FEMA\n\nTrump told reporters in Asheville, North Carolina, that the federal government would supply “a lot of the money” to repair damage from floods and landslides after Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump also proposed to overhaul the FEMA so that states respond to their own disasters rather than the federal government.\n\n“We’re going to fix it as fast as we can,” Trump said. “It’s a massive amount of damage.”\n\nTrump said Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, and Democratic Gov. Josh Stein would work on plans for demolition of damaged buildings and cleaning up debris. Trump said the federal government would probably provide 75% of the funding.\n\n“We’re going to supply the money, a lot of the money,” Trump said.\n\nTrump said he would review “the whole concept of FEMA” because states such as Florida with hurricanes and Oklahoma with tornadoes are better at responding to disasters.\n\n“I’d like to see the states take care of disasters,” Trump said. “I think you’re going to find it a lot less expensive – less than half – and you’re going to get a much quicker response.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff ‘glad’ Trump will see devastation from wildfires\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, a frequent critic of Trump, said he’s glad Trump is visiting Los Angeles to tour the wildfire damage but that he and Sen. Alex Padilla have votes scheduled and couldn’t attend.\n\n“I’m glad that he’s going to see the devastation because I think, frankly, until you see it and the scope of it – whole neighborhoods gone block after block after block – it’s hard to wrap your head around,” Schiff told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”\n\nBut Schiff said he hoped Trump and congressional Republicans wouldn’t put conditions on funding for disaster aid.\n\n“We've never done that when it comes to our fellow citizens who are hurting,” Schiff said. “And California, frankly, has been the most generous state in terms of supporting our fellow citizens, whether they're in red states or blue when they face disaster.”\n\nSchiff said overhauling the Environmental Protection Agency and the FEMA, as Trump has suggested, are areas that could lead to bipartisan support.\n\n“All of that is ample ground to get together and make things happen,” Schiff said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump said he didn’t invite California Sen. Adam Schiff on trip\n\nrump said he didn’t invite Sen. Adam Schiff, a frequent Democratic critic, on the trip to areas of Los Angeles damaged by wildfires.\n\n“Is he going? I don't know. I mean, I really don't know,” Trump said. “You know, if he's going to be there it would be cheaper, but I didn't invite him. Somebody did.\"\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., has asked that disaster aid for California not come with strings attached, after Republicans suggested potential restrictions on the funding. Schiff is a former member of the U.S. House who previously led the first impeachment of Trump over his dealings with Ukraine and has questioned whether his nominees to become Cabinet secretaries will act independently from him.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump said he will watch ‘March for Life’\n\nTrump said he would be watching the “March for Life” in Washington as he traveled to North Carolina and California to visit disaster areas. He said Vice President JD Vance would represent the administration “very well.”\n\n“I’m going to be watching it,” Trump said. “He’s going to be representing us very well.”\n\nTrump also noted that he pardoned 23 people who he said were \"unjustly\" charged for protesting outside abortion clinics.\n\n“It was disgraceful what happened,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump calls DOD nominee Pete Hegseth ‘a good man’\n\nTrump praised his nominee to lead the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, as a “good man” but didn’t predict what would happen with his Senate confirmation vote scheduled for late Friday.\n\n“He’s a good man. I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Trump said. “I hope he makes it.”\n\nGOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against limiting debate on the nomination. Trump also questioned whether Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would support Hegseth because Trump and McConnell have had disputes in the past.\n\n“I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump: North Carolina was ‘allowed to fester’\n\nTrump told reporters on Friday morning outside the White House that he’s going to North Carolina because the state has been treated badly since Hurricane Helene and to California where he said the wildfires should have been extinguished already.\n\n“North Carolina is a horrible thing the way that’s been allowed to fester. It should have been done months ago,” Trump said. “North Carolina has been treated very badly.”\n\nTrump will visit Los Angeles later in the day to hear about the wildfires.\n\n“We’re going to take a look at the fire if they let the water flow, but they didn’t let the water flow,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump's travel schedule ‒ minute by minute\n\nTrump left the White House by helicopter at 9:16 a.m. for his tour of disaster areas in North Carolina and California on Friday.

Stein to meet Trump\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is planning to meet President Donald Trump on the tarmac of Asheville Regional Airport during Trump’s visit to Western North Carolina, according to The Citizen-Times, a USA TODAY Network partner.\n\nEarlier in the week, Stein, a Democrat, said Trump’s planned visit to western North Carolina, which was ravaged by Tropical Storm Helene nearly four months ago, was “very good news” for the region’s residents. The storm killed more than 100 people across the state and caused an estimated $60 billion in damage, according to the latest estimate from the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management.\n\n‒ Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nWhat is Trump’s schedule today?\n\nTrump's disaster-area tour begins around 10 a.m. EST on his first trip away from Washington.

Those same reports say the decision isn’t final, but if Rubio is selected and confirmed by his colleagues in the U.S. Senate, DeSantis would get to name his replacement.\n\nIt would present DeSantis, who ran against Trump for the GOP nomination in 2024 and lost, with a major decision that could affect his possible future aspirations to run for president in 2028.\n\nThe person selected would serve until 2026, when a special election would be held to serve out the remaining two years of Rubio’s term. DeSantis, a former U.S House member, could pick someone who would run in 2026, or someone who would be a placeholder if he chose to attempt to return to Washington ahead of a potential 2028 run for president.\n\nThe initial list of possible picks includes Lt.

Kristi Noem will head up the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump plans to meet with Congressional leaders tomorrow\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters Tuesday that President-elect Donald Trump plans to come to Capitol Hill to meet with Johnson and the next Senate Majority Leader, who will be elected tomorrow morning.\n\nJohnson said he expects the meeting to take place in the morning before Trump meets with President Joe Biden at the White House at 11 a.m. The Senate leadership election is scheduled for 9:30 a.m.\n\nTrump has already drafted two sitting House members -- Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla. -- to serve in his administration.\n\nThat may cause problems for the House GOP, which is on track to hold the majority in the lower chamber on a razor-thin margin.\n\n\"President Trump fully understands and appreciates the math here,\" Johnson said, adding that he doesn't expect Trump to select any more current House members, but noted that's up to Trump.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nThree senators vying to become Senate Republican leader\n\nThree senators are running to succeed Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who is stepping down from the position in January.\n\nThe two main contenders to become McConnell’s heir are Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., who is currently second-in-command in the Senate GOP as Republican whip, and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who has also served as whip and previously led the Senate GOP’s campaign arm.\n\nBut several of President-elect Donald Trump’s most recognized allies, including billionaire tech titan Elon Musk, are mounting a campaign to get Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., elected to the post. They argue Scott is the only candidate who has been sufficiently loyal to Trump and would be best equipped to represent the president-elect’s interests.\n\nThe election will be held Wednesday behind closed doors.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nDonald Trump expected to tap Marco Rubio as Secretary of State: Reports\n\nDonald Trump is expected to tap Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida to serve as his Secretary of State, according to news reports.\n\nRubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, is Trump’s choice to become the nation’s top diplomat, according to CNN and The New York Times. Rubio, a Cuban American, would be the first Latino to serve as Secretary of State. The Times noted, however, that its sources said Trump could still change his mind at the last minute.\n\nRubio has deep foreign policy experience and has transformed from a Trump opponent to a close ally who was a finalist to serve as Trump's vice president. Rubio has expressed support for Ukraine's war effort against Russia, but voted against additional aid for the country last year.\n\n− Riley Beggin and Michael Collins\n\nDonald Trump to pick Kristi Noem to head Homeland Security: Reports\n\nDonald Trump is expected to pick South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to lead the Department of Homeland Security, according to multiple news reports.\n\nCNN first reported that Noem was Trump's choice to become Homeland Security secretary. Noem, a longtime Trump loyalist who joined Trump on the 2024 campaign trail, served as a South Dakota Republican congresswoman from 2011 to 2019. She was elected the state's first female governor in 2018 and was reelected in 2022.\n\nA rancher, farmer and small-business owner, the 52-year-old Noem was briefly under consideration as Trump's vice presidential running-mate this year. But her bid quickly crumbled amid a public backlash after Noem acknowledged in a memoir earlier this year that she shot and killed her dog Cricket for being \"untrainable.\"\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump picks Mike Waltz as national security adviser\n\nDonald Trump has asked Florida congressman Mike Waltz to serve as his national security adviser, according to two sources familiar with his selection.\n\nWaltz, 50, is set join the new administration as it navigates several tense geopolitical fights, including the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas wars. The role Trump asked Waltz to serve in does not require Senate confirmation.\n\nThe three-term lawmaker has been a member of the House Armed Services Committee, served in civilian roles at the Pentagon and is a decorated Green Beret combat veteran. He's also an outspoken critic of the Defense Department’s diversity programs.\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook and David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump picks Lee Zeldin, former New York congressman, to lead EPA\n\nDonald Trump tapped former Rep. Lee Zeldin to serve as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nAs the head of the EPA, Zeldin is expected to be tasked with rolling back many of the environmental regulations from the Biden administration while Trump pushes an expansion of fossil-fuel energy.\n\n\"Lee, with a very strong legal background, has been a true fighter for America First policies,\" Trump said in a statement. \"He will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards.\"\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nStephen Miller named Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy\n\nDonald Trump has tapped Stephen Miller, one of his longest-serving top immigration advisers, as deputy chief of staff for policy in the incoming White House.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance congratulated Miller on his new role in a post on X after CNN first reported the move. \"This is another fantastic pick by the president,\" Vance said.\n\nMiller's appointment comes after Trump campaigned for president in 2024 on mobilizing mass deportations of undocumented immigrants who are in the country unlawfully.\n\nMiller, 39, served as senior advisor to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House and is credited with shaping Trump’s immigration policies, which included separating migrant children from their families and a ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries. Miller played a central role in Trump's 2024 campaign.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWho is Elise Stefanik? Donald Trump picks major House ally to be next UN ambassador\n\nDonald Trump named Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to be the next ambassador to the United Nations, according to multiple reports. The New York lawmaker has accepted the offer.\n\nTrump's nomination of Stefanik, a longtime congressional ally, is his first cabinet pick after being reelected Tuesday for a second, nonconsecutive term in the White House.\n\nOne of Stefanik's most prominent moments came last year during a congressional hearing with college presidents from Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and MIT. During the hearing, she asked them whether calling for the genocide of Jews warranted disciplinary action.\n\nAll three presidents waffled and dodged the question, instead offering legal responses without directly condemning calling for the genocide of Jews. Two of the presidents, Penn's Liz Magill, and Harvard's Claudine Gay, have since left their posts.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/12/04/pete-hegseth-donald-trump-ron-desantis-defense-secretary/76754104007/", "title": "Pete Hegseth nomination: Trump weighs Ron DeSantis as ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − A leading 2024 GOP primary foe could become Donald Trump's military chief.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated former Fox News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary but is considering replacing him with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, according to a source close to the transition.\n\nHegseth's chances of making it through U.S. Senate confirmation have been bogged down by revelations he was accused of sexual assault, which he denies and for which he has never faced charges, and by a whistleblower report first detailed by The New Yorker alleging he had been forced out of leadership roles with two nonprofit veterans groups for personal misconduct, mismanagement of funds and intoxication on the job.\n\nDeSantis would be a remarkable addition to Trump's Cabinet. The 46-year-old Florida governor's presidential primary campaign last year against Trump became highly contentious. Trump regularly mocked DeSantis as \"Desanctimonious,\" and the Florida governor slammed the former and future president as insufficiently conservative.\n\nDeSantis also had a falling out with Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, who ran his first campaign for governor in the closing stretch of the 2018 election cycle but later was booted out of his orbit.\n\nAfter dropping out of the presidential race, DeSantis endorsed Trump, met with him and was invited to the Republican National Convention to deliver a speech supporting him. The two seem to have repaired their riff, at least publicly, and DeSantis still has a strong following within the GOP after six years of aggressive conservative governing.\n\nBefore entering politics as a congressman and becoming governor in 2018, DeSantis served in the Navy’s Judge Advocate General’s Corps from 2004 to 2010. He deployed to Iraq with a Navy SEAL team, earned a Bronze Star and later became a fierce advocate for Trump's first-term presidency while representing a northeastern Florida district in the House.\n\nAs governor, DeSantis often deployed the Florida National Guard to deal with natural disasters and other issues. He also revived the Florida State Guard. His management of both was criticized.\n\nDeSantis sent both the National Guard and State Guard far from Florida to help secure the southern border. The State Guard experienced turmoil and was criticized for being too militarized.\n\nDeSantis laid out a plan for the military while running for president. Like Hegseth, he focused heavily on ridding the military of \"woke\" policies he views as too liberal.\n\n\"People see the military losing its way, not focusing on the mission, and focusing on a lot of these other things,” DeSantis told CNN.\n\nThe military plan DeSantis rolled out last year included eliminating diversity programs, ending support for transgender people and cutting climate changes initiatives. He also called for reinstating military members who were removed from duty for refusing to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and conducting a review of all four-star officers within six months, removing anyone who \"promoted policies to the detriment of readiness and warfighting.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news that DeSantis could be nominated for the post, said Trump also could decide not to choose DeSantis and select another replacement if Hegseth’s nomination falls apart.\n\nA combat veteran, Hegseth would need the support of Senate Republicans to win confirmation. On Wednesday morning, Hegseth told reporters while visiting the U.S. Capitol for meetings with senators that he had spoken to Trump and that the president-elect still backs him for the Pentagon job.\n\n\"I spoke to the president-elect this morning. He said: 'Keep going, keep fighting. I’m behind you all the way,'\" Hegseth said. \"Why would I back down? I’ve always been a fighter. I'm here for the war fighters.\"\n\nOn Capitol Hill, several GOP senators said they were reluctant to answer hypothetical questions about DeSantis being substituted for Hegseth.\n\n“Right now, I’m working on Pete. And that’s the only thing I’m focused on,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee that will be in charge of holding Hegseth's confirmation hearing.Mullin said he sees Hegseth as the “most challenging” of Trump's incoming nominations since Matt Gaetz’s decision to back out as the president-elect's pick to be attorney general. Still, Mullin said that he believes there is still a path forward for Hegseth. “I’m all in for Pete. I think Pete will be great at this,” he said..\n\nSen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said she plans to meet with Hegseth next week in her office.\n\n“Whatever the Trump administration decides about its approach to the Department of Defense, you know, I'll be just prepared to deal with it when the time comes,” she said.\n\nWhen asked whether she believes DeSantis is qualified to be defense secretary, Lummis said “definitely.”\n\n“Ron has a military background, and he's certainly qualified. He's proven his administrative skills as governor,” said Lummis, a founding member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus with DeSantis.\n\nThe Trump transition office and DeSantis' office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump and DeSantis were together Tuesday in Florida at a memorial for three Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office deputies killed in a traffic crash.\n\nAfter weeks of speculation about whether Trump would follow normal procedures for presidential transitions for digging into the backgrounds of those proposed for top federal jobs, the president-elect's transition team announced Tuesday that they entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice for background checks and security clearances.\n\nSo far, two Trump picks for senior positions have dropped out. Chad Chronister withdrew from consideration Tuesday to run the Drug Enforcement Administration, weeks after former Rep. Matt Gaetz dropped out of consideration for attorney general amid scrutiny about allegations of sex with an underage girl.\n\nContributing: Charles Ventura, Sudiksha Kochi and Savannah Kuchar\n\n(This story has been updated with more information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/12/03/trump-nominees-hegseth-patel-fbi-senate/76712589007/", "title": "GOP senators call for vetting of Trump's picks Hegseth and Patel", "text": "WASHINGTON – Republican senators say they want to be supportive of President-elect Donald Trump’s controversial picks to lead the Pentagon and FBI.\n\nBut they have questions for Pete Hegseth – a veteran and conservative media personality who has been accused of sexual misconduct – and want to see background checks conducted on him and Trump's choice for a new FBI director, Kash Patel, before they get on board.\n\n“My attitude about the nominations is that that’s why God made confirmation hearings,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, who added that he was unfamiliar with most of Trump’s nominees but has a “completely open mind” about them leading important federal agencies.\n\nWhile not a legal requirement, FBI background checks on an incoming president’s personnel picks are standard protocol and come with practical reasons including for the sharing of classified information during the transition from one White House to the next. Trump’s team had bypassed the procedure and conducted its own vetting process.\n\nAfter several Republican senators publicly raised the issue, Trump's team said Tuesday that it has taken an initial step toward working with the Department of Justice on background checks and security clearances, signing what's known as a memorandum of understanding that would pave the way for them to engage in that process.\n\n\"Ultimately, this will afford the transition process additional insights, and it facilitates our agency landing teams gaining access to the information they need to prepare for leadership of the federal agencies and departments,\" the Trump transition team said in a statement.\n\nInside the transition:Trump makes a statement with aggressive Cabinet picks, fast-moving transition effort\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, who is set to lead the Senate Armed Services Committee next year and oversee Hegseth’s confirmation hearing, said Monday evening that while he believed the “issue of who does the background checks is about to be resolved,” he wanted to see precedent followed and the FBI conduct background checks on Trump’s intended nominees.\n\n“The background checks are important. Hearing from Americans is important,” said Wicker, a Mississippi Republican.\n\nWicker added that he expects a hearing to be held on Hegseth in January, after the next Congress gets sworn in and when Republicans have the majority. Senators will balance the arguments for and against Hegseth, he said, and make an “informed judgement” based on what they find out.\n\nHegseth and Patel are among a handful of Trump nominees whose appointments could still run into trouble in the Senate, even with Republicans in charge. The GOP will hold a narrow 53-47 majority beginning next month, meaning it would take four Republican senators to oppose a Trump nominee in order for it to fail so long as all Democrats and independents stick together and vote 'no' too.\n\nAlready, one of Trump’s early Cabinet picks, Matt Gaetz, quit Congress and removed himself from consideration to be U.S. attorney general ahead of the potential public release of a House ethics report that examined sexual misconduct allegations against the former Florida GOP lawmaker.\n\nAs lawmakers returned to Washington on Monday, damaging new details in the saga surrounding Hegseth emerged.\n\nHegseth, 44, had been under fire for a 2017 sexual encounter, in which an unidentified woman claimed in a police report the former Fox News anchor blocked the exit of a hotel room in Monterey, California, and sexually assaulted her. Hegseth and his attorneys have denied the allegations and maintained that the encounter was consensual.\n\nIn a second incident, Hegseth’s mother, Penelope, called out her son’s “abusive behavior” towards women, in a blistering email from 2018 that the New York Times published last week. She said she has since apologized to her son and called publication of the email “disgusting.”\n\nA whistleblower report at the center of an article in The New Yorker on Sunday alleged Hegseth had been forced out of two non-profit organizations for personal misconduct, mismanagement of funds and intoxication on the job.\n\n“Pete Hegseth dedicated his entire life as a warrior for the troops and for our country,\" the Trump transition team said in a statement Tuesday. \"He is an incredibly tough and smart candidate that will fight to put America First. He’s clearly being subject to an onslaught of unwarranted and untrue criticism by people, including disgruntled former employees, who don’t want to see President Trump and his Administration enact real, meaningful change at the Pentagon.\"\n\nHegseth's lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n“I’m obviously looking at this new information,” Wicker told reporters on Monday evening. “But I’m still looking to be supportive.”\n\nWicker said he was not bothered by the email that Hegseth’s mother sent him, noting that she withdrew her comments.\n\n“He’ll be vetted on all that,” Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, one of Hegseth’s defenders in the Senate, said on Monday. “As I told him, I said, ‘You’re going to have to have all your ducks in a row.’ And he will, when it comes to explaining all that.”\n\nTuberville called Hegseth “very smart” and defended his qualifications.\n\n“I’ve known Pete for quite a long time,” he said. “I like him because of his age. He’s not a 60, 70-year-old admiral general that doesn’t relate to the war fighters, people who’ve been fighting, men and women that’s going to fight to protect our country.”\n\nSenate Republicans keeping 'an open mind' about Trump nominees\n\nHegseth’s ability to get confirmed will rest on the support of moderates such as Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and senators who are not tightly aligned with Trump. Iowa Republican and military veteran Joni Ernst, a vocal advocate for sexual assault victims, is also being closely watched. Ernst was at Mar-a-Lago last week.\n\nMurkowski declined to comment on Monday. Collins stressed the importance of following the regular Senate confirmation process, which Trump has floated going around with an untested constitutional authority known as \"recess appointments\" where lawmakers would allow the president to appoint his picks without their OK.\n\n“That is why I do not want to see an attempt to have recess appointments. It’s important that we thoroughly vet the nominees for these very important decisions,” Collins said of Hegseth.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he expects a Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing would take place for Hegseth, who he plans to meet with this week, even if Republicans ultimately opted to go into recess to allow Trump to directly appoint him.\n\n“My presumption is that I’ll support him, and I hope people will at least let him get to his confirmation hearing, hear from him, those who have major concerns,” he said.\n\nHegseth will be put under oath at the hearing, Hawley, who is not on the committee, added. “What I’d say to my Republican colleagues is give him a chance, let him answer your questions. If you’ve got tough questions, that’s fine. Pose them to him and give him a shot to answer.”\n\nRepublican Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming said she wants to hear Hegseth's ideas on how to try to rein in spending at the Department of Defense. Speaking to reporters before a meeting she said she had scheduled with Hegseth on Monday evening, Lummis added that she had not heard about the report that alleged the Trump pick to run the Pentagon had mismanaged funds at veterans’ organizations.\n\nAs for the sexual assault allegations, Lummis said she listened to conservative media personality Megyn Kelly’s review of the police report, and “she came away completely convinced that he was the – albeit it, extremely drunk – that he was the more innocent person in that engagement.”\n\n“I’m going to give him the benefit of the doubt. I’m inclined to say yes to Pete Hegseth, but I do have questions,” she said.\n\n'I truly don't know him'\n\nRepublicans in the Senate, who will be tasked with confirming Trump’s nominees once he takes office, say they are keeping an open mind about his appointments, including the 44-year-old Patel, who Trump announced on Saturday that he plans to nominate as the next FBI director.\n\nBiden to Trump White House:Trump reaches transition agreement with Biden White House after long delay\n\nCurrent FBI director, Christopher Wray, still has more than two years left on his ten-year term. However, Trump can fire Wray, who he appointed after axing former FBI director James Comey, and nominate Patel to the position.\n\n“It’s not illegal,” said Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican who declined in 2024 to endorse Trump. He added that the most important factors as he considers Patel are his background, competency and vision for the agency.\n\nA hardline Trump ally, Patel is a former federal prosecutor and federal public defender who gained notoriety as a top aide to then-House Intelligence Committee Chair Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. Patel also worked as the Pentagon's chief of staff during Trump's first term, as well as serving as deputy director of National Intelligence and senior director for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council.\n\nSince Trump made his announcement over the weekend, Patel has garnered outside criticism for his verbal bashes against the FBI, as well as skepticism for his lack of experience.\n\n“Hard to imagine a single more threatening and adversarial figure for the FBI in the entire country,” former U.S. Attorney and deputy assistant Attorney General Harry Litman wrote on X.\n\nWhile Hegseth made the rounds on Capitol Hill on Monday, several senators said they were just starting to get acquainted with Patel’s potential nomination.\n\n“I don’t know Mr. Patel,” said Young. “My expectation will be that we will receive a lot of information. Members of the committee will go ahead and hold hearings, and if I feel like at the end of that process I don’t have the information I need to make an informed decision, I’ll make that known.”\n\nWicker said, “I know that he has a lot of admirers and a lot of detractors, but...I’ve never met him, never had a conversation with him.\"\n\nLike Young and Wicker, others said they want to know more about Patel and expect to get their questions in at confirmation hearings.\n\n“I truly don’t know him,” said Collins. “I had heard his name, but I don’t know his background. He’s the nominee I will have to do a lot of work on.”\n\nContributing: Nick Penzenstadler, Josh Meyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/22/donald-trump-president-executive-orders-live-updates/77859494007/", "title": "Latest on executive orders and president's schedule", "text": "WASHINGTON — On his first full day in office Tuesday, President Donald Trump continued sweeping actions, including ordering the shuttering of all executive branch diversity, equity, and inclusion offices and ordering all employees working in such offices to be placed on leave.\n\nIn addition, Trump revoked Secret Service protection for former U.N.

His nomination drew opposition from senators of both parties after he admitted to employing a housekeeper who was not legally authorized to work in the country. He was also accused of permitting practices that violated workers’ rights. A confirmation hearing was never held.\n\nFlash forward eight years, and Trump said he’d nominate Puzder to serve again, this time in the plum position of European ambassador. Ambassador nominations also require Senate approval, and Puzder will be expected to testify before the upper chamber’s Foreign Relations panel.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nVA warns: Don't hide DEI programs targeted for termination\n\nThe top official at the Department of Veterans Affairs wants staff to report if they learn of efforts to disguise diversity, equity and inclusion programs targeted for termination by the Trump administration, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThe email from Todd Hunter, Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs, says he is “aware of efforts by some in government to disguise these programs by using coded or imprecise language.”\n\nEmployees should report any such efforts within 10 days or “may result in adverse consequences,” he wrote.\n\nThe message follows President Donald Trump's executive order ending DEI programs across the federal government.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nHouthis redesignated as foreign terrorist group\n\nIn another policy reversal, President Donald Trump has changed the country's official designation for the Houthis, the Shia Islamist group active in Yemen for decades, according to a news release.\n\nTrump signed an executive order Wednesday designating Ansar Allah, the group also known as the Houthis, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization for the second time.\n\nTrump designated the Houthis a terrorist group in the final days of his last term in January. Former President Joe Biden delisted the group from that designation shortly after taking office to help facilitate humanitarian assistance to Yemen. The State Department deemed it a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group last year over its sustained attacks on commercial shippers in the Red Sea.\n\nRepublicans had urged Trump before his inauguration to redesignate the militant group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Under the Biden administration, the Iranian proxy group was delisted as an FTO\n\nThe group's designation becomes effective in 30 days.\n\n\"Under President Trump, it is now the policy of the United States to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the Houthis’ capabilities and operations, deprive them of resources, and thereby end their attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea,\" the release says.\n\nThe Trump administration will also end its relationship with groups that \"have made payments to the Houthis, or which have opposed international efforts to counter the Houthis while turning a blind eye towards the Houthis’ terrorism and abuses,\" it says.\n\n– Gabrielle Banks and Francesca Chambers\n\nSenate Democrats ask to meet privately with Pete Hegseth amid new allegations\n\nDemocratic senators on the Armed Services Committee asked Pete Hegseth to privately meet with every member of the committee after his former sister-in-law claimed in signed testimony that he terrified his ex-wife and drank to the point of vomiting and passing out, among other accusations.\n\nThe Senate has yet to vote on Hegseth's nomination for secretary of Defense, but the committee approved it Monday by a vote of 14-13, along party lines.\n\n\"We request that Mr. Hegseth meet privately with every interested lawmaker on the committee before the Senate votes on his nomination so that we can have frank discussions about the new information that has come to light,\" the group, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, said in a joint statement. \"It would be irresponsible and contrary to our constitutional duty for the Senate to vote to confirm this nomination before such meetings have occurred.”\n\nIn the affidavit, the former wife of Hegseth's brother claimed Hegseth's ex-wife hid in closet and set a code word for when he threatened her. Hegseth was dragged out of a strip club where he was getting lap dances in military uniform, and drank to the point of vomiting and passing out, she claimed. He also made racist and sexist comments disparaging Hispanic people and Muslims, according to the document.\n\nHegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, dismissed all the allegations as false.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nJohnson creates new subcommittee to investigate Jan. 6. attack\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced a new select subcommittee on Wednesday that would continue House Republicans’ investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\n“House Republicans are proud of our work so far in exposing the false narratives peddled by the politically motivated January 6 Select Committee during the 117th Congress, but there is still more work to be done,” Johnson said in a statement.\n\nThe purpose of the new subcommittee, Johnson said, is to “uncover the full truth” of the riot.\n\nThough the House did form a bipartisan select committee in 2021 to investigate the attack, Republicans have criticized the panel's findings. The select committee released a final report in 2022 that alleged the “central cause” of the attack was Donald Trump, “who many others followed.”\n\nIn response to Johnson’s announcement, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who chaired the bipartisan committee, told reporters on Wednesday that you can’t “unwrite history.”\n\n“I stand by the work that we did,” he said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMurkowski knocks Trump's Jan. 6 pardons\n\nLisa Murkowski, one of the most moderate lawmakers in Congress, knocked Trump's pardons and commutations for over 1,500 people charged and convicted in the Jah. 6 Capitol riot.\n\n\"The Capitol Police officers are the backbone of Congress— every day they protect and serve the halls of democracy,\" the Alaska Republican shared on X. \"I strongly denounce the blanket pardons given to the violent offenders who assaulted these brave men and women in uniform.\"\n\nMurkowski voted to impeach Trump during his second impeachment trial, when he was charged with inciting the Capitol attack.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nDonald Trump's transportation secretary pick clears hurdle\n\nSean Duffy, Trump's pick to lead the Transportation Department, cleared a pivotal hurdle on Wednesday. The Senate Commerce Committee voted unanimously to send his nomination to the larger Senate, where he'll have his final confirmation vote soon.\n\nDuffy, a one-time Wisconsin lawmaker and reality star, told senators he believes Boeing requires \"tough love\" from federal officials, and he would allow an ongoing safety probe into Elon Musk's Tesla to continue if he's confirmed.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWoman convicted in Capitol riot turns down pardon from Donald Trump\n\nOne of Donald Trump's first acts in office was offering pardons or commutations to nearly 1,600 people charged or convicted in the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nBut at least one recipient isn't accepting the offer. Pamela Hemphill of Boise, Idaho, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail in connection with the riot. She said her attorney told her Tuesday that she had received a pardon, but she refused it.\n\n“Accepting the pardon would be an insult to the Capitol Police officers, to the rule of law, to our nation,” Hemphill told the Idaho Statesman. “The J6 criminals are trying to rewrite history by saying that it was not a riot; it wasn’t an insurrection. I don’t want to be a part of their trying to rewrite what happened that day.”\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nDemocrats, GOP split over the idea of billionaires acquiring TikTok\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that he was open to billionaire Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, or Larry Ellison, co-founder of the software company Oracle, to acquire TikTok – an idea that Democratic lawmakers have balked at.\n\n“That’s so predictable. I mean, anytime he can use his influence to lavish favors on rich friends, he does it. And this has all been just so predictable,” said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who voted in favor of the bipartisan law.\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, said that Musk acquiring TikTok was “always a concern” of hers.\n\nBut Republicans have been open to the idea.\n\n“Somebody needs to take ownership of this from the Chinese Communist Party. I don't know who it is. I mean, if it's a U.S. citizen all the better,” said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

John Kennedy, R-La., commended Trump’s order placing federal DEI workers on leave.\n\n“The best way to stop discriminating against people on the basis of race of gender is to stop discriminating against people on the basis of race and gender,” Kennedy told reporters Wednesday.\n\n“The truth is the American people don't think about race or gender merely as much as some folks in Washington want to pretend,” he continued.\n\nKennedy said he would prefer a more race- or gender-blind approach to hiring, and expects to see this under the Trump administration.\n\n“To a bear, we all taste like chicken,” Kennedy said.– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMusk casts doubt on Stargate, a new AI venture touted by Trump\n\nDonald Trump’s billionaire ally Elon Musk undercut an announcement the president made Tuesday about a private sector investment of up to $500 billion to build artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nTrump said the project, named Stargate, would be a joint venture between ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, with each committing $100 billion for immediate deployment.\n\nAn announcement of the venture by Open AI CEO Sam Altman on X, was immediately derided by Musk.\n\n“They don’t actually have the money,” wrote Musk. Moments later, he added another tweet saying, “SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.”\n\nMusk has been a vocal critic of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman since the company became a for-profit entity.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump says he’s not looking to hurt Russia…but\n\nPresident Trump urged Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to “stop this ridiculous” war with Ukraine or face consequences.\n\nTrump said he would be forced to “put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia” to the United States in a post on Truth Social.\n\n“I’m not looking to hurt Russia. I love the Russian people, and always had a very good relationship with President Putin,” he said, saying the warning was a “favor” to Russia, whose economy he said was “failing.”\n\n“Let’s get this war, which never would have started if I were President, over with,” he said.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nHouse Speaker Johnson doesn’t ‘second-guess’ Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Wednesday he wouldn’t second-guess President Donald Trump’s decision to pardon nearly 1,600 people charged with the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nJohnson said peaceful protests should never be punished and that the Justice Department was weaponized against Trump’s supporters. But the pardons also covered hundreds of people convicted of assaulting police and other violence.\n\n“It was a terrible time and a terrible chapter in America’s history. The president has made his decision. I don’t second-guess those,” Johnson said. “We believe in redemption. We believe in second chances.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nHouse Speaker Johnson calls Biden pardons of relatives ‘shocking’\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., slammed former President Joe Biden for pardoning his son Hunter, brother James and other relatives before leaving office Monday and said legislative action was possible.\n\n“It was shocking,” Johnson said. “It was breathtaking to us.”\n\nHe noted that Democrats criticized President Donald Trump four years earlier at the possibility he would pardon allies before leaving office. But Johnson said the pardons confirm GOP suspicions about what he called “the Biden crime family.”\n\nHouse Republicans conducted an impeachment inquiry against Biden, which included close scrutiny of Hunter Biden and James Biden for their overseas business deals. The former president denied wrongdoing and said he never benefited from the deals. Hunter Biden was convicted of gun and tax charges. Lawmakers urged the Justice Department to investigate James Biden.\n\nThe former president pardoned Hunter Biden WHEN and James Biden and other relatives on his last day in office Monday.\n\n“To us it is disgusting,” Johnson said. “There is a lot of attention that will be paid to this and we will be looking at it as well.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nPolice groups say Trump pardons for Jan. 6 ‘sends a dangerous message’\n\nTwo law enforcement groups – the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police – said President Donald Trump’s pardon of people charged in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, “sends a dangerous message” and they should have served their entire prison terms.\n\n“When perpetrators of crimes, especially serious crimes, are not held fully accountable, it sends a dangerous message that the consequences for attacking law enforcement are not severe, potentially emboldening others to commit similar acts of violence,” the two groups said in a joint statement Tuesday.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police had endorsed Trump in September and both groups said they have longstanding and positive relationships with him. But they voiced disappointment with Trump pardoning nearly 1,600 people, including hundreds convicted of assaulting police officers, and ended the sentences for 14 people.\n\n“The IACP and FOP firmly believe that those convicted of such crimes should serve their full sentences,” the groups said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump to address world leaders gathered in Davos\n\nPresident Donald Trump will be addressing leaders gathered at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday via video, according to organizers.\n\nThe address will start 11 a.m. and last 45 minutes.\n\nThe first day of the meeting coincided with the inauguration of President Trump, and the organizers expect the White House to be a “key topic” as Trump’s policy will impact the global economy in many ways.\n\n“These include imposing steep tariffs on other major economies, reassessing long-held military and diplomatic alliances, reforming multilateral institutions and rolling back an array of US regulations,” according to organizers.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nSen. Sanders defends Gabbard, Trump’s pick to lead DNI\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday night defended Tulsi Gabbard, President Trump’s pick for director of national intelligence, in an interview on CNN.\n\nSome lawmakers have called Gabbard, a former congresswoman from Hawaii, a likely “Russian asset,” and expressed concerns over Gabbard’s 2017 trip to Syria, where she met with former Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nGabbard, who was a Democrat when she served as a congresswoman from 2013 to 2021, supported Sanders during his presidential run in 2016.\n\nSanders said Gabbard “took a lot of heat” for supporting him over Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe said he was not worried about her visit with Assad.\n\n“The idea that you should not sit down with your adversaries whether it is Iran, whether it's China, whether it's North Korea, whether it's Syria, whatever it may be,” he said. “I don't think that that's a valid criticism.”\n\nHe went on praise Trump for his own meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2018.\n\n“Donald Trump did the right thing. Every once in a while, he does,” he said.\n\nHe said he had not made up his mind on how he would vote for Gabbard during the upcoming Senate confirmation hearing.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump orders end to FAA diversity hiring practices\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a document Tuesday evening that directed the Federal Aviation Administration to cease its use of diversity, equity and inclusion hiring authorities. He singled out disability hiring authorities in particular.\n\n“During the prior administration … the FAA betrayed its mission by elevating dangerous discrimination over excellence,” the president argued. He further decried the recruitment of \"individuals with serious infirmities,\" in a rebuke of disability hiring efforts.\n\nThe country's aviation watchdog used expedited disability hiring authorities for at least a decade, including during Trump's first administration. Such programs permitted hiring managers to bypass the competitive hiring process to appoint professionally qualified candidates with disabilities.\n\nIn the document, Trump argued pro-diversity hiring practices \"[penalize] hard-working Americans who want to serve in the FAA but are unable to do so, as they lack a requisite disability or skin color.”\n\nThe agency, however, struggles with large shortages of air traffic controllers, who must meet stringent medical requirements that disability hiring authorities could not circumvent.\n\nThe move is one of many executive actions focused on the federal workforce enacted since Trump took office Monday afternoon. His other actions addressed DEI hiring more broadly, froze hiring in most executive agencies and directed a return to in-person work for many federal employees, among other directives.\n\n– Davis Winkie\n\nTrump executive order inverts civil rights hiring protections\n\nPresident Donald Trump revoked a 1965 civil rights executive order Tuesday, rolling back authorities long used to prevent employment discrimination by federal contractors, subcontractors and grant recipients. He also ordered agencies to plan potential civil rights investigations against private sector entities who embrace diversity hiring.\n\nIn his own executive order, Trump attacked such policies as “dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called ‘diversity, equity and inclusion.’”\n\nTrump’s order flips the script, arguing that affirmative action provisions are illegally discriminatory. Federal agencies instead must now “enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.”\n\n– Davis Winkie\n\nWhat is on President Trump’s schedule today?\n\nTrump will sit down today for an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity for the first interview from the Oval Office, according to Politico. The interview will air at 9 p.m.\n\nThe president is also expected to meet a group of “centrist Republicans” at the White House, the outlet also reported.\n\nThe White House has not yet released a public schedule for the president. The in-town press pool (the rotation of the small group of reporters who shadow the president) has been asked to report at 9 a.m.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJustice Department career officials reshuffled to advance Donald Trump's immigration agenda\n\nJustice Department officials were swiftly reassigned in the wake of President Donald Trump's Monday inauguration in order to help align the department with the new administration's priorities – particularly on immigration, a department official familiar with the matter told USA TODAY.\n\nIn a speech to supporters Monday, Trump described immigration as his \"number one issue.\"\n\nThe swift moves at the Justice Department, which were in place by Tuesday, show the administration moving to enact his immigration agenda at the department level.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump pardons founder of Silk Road\n\nPresident Trump said Tuesday night that he had given a “full and unconditional” pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, an online black market which enabled users to buy and sell illegal drugs.\n\nThe president announced his decision on Truth Social.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump announces private sector investment in AI\n\nPresident Trump announced on Tuesday a private sector investment of up to $500 billion to build artificial intelligence infrastructure, aiming to outpace rival nations in the business-critical technology.\n\nTrump said the joint venture, called Stargate, will build data centers and create more than 100,000 jobs in the United States. ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, along with other equity backers of Stargate, have committed $100 billion for immediate deployment, with the remaining investment expected over the next four years.\n\nAnd CEOs Masayoshi Son of SoftBank and Sam Altman of OpenAI CEO along with Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison joined Trump at the White House for the launch.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/22"}]}

The United Kingdom is exempted.\n\nNeed a break?

Airlines await a complete list from the government.\n\nThe listed airports:\n\nAtlanta Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport\n\nDallas Fort Worth International Airport\n\nDetroit Metropolitan Airport\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport\n\nHonolulu's Daniel K. Inouye International Airport\n\nNew York JFK\n\nLos Angeles International Airport\n\nChicago O’Hare International Airport\n\nSeattle-Tacoma International Airport\n\nSan Francisco International Airport\n\nWashington-Dulles International Airport\n\nAmerican and other airlines said travelers who are not scheduled to fly through one of the airports will be rebooked on a flight that goes through one of them.\n\nOnce home, U.S. travelers will have to self-quarantine for 14 days, Pence said.\n\nWhen does the ban take effect?\n\nMidnight Friday.\n\nHow are airlines reacting?\n\nMajor U.S. airlines said they would implement the policies.\n\nDelta cited \"the safety and health of our customers and employees\" in saying it \"will continue to quickly make adjustments to service, as needed, in response to government travel directives.\" A United spokeswoman, Leslie Scott, said that as details of the plan become known, \"we will comply with the administration's announcement.\"\n\nOne airline noted that the plan remains fuzzy. In a tweet, Finland national carrier Finnair said it will let passengers know details as soon as it receives them, and it apologized \"about the uncertainty this is causing to our customers.\"\n\nWhat about trips already booked?\n\nDelta issued a travel waiver late Wednesday covering flights between the USA and Europe, raising the possibility that other carriers would follow suit. Delta said it will waive ticket change fees for passengers traveling to, from or through Europe and the U.K. through May 31. The waiver applies to travelers who purchased tickets before March 11.\n\nIs there another way to catch a flight from Europe to the USA?\n\nThe U.K. exemption opens a lot of possibilities for connecting flights to the continent. London Heathrow is one of the world's busiest connecting hubs.\n\nHow sudden is this?\n\nThe travel suspension announcement is sweeping, but Delta, American and United had already canceled flights to northern Italy because of earlier restrictions there.\n\nPlenty of travelers canceled spring flights to Europe out of anxiety, so Europe flights were hurting before Trumps’s ban. United said Tuesday that bookings to Europe were down 50%.\n\nIt doesn’t matter that Trump mentioned only flights from Europe to the USA, not flights in both directions, said Brett Snyder, a former airline employee who runs the Cranky Concierge travel service. Travelers will cancel flights en masse during the busy spring break travel season.\n\n“If they can’t come home, they’re not going to Europe,” he said.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nCoronavirus is spreading around the world. Italy has been hit hard, with more than 12,000 confirmed infections and more than 800 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. France, Spain and Germany each have about 2,000 confirmed cases.\n\nThe restrictions will \"deny entry to foreign nationals who have been in affected areas and will keep Americans safe and save American lives,\" Wolf said.\n\nWhere are there other travel restrictions?\n\nThe administration has already restricted travel from China and Iran.\n\nJetblue:Airline faces drop in demand due to coronavirus that's worse than 9/11, president says\n\nWhat will the travel ban do to the airline industry?\n\nIt is likely to make a bad situation worse in the name of public safety.\n\nThe travel and tourism industry has taken hit after hit since the coronavirus outbreak began in January. Though it's still early for concrete data, economists and industry executives fear 9/11- or recession-like repercussions.\n\nU.S. airlines began suspending and cutting international flights in late January and have repeatedly added reductions to destinations. The cuts are poised to spread to flights within the USA as travelers worry about the risks of flying anywhere, not just abroad.\n\nUnited Airlines said last week it will cut its domestic seat capacity by 10% in April and May, and JetBlue said it is making 5% cuts. Tuesday, American said it will reduce international seat capacity by 10% this summer, including a 55% reduction in flights across the Pacific. Flights within the USA will be reduced by 7.5% for April.\n\nAt the White House on Monday, Trump said he wanted to work with the airline and cruise industries to help them weather the coronavirus fallout.\n\n\"We'll be helping them through this patch,\" Trump said at a meeting with health insurance executives.\n\nWhat do the CDC and State Department say?\n\nAfter Trump's announcement late Wednesday, the U.S. State Department issued a global advisory urging Americans to \"reconsider\" all travel abroad. The CDC warned Americans to avoid nonessential travel to 29 European countries and principalities.\n\nNone of the guidance they issued late Wednesday explicitly tells U.S. citizens to not travel to Europe or abroad.

And then the changes might only be the addition of a COVID-19 test or other additional measures.\n\nTravel would only technically be banned for vacations and other leisure trips if the country changes its policy and doesn't allow any nonessential travel, even with a quarantine.\n\nThe European Union's governing body removed the United States from its list of safe countries based on COVID-19 case rates. The U.S. was added to the list in June, opening Europe travel this summer to vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers. Previously, travel was generally only open to vaccinated travelers under EU recommendations announced a month earlier, in May.\n\n►Europe reopening this summer: What American travelers need to know\n\nKeyes of Scott's Cheap Flights said unvaccinated travelers are likely to face the most changes under any new travel restrictions.\n\n\"I would imagine most countries will continue to allow in vaccinated Americans,'' he said, noting that many countries rushed to reopen to vaccinated visitors before the EU gave the green light. \"If you're unvaccinated you may not be able to travel to as many places in Europe next work or in two weeks as you are able to today.''\n\nTravelers flocked to popular European destinations this summer including Greece, Italy, and France.\n\nEven before the EU's policy change, some European countries and travel companies had already increased restrictions due to the Delta variant.\n\nEarlier this month, Germany reimposed restrictions on unvaccinated Americans. Those who are unvaccinated or unable to show proof of recovery will need to self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival. The quarantine period can end on the fifth day with proof of a negative coronavirus test.\n\nPreviously, unvaccinated travelers had to show a negative coronavirus test to enter Germany.\n\nGiven ever-shifting travel restrictions, Perillo Tours, which just restarted tours to Italy, changed its policy a few weeks ago to require all passengers to be vaccinated. Most already were, Perillo said, with just 3% of passengers having to cancel.\n\nCan vaccinated Americans travel to Europe?\n\nTravelers will have to keep tabs on the entry requirements in individual countries this week and into September.\n\nCheck the websites of the country's tourism board, U.S. embassies in the country, and airline and travel company websites for the latest restrictions if you don't have a travel agent.\n\n►Want to see the Eiffel Tower and other attractions in France: Bring vaccination proof\n\nCan Americans still visit England, other UK countries?\n\nThe United Kingdom left the EU in early 2020 so it has its own policies. In early August, England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales lifted quarantine restrictions for vaccinated Americans. Testing is still required to bypass a 10-day quarantine.\n\nWill airlines refund my tickets if I don't want to travel to Europe?\n\nProbably not, unless your airline ticket is refundable or the airline cancels your flight. Travelers who voluntarily cancel trips are likely to receive credit for a future flight, depending on the terms of their ticket.\n\nDuring the height of the pandemic last year, airlines issued a variety of travel waivers so keep an eye out for any that might make travel changes more flexible. The good news: Even without new pandemic waivers, most major airlines have permanently eliminated those pesky change fees on most tickets.\n\nWhat is essential travel to Europe?\n\nThe EU's list of essential travel allowed during the pandemic includes travel by health care professionals, students, certain workers and government officials, and others.\n\nWhat are the 27 EU countries?\n\nThere are 27 countries in the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyrpus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.\n\nContributing: Bailey Schulz, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/football/qatar-world-cup-2022-lgbtq-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "'It's not safe and it's not right.'

Sign up here.\n\nCNN —\n\n“I’m a man and I love men. I do – please don’t be shocked – have sex with other men. This is normal. So please get used to it, or stay out of football.”\n\nDario Minden was a relatively unknown German football fan before a video of a powerful speech he made was widely shared on social media in September.\n\nFor the majority of the 15-minute talk he spoke in his native German before switching to English, a change he deliberately made, he says, for impact. He wanted the world to hear.\n\nLooking directly at Qatar’s ambassador to Germany, Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Saud al-Thani, in a room full of dignitaries and sponsors at a human rights conference in Frankfurt, hosted by the German Football Association, he said his impactful words. Sitting in the front row, the camera pans briefly to al-Thani and shows him looking at and listening to Minden.\n\n“Football is for everyone,” Minden continued. “It doesn’t matter if you’re lesbian, if you’re gay, it’s for everyone. For the boys, for the girls and for everyone in between … The rule that football is for everyone is so important. We cannot allow you to break it no matter how rich you are. You are more than welcome to join the international football community and, also, of course, to host a big tournament. But in sports, it is how it is. You have to accept the rules.”\n\nWhen Minden finishes, a sprinkling of applause can be heard from some members of the audience.\n\nThat he loves men and has sex with men isn’t an issue in his homeland, but it is in Qatar, a country which from Sunday will be hosting the month-long World Cup, one of sport’s biggest and most lucrative events.\n\nVisitors gather at the FIFA World Cup countdown clock in Doha on October 30, 2022. Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, it is undoubtedly a historic event, but it is also one clouded by controversy, from the death of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured as the Gulf state prepared for the tournament, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nHomosexuality in Qatar is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison. A report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to “ill-treatment in detention.”\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Minden said he would not be going to Qatar and would not be watching the competition on television.\n\n“When we talk about the situation for the LGBTQ+ rights, we mean not only the football tourists, but also the situation before, and especially after, the World Cup,” he said.\n\nAfter the conference, Minden said he spoke privately with the ambassador who he said told him all were welcome to Qatar. But Minden told CNN: “It’s not safe and it’s not right.”\n\n‘Everyone is welcome to Qatar’\n\nA Qatar government official told CNN in a statement that the World Cup host was an inclusive country. “Everyone is welcome in Qatar,” the statement read, adding: “Our track record has shown that we have warmly welcomed all people regardless of background.”\n\nMeasures were being implemented to ensure discrimination of any kind did not happen, such as human rights training sessions with public and private security forces, and the enacting of legal provisions for the protection of everyone, according to FIFA.\n\nA statement sent to CNN on behalf of the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup, pointing to the fact that the country had, it said, hosted hundreds of international and regional sporting events since being awarded the World Cup in 2010.\n\n“There has never been an issue and every event has been delivered safely,” the statement read.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nBut there have been mixed messages with a World Cup ambassador and former footballer Khalid Salman saying earlier this month that homosexuality was “damage in the mind,” in an interview with German broadcaster ZDF.\n\nWhen asked by CNN for its advice to any members of the LGBTQ community traveling to Qatar, FIFA referred to a recent public statement made by Fatma Samoura, the the governing body’s secretary general, who said: “No matter your race, your religion, your social and sexual orientation, you are most welcome, and Qataris are ready to receive you with the best hospitality that you can imagine.”\n\n‘I don’t feel comfortable traveling to Qatar’\n\nBut for Englishman Rob Sanderson the respecting of cultures is a “two-way street.”\n\nSanderson is Special Projects Officer of Pride in Football, a network of UK LGBTQ fan groups and one of the supporter groups which joined forces in an open letter to condemn both FIFA and the Supreme Committee, refuting the world governing body and Qatar’s claims that it would be a World Cup for all.\n\nHe is a regular at England internationals and was once the victim of a homophobic assault, he says, at Wembley four years ago, ahead of England’s match against Spain in 2018, when he had an altercation with another fan. The incident was reported to the police and investigated, he says, but there was “insufficient evidence” to proceed, he says. But, largely, he has felt accepted at England matches, where he and his friends hold pride flags aloft celebrating their community and the team.\n\nHowever, he will not be going to Qatar and says if England were to win the tournament, it would be a tarnished trophy.\n\n“I don’t feel comfortable traveling out to Qatar and being in any way visible because if I’m visibly showing I’m an LGBT+ football fan, all I’m doing is drawing a target on the back of a local who is anything other than hostile towards me,” the 34-year-old told CNN.\n\n“I don’t feel comfortable being used as an excuse for any hostility that would be around after the tournament. It doesn’t sit right with me.”\n\nQatar isn’t the first controversial host of a big sporting event, or even a FIFA World Cup. The last edition was held in Russia, a country which introduced laws in 2013 which banned “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations.”\n\nIn the build-up to the 2018 tournament, the UK Foreign Office warned of a “heightened risks” to members of the LGBT community traveling to Russia.\n\nBut while some Pride in Football members went to Russia, Sanderson says, feeling that it was safe as Russian society had previously accepted, in the post-Soviet and pre-Putin era, same-sex relationships, none of its members are going to Qatar. “It’s a totally different environment,” he said.\n\n“They said ‘everyone’s welcome’ but they’ve signed that line off by saying ‘you must respect our culture’.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off on Sunday.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Samoura was sent out to the 32 participating nations but would not divulge the contents.\n\nA joint statement issued earlier this month by fan groups Pride in Football, The Rainbow Wall and Three Lions Pride said: “Let’s be clear, talking about human rights is neither ideological nor political. It is simply asking for decency and the ability for people to be able to watch their teams without fear of abuse.”\n\nA number of European federations also issued a statement saying they would continue to campaign at the tournament on human rights issues and compensation for migrant workers.\n\nUSA's team logo is displayed in a room used for briefings during a training session at the team's training camp in Doha ahead of Qatar 2022. Ozan Kose/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGareth Bale, once the world’s most expensive footballer and Wales captain, will wear a OneLove armband during matches in Qatar in support of a season-long campaign which promotes diversity and inclusion. Wales is one of eight participating European countries at the World Cup supporting the initiative.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before traveling to Qatar, the former Real Madrid player said: “We can shed a light on the problems that are going on.”\n\nHowever, Hugo Lloris, captain of France, another team participating in the OneLove campaign, said on Monday he had to “show respect” to Qatar’s culture when asked by reporters about wearing a rainbow-colored armband.\n\n“In France, when we welcome foreigners, we often want them to play by our rules and respect our culture – and I will do the same when I go to Qatar,” he said.\n\nEngland flew into Qatar on Tuesday on a plane called “Rain Bow” and the US Men’s National Team (USMNT) is displaying a rainbow logo at the team’s training facility in Doha. Talking to reporters, head coach Gregg Berhalter said: “We recognize that Qatar has made strides and there has been a ton of progress, but there’s some work still to do.”\n\nThe nearer we get to the kick-off of the opening match between Qatar and Ecuador on November 20, the louder the dissenting voices are becoming and the more visible the signs of support for LGBTQ issues.\n\nThe World Cup, like the Olympics, puts the host country under a global spotlight. Usually, most controversies are forgotten once the sport starts, but such has been the intensity of focus on Qatar’s human rights record that it would be astonishing if all were forgotten by kickoff on Sunday.

The coworker then worked five shifts from May 16 to 20 while experiencing very mild symptoms.\n\nAll of the two stylists’ clients wore masks and will be tested. The owner of the Great Clips said in a statement that the salon will be closed until it goes through sanitizing and deep cleaning.\n\nThe two cases come just days after city officials announced plans to relax even more distancing requirements and about a week after the health department started seeing an influx of new travel-related infections.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nTrump administration exempts foreign athletes from entry ban\n\nActing Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf signed an order Friday that exempts certain foreign professional athletes from the ban on entry into the U.S.\n\n\"Professional sporting events provide much needed economic benefits, but equally important, they provide community pride and national unity,\" Wolf said in a press release. \"In today’s environment, Americans need their sports.

Ron DeSantis seeks to make a data-driven case for a step-by-step reopening of the state’s battered economy following safer-at-home orders.

But \"El Paso Strong\" hasn't been embraced by the public in the context of the virus, which is challenging community ties in a region that normally transcends borders.\n\nThe region’s top elected official, County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, initially supported tapping \"El Paso Strong\" to rally residents' support for social distancing with the same zeal as they helped each other after the Aug. 3 shooting.\n\nIn some ways, life during the pandemic is not unlike the first few weeks after the shooting, when many residents were afraid to go out.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nObesity increases risk of COVID-19 severity, studies show\n\nThe chronic conditions that increase the risk of serious illness and death of COVID-19 are by now well known: diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and being older than 65. Obesity is less well known or understood, but a growing number of studies and data on COVID-19 deaths confirm the link.\n\nThe extra weight on people in the 40-plus BMI range who contract COVID-19 increases the chance they will require hospitalization, most likely in the intensive care unit. It also hampers the ability of physicians to treat them, especially with ventilators, doctors say.

The bureau did not elaborate on the reason for the move. Myers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nEarly in the COVID-19 crisis, Oakdale had become the epicenter of the outbreak in the vast federal prison system.

But if the NBA restarts, the Disney complex makes sense for a variety of reasons, starting with the NBA’s relationship with Disney, which owns ABC and ESPN, two of the league’s main TV partners.\n\n– Jeff Zillgitt\n\nDOJ to LA, Illinois: Lockdown orders may be illegal if too restrictive\n\nThe Justice Department is warning state and local officials that stay-at-home orders aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus may be illegal if they become too strict.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband said in a letter Friday to Los Angeles officials that their recent comments suggesting that stay-at-home orders may be extended \"may be both arbitrary and unlawful.\" The Justice Department also said Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker's \"sweeping limitations\" on his state's residents raise constitutional concerns.\n\nNew York permits recreational gatherings of up to 10 people\n\nIn time for Memorial Day weekend, New York will allow all gatherings of up to 10 people with proper social distancing and mask-wearing.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order easing the ban on nonessential gatherings of any size, which took effect March 23 as the coronavirus rapidly spread through New York. His move followed a lawsuit from the New York Civil Liberties Union challenging a prior order that allowed gatherings only for religious services.\n\nThe decision will enable New Yorkers to spend time together in parks, backyards and beaches over the holiday weekend as long as they maintain distance and adhere to the state Department of Health's cleaning and disinfecting protocols.

He then appeared to stumble over his words in a way that suggested those restrictions would also apply to cargo.\n\n“And these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other things as we get approval,” Trump told Americans. “Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.”\n\nBut while the Trump administration has sought to limit European imports as part of his trade policy, cargo has never been on the table as a way to control the spread of coronavirus. Cargo from China continued, for instance, even as it became clear that the country was at the epicenter of the virus.\n\nThe White House quickly noted that the restrictions were focused on people, not boxes, and Trump later appeared to clarify his remarks in a tweet.\n\n“The restriction stops people not goods,” Trump posted.\n\n–John Fritze, David Jackson and Courtney Subramanian\n\nPelosi and Schumer urge Republicans to pass Democratic virus response bill\n\nIn a statement released following President Donald Trump's speech, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Republicans to pass Democrats' legislation to blunt the economic effects of the virus and bolster the response to the virus.\n\nThe two Democratic leaders said the best response to the virus was \"for the president to focus on fighting the spread of the coronavirus itself,\" noting that Trump did not mention anything during his speech about the lack of coronavirus testing kits.\n\nThey asked Republicans to help pass Democrats' package to combat the virus, which would provide free coronavirus testing, paid emergency leave, food security, among other Democratic priorities. Democrats have said they saw a payroll tax cut like Trump had floated as a non-starter.\n\n-Nicholas Wu\n\nDHS to require U.S. passengers to undergo 'enhanced screening'\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration's said it was readying \"enhanced screening\" procedures for U.S. passengers returning from parts of Europe hard hit by the coronavirus.\n\nThe White House said the restrictions would closely match those imposed on people returning from China earlier this year.\n\nIn explaining the new restrictions, Trump said that the U.S. would be suspending travel from parts of Europe for 30 days. He said there would be exemptions for Americans who had \"undergone appropriate screenings. \"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security issued a statement shortly after Trump's address, offering further clarity on the European travel restrictions the president discussed.\n\nActing DHS Secretary Chad Wolf said that the restrictions would \"deny entry to foreign nationals who have been in affected areas will keep Americans safe and save American lives.\"\n\nWolf said that DHS would issue a notice in the next 48 hours \"requiring U.S. passengers that have been\" traveling in parts of Europe to \"travel through select airports where the U.S. Government has implemented enhanced screening procedures.\"\n\n–John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nThe 26 European countries hit with the travel ban\n\nMore than two dozen European countries are affected by the travel restrictions announced by President Donald Trump, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe countries, known as the Schengen Area, include: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe president’s proclamation suspends the entry of most foreign nationals who have been in these European countries at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States.\n\nThe order does not apply to legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation, according to the agency.\n\n–Ledge King\n\nMinutes after speech, Donald Trump cancels Las Vegas trip\n\nAfter President Donald Trump urged Americans to forgo unnecessary travel, the White House and the re-election campaign are canceling future events.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution from the Coronavirus outbreak, the President has decided to cancel his upcoming events in Colorado and Nevada,\" White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said.\n\nTrump had planned to address a Jewish Republican organization meeting in Las Vegas and to host a conservation roundtable in Denver.\n\n–David Jackson\n\nTrump asks for payroll tax relief despite GOP hesitance\n\nDuring his Wednesday night speech, Trump asked that Congress consider payroll tax cuts – a request that lawmakers in both parties have voiced concern about.\n\n\"I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief,\" Trump said. \"Hopefully, they will consider this very strongly. We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus.\"\n\nThe idea has been met with skepticism in recent days from even Republicans, who call the idea both premature and something that would not help in this situation.\n\n\"I would prefer they exercise other options before going down that path,\" Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, has said. Democrats have said the idea is something that would have no chance in passing the Democratic-held House.\n\n\"It's a non-starter,\" Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said earlier Wednesday of the payroll tax cut idea.\n\n–Christal Hayes\n\nTrump's speech faces a partisan response on the Hill\n\nDemocrats and an independent slammed Trump's speech after he concluded, while Republicans offered praise.\n\nRep. Andy Levin, D-Mich., whose state confirmed its first two cases of the coronavirus yesterday, tweeted, \"Mr. President, you can’t travel ban your way out of this.\" Rep. Justin Amash, I-Mich. who left the Republican Party last year, called it \"disturbing in so many ways\" on Twitter.\n\nRep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., praised Trump for taking \"bold and decisive action to prevent the spread of #coronavirus.\" Close Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, hailed \"proactive and decisive\" action by Trump to combat the virus.\n\nFormer Ambassador to the United Nations under President Barack Obama, Susan Rice, simply tweeted: “OMG.”\n\nCongressman Don Beyer, D-VA., who has self-quarantined after dining with someone who tested positive for the virus, tweeted, “We have a pandemic with over a thousand coronavirus cases in the United States and counting. We don't need walls and travel bans, we need TESTS.”\n\nElise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who has become a staunch Trump supporter on Capitol Hill, said, “Tonight’s Oval Office Address by @realDonaldTrump was a strong and clear message to all Americans to encourage unity and swift action as we confront and ultimately beat Coronavirus.”\n\nThe First Lady, Melania Trump, made a public comment on coronavirus after her husband’s address, saying, “Our great country is fighting hard against the #Coronavirus. This nation is strong & ready & we will overcome. Please take action to prevent further spread. Visit http://cdc.gov for updated health info & updates.”\n\n–Nicholas Wu, Savannah Behrmann\n\nTrump stops short of declaring a national emergency\n\nPresident Donald Trump ran through several ideas he said could help slow the spread of the virus and right an economy flailing amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nOne idea he did not raise: Declaring a national emergency.\n\nIn the hours heading into the address, there was widespread speculation that Trump could rely on the Stafford Act to declare an emergency. Democrats demanded that action earlier Wednesday, saying it would free up more than $40 billion in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds for the nation’s response.\n\nThroughout the address, Trump used the word “emergency” and said his administration would take urgent action, including on taxes, but he stopped short of the promising to execute the broader emergency declaration.\n\n–John Fritze\n\nExtending the tax filing deadline\n\nSome taxpayers won’t have to file their taxes by April 15 as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to lessen the economic effects of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday.\n\nHe also called on Congress to provide Americans with “immediate payroll tax relief.”\n\n“Hopefully, they will consider this very strongly,” he said.\n\nTrump didn’t specify who would get a filing extension and for how long.\n\nBut Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday the extension is intended to help \"small and medium-sized businesses and hard-working individuals\" heavily impacted by the widespread virus.\n\nMnuchin said an extension could put billions of dollars into the economy by giving businesses and individuals more available cash.\n\n“This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy,” Trump said.\n\nBut the move may mean the government will have to increase borrowing in the short-term to pay its bills before all returns are filed.\n\nThe extension does not require congressional approval, according to the administration.\n\nHouse Democrats have already told the IRS they’re concerned that people may need more time to file because IRS officials and tax preparers may not be as available to assist.\n\nIndividuals are typically required to pay taxes by April 15 or they face penalties and interest charges. The IRS also grants taxpayers the option to file for a six-month extension.\n\n–Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump wraps up\n\nTrump wrapped up his remarks at 9:11 p.m. EDT, about 10 minutes after he began.\n\n“The virus will not have a chance against us,” he said.\n\nThe president’s remarks largely focused on actions he had taken so far and was less specific on what he plans to do moving forward.\n\nTrump said he would take “emergency” action to extend the April 15 tax deadline, though he did not say specifically how long that extension would last. He reiterated his desire for a payroll tax holiday, despite the frosty reception that idea received on Capitol Hill from members of both parties Wednesday.\n\n–John Fritze\n\nTrump vows emergency action on paid family sick leave\n\nTrump encouraged those who are not feeling well to stay home, saying he wants to \"ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship.\"\n\nHe said he would be soon taking emergency action to provide financial relief for workers who are quarantined or caring for others due to coronavirus. He added he would be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend the relief. The president did not indicate whether it would have an expiration, include a mandate or require government funding.\n\nAdvocates for paid leave say it's critical to help contain the spread of the virus as well as providing a safety net for low-income workers who are forced to stay home sick or self-quarantine.\n\nPaid family sick leave is a key priority among Democrats and is expected to top their list amid negotiations over an economic stimulus package. Senate Democrats proposed emergency unemployment insurance to replace lost wages from quarantine or the need to stay home with children whose schools close. They also proposed requiring employers to allow workers to accumulate seven days of paid sick leave, allowing them to stay home to prevent the spread of disease, and also 14 days of paid sick leave at the beginning of any public health emergency.\n\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the labor committee, proposed that the Senate immediately consider legislation for paid sick leave. But she was blocked by a Republican objection.\n\nMurray said employees such as restaurant workers, truck drivers and service industry workers shouldn’t face the choice of working while sick or losing their pay.\n\n“This is not a choice we should be asking anyone to make in the United States of American in the 21st Century, but 32 million people in our country today – or about one out of every four private-sector workers – are faced with this impossible choice every time they get sick,” Murray said.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., who chairs the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, objected to fast-tracking the legislation. He acknowledged workers are struggling but said businesses are also struggling and that an expensive federal mandate wouldn’t help them.\n\n“The idea of paid sick leave is a good idea,” Alexander said. “But if Washington, D.C., thinks it’s a good idea, Washington, D.C., should pay for it.”\n\n– Courtney Subramanian, Christal Hayes, Nicholas Wu and Bart Jansen\n\nPresident Trump restricts 'all travel' from EU to US starting Friday\n\nTrump said the administration would restrict “all travel” to the U.S. from Europe, which is reeling from the epidemic, for the next 30 days. The United Kingdom will be exempt from the new limits, which Trump said will go into effect on Friday at midnight.\n\n“These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground,” the president said of the European Union travel curbs.\n\nItaly has been hit the hardest, with more than 12,000 confirmed infections and more than 800 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. France, Spain and Germany each have about 2,000 confirmed cases.\n\nTrump said there would also be travel restrictions from Europe for Americans \"who have undergone appropriate screenings.\"\n\nThe administration has already restricted travel from China and Iran. Trump has repeatedly trumpeted his early move to limit travel from China, saying the decision saved lives. Experts say it likely slowed the arrival of the virus in the United States.\n\n–Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nTrump tries to project sense of calm\n\nPresident Donald Trump started off his remarks by trying to give a sense of historical perspective, and a sense of calm.\n\n“From the beginning of time, nations and people have face unforeseen challenges,” Trump said. “It only matters how you respond and we are responding with great speed and professionalism.”\n\n“We are moving very quickly,” Trump added.\n\nThe president’s remarks on his response come as he himself has been under fire for repeatedly appearing to contradict public health officials in his own administration.\n\n“Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow,” he said.\n\n–John Fritze\n\nTrump’s address on coronavirus is underway\n\nPresident Donald Trump has started his address to the nation from the Oval Office on the coronavirus outbreak at 9:01 p.m. EDT, just about on schedule.\n\n\"Tonight I want to speak with you about our nation's unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak,\" Trump said, noting the pandemic designation from the World Health Organization earlier in the day.\n\nIt’s a critical speech for Trump’s presidency by any measure. Look for him to address the public health aspects of the pandemic, his administration’s response and the potential economic impact – all while he attempts to calm a jittery nation and leave a door open to working with Democrats on an economic stimulus.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nPence calls Pelosi before Trump speech\n\nVice President Mike Pence and another member of the administration’s coronavirus task force called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about an hour before President Donald Trump was scheduled to speak to the nation.\n\nPence and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, spoke with Pelosi briefly about the emergency legislation the House has proposed to combat the coronavirus, Pelosi’s spokesman tweeted.\n\nTrump's address will come hours after the World Health Organization formally declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic as the global death toll rose above 4,300.\n\nAs Congress and the Trump administration negotiate an economic package to cope with the coronavirus, disagreements are emerging over whether to focus on tax relief or provide direct aid to people who lose income from illness or an economic downturn.\n\nCongressional Democrats proposed free testing for the virus and enhanced paid sick leave, unemployment insurance and food assistance.\n\n–Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump's second formal address from the Oval Office\n\nWhen President Donald Trump makes his prime-time address tonight amid a widening coronavirus that is now a pandemic, it will mark only his second formal Oval Office speech to the nation.\n\nTrump's address will come hours after the World Health Organization formally declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic as the global death toll rose above 4,300. Confirmed cases in the U.S. crept past 1,000, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nAmid a budget fight last year that led to a five-week partial government shutdown, Trump used a January address to pressure Democrats to agree to his request for $5.7 billion for his long-promised border wall along the southern border as a condition to end the stand-off.\n\nDuring that speech, he stopped short of declaring a national emergency but declared one a month later to redirect funds from other federal agencies to the Department of Homeland Security to go toward building about 80 miles of barriers in California, Arizona and New Mexico. The decision led to a legal battle that went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in July that he could use the military funding to build a portion of his wall.\n\nMore:Trump demands border wall in speech; Democrats accuse him of sowing fear\n\nEarlier this year Trump addressed the nation from the Grand Foyer of the White House hours after Iran rained more than a dozen rockets down on U.S. airbases in Iraq housing U.S. troops. He sought to calm fears of a potential war with Iran after escalations over the U.S. killing of Qasem Soleimani, one of Tehran's most powerful leaders.\n\nTrump is expected to again try to quell fears as the rapid spread of coronavirus sparks panic across the country and rattles the stock markets.\n\n– Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump's address timing explained\n\nPresident Donald Trump chose a critical day to deliver his rare address to the nation, a potential inflection point both for the coronavirus and the nation's response to it.\n\nAnd there's an enormous amount at stake for the president.\n\nTrump's remarks come hours after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic. It's a loosely defined word, but to be labeled a pandemic a virus must have \"sustained transmission throughout the world,\" Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told USA TODAY last month.\n\nMore:Coronavirus has been declared a pandemic: What does that mean\n\nThe president's speech comes as the global death toll rose above 4,600 on Wednesday and confirmed cases in the U.S. crept past 1,200, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nHis remarks also arrive at an exceptional moment in U.S. politics, as Trump seeks to get a grip on the virus and its economic ramifications in an election year. Top White House aides are negotiating with House Democrats over an economic stimulus that Trump has described as \"dramatic.\" Details of that proposal, so far, have been very much influx.\n\nThe virus – and Trump's sometimes wobbly response to it – is also increasingly factoring into the 2020 presidential race. Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have cancelled large rallies because of the virus, and are raising it as an issue to question Trump's leadership. A Trump campaign aide, meanwhile, claimed Wednesday that Biden was canceling events as \"an excuse to get off the campaign trail.\"\n\nMore:Trump aide says Biden using coronavirus 'to get off the campaign trail'\n\n– John Fritze\n\nTrump announces rare public address to the nation for coronavirus\n\nPresident Donald Trump will make a prime-time address from the Oval Office on Wednesday about coronavirus amid widening concerns over an outbreak that is now a pandemic.\n\nTrump's address will come hours after the World Health Organization formally declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic as the global death toll rose above 4,300. Confirmed cases in the U.S. crept past 1,000, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\n\"I’ll be making a statement later tonight,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump initially said that his remarks would \"probably\" take place 8 p.m. EDT. He later tweeted that he would be \"addressing the Nation this evening\" at 9 p.m. EDT.\n\nTrump declined to say whether he would announce additional travel restrictions or a national emergency. He said there would be economic and health announcements during his statement.\n\nThe president last delivered an Oval Office address to the nation on Jan. 8, 2019 amid the government shutdown. He used the address to make his case for additional federal funding for border security, including his long-proposed wall.\n\nThe Trump administration is scrambling to respond to the public health and economic fallout from the virus. Trump and Democrats are negotiating over what the president described as a \"dramatic\" stimulus. As part of that, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the administration is considering delaying the annual April 15 tax day.\n\n– John Fritze, David Jackson and Courtney Subramanian", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/01/covid-19-pandemic-timeline-key-moments/77240518007/", "title": "Five years ago: Key moments from the first months of COVID-19", "text": "In the time warp that COVID-19 created in most of our lives, it's hard to believe it's been five years since any of us first heard of a mysterious illness making people sick in China.\n\nBut it was Dec. 31, 2019 that the World Health Organization in China was first notified of a cluster of cases of a pneumonia-like illness in a city of 11 million people called Wuhan.

A growing number of smaller districts around the country have also chosen to close.\n\nAccording to a count updated mid-afternoon Friday by Education Week magazine, about a quarter of American schoolchildren had been or were scheduled to be affected by a school closures – and that was before some states announced their actions.\n\nThe magazine said at least 46,000 schools were closed, are scheduled to close, or were closed and later reopened, affecting at least 21 million students.\n\nCustoms intercepts fake virus tests\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection is advising Americans to be aware of “bogus home testing kits for sale either online or in informal direct to consumer settings” after officers at Los Angeles International Airport intercepted a package containing suspected counterfeit COVID-19 test kits arriving from the United Kingdom, the agency said Saturday.\n\nThe officers discovered six plastic bags containing various vials while conducting an enforcement examination Thursday. The vials were filled with a white liquid and labeled “Corona Virus 2019nconv (COVID-19)” and “Virus1 Test Kit,” the agency said. The agency turned the shipment over to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for analysis.\n\n– Grace Hauck\n\nTrump adds UK, Ireland to travel restrictions\n\nTrump on Saturday said the United Kingdom and Ireland will be added to the Europe travel restrictions that went into effect late Friday. This means residents of those countries will not be allowed to travel to the United States for 30 days beginning Monday.\n\nU.S. residents and legal permanent residents won't be banned but they will face airport screenings upon their return and will be asked to self quarantine for 14 days.\n\nIn response to the broadened ban and the resulting falloff in travel demand, airlines are likely to sharply cut flights between the U.S. and London and Ireland. Delta Air Lines and American Airlines suspended all flights between the U.S. and the 26 European countries covered by the initial ban.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump said he is considering domestic travel restrictions \"specifically from certain areas\" after the Pentagon restricted service members' domestic travel. \"If you don't have to travel I wouldn't do it ... we want this thing to end.\" Read more here.\n\n– Dawn Glibertson\n\nCensus deadline could change\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Saturday the deadline to respond to the 2020 Census is still the end of July, but that could change if the coronavirus crisis impacts the national operation.\n\nCivil rights groups and community activists had called for the Census Bureau to consider extending the July 31 deadline as concerns increase about the impact of the outbreak on the decennial count.\n\nRoss said the agency has a $2 billion contingency budget and will adapt its plans to deal with the coronavirus crisis, including deadlines. Households have until July 31 to respond to the population survey.\n\nCivil rights groups said they’re worried about the safety of census takers and are concerned communities that have long been under counted may not respond.\n\nCensus officials have been scrambling to meet deadlines, including recruiting and hiring thousands of workers who will knock on the doors of people who don’t respond to the survey. The deadlines are critical as the Census is required to provide information to Congress. That information is used to distribute billions in federal funds and determine the number of members of Congress for each state.\n\n— Deborah Berry\n\nNCAA had, spent rainy-day fund\n\nThe cancellation of the NCAA’s Division I men’s and women’s basketball tournaments is likely to wreak financial havoc on colleges and universities that depend on the millions of dollars in revenue the games bring in.\n\nIt turns out the NCAA did have the foresight to begin planning for an unknown catastrophic event that would threaten its biggest and most lucrative event.\n\nBy 2014, the association had accumulated a nearly $400 million cushion as a hedge against a massive loss of revenue from the tournament.\n\nThen, at the direction of its governing board of college presidents, the NCAA distributed that money to schools to help them with increasing costs and spent it on their behalf in other ways, including a $208.7 million legal settlement.\n\n“The NCAA will be fine,” said Barbara Osborne, a sports administration professor at the University of North Carolina. “But all schools will be having huge belt tightening because of this.” Read more here.\n\n– Steve Berkowitz\n\nMnuchin says more bills coming on cruise, hotel, airline assistance\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin praised the legislation passed by the House early Saturday morning and said the next round of legislation would address the cruise, hotel and airline industries.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday in a letter to lawmakers the House would start work on a third legislative package to \"protect the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.\"\n\nThe House passed a bill early in the morning to provide paid sick leave and free coronavirus testing, and Mnuchin told reporters the bill \"delivers on what the president announced in his speech the other night.\"\n\n\"People who need to be quarantined, we want them at home and we don't want them to fear not getting paid,\" he continued.\n\nMnuchin said there was language agreed to with Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy that did not make it into the final bill, \"so there will be a technical correction Monday morning.\"\n\n- Nicholas Wu and Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump: Federal Reserve should be ‘more proactive’\n\nTrump again slammed the Federal Reserve on Saturday, saying the central bank hasn’t done enough to calm financial markets amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt an unusual Saturday news conference, Trump offered praise to Congress, the American people and even the press for their response to the coronavirus scare. But the Fed – one of his favorite targets – got only presidential scorn.\n\n“I thought the Fed would be and should be much more proactive,” Trump said. “Our Fed is following.”\n\nTrump is frequently critical of the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he appointed to the chairmanship in 2017. Trump claims that interest rate hikes have slowed economic growth.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates two weeks ago in a rare emergency move in response to the threat the coronavirus posed to the economy and financial markets. But Trump thinks it should be doing more.\n\n“Our Fed is not doing what they should be doing,” he said, arguing the U.S. shouldn’t have a rate higher than competitor nations such as Germany and Japan.\n\nAsked whether he intends to fire Powell, Trump said he has the authority to do so, “but I’m not doing it.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nFrance closes all schools, restaurants, Eiffel tower; Spain locks down 46M citizens, Israel bans gatherings\n\nFrance and Spain followed Italy's lead with tough new measures, leaving the Eiffel Tower and Louvre shuttered and 46 million Spanish citizens in a lockdown.\n\nItaly also invoked sharp new measures, including closing playgrounds and parks.\n\nFrance's orders closed cafes, restaurant and cinemas.

It is intended to cut red tape that otherwise might hold up emergency relief, officials said.\n\nIt will apply to drivers hauling critical medical supplies like masks, hand sanitizer, soap and disinfectants needed by health care workers. Also mentioned are sanitation supplies for communities. Included, too, is food for emergency restocking of stores, workers and supplies for temporary housing or quarantine facilities related to COVID-19 and transportation of medical or other emergency-service personnel.\n\n\"This declaration will help America’s commercial drivers get these critical goods to impacted areas faster and more efficiently,\" said Jim Mullen, acting administrator of the department's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.\n\nThe order requires truckers be allowed to rest for a minimum of 10 consecutive hours if they say they need time off before returning to work at the terminal or their normal reporting location. Normally, truckers are subject to elaborate rules that limit them to 11 hours of driving a day during a 14-hour period after 10 hours of rest.\n\nThe administration's order includes stipulations to prevent abuse. It won't apply to commercial deliveries, for instance, or to mixed loads – items both considered part of the emergency relief shipped along with general cargo.\n\n- Chris Woodyard\n\nAhead of Pence briefing, White House checks temperatures for those around Trump, Pence\n\nAhead of a press briefing Saturday with Vice President Mike Pence, a member of the White House Physicians Office took the temperature of reporters and television crews.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and Vice President,\" said White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere.\n\nOne symptom of the coronavirus, which has been named COVID-19, is a fever.\n\nOne reporter whose temperature was too high was escorted out by staff.

Democrats and advocates have criticized the Trump administration for not doing enough to address the crisis.\n\n“I’m extremely concerned that our lack of preparedness ... would result in a Katrina-like response where there was vast inequities between who receive services and who did not receive services and that line was drawn based on race, primarily, and class,’’ Derrick Johnson, president of the national NAACP, told USA TODAY.\n\nFormer President George W.

Each region is mostly autonomous, with its own police force and militia. Regional governments are largely divided along entrenched ethnic lines. Long-standing tensions between regions have led to ethno-nationalist clashes there.\n\nThe TPLF, which ruled the country for more than three decades before Abiy came to power in 2018, has been designated a terrorist group by the current government.\n\nAfter becoming prime minister, Abiy worked to dismantle the power of the TPLF. He announced the rearrangement of the ruling coalition that TPLF founded – the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Front (EPRDF), comprised of four parties – into a single, new Prosperity Party (PP), ostracizing the TPLF in the process.\n\nAbiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for helping to end Ethiopia’s 20-year war with neighboring Eritrea.\n\nEritrean forces have since joined in the military campaign in Tigray on the side of the Ethiopian government.\n\nAll actors in the conflict have been accused of carrying out atrocities, but Eritrean forces have been linked to some of the most gruesome. In addition to perpetrating mass killings and rape, Eritrean soldiers have also been found blocking and looting food relief in multiple parts of Tigray. Eritrea’s government has denied any involvement in atrocities.\n\nTimeline\n\nNovember 4, 2020 - After accusing the TPLF of attacking a federal army base outside Tigray’s regional capital Mekelle, Abiy orders a military offensive against TPLF in the northern Tigray region and promises that the conflict will be resolved quickly.\n\nNovember 9, 2020 - According to Amnesty International, more than 600 civilians are killed in Tigray amid fighting between the local and federal governments.

Doing so will place the United States firmly on the Sunni side of the Middle East conflict and in opposition to the growing Shiite military axis of Iran-Syria-Hezbollah, experts say.\n\nThe Muslim divide is apparent in Lebanon, where Palestinian refugees in the tens of thousands live in a country controlled by Shiite Hezbollah, an anti-American terrorist group with thousands of fighters that has fought two wars with Israel.\n\nThere have been skirmishes and threats between the Palestinians and Hezbollah but no major combat. Should that change, the United States may find itself in the middle of a major war.\n\n\"Both sides know how fragile the situation is, and all parties are aware and concerned that the situation could violently explode in an instant,\" says Avi Melamed, a former Israeli senior official on Arab Affairs.\n\n\"Should a broad Sunni-Shiite collision break out in Lebanon, the major Palestinian organizations will not be able to continue to sit on the fence for very long,\" he says. \"At some point — even if against their will — they will have to take a side — and they're not likely to choose Hezbollah.\"\n\nLebanese Sunnis have experienced a growing feeling of marginalization. It started with the assassination of Sunni Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005, in which four members of Shiite group Hezbollah have been indicted.\n\nMany Sunnis blame Hezbollah for the more recent assassinations of major Sunni figures Wissam Eid, a police investigator, and Internal Security Forces Gen.

Melamed and others said Palestinian factions may have been involved. Angry Palestinian refugees in the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp in a formal protest burned the food, commodities and aid packages Hezbollah had distributed to them.\n\nIn the past few weeks, 40 people were killed in clashes in Tripoli in which Sunnis fought Alawites, members of a Shiite offshoot aligned with the Syrian regime. Assad is an Alawite.\n\nFurther south in the city of Sidon, Sunnis clashed with Shiites participating in a funeral procession, preventing them from burying a Hezbollah militant killed while fighting in Syria. Two Sunni sheiks with ties to Hezbollah were shot at in Sidon and in the Beqaa Valley by unknown assailants.\n\nThe disenchantment of Sunnis in Lebanon has led to the radicalization of some members of the community, particularly in areas where Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods border each other, such as Tripoli, the Beqaa Valley, Sidon and certain neighborhoods of Beirut.\n\n\"About 80 Tripoli Sunnis have gone to fight with the rebels in Qussayr in recent weeks,\" said Salafist Sheik Abu Ahmad.\n\nThey were responding to the call for jihad in Syria by Sheik Salem Rafei two months ago, he said. The son of Dai Islam al-Chahhal, the highest Salafist authority in Lebanon, also fought in Qussayr alongside the rebels.\n\nIn Palestinian enclaves around Lebanon, six new radical groups have beefed up their operations. Composed of former members of radical organizations such as Jund al-Sham, Fateh al-Islam and Osbat al-Ansar, they have been accused of coordinating with the Syrian Islamist rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra, which the US government has labeled a terror organization.\n\n\"There are strong indications that these groups are coordinating with radical movements in [the Palestinian refugee camp] Shatila, Sidon and Tripoli,\" Abu Ahmad said.\n\nAs the war in Syria rages on, Melamed warns of the dangers of increasing tensions between Lebanese Sunnis who are against the regime and Shiites who are with it.\n\n\"Tensions are rising by the minute in Lebanon. While the scope of Salafist jihadists is still limited and does not allow them to seriously challenge Hezbollah, there is an accumulation of reports of possible involvement of Jabhat al-Nusra in Lebanon that are extremely worrisome.

A year later, he launched a conflict that spiraled into a brutal civil war, spawning one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.\n\nIn November 2020, Abiy ordered a military offensive in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region and promised that the clash would be resolved quickly. Two years on, the fighting has left thousands dead, displaced more than 2 million people and given rise to a wave of atrocities, including massacres, sexual violence and the use of starvation as a weapon of war.\n\nEthiopia was struggling with significant economic, ethnic and political challenges long before a feud between Abiy and the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), bubbled over into unrest and threatened to pull Africa’s second-most populous country apart.\n\nNow, after years of grinding conflict, the Ethiopian government and the leadership of the TPLF have agreed to cease hostilities and pull the country back from the brink. But the surprise truce leaves many questions unanswered, with few details on how it will be implemented and monitored.\n\nHere’s a closer look at what’s happening in Ethiopia.\n\nHow did the conflict start?\n\nAn Ethiopian refugee prays at an Orthodox church near a refugee camp in Gedaref, eastern Sudan, on December 6, 2020. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Tigray conflict has its roots in tensions that go back generations in Ethiopia.\n\nThe country is made up of 10 regions – and two cities – that have a substantial amount of autonomy, including regional police and militia. Because of a previous conflict with neighboring Eritrea, there are also a large number of federal troops in Tigray. Regional governments are largely divided along entrenched ethnic lines.\n\nBefore Abiy Ahmed came to power, the TPLF had governed Ethiopia with an iron grip for decades, overseeing a period of stability and economic growth at the cost of basic civil and political rights. The party’s authoritarian rule provoked a popular uprising that ultimately forced Abiy’s predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn, to resign.\n\nIn 2018, Abiy was appointed by the ruling class to quell tensions and bring change, without upending the old political order. But almost as soon as he became prime minister, Abiy announced the rearrangement of the ruling coalition that the TPLF had founded – the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Front, or EPRDF, which was composed of four parties – into a single, new Prosperity Party, ostracizing the TPLF in the process.\n\nIn his drive for a new pan-Ethiopian political party, Abiy sparked fears in some regions that the country’s federal system – which guarantees significant autonomy to ethnically-defined states such as Tigray – was under threat. Leaders in Tigray withdrew to their mountainous heartland in the north, where they continued to control their own regional government.\n\nTensions boiled over in September 2020, when the Tigrayans defied Abiy by going ahead with regional parliamentary elections that he had delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Abiy called the vote illegal and lawmakers cut funding to the TPLF leadership, setting off a tit-for-tat series of escalations between the regional and the federal government.\n\nOn November 4, 2020, after accusing the TPLF of attacking a federal army base outside Tigray’s regional capital Mekelle and attempting to steal its weapons, Abiy ordered a military assault against the group, sending in national troops and fighters from the neighboring region of Amhara, along with soldiers from Eritrea. Getachew Reda, a senior TPLF leader, said in an op-ed in Foreign Policy that the group attacked the base in an “act of self-defense.” CNN cannot confirm the claims of either side.\n\nAbiy declared the offensive a success after just three weeks, but the conflict dragged on for two years, with both sides trading control over the regional capital Mekelle, gaining and losing ground.\n\nAn earlier humanitarian ceasefire broke down in August and fighting has intensified in the months since. The clashes, combined with a lack of fuel and the communications blackout, has severely curtailed aid distribution to the region.\n\nOn October 17, amid reports of heavy bombing in Shire and other Tigrayan cities, and food supplies running out in the regional capital Mekelle triggering fears of famine, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that the situation in the Tigray region was “spiraling out of control,” and that the violence had “reached alarming levels.”\n\nThe UN chief called for an “immediate withdrawal and disengagement of Eritrean armed forces from Ethiopia,” and the urgent resumption of talks, which had been due to take place in September.\n\nA damaged tank on a road north of Mekelle, the capital of Tigray, on February 26 EDUARDO SOTERAS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhat does the peace agreement actually mean?\n\nAfter just over a week of formal peace talks mediated by the African Union (AU) in South Africa’s administrative capital Pretoria, delegates from both sides of Ethiopia’s war agreed to a “permanent cessation of hostilities.” The surprise truce was signed by Getachew Reda from the TPLF and Redwan Hussein, national security adviser to Ethiopia’s federal government, on the eve of the second anniversary of the start of the war, on November 3.\n\nThe document laid out a number of key objectives, including the disarmament of fighters, unhindered humanitarian access to Tigray, repairing essential services in the region, providing a framework for accountability and justice, and restoring some semblance of stability in the country.\n\n“We have agreed to permanently silence the guns and end the two years of conflict in northern Ethiopia,” both sides said in a joint statement, published after delegates shook hands.\n\nThose involved in mediating the deal signaled that it was just the first in a long series of steps toward negotiating a more enduring peace. Mediators have also warned that forces fighting on the ground could easily disrupt the pact. Still, the UN has called it a “critical first step” towards ending the conflict.\n\n“This is not the end of the peace process but the beginning of it,” said Olusegun Obasanjo, the AU’s high representative for the Horn of Africa and a former Nigerian president, who first announced the deal.\n\nAbiy, whose military, backed by Eritrean forces, has made rapid gains in Tigray over recent weeks, celebrated the conclusion of the talks, saying: “Our commitment to peace remains steadfast. And our commitment to collaborating for the implementation of the agreement is equally strong.”\n\nBut how the deal will be implemented is unclear, with analysts pointing out that the text raises more questions than it answers.\n\n“These kinds of agreements should include constructive ambiguity, on the issues that are contested,” Kjetil Tronvoll, an expert on Ethiopian politics at Bjorknes University College in Norway, told CNN. “But here it’s not constructive it’s more destructive, in that it will undermine the trust process and could possibly jeopardize the durability of the agreement.”\n\nRepresentatives from Ethiopia and the TPLF and mediators at a press conference announcing the agreement in Pretoria, South Africa. Phill Magakoe/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere are a number of points in the agreement that Tronvoll said raise concerns, particularly one issue that was omitted entirely: the status of Eritrean forces in Tigray, which the text makes no mention of in spite of their outsized role in the conflict. Though the agreement states that the Ethiopian military will be deployed along the country’s borders, it does not specify whether they will ensure Eritrea’s withdrawal. “I don’t see any sustainable peace process if Eritrean forces are still on the ground,” Tronvoll said.\n\nThe deal is widely being seen as a capitulation by the TPLF, which, by Getachew’s own account, have suffered huge losses since hostilities resumed. “In order to address the pains of our people, we have made concessions because we have to build trust,” he said, adding that civilians and fighters were dying as he spoke.\n\nThe swift 30-day timeline for the overall disarmament and demobilization of Tigrayan fighters has raised eyebrows. And the agreement does not outline what force will replace them to provide security guarantees for Tigray’s civilian population, who have suffered widespread abuses at the hands of Ethiopian forces.\n\nThe agreement also states that the Ethiopian government will ensure “accountability, ascertaining the truth, redress for victims,” but ultimately how that accountability might come about is opaque.\n\n“It’s one of the key issues left unanswered … how accountability will come about,” Tronvoll said. “Ultimately it is the generals and Abiy Ahmed himself who should be held to account. I don’t know if anyone believes he’ll sign off on an agreement in which he would be put on trial.”\n\nWhat atrocities have been committed in the conflict?\n\nFor months at the start of the conflict, Abiy denied that civilians were being harmed or that soldiers from Eritrea had joined the fight. But reports from international observers, human rights groups and CNN proved both of those claims wrong.\n\nThousands of people have died in the fighting, by many estimates, with reports of razed refugee camps, looting, sexual violence, massacres and extrajudicial killings. Many more have fled to Sudan, in what the United Nations has called the worst exodus of refugees from Ethiopia seen in two decades. They describe a disastrous conflict that’s given rise to ethnic violence.\n\nEthiopia’s government has severely restricted access to journalists, and a state-enforced communications blackout concealed events in the region, making it challenging to gauge the extent of the crisis or verify survivors’ accounts.\n\nBut evidence of atrocities began to leak out last year.\n\nTigrayans grieve by a mass grave in the city of Wukro, north of Mekele, on February 28, 2021. EDUARDO SOTERAS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCNN investigations have uncovered evidence of massacres carried out in two Tigrayan towns, by Eritrean forces in Dengelat, and by Ethiopian soldiers in Mahibere Dego. A CNN team on the ground in central Tigray last April captured Eritrean troops – some disguising themselves in old Ethiopian military uniforms – operating with total impunity, manning checkpoints and blocking vital humanitarian aid to starving populations more than a month after Abiy pledged to the international community that they would leave.\n\nAll actors in the conflict have been accused of carrying out atrocities, but Eritrean forces have been linked to some of the most gruesome. In addition to perpetrating mass killings and rape, Eritrean soldiers have also been found blocking and looting food relief in multiple parts of Tigray.\n\nEritrea’s government has denied any involvement in atrocities. Ethiopia’s government has pledged investigations into any wrongdoing.\n\nThe conflict, which erupted during the autumn harvest season following the worst invasion of desert locusts in Ethiopia in decades, plunged Tigray even further into severe food insecurity. The UN has repeatedly issued warnings about de facto humanitarian aid blockades, barring critical food and assistance to Tigray.\n\nThe Ethiopian government has repeatedly rejected allegations that it is blocking aid. But days after the UN’s aid chief warned Tigray was facing a “man-made” famine, Ethiopia ordered seven senior UN officials to be expelled from the country, including from organizations coordinating relief efforts.\n\nThere are currently about 5.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Tigray, including 3.8 million in desperate need of healthcare, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nOn the same day that the truce was announced, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it had been two months since the last humanitarian aid reached the region, and that large numbers of displaced people were arriving in or moving toward Mekelle seeking assistance every day.\n\n“Since the beginning of the siege, food, medicine and other basic services have been weaponised,” Tedros said. “It has now been more than two months since the last humanitarian aid reached Tigray. But even before that, the aid reaching Tigray was a trickle – nowhere near enough to meet the needs.”\n\nHow did Abiy win the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nEthiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed campaigns in Jimma on June 16, 2021. Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than a year before Abiy launched an assault on his own people, he described war as “the epitome of hell” during his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize. He was awarded the honor for his role in ending a long-running conflict with neighboring Eritrea and for pushing significant reforms in Ethiopia.\n\nEritrea was once a part of Ethiopia, but won independence in 1993 after a 30-year armed struggle. From 1998 to 2000, Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a war that killed thousands on both sides, which led to a long, dangerous stalemate and a total freeze in cooperation.\n\nOnce in power, Abiy moved quickly to normalize relations with Eritrea, in part by accepting the ruling of an international commission on boundaries between the two states.\n\nAbiy also made significant moves towards domestic reforms, raising hopes that he would bring about lasting change. As well as forging a truce with Eritrea, he lifted a severe security law, released thousands of political prisoners, moved to open up the telecommunications industry and expand private investment.\n\nBut his reputation as a leader who could unite Ethiopia has swiftly deteriorated, and his much-lauded peace deal with Eritrea appears to have paved the way for the two countries to go to war with their mutual foe – the TPLF.\n\nSince the conflict began, ethnically-driven violence has broken out into other parts of the country, including in Abiy’s home region, Oromia, the country’s most populous region. Last May, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), an armed group, vowed to wage “total war” against Abiy’s government.\n\nDespite promises to heal ethnic divides and pave the way for a peaceful, democratic transition, Abiy has increasingly invoked the playbook of repressive regimes: Shutting down internet and telephone services, arresting journalists and suppressing critics. Abiy has also been criticized for fueling “inflamed” rhetoric amid the conflict in Tigray, whose forces he has described as “weeds” and “cancer.”\n\nLast July, in the midst of the war, Abiy and his party won a landslide victory in a general election that was boycotted by opposition parties, marred by logistical issues and excluded many voters, including all those in Tigray – a crushing disappointment to many who had high hopes that the democratic transition Abiy promised would be realized.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/20/africa/ethiopia-civilian-deaths-oromia-region-intl-afr/index.html", "title": "Ethiopia: At least 200 civilians, mostly Amharas, killed in Saturday ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt least 200 civilians are believed to have been killed in Ethiopia’s Oromia region by rebel group the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) on Saturday, according to reports, a rights group and local officials. Most of the victims are from the Amhara ethnic group, a police officer said.\n\nThe attack on the town of Gimbi was connected to fighting between government forces and the OLA, according to a statement from the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC). The EHRC told CNN Monday that the assault has left “scores of people injured, villages destroyed, and entire communities traumatized.”\n\nThe OLA – which last year aligned with Tigrayan rebel forces against Ethiopia’s federal government in the country’s protracted conflict – has denied all the allegations. OLA spokesman Odaa Tarbii said Sunday that the “regime” of Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed “is again blaming the OLA for atrocities committed by its own retreating fighters.”\n\nThe rebel group has been designated as a terror organization by the Ethiopian government, and it is frequently accused of attacking civilians and targeting ethnic Amharas.\n\nThis incident is among the worst atrocities to hit the country since fighting broke out in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region in 2020, when Abiy’s government and its allies from the neighboring Amhara region tried to suppress a rebellion by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF).\n\nThe TPLF dominated Ethiopia’s government prior to Abiy’s rise to power in 2018.\n\nThe ensuing civil war has seen both sides carry out atrocities, according to human rights groups, and risks splitting the ethnically diverse country. There is no suggestion TPLF was involved in Saturday’s attack.\n\nA local police officer involved in the response effort to Saturday’s incident told CNN ​that an attack happened near Tole, a village within Gimbi, on Saturday, with the majority of the victims belonging to the Amhara ethnic group. The police officer spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak on the matter.\n\nThe assault came days after heavy fighting between government security forces and the OLA in the area, he said.\n\nSurvivors and escapees told the police officer that the attack started when members of the OLA attempted to cross through the village but were denied passage by local residents and some armed civilians.\n\nA resident of Tole, who only spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said he saw OLA militiamen walking down a main road on Saturday morning before dispersing towards neighboring villages. Government forces, who were seen in Tole earlier in the week, had left the area days before the attack, he added.\n\nThe police officer said responders were sent to the scene on Sunday to retrieve and bury bodies.\n\nFederal forces have now secured the area, he added, but “residents are still asking for immediate assistance due to security concerns in the area,” the EHRC said.\n\nThe Oromia regional government also accused the OLA of attacking civilians after “being incapable of resisting attacks from security forces,” and has vowed to intensify attacks on the group, according to a statement published on Sunday.\n\nPrime Minister Abiy said the “attacks on innocent civilians & destruction of livelihoods by illegal and irregular forces is unacceptable,” in a tweet on Monday.\n\nThe head of the EHRC, Daniel Bekele, urged authorities to “ensure necessary measures for protection of civilians,” and “find a lasting solution to the problem,” in a statement from the commission on Sunday.\n\nEthiopia is an ethnically and religiously diverse nation of about 110 million people who speak numerous different languages. Its two largest ethnic groups, the Oromo and Amhara, make up more than 60% of the population. The Tigrayans, the third largest, are around 7%.\n\nLast week, Abiy said the Ethiopian government has formed a committee to negotiate with forces from the Tigray region.

It's also the first conducted amid ongoing fighting.

Security Council may vote as early as this week on a resolution that demands an “immediate cessation of hostilities in all countries on its agenda” and calls for armed groups to engage in a 30-day cease-fire, according to a draft of the measure obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nIts fate is uncertain, and experts say it comes with many caveats and exceptions – including a loophole that could allow Russia to continue bombing civilians in Syria.\n\nRight now, world powers are still quibbling over several provisions. The Trump administration has objected to any language expressing support for the World Health Organization, among other provisions – disputes that could sink or stall the effort. President Donald Trump has blasted the WHO being biased toward China and accepting Beijing's statements about the coronavirus outbreak at face value.\n\nA State Department official declined to comment on the draft, citing ongoing negotiations. The official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said the Trump administration supports the call for a global cease-fire but wants to ensure it will not hinder U.S. counterterrorism missions.\n\nIf it passes, experts say its impact could be significant – albeit not sweeping – during an otherwise bleak moment of global crisis.\n\n“This is not a piece of paper that’s going to save the planet, and it’s not even going to stop some of the nasty wars that are burning out there,” said Richard Gowan, an expert on the United Nations and peacekeeping with the International Crisis Group, a nonpartisan organization that seeks to prevent conflict.\n\n“But it’s at least something which could help ease middle-sized and smaller conflicts in countries ranging from Colombia to Sudan, where we know that armed groups are actually interested in pausing violence and talking about peace during the COVID crisis.”\n\n'Famines of biblical proportions':UN food program chief fears coronavirus will cause mass starvation\n\nIt could also help staunch the flow of refugees in some war-ravaged countries – and thus slow the spread of COVID-19, said Barry Posen, an international professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\"War and disease travel together and are usually causative,\" Posen said.\n\nWhile a global cease-fire may sound lofty and idealistic, he said, it's also quite practical, particularly in places like Syria and Yemen, where health care is scarce and civilians are extremely vulnerable to disease.\n\n\"The intrusion of COVID into that situation would make what's already a horror show into an even bigger horror show,\" he said. \"If you can do a little something to suppress these wars at the moment, you would also be doing a little something to suppress the disease.\" And because these conflicts are also producing refugees, it could help limit the further spread of the illness if civilians are not forced to flee conflict zones.\n\nU.S. coronavirus map:Tracking the outbreak\n\nMore than 100 countries, 16 armed groups already endorse cease fire\n\nThe United Nation's secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, has used both lofty rhetoric and harsh reality in his pitch for the cease-fire.\n\n\"There should be only one fight in our world today: our shared battle against COVID-19,\" he said in an April 3 news briefing on his effort. French President Emmanuel Macron has also championed the cease-fire proposal.\n\nSo far, about 16 armed groups and more than 100 countries have endorsed the measure, according to an informal tally kept by U.N. officials. A few examples:\n\n• In Colombia, a left-wing rebel group known as the ELN agreed to a cease-fire starting April and said it would consider reviving peace talks with the government.\n\n• In Yemen, one side of that brutal war – the Saudi Arabia-led coalition – agreed to a unilateral cease-fire for at least a month, to help control the spread of coronavirus in a country already ravaged by starvation and other diseases. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have not yet signed on.\n\n• In Syria, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces agreed to a cease-fire, saying its fighters would defend themselves against attacks but not engage in offensive military action. “We hope that this humanitarian truce will help to open the door for dialogue and political solution and to put an end to the war in the world and Syria,” the SDF said in a statement.\n\nGuterres hailed these moves but noted there is \"a huge distance between declarations and deeds.\"\n\nP. Terrance Hopmann, a professor of international relations at Johns Hopkins University, said there's a stark power imbalance among those who have signed onto the cease-fire proposal and those who have not – with rebel groups far more willing to end fighting than they governments they are trying to topple.\n\n\"Rebels don't have access to hospitals, they don't have access to medical care generally,\" he noted. \"They're often in the jungle or the desert or something.\"\n\nWhat does coronavirus do to your body?:Everything to know about the infection\n\nGovernments, even those under attack, may see an advantage in the pandemic \"because they already have a power asymmetry in their favor\" and therefore may try to push forward to try to win a conflict rather than negotiate a truce, he said.\n\nOne surprising exception is in the Philippines, Hopmann said, where a communist rebel group said it had ordered its fighters to observe a cease-fire amid the pandemic after Philippine's hard-line president, Rodrigo Duterte, had declared his own unilateral cease-fire. The conflict has caused an estimated 40,000 deaths in that country.\n\n\"We'll be lucky if this appeal works in one or two cases,\" Hopmann said. \"But if it does,\n\nit would be a significant accomplishment because thousands of people were being killed every day in many conflicts around the world.\"\n\nCease-fire pitch comes as peace talks become difficult amid social distancing\n\nGowan noted that the push for a cease-fire comes as U.N. mediators and envoys cannot travel to conflict zones, making peace talks even more difficult. He also said some groups that have endorsed the cease-fire have already started fighting again, while others have less-than-altruistic motives.\n\n\"In Yemen, the Saudis have for some time been trying to see if they can find a way to get out of this quagmire,\" Gowan said, and the pandemic may offer \"a face-saving way\" to exit a war that has damaged the kingdom's reputation and drained its military.\n\nBut even as the Saudis embraced the U.N. proposal, another faction on Monday broke a peace deal it had signed in November, highlighting the intractability of the multicountry conflict.\n\nGowan said the peace push may gain more traction as the pandemic spreads.\n\n\"In places like Libya and eastern Ukraine, where fighting goes on, the disease hasn’t had its full effect yet in terms of infections or economic damage,\" he said. \"As the disease plays out, you’re going to see more military groups really feel the pain to resources and fighters ... and that could inspire a sense of exhaustion that might inspire more countries to take this seriously.\"\n\nFor major world powers, Posen said the coronavirus outbreaks on the USS Theodore Roosevelt and a French aircraft carrier should serve as a stark warning about how the disease could weaken military prowess. In both cases, hundreds of sailors became infected as the virus swept through the ships.\n\n\"The disease caused by the coronavirus is weakening all of the great and middle powers more or less equally,\" he said. He said with no country likely to gain a meaningful military advantage from the pandemic, \"the odds of a war between major powers will go down, not up.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean the U.S. and its foes aren't flirting with conflict. After a dozen Iranian speed boats brazenly swarmed U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf, Trump last week threatened to \"shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea.\"\n\nGowan and others said the Trump administration has objected to at least two elements of the resolution.

What to know about its complex civil war", "text": "A surprise offensive by rebel forces opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime has led to a new round of fighting in the Middle Eastern country's long-running – but until recently largely static – civil war.\n\nAfter a lightning advance in just a few days, rebels captured almost all of Aleppo, which is Syria's second-largest city. However, Assad in a speech Saturday vowed to defend the country's \"stability and territorial integrity.\"\n\nSyria's civil war grew out of Assad's brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2011. More than a decade later, about half a million people have been killed, according to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group. Millions of Syrians have fled overseas. Key infrastructure lay in ruins. A web of Syria's neighbors and countries around the world have backed either Assad's government or various rebel opposition groups to varying degrees.\n\nSyria's war:How barbarity, confusion and indifference helped Bashar al-Assad prosper\n\nHere's what to know about the complex war.\n\nWhy has Syria's civil war re-erupted now?\n\nA cease-fire brokered by Turkey, which supports the opposition, and Russia, which backs Assad, has been in place since 2020. But the fresh rebel offensive started last week as anti-Assad fighters sought to take more government-controlled territory. Rebels claimed this was in response to an uptick in attacks from Assad's forces.\n\nHowever, analysts say the eruption of new fighting is likely a direct consequence of what's been taking place outside Syria's borders. That includes Iran-backed Hezbollah – an ally of Assad – and its major hostilities with Israel in Lebanon. Russia's war in Ukraine has also influenced the region.\n\n\"Hezbollah has been weakened by its recent conflict with Israel. Russia remains entangled in the war in Ukraine and faces economic strain. Iran is stretched thin, with its ground lines of communication and regional allies under direct attack,\" said Mohammed Albasha, founder of Basha Report, a Virginia-based consultancy specializing in Middle East affairs. \"Against this backdrop, Turkey and its allies are seizing the moment.\"\n\nWho's fighting who? And why?\n\nA Sunni Islamist militant and political group named Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, and its allies have been leading the latest rebel offensive. HTS has historic, though now splintered, connections to both al-Qaida and the Islamic State terror groups. HTS wants to topple Assad, expel Iran from the area and pursue its own extremist ideology.\n\nAssad's chief military supporters have been Russia and Iran. Russia entered the conflict in 2015 to shore up Assad's struggling regime. Russia's leader Vladimir Putin wanted to assert his country's power on the world stage and act as a counterweight to the U.S., which at the time was arming and providing air cover for a motley crew of anti-Assad rebel groups, including Kurds in Iraq and Syria, who were simultaneously waging war against the Islamic State.\n\nSyria conflict explained:How did we end up here?\n\nIran has long backed the Assad regime, funneling money and fighters to it through Hezbollah. It does this to pursue its national security aims, which include using Syria to pressure its neighbor Israel, Iran's arch-enemy.\n\nTurkey, Syria's northern neighbor, has thrown its weight behind anti-Assad opposition groups because it wants to contain Kurdish secessionist movements in the region, including in Turkey, where separatists have for decades waged what the government describes as terror attacks. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also faces growing domestic political pressure to deport Syrian refugees who have fled to Turkey in droves since the war's start.\n\nWhat does the fighting mean, and what happens now?\n\nAssad's regime is entrenched. His government as of last week controlled approximately 70% of Syrian territory, according to the United States Institute of Peace, a think tank. The surge in fighting from a mostly dormant cease-fire raises the possibility of yet another violent and volatile front in the Middle East after a fragile cease-fire in Lebanon between Hezbollah and Israel and the ongoing fight in Gaza between Iran-backed Hamas and Israel.\n\nWhether Assad's government can survive, and prosper, may ultimately depend on how much intervention there is from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, all three of which have enabled him to stay in power.\n\nSyrian rebels sweep into Aleppo:army says dozens of soldiers killed\n\nAyman Abdel Nour, a former friend of Syria's leader from their college days studying medicine in Damascus and the editor-in-chief of All4Syria, a leading independent news outlet, said that in recent weeks Assad has resisted efforts by Russia to get him to meet with Turkey's Erdogan ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's second term.\n\nThis meeting, Nour said, would be aimed at finding a longer-term solution to Syria's 13-year-old simmering civil war – in particular its underpinning by non-state actors such as Hezbollah at a time when Trump has signaled he wants to withdraw the remaining 900 U.S. troop in Syria who counter Iran's influence.\n\n\"The rapid gains by rebel forces, combined with the maneuvering of external powers with conflicting interests, leave Syria's future precariously uncertain,\" said Albasha.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/asia/asia-summits-asean-us-china-myanmar-intl-hnk-mic/index.html", "title": "As major powers meet in Asia, the rest of the world is pressed to pick ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nWorld leaders are converging in Phnom Penh this weekend for the first in a series of international summits in Southeast Asia over the coming week, where divisions between major powers and conflict threaten to overshadow talks.\n\nThe first stop is the Cambodian capital where leaders from across the Indo-Pacific will meet alongside a summit of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders, followed next week by a meeting of the Group of 20 (G20) leaders in Bali and of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Bangkok.\n\nThe stacked diplomatic line-up will be a test of international appetite for coordination on issues like climate change, global inflation and rising food prices on the back of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic – and the first time that all three events are being held in person since the outbreak began in 2020.\n\nSharp geopolitical divisions of the type not seen in decades loom over this political calendar, as the war in Ukraine has radically transformed Russia’s relationship with the West, the top two global economies US and China remain locked in intensifying competition, and the rest of the world is pressed to pick a side.\n\nWhether Russian leader Vladimir Putin will make any appearance during the stretch of diplomatic dates remains uncertain. Both US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to attend two of the summits in Southeast Asia – a region that has long been ground-zero for influence-jockeying between Beijing and Washington.\n\nXi is re-emerging on the world stage after years without travel during the pandemic, having secured a norm-breaking third term in power, while Biden heads east fresh from a better-than-expected performance by his party in the US midterm elections. Both would be expected to pitch their country as a stronger partner and more responsible global actor than the other.\n\nThe two will meet face-to-face on Monday on the sidelines of the G20, their first in-person encounter since Biden’s election, the White House said on Thursday. Beijing on Friday confirmed Xi’s travel plans to the G20 and APEC summits, and said he would hold bilateral meetings with Biden and several other leaders.\n\nTalks between the two could help to avert an escalation of tensions between the powers. But for the leaders meeting during the string of summits in coming days, cinching robust agreements on tackling global issues – already a tough bargain at the best of times – will be a challenge.\n\nPolice officers in Phnom Penh close the roads to traffic around the site of the ASEAN summit, which meets from November 10. Chris Humphrey/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nDivided world\n\nEven the most regional of the meetings, the ASEAN summit of Southeast Asian leaders – which kicked off in Phnom Penh on Friday and is slated to address strengthening regional stability as well as global challenges – will reflect fractured world politics, experts say.\n\nBut unlike the other major meetings, which may be more squarely focused on the fallout from the war in Ukraine, ASEAN leaders are entering the summit and related meetings this weekend under pressure to address a spiraling conflict within their own bloc: as Myanmar remains in turmoil and under military rule nearly two years after a brutal coup ousted the democratically elected government.\n\nDifferences between Southeast Asian countries on how to handle that conflict, compounded by their criss-crossing allegiances with great powers – and a reticence from the bloc to appear to take sides between the US and China – will all impact how much the group can agree on and what it can accomplish across the gamut of summits, experts say.\n\n“Normally this season would be very exciting – you have three major world summits in Southeast Asia – Phnom Penh, Bali and Bangkok,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University’s Faculty of Political Science in Bangkok.\n\n“But (ASEAN) is very much divided on Russian aggression, on the Myanmar coup crisis, on China’s belligerence in the South China Sea and so on, and this means that ASEAN is in bad shape,” he said.\n\nAt a United Nations vote last month, seven of the 10 ASEAN countries, including the Myanmar representative who is not backed by the ruling military, voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of four regions of Ukraine, while Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam abstained.\n\nBut ASEAN as a bloc has also taken a step to tighten ties with Kyiv at this week’s events, signing an amity and cooperation treaty with Ukraine in a ceremony with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Phnom Penh on Thursday.\n\nThe bloc aims to use consensus among its states as its strength when it brings larger world players to the table, for example in its adjacent East Asia Summit that brings together 18 Indo-Pacific countries, including Russia, China and the United States, and also meets this weekend.\n\n“If ASEAN cannot get its house in order, if ASEAN cannot rein in a rogue member like the Myanmar military regime, then ASEAN loses its relevance,” Pongsudhirak said. “On the other hand, if ASEAN is united, if it can muster commitment and resolve … it can have a lot of pulling power.”\n\nConflict and competition in Southeast Asia\n\nNearly two years since the military coup crushed Myanmar’s fledgling democracy, rights groups and observers say freedoms and rights in the country have deteriorated sharply; state executions have returned and the number of documented violent attacks by the ruling military junta on civilian infrastructure, including schools, has surged.\n\nNumerous armed rebel groups have emerged against the ruling military junta, while millions of people have resisted its rule through forms of civil disobedience.\n\nThe weekend’s summits in Phnom Penh will pull the conflict back into international focus, as Southeast Asian leaders try to find a path forward, after Myanmar’s ruling junta failed to implement a peace plan negotiated in April of last year. The country remains part of ASEAN, despite calls from rights groups for its ejection, but has been barred from sending political-level representatives to key events.\n\nProtestors setup and guard makeshift barricades to block the road during the demonstration against the military coup in Yangon, Myanmar in March 2021. Stringer/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nASEAN foreign ministers held a last-ditch attempt to hash out a strategy late last month, with Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, who chaired the meeting, stressing in a statement afterwards that the challenges were down to “the complexity and difficulty of Myanmar’s decades-long protracted conflicts, which has been further exacerbated by the current political crisis.”\n\nBut observers have low expectations for a tougher line, at least while Cambodia chairs the bloc, and are already looking to next year when Indonesia assumes leadership in 2023.\n\nAddressing the “ongoing crisis” will be a focus for Biden in talks with Southeast Asian leaders as he attends ASEAN summits over the weekend, the White House said on Tuesday. Since the coup, the Biden administration has launched targeted sanctions against the military regime and held meetings with the opposition National Unity Government.\n\nChina, on the other hand, has shown support to the ruling military junta and would be unlikely to back tough action, observers say. A months-long inquiry into the situation in Myanmar released by an international team of lawmakers last month accused Russia and China of “supplying both weapons and legitimacy to an otherwise isolated regime.”\n\nThat, too, could have an impact on outcomes this weekend, according to political scientist Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.\n\n“Because of Russian and (Chinese) support for the junta, any efforts toward a solution by ASEAN would require some form of engagement with them, whether this is to get buy-in or even just non-opposition,” Chong said.\n\nThe crisis in Myanmar is not the only area where US and China division may loom over the ASEAN summits, even as issues like China’s aggression in the South China Sea – where Beijing asserts territorial claims that conflict with those of several Southeast Asian countries – may be of lesser importance this year.\n\nASEAN will hold its usual side summits with both the US and China respectively, as well as other countries, and China’s number two leader, the economy-focused Premier Li Keqiang arrived earlier this week as Xi’s representative.\n\nAs Southeast Asian leaders seek to shore up their economic stability, they are likely to raise concerns about the impact of US-China competition on the region, its trade and supply chains, for example in the wake of a US export ban on semi-conductors to China, according to Chong.\n\n“ASEAN states are going to try and find some way to navigate all this, and will be looking to both Beijing and Washington to see what sort of leeway they can provide,” he said.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/12/06/syria-rebels-take-hama-city/76817335007/", "title": "'Your time has come': Syrian rebels take major city as thousands flee", "text": "Syrian rebels overtook the western city of Hama, their second major victory since they swept Aleppo last week, as thousands fled the city of Homs ahead of the Islamist insurgents.\n\nThe rebel group, called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, had advanced to the countryside around 3 miles north of Homs, Syria's third largest city, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitor.

The agreement that is in the works would include dozens of individuals who were arrested in 2021 protests against the Communist government. The official could not say how many political prisoners would be set free but said the Biden administration believed the release would take place in relatively short order.\n\nCuba's government said later that it would \"gradually\" release 553 political prisoners, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Catholic Church has been engaging directly with the Cuban government, the person said. The Vatican has consistently kept the administration appraised of the potential actions that Cuba will be undertaking.\n\nBiden spoke this week to Pope Francis by phone, giving the administration confidence in the strength of the dialogue, the official conveyed. He also awarded Francis the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction after their conversation.\n\nAn administration official said Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva also asked Biden to lift the state sponsor of terror designation.

North Korea imprisoned Otto Warmbier for more than a year, detaining the one-time college student as he was preparing to leave that repressive dictatorship.\n\nAt the urging of Fred and Cindy Warmbier, 12 senators — six Republicans and six Democrats — sent a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Monday, asking him to put North Korea on the list of countries that the U.S. considers sponsors of terrorism.\n\n“This is something the Warmbiers are very interested in,” said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who led the letter along with Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat. Other signers include Sens.

Portman’s office has been helping them arrange meetings with other members of Congress who might be able to help them win this policy change.\n\nNorth Korea was listed as a state sponsor of terrorism for two decades, from 1988 until 2008. The George W. Bush administration took the country off the list as part of an agreement with North Korea to curb its nuclear weapons program.\n\n“Of course North Korea didn’t follow through on the commitments they had made on the nuclear program, and yet this designation never was renewed,” Portman said in an interview Wednesday. He said North Korea’s dealings with Iran should be enough to justify putting them back on the list, not to mention their recent missile tests and other aggressions.\n\nIn their letter to Tillerson, Portman and the other senators note that North Korea has “consistently shown a disregard” for international agreements, “reviving its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.”\n\nThe senators also asked Tillerson to take into account North Korea’s treatment of detained U.S. citizens, although they did not mention Otto Warmbier specifically. Warmbier was in North Korea as part of a tour group when he was detained and charged with hostile acts against the North Korean government.\n\nAfter a sham trial, he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly stealing a poster from a staff-only section of a hotel in North Korea.\n\nPutting North Korea on the terrorist-sponsor list would give the U.S. another pressure point against North Korea. It would also be a “diplomatic setback” for the country, Marc Thiessen, a former Bush aide and foreign policy expert, wrote in a recent op-ed arguing in favor of the move.\n\n“The additional sanctions that come with a re-designation may not make much of a difference in North Korean’s behavior, but they are one piece of a larger strategy for isolating and squeezing the North Korean regime,” Thiessen wrote.\n\nThe State Department declined to comment on the record. For a country to be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, the secretary of State must determine that the government of that country has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.\n\nThe Warmbiers have not responded to recent requests from The Cincinnati Enquirer for an interview. But in an interview with Fox and Friends last week, they said they were shocked to learn North Korea was not on the terrorist list.\n\n“We owe it to the world to list North Korea as a state sponsor of terror,\" said Fred Warmbier.\n\nThey described in wrenching detail their son’s medical condition upon his return from North Korea. \"They destroyed him,\" said Cindy Warmbier.\n\nFollow Deirdre Shesgreen on Twitter: @dshesgreen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/07/22/fact-check-republican-convention-trump-speech/87420076/", "title": "Fact check: Trump's big acceptance speech", "text": "Lori Robertson, FactCheck.org\n\nCLEVELAND — In accepting his party’s nomination for president, Donald Trump said “here, at our convention, there will be no lies.” But we found plenty of instances where Trump twisted facts or made false claims.\n\n• Trump said after Clinton’s four years as secretary of State, “Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.” But Iran was already on a path to acquiring nuclear weapons. At issue is whether the nuclear deal will prevent Iran, as intended, from becoming a nuclear power.\n\n• He also blamed Clinton for the resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. But Clinton and former Defense secretary Robert Gates both urged President Obama not to be quick to abandon support for Mubarak.\n\n• Trump claimed Clinton “plans a massive … tax increase,” but tax experts say 95% of taxpayers would see “little or no change” in their taxes under Clinton’s plan.\n\n• He correctly noted a 17% increase in homicides in the 50 largest cities from 2014 to 2015, but called it a reversal after a decades-long decline in crime. Experts say that’s not enough data to draw conclusions about a trend.\n\n• Trump claimed Clinton “illegally” stored emails on her private server while secretary of State, and deleted 33,000 to cover-up “her crime.” But the FBI cleared Clinton of criminal wrongdoing, and found no evidence of a cover-up.\n\n• Trump said that “there’s no way to screen” Syrian refugees to determine “who they are or where they come from.” But all refugees admitted to the U.S. go through an extensive vetting process that takes 18 to 24 months to complete.\n\n• He said the “trade deficit in goods … is $800 billion last year alone.” It was nearly that, but it discounts the services the U.S. exports. The total trade deficit for goods and services is just over $500 billion.\n\n• Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, also spoke, and he erroneously claimed that the Iran nuclear deal “lined the pockets of the world’s number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money.” The assets that were unfrozen by the deal weren’t held by the U.S. government.\n\nThat’s not all: Trump made other factual errors and omissions on NAFTA, Libya, household income, government regulation and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGOP convention: Trump speech is grand finale of wacky, wild week\n\nSeeking Republican unity, Trump says: 'I will fight for you'\n\nForeign Policy Flubs\n\nTrump criticized Hillary Clinton’s performance as secretary of State, contrasting the state of foreign affairs now with what they were like “pre-Hillary,” as he called it:\n\n• Trump said, “Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.” But Iran was already on a path to nuclear weapons before Clinton became secretary of State in January 2009.\n\n• Trump also said, “Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood.” True, but it was through an election after an uprising against President Hosni Mubarak. Clinton and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates both wrote that they urged President Obama not to be quick to abandon support for Mubarak.\n\nThe disagreement between Trump and Clinton on Iran’s nuclear ambitions is over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which is designed to lengthen the so-called “breakout” time — the amount of time that it takes to assemble a bomb.\n\nPrior to the agreement, the breakout time was thought to be months, but now it is more than a year for at least 10 years, as the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service explains in its May report “Iran Nuclear Agreement.”\n\nHowever, critics, such the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, say that delay is only temporary — a position shared by Trump and many Republicans.\n\n“While the agreement lengthens Iran’s breakout time today, restrictions on Iran’s program begin to lift within a decade,” AIPAC said earlier this month to mark the one-year anniversary of the deal. “After 15 years Iran will be a nuclear-threshold state: no restrictions will remain on the number or type of centrifuges Iran will be able to install or the number of enrichment facilities it can build.”\n\nBut Iran was on a path to a nuclear weapon before Obama took office. The United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency has been concerned since 2002 about what it called the “possible military dimensions to Iran’s nuclear programme.”\n\nIn a Nov. 8, 2011, report, the IAEA reported, “Since 2002, the Agency has become increasingly concerned about the possible existence in Iran of undisclosed nuclear related activities involving military related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile, about which the Agency has regularly received new information.”\n\nIn November 2008, the New York Timesreported that Iran had enough nuclear material to make a bomb, citing expert analysis of a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nThe issue now is how that path has been altered, for better or worse, by the Iran nuclear deal signed by the Obama administration and supported by Clinton (who left the State Department in February 2013, more than two years before the Iran deal was struck).\n\nAs for Egypt, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood was elected president of Egypt. That was a year after citizen protests forced longtime Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to resign from office. A year after his election as president, Morsi was then overthrown by the Egyptian military and replaced as president by military chief Abdul-Fattah al-Sisi.\n\nIn his book “Duty,” Gates was critical of Obama for being too quick to abandon support for Mubarak — a point also made by Clinton in her book “Hard Choices.”\n\nIn an interview last May to discuss his book, Gates said of Clinton: “I think that we certainly agreed in terms of how to deal with the very first phases of — of the Arab Spring, and, particularly, disagreeing with the President on how to handle Mubarak.”\n\nTax Overreach\n\nTrump claimed that Clinton “plans a massive — and I mean massive — tax increase.” But experts say 95% of taxpayers would see “little or no change” in their taxes under Clinton’s plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump boasted that under his tax plan, “middle-income Americans will experience profound relief.” Experts say Americans at all income levels would see their taxes reduced under Trump’s plan, but the biggest cuts — both in raw dollars and as a percentage of income — would go to the wealthiest Americans.\n\nTrump: \"While Hillary Clinton plans a massive — and I mean massive — tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year – Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be simplified for everyone.\"\n\nIt’s accurate to say that Clinton has proposed tax increases, for some. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center concluded that the sum of Clinton’s proposed tax changes — including changes to both individual and business taxes — would increase revenue by $1.1 trillion over the next decade. But almost all of the higher taxes would fall the top earners.\n\n“Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes,” the Tax Policy Center concluded. In fact, the Tax Policy Center wrote, the “top 1 percent of households would pay more than three-fourths of Clinton’s total tax increases.”\n\nThe Tax Foundation reached a similar conclusion about Clinton’s tax plan. By the Tax Foundation’s calculation, Clinton’s tax plan would increase revenues by nearly $500 billion over the next decade, but only by $191 billion when accounting for the plan’s overall economic effect.\n\n“The largest sources of revenue in the plan are the new taxes targeted at high-income taxpayers,” wrote the Tax Foundation, which analyzed the plan’s impact with (dynamic) and without (static) taking into account the expected effect on the economy.\n\nTax Foundation: \"On a static basis, Clinton’s tax plan would only reduce the after-tax incomes of top-income taxpayers. Those in the top 10 percent would see a reduction in income of 0.7 percent. The top 1 percent of all taxpayers would see a 1.7 percent reduction in after-tax income. \"On a dynamic basis, the plan would reduce after-tax incomes by an average of 1.3 percent. All deciles would see a reduction in after-tax income of at least 0.9 percent over the long-term. Taxpayers that fall in the bottom nine deciles would see their after-tax incomes decline by between 0.9 and 1 percent. The top 10 percent of taxpayers would see a reduction in after-tax income of 1.7 percent. The top 1 percent of all taxpayers would see the largest decline in after-tax income: 2.7 percent.\"\n\nTrump is correct that he has called for substantial tax cuts — deeper than any of the other presidential candidates — that would result in lower taxes at all income levels. But the biggest cuts would come for the wealthiest taxpayers, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.\n\n“Mr. Trump’s plan would cut taxes by $11.98 trillion over the next decade on a static basis,” the Tax Foundation stated.\n\nTax Foundation: \"Taxpayers in the bottom deciles (the 0-10 and 10-20 percent deciles), would see increases in after-tax adjusted gross income (AGI) of 1.4 and 0.6 percent, respectively. Middle-income taxpayers with incomes that fall within the 30th to 80th percentiles would see larger increases in their after-tax AGI, of between 3.0 and 8.3 percent. Taxpayers with incomes that fall in the highest income class (the 90-100 percent decile) would see an increase in after-tax income of 14.6 percent. The top 1 percent of all taxpayers would see a 21.6 percent increase in after-tax income.\"\n\nWhile the tax cuts are undeniably large, the Tax Foundation cautioned that the loss in revenue — even with expected benefits to the economy — would “increase the federal government’s deficit by over $10 trillion” over 10 years.\n\nFact check: Night 1 of GOP convention\n\nFact check: Night 2 of GOP convention\n\nFact check: Night 3 of GOP convention\n\nAnd More on Taxes …\n\nLike his son Eric claimed on Day 3 of the RNC, Trump said, “America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.” The U.S. has one of the highest business tax rates, but for personal taxes, the U.S. ranked in the bottom half among industrialized nations.\n\nAccording to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the U.S. came in at 27th out of 30 industrialized countries in tax revenue as a percentage of GDP in 2014. Denmark (50.9%), France (45.2%) and Belgium (44.7%) were the three highest taxed countries. The U.S. figure, 26%, was well below the OECD average.\n\nThe U.S. also ranked 17th out of 29 industrialized countries when it came to tax revenue per capita, according to the OECD. The top three were Luxembourg ($49,911), Norway ($38,016) and Denmark ($31,054). In the U.S., the tax revenue per capita in 2014 was $14,204.\n\nAs for corporate tax rates, the U.S. does, in fact, have the highest statutory tax rate among industrialized nations. And it was second to France among industrialized nations when considering the marginal effective tax rate, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.\n\nNot a Reversal in Crime Trend\n\nTrump was correct to say that “homicides last year increased by 17% in America’s 50 largest cities,” but criminology and statistics experts disagree with his conclusion that a one-year increase in some cities means that “decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed.”\n\nTrump: \"Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17% in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.\"\n\nThe figures are correct for 2014 to 2015, though technically, 36 cities had an increase in murders and 13 had a decrease. As we’ve written before, law enforcement officials are concerned about the uptick, but far from ready to declare this a “reversal” of a long decline in murders and violent crime, since those figures peaked, both in cities and nationwide, in the early 1990s.\n\nDarrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Police Association, told us in an email that it was “too soon to talk about trends.” Stephens said there had been “a spike in the past year in some large cities (particularly in five or six) — something we should be concerned about to be sure but not a trend or even close to 20 years ago.”\n\nRichard A. Berk, professor of criminology and statistics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told us, “Snapshots are not trends. And two or three years of data are far too few to establish a trend.”\n\nIt’s difficult to know what is causing the increases in some cities, he said. “In LA, for example, the number of shootings has been flat but the number of homicides has jumped,” Berk said. “Are the bad guys becoming better marksmen?”\n\nSimilarly, when the Washington Postwrote about the 2014-to-2015 increase in major cities, it said that experts were concerned but said “it’s too early to know what caused the change, or whether it will endure.” Franklin Zimring, a criminologist at the University of California at Berkeley, told the Post, “There’s no national pattern.”\n\nWe took a longer view of what has happened in some major cities, compiling the FBI city-specific data, which comes from voluntary reports from police departments, available through 2012, and 2015 numbers reported by police departments to the Major Cities Chiefs Police Association. Every city shows a big drop in the number of murders since the 1990s, and mixed movement from 2012 to 2015.\n\nClinton Emails and the Law\n\nTrump twisted the facts when he said that Clinton “illegally” stored emails on her private server while secretary of State, and deleted 33,000 of them “so the authorities can’t see her crime.” The FBI on July 5 cleared Clinton of wrongdoing, and found no evidence of a cover-up.\n\nTrump: \"And when a secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can’t see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never before.\"\n\nA quick recap of the facts: Clinton exclusively used personal email for government business, and stored those emails on her private server. The FBI investigated whether “classified information was improperly stored or transmitted” on Clinton’s server in violation of federal law, as FBI Director James Comey explained on July 5.\n\nBut Comey said the facts of the case did not warrant criminal charges. “Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,” he said.\n\nAs for Trump’s reference to 33,000 deleted emails, Clinton in 2014 turned over 30,490 work-related emails to the State Department in 2014, and destroyed 31,830 emails she deemed private and personal. The FBI “discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton” to the State Department.\n\nIt is a crime to intentionally destroy government records. However, Comey said the FBI “found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.”\n\nSee our item “A Guide to Clinton’s Emails” for more information.\n\nRefugee Exaggerations\n\nWhile criticizing Hillary Clinton’s support for admitting more Syrian refugees to the U.S., Trump said that “there’s no way to screen” those refugees to determine “who they are or where they come from.” That’s false. All refugees admitted to the U.S. go through an extensive vetting process that involves multiple federal agencies and can take up to 24 months to complete.\n\nTrump: \"My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.\"\n\nThe Obama administration pledged to admit up to 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 (ending Sept. 30), and Clinton has said that the U.S. should increase that number to 65,000. However, Clinton said the U.S. should increase the number of Syrian refugees admitted “only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine.”\n\nThe current process for admitting a refugee to the U.S. is very lengthy. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or sometimes a U.S. embassy, refers a qualified refugee for resettlement in the U.S. After that, there’s an initial multistep security clearance, including the collection of the refugee’s personal data and background information. That is followed by an in-person interview abroad with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which has to approve the application. The security clearance involves checking the refugee’s name and fingerprints against several government databases. That’s followed by a medical screening and a pairing with one of the voluntary agencies in the U.S. that sponsors refugees. And, finally, there’s another security clearance to check for any new information. That completes the process.\n\nAccording to the State Department, the total process from the UNHCR referral to finally being admitted into the U.S. takes 18 to 24 months on average.\n\nAnd while it may be the case that some Syrian refugees lack the documentation necessary to identify them, that is not the case for everyone. At an October 2015 Senate subcommittee hearing on refugee resettlement, Barbara Strack, chief of the refugee affairs division of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said that Syrian refugees tend to have “many, many documents.”\n\nTrade Deficit Cherry-Picking\n\nTrump also used a bit of cherry-picking when he said, “Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly — think of this, think of this — our trade deficit is $800 billion … last year alone.”\n\nThe important word here is “goods.” The total trade deficit, counting both goods and services, is smaller.\n\nOfficial figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis show the value of goods that the U.S. imported was $763 billion (not $800 billion) more than the value of goods it exported. However, the U.S. does well when it comes to exporting services, including travel, education and intellectual property such as software. The U.S. imported $262 billion less in services than it exported — creating a positive balance in that column.\n\nOverall, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services was just over $500 billion last year.\n\nAnd another fact Trump didn’t mention — that figure peaked a decade ago. The overall trade deficit reached its high in 2006, and last year’s figure was 34% lower.\n\nAnd as we reported earlier this month, the downward trend is continuing in 2016.\n\nDuring the first five months of this year, the trade deficit has shrunk further, down 3.5% compared with the same period in 2015.\n\nFact check: Donald Trump's false and misleading claims\n\nFact check: Trump ‘recommended’ Ohio for convention?\n\nClinton’s Role in NAFTA\n\nTrump said: “Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country.” Actually, the North American Free Trade Agreement Trump was negotiated and signed by President George H.W. Bush. President Clinton signed the legislation to implement the agreement.\n\nAs we noted when Trump made the same claim last month, Republicans played an important role in the passage of the NAFTA bill. The Senate passed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, 61-38, on Nov. 20, 1993, with 34 Republican votes, and the House passed it three days earlier, 234-200, with 132 Republican votes.\n\nTrump On Libya Regime Change\n\nTrump criticized Clinton for her “failed policy of nation-building and regime change” and he counted Libya among them. Left unsaid was that Trump also supported the military ouster of Moammar Gadhafi at that time.\n\nTrump: \"We must abandon the failed policy of nation-building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, in Egypt, and Syria.\"\n\nBut as Sen. Ted Cruz pointed out at a Republican debate in February, Trump also supported regime change in Libya at the time. Although Trump denied it in the debate, Trump said in 2011 that the U.S. should go into Libya “on a humanitarian basis” and “knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively and save the lives.”\n\nTrump made that comment in a video posted to his YouTube channel in February 2011:\n\nTrump, Feb. 28, 2011: \"I can’t believe what our country is doing. Gadhafi, in Libya, is killing thousands of people. Nobody knows how bad it is and we’re sitting around. We have soldiers all over the Middle East and we’re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage. And that’s what it is, a carnage. … Now we should go in. We should stop this guy which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it and save these lives. This is absolute nuts. We don’t want to get involved and you’re going to end up with something like you’ve never seen before. Now, ultimately the people will appreciate it and they’re going to end up taking over the country eventually. But the people will appreciate it and they should pay us back. But we have to go in to save these lives. These people are being slaughtered like animals. … We should do it on a humanitarian basis. Immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively and save the lives.\"\n\nHousehold Income\n\nTrump used an often-cited but outdated figure when he said, “Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000 — that’s 16 years ago.” Actually, incomes have been rising lately.\n\nTrump was speaking of incomes in 2014. According to the Census Bureau’s annual figures, the median household income in 2014 was $53,657. And in 2000, the “real” income (adjusted for inflation, and stated in 2014 dollars) had been $57,724.\n\nThat indeed is a difference of $4,067. But the notion of a 16-year decline is misleading. What Trump failed to mention is that in 2014, real median household income had already risen by $1,052 since hitting a recession-driven low in 2012.\n\nFurthermore, a lot has happened since 2014. As we’ve often reported, more timely measures show paychecks rising faster than inflation — especially in the past two years. The most recent report on average weekly earnings for all workers in June was 3.1% above the figure for the same month in 2014.\n\nChoosing Your Doctor\n\nTrump used a popular false talking point about the Affordable Care Act when he said that he’d repeal it and “you will be able to choose your own doctor again.” The law didn’t take away the ability to choose a doctor, as we’ve said before.\n\nThe ACA, otherwise known as Obamacare, expanded Medicaid but also expanded private insurance coverage. And as most Americans know — since 55% have private insurance — the insurers usually have a network of doctors to choose from. The ACA didn’t change that.\n\nWe often have heard another version of this claim, asserting that the government was coming between you and your doctor, but, again, the ACA didn’t come close to establishing a government-run system like Britain or Canada have.\n\nRegulation Repeat\n\nTrump repeated an overstatement on the costs of regulation — a claim we heard on the second day of the convention from Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. Trump said that “excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year,” but that figure comes from a conservative group’s admitted “back-of-the-envelope” calculation and is an estimate of regulatory costs that does not include potential savings.\n\nThe calculation comes from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a staunch opponent of government over-regulation. In the report, “Ten Thousand Commandments: An Annual Snapshot of the Federal Regulatory State,” author Clyde Wayne Crews Jr. calculates the 2013 cost of federal regulatory compliance at nearly $1.9 trillion.\n\nThat figure is based on the Office of Management and Budget’s annual reports to Congress on the benefits and costs of federal regulation. The problem is that the Competitive Enterprise report focused on the “costs” and ignored the “benefits” listed in those reports. That tells only half the story.\n\nFor more on this topic, check out our 2015 CPAC article where we examined a similar claim from Rick Perry.\n\nPriebus: Iran’s Frozen Assets\n\nReince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, erroneously claimed that the Iran nuclear deal “lined the pockets of the world’s number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money.” Your money? No.\n\nThe assets unfrozen as part of the deal with Iran were not held by the U.S. government. They were Iranian assets held mostly by financial institutions in countries outside the U.S., and were frozen due to the economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries. So Priebus was wrong to characterize to an American audience that the unfrozen assets were “your money.” It was never the United States’ money, nor were the assets even controlled by the U.S. government.\n\nPriebus’ error mirrors the fundamental misunderstanding that underpinned Trump’s fanciful recounting in recent weeks of how he would have negotiated a tougher nuclear agreement with Iran.\n\nIn one speech, Trump said he would have told Iranian officials that “we don’t have the money” to pay back Iran, because of a “bad budget” and large U.S. debt. “I’m not gonna be able to give you the $150 billion back,” Trump said he would have told Iranian officials. “I can’t do it.” A week later, Trump laid out a similar hypothetical negotiation with Iran, saying the U.S. “should’ve never given [Iran] back the $150 billion,” and that he would have told the country, ” We don’t have it, I’m sorry.” As a result, he said, “We would’ve saved $150 billion.”\n\nAgain, the money was never the United States’ to “give back.” And so keeping those assets frozen would not have “saved” American taxpayers anything.\n\nTrump was more careful with his wording in his convention speech, saying only that the Iran deal “gave back to Iran $150 billion.” The deal did result in Iran gaining access to tens of billions in frozen assets. However, experts told us the $150 billion figure is inflated.\n\nRichard Nephew, a sanctions expert who was on the State Department team negotiating with Iran, told us the “total amount of foreign-held assets was probably something closer to $100 billion.”\n\nNader Habibi, a professor of economics at Brandeis University’s Crown Center for Middle East Studies, told us the amount received by Iran is even lower than that.\n\n“Based on my research the total amount of Iran’s assets that were released as a result of the nuclear agreement were between $25 billion to $50 billion,” said Habibi, who detailed that calculation in an article for The Conversation, a site that publishes articles from academic and research experts.\n\nTakeaways: Wild GOP convention ends with a sense of normality\n\nAnalysis: The Republican convention as reality TV. Not in a good way\n\nClinton and Trump on Debt\n\nPriebus also said that “a Clinton presidency only means more debt.” Yes, but Clinton’s plan would result in a “relatively small” increase in the debt, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. On the other hand, the group found that Trump’s tax and spending plan would cause a “massive increase” in the debt.\n\n“Our national debt is at post-war record-high levels and projected to grow unsustainably,” wrote Marc Goldwein, senior policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “And neither former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton nor businessman Donald Trump would reverse course — Trump, in fact, would make our debt dramatically worse.”\n\nClinton has proposed $1.45 trillion in new spending — mostly on infrastructure, paid leave and education proposals — according to a June 27 report by CRFB called “Promises and Price Tags.” But that new spending is largely offset by $1.2 trillion in new revenue from proposed tax increases for the wealthiest Americans. So, the report concludes, Clinton would increase the debt by $250 million by 2026.\n\nHowever, the group found that Trump’s tax plan would result in $10.5 trillion less in tax revenues, which would be partially offset by $650 billion less in primary spending. Together with $1.7 trillion in higher interest costs, the report concludes that the sum of Trump’s policies would increase the debt by $11.5 trillion over 10 years.\n\nGoldwein noted that the estimates are “subject to uncertainty.” But, he said, “there does not seem to be a plausible path for either candidate to put the debt on a sustainable path without modifying or adding to their plans.” And, he said, neither can get there “simply by growing the economy.”\n\nContributing: Eugene Kiely, Brooks Jackson, Robert Farley, D’Angelo Gore, Zachary Gross, Caroline Wallace, Sydney Schaedel and Jenna Wang.

Pro: more choice for patients\n\nThe NHS is often seen as a one-size-fits-all system by its detractors, while a privatised service might allow patients to better choose where to be treated and what treatment to have.\n\nWriting for the BBC, Thomas Cawston of the think tank Reform said that “poll after poll shows patients value their right to choose which hospital to go to and what treatment they receive”. He said that as competition within the NHS maximises choice for patients, more privatisation would therefore be a good thing.\n\nBut, in The Guardian, Kim Thomas said that provider choice is already “well established” within the NHS, but only has “limited value”. In rural parts of the country, for example, most patients will only want to visit their nearest hospital and it may even be impossible for them to travel anywhere else.\n\nAnd evidence from the US suggests that a fully private system gives choice only to well-off people. In Time magazine, Steven Brill said that the 28 million Americans with no health insurance have “little choice of hospitals [and] no choice of the drugs that they have to buy or the lab tests or CT scans that they have to get”.\n\nHe added: “They are powerless buyers in a seller’s market where the only sure thing is the profit of the sellers.”\n\n2. Con: less transparency\n\nWe Own It, a group that campaigns against the privatisation of public services from the NHS to schools, believes that increasing privatisation within the health service “will open the door to more cronyism with no due process”.\n\nPrivate companies aren’t held to the same standards as public ones and do not need to publish accounts to show how they have spent funds. “Without basic financial transparency from public service contractors we can say goodbye to democratic accountability,” said The Guardian’s Zoe Williams.\n\nCritics of NHS privatisation have used the Covid-19 pandemic as an example of how outsourcing contracts to private firms can lead to a lack of transparency. In a piece for the British Medical Association’s website, the BMA’s deputy chair, David Wrigley, said that the government had chosen to outsource to “scores of private firms” with “minimal oversight, governance or transparency”.\n\nHe added: “There is no ability to scrutinise these deals and taxpayer money is haemorrhaging from the Treasury while a health and care system in desperate need of investment and resource is ignored.”\n\nEvidence from across the pond has suggested that the cost of treatment in US hospitals can often be hard to assess because of a lack of transparency. And American patients – especially the poorest – are kept in the dark, with “no idea what their bills mean”, said Brill.\n\n3. Pro: could reduce waiting times\n\nCurrent NHS waiting lists are “out of control”, said The Guardian in January, with around 7.5 million people waiting for treatment – the highest number since records began in 2007.\n\nThe government is developing various plans to reduce the backlog and increase surgical capacity, with more privatisation thought to be an inevitability. One solution suggested by Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute, a neoliberal think tank, would be to “enable every patient to ‘Go Private’ if the NHS fails to provide service within a reasonable time, paid for out of local health budgets”.\n\nWriting for the business publication City AM, Lesh said that this form of privatisation would “result in greater patient choice, more equitable and better outcomes, and stronger incentives for speedy care in the NHS”.\n\nBut, said Labour MP Stella Creasy in The Guardian, long waiting lists should not be a pretext for privatising the health service. “Lists have been creeping up for years,” she wrote. “Rather than invest in NHS capacity, recent years have seen a conscious decision to divert funding to profit-making private healthcare companies.\n\n“Without more scrutiny, this could see healthcare outcomes shaped not by need but whether you have the money to jump the queue.”\n\n4. Con: the moral argument\n\nBefore his death in March 2018, Professor Stephen Hawking warned that the government was taking the NHS “towards a US-style insurance system, run by… private companies”, and insisted: “We must prevent the establishment of a two-tier service.”\n\nA long-term user of the NHS, having lived with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years, Hawking wrote in The Guardian that the NHS is “the fairest way to deliver healthcare”.\n\nThe moral argument for a public system which delivers free care to everybody, regardless of wealth or status, was once unassailable – and even advocates for increased privatisation still do not question the principle, at least in public.\n\nYet the service was set up “in the face of political opposition”, said Hawking. Public opinion may shift again – particularly when the argument is made that the service is simply too expensive to run now, given an ageing population unforeseen by its founders.\n\n5. Con: public healthcare is more efficient\n\nThis may seem a surprising claim, given that the prevailing wisdom since the Thatcher years has been that state control is inherently inefficient and internal markets bring savings. But in 2017, Hawking told the Royal Society of Medicine that “international comparisons indicate that the most efficient way to provide good healthcare is for services to be publicly funded and publicly run”.\n\nOne of those comparisons is a 2012 study by a US-Bosnian team looking at healthcare systems in several countries, which concluded that systems that “ration their care by government provision or government insurance incur lower per-capita costs”.\n\nThe US, with its privately run insurance-based system, spends more on healthcare per person than any other nation, OECD figures show. However, patients in countries with a government-controlled system such as Germany and Canada have greater trust in its healthcare systems than do Americans, an Ipsos Mori survey of more than 20,000 people globally revealed in 2020.\n\n6. Pro: more seats at the table\n\nOne of the most contentious components of the government’s proposed Health and Care Bill, which is a sweeping legislative overhaul of how the NHS operates in England, is the introduction of Integrated Care Boards (ICBs).\n\nThese ICBs will be “accountable for NHS spend and performance within the system” and will have the power to decide on the type of healthcare that groups in their local area will receive, according to the government.\n\nAlongside NHS bosses, GPs and council public health leaders, private providers of services may qualify to sit on some of these boards – a plan that has concerned some anti-privatisation campaigners. However, said the Nuffield Trust, these meetings “will be held in public and decisions must be transparent”. In addition: “Any conflicts of interest will have to be declared and managed.”\n\n7. Con: continuity of care\n\nPrivate firms will not carry on providing an unprofitable service any longer than they have to. This could lead to a lack of continuity, with some patients finding their health providers change during an illness.\n\nFor this reason, wrote The Guardian’s elderly patient columnist Dick Vinegar (not his real name), “any service, like GPs, where continuity is essential to the patient, should not go to private companies on short contracts”.\n\nContinuity is particularly crucial for elderly patients, said Lara Sonola from the health think tank The King’s Fund. “Good continuity of care inspires trust and confidence,” she wrote. Continuity can be as simple as staff knowing a patient’s name. The NHS is not a paragon of continuity – but few argue increased privatisation would improve it.\n\n8. Pro: a fresh start\n\nIn 2017, a doctor with 20 years’ experience writing in The Spectator said that the NHS had become “a confused hotchpotch of short-term solutions imposed in a haphazard and uncoordinated way on an anachronistic model”. While he stopped short of recommending privatisation, he said that the current system was unsustainable.\n\n“We need to think creatively about how we could fund the NHS,” he wrote. “For example: if people are willing to pay for their healthcare, should they be allowed to do so? Should prescriptions be subsidised for those who can afford them, and should we charge for GP appointments like the Scandinavians do? Might the NHS offer a basic service, with health insurance required for the extras?”\n\nIn Lord Darzi’s independent report examining health and care services on the NHS’s 70th birthday in 2018, he suggested privatisation is neither the problem nor the solution. The vast majority of healthcare provision remains in the public sector, he said, adding that the issue “[paled] in comparison” to other crises.\n\nFour years on, The Spectator’s Isabel Hardman concurred: “Privatisation seems to work as a psychological trick in the British love of the NHS: it is ever-present as a threat to the existence of the health service, to the extent that more pressing problems get ignored.” More urgent, she wrote, are the “gaping vacancies in many disciplines” within the NHS and the lack of workforce planning.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Uk", "Anahi Valenzuela", "The Week Us", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis", "Harriet Marsden", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Richard Windsor", "Rebecca Messina", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/959168/what-is-title-42-the-strict-covid-border-laws-being-expanded-in-the-us", "title": "What is Title 42?

In effect, it will “deny asylum to most migrants who cross illegally”, The Guardian said.\n\nIt has been denounced by migrant rights groups, who say it puts migrants in danger and infringes international law.\n\nWhat is Title 42?\n\nTitle 42 is an “obscure public-health rule” introduced by former president Donald Trump’s administration in March 2020, the early days of the pandemic, based on an order issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIt allowed US border agents to remove, without a hearing, people who crossed the Mexico-US border without authorisation – ostensibly “due to the risk Covid-19 posed”, said The Economist, and send them back to Mexico or their home countries.\n\nThe policy is known as Title 42 for the portion of US code that allowed the CDC to issue it.\n\nAfter winning the 2020 presidential election, Biden pledged to reverse Trump’s restrictive asylum policies. He appeared to be “one of the most liberal Democratic presidents on immigration yet” when he was first elected, said The Washington Post, “ripping up several Trump immigration policies in a frenzied first day”.\n\nBut he allowed Title 42 to remain in place, with exemptions for unaccompanied children. His willingness to extend its use as a border control tool is “a glaring example of his conflicted needs and policy entanglements”, the paper said.\n\nTitle 42 originally applied mainly to migrants from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, but was expanded to Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.\n\nPublic health experts, human rights campaigners and some Democrats argued that the rule unlawfully prevented migrants from seeking asylum and exposed them to dangers in Mexico, including kidnapping and assault.\n\nAuthorities have used the policy to expel migrants at the US-Mexico border more than 2.8 million times, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nSince Biden took office, more than 13,000 incidents of kidnapping, torture, rape or other violent attacks on people blocked or expelled to Mexico under Title 42 have been identified by Human Rights First.\n\nWhy is it ending?\n\nIn April 2022, the CDC announced that it would “terminate” Title 42, because the public health order was no longer necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\n\nTitle 42’s end, however, was “repeatedly delayed by legal wrangling as Republican-led states sought to keep the policy in place”, said BBC News.\n\nBut with the government declaring an end to the public health emergency and federally mandated Covid regulations, which was the legal underpinning for Title 42’s border restrictions, “officials say the time is finally up”.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nPeople are already on the move across the Americas “in record numbers” as countries in the South and Central American region experience political and economic crises, said the Financial Times.\n\nMore than 8,700 migrants were detained each day between Saturday and Monday, US Border Patrol chief Raul Ortiz said on Twitter, far higher than the average of last year, 7,500, which was a record. “Even more people are expected to attempt the fraught journey after [Title 42] has passed,” said the FT.\n\nThe Biden administration is “surging personnel and funds to the border”, said The Guardian, sending 1,500 active-duty troops to the area.\n\nThe US administration is also depending on its counterparts in Mexico, “an important ally” in the effor to control the flow of migrants, said the Financial Times. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has deployed his country’s military and National Guard to the border.\n\nOfficials expect a spike in migration as “many migrants who were sent back to Mexico under the policy are desperate and losing patience”, said CNN. Without Title 42, US immigration authorities “will return to decades-old protocols at a time of unprecedented mass migration in the Western hemisphere”. Both Democrat and Republican politicians have “expressed scepticism that the administration truly is prepared to handle the crisis”.\n\nImmigration policy is likely to play “an important role in the 2024 presidential race”, said the BBC, with many Americans “expressing concern about the border”.\n\nA Reuters / Ipsos poll this week showed that Biden’s public approval was at 40% in recent days, close to the lowest level of his presidency, with only 26% approving of how he is handling immigration. Biden has said the border will probably be “chaotic for a while”.\n\nTrump, who is running for the Republican nomination in the 2024 election, has called Title 42 one of his “most successful policies”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Becca Stanek", "Peter Weber", "Joel Mathis", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/01/22/cuba-havana-us-talks/22170631/", "title": "U.S.-Cuba talks cordial, but more talks needed", "text": "Rick Jervis\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nHAVANA — The second day of talks between the highest level U.S. and Cuban officials in nearly four decades concluded Thursday on a cordial but cautious note: Each side praised the openness but stressed the differences between both countries.\n\n\"We have to overcome more than 50 years of a relationship that was not based on confidence or trust,\" said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson, who leads the U.S. delegation. \"There are things we have to discuss before we can establish that relationship.\"\n\nBoth countries set an agenda for re-establishing full diplomatic ties, but said it could take weeks just to schedule the next round of talks, a sign of the long road ahead.\n\nThorny subjects such as Cuba´s human rights records and the jailing of political prisoners were part of the day's meetings and are topics U.S. officials will continue to press, Jacobson said. Both sides agreed the new relationship should be based on the Vienna Convention and discussed the legal steps needed to open embassies in Washington and Havana, as well as what freedoms the diplomats in both countries will enjoy.\n\nThe meetings, which took place in the Palacio de Convenciones, a vast 1970s-era convention center in the Cubanacan neighborhood of northwest Havana, are the first involving a high-ranking U.S. official in Havana in 38 years and lay the foundation for a new chapter of diplomatic relations between the two countries.\n\nThey are the first meetings since President Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced last month that the two countries would re-establish diplomatic ties and the U.S. would ease restrictions on trade and travel to the island.\n\nThe Cuban delegation, led by Josefina Vida, head of the Foreign Ministry´s North American affairs division, said removing Cuba from the State Department's list of countries that sponsor terrorism and lifting the economic embargo were important steps to fully normalizing relations.\n\n\"It was a first meeting. This is a process,\" Vidal said. The U.S. and Cuba will schedule a second round of talks in the next few weeks, she said.\n\nVidal earlier said she stressed that financial barriers placed on the Cuban Interests Section in Washington need to be lifted.\n\n\"Despite the profound differences that exist between our two governments, we should learn to co-exist with them in a peaceful and civilized way,\" Vidal said.\n\nThe need for at least one future round of talks could set back U.S. hopes of reopening the embassies before April's Summit of the Americas, which Obama and Castro are expected to attend.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/11/24/iran-deal-middle-east-fears/3691673/", "title": "Nuke deal leaves Iranian capability, Arab fears intact", "text": "Oren Dorell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSome see it as the %22beginning of the end%22 of Itan%27s nuclear weapons program\n\nOthers say U.S. is abandoning its role as protector in the Middle East\n\nSome critics foresee a nuclear arms race in the region\n\nWhether Iran complies with its promises or not, the deal reached by world powers over its nuclear program will alter the Middle East dramatically, observers and analysts say.\n\n\"I am afraid Iran will give up something to get something else from the big powers in terms of regional politics — and I'm worrying about giving Iran more space or a freer hand in the region,\" Abdullah al-Askar, chairman of Saudi Arabia's appointed Shoura Council, a quasi-parliament that advises the government on policy, told the Daily Star in Lebanon. \"The government of Iran, month after month, has proven that it has an ugly agenda in the region, and in this regard no one in the region will sleep and assume things are going smoothly.\"\n\nWestern governments and the allies of Iran praised the deal as walking the world back from a possible military confrontation with the Islamic republic over its decades-long nuclear program suspected of trying to build an atomic bomb.\n\nThere was silence, however, from the capitals of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Egypt and Jordan — Arab countries whose rulers belong to the Sunni Muslim sect.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was blunt on his opinion. \"What was reached in Geneva is not a historic agreement, it is a historic mistake,\" Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday.\n\nPresident Obama called Netanyahu later Sunday to underscore \"that the United States will remain firm in our commitment to Israel, which has good reason to be skeptical about Iran's intentions,\" according to a White House statement.\n\nLess than a day after the deal was made in Geneva on Sunday, there were differences over the two sides' understanding of the deal.\n\nIran President Hassan Rouhani crowed Sunday that the deal recognizes Tehran's \"right\" to enrich uranium; Secretary of State John Kerry said it does not. Members of Congress on Sunday — such as Robert Menendez, D-N.J. who had been pushing to strengthen economic sanction against Iran over its program — said they would hold off for now to see how things go.\n\nFEARS OF U.S. RETREAT\n\nCritics say the six-month deal does not freeze or force a rollback of Iran's production of nuclear fuel, as several United Nations Security Council resolutions have demanded, such as when the council called for suspension of all enrichment. Iran can continue to enrich uranium, a process that can make material for an atomic bomb.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry told reporters this is the first stage. The next stage \"will also be even more consequential,\" Kerry said.\n\nIran agreed to put a cap on its nuclear program and give international inspectors greater access to currently inspected and new sites. Iran also agreed to stop producing medium-enriched uranium, which represents 90% of the effort required to produce weapons-grade material, and to dilute or convert that stockpile to a different form that is harder to process to fuel a bomb.\n\nIn return, the West agreed to provide Iran about $7 billion in relief on sanctions on oil and banking that were meant to get Iran to suspend production of nuclear material until international inspectors could ascertain the program has peaceful aims, as Iran claims.\n\nThe deal \"looks clearly like the beginning of the end of the Iranian nuclear weapons program,\" said Thomas Pickering, a U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George H.W. Bush, and undersecretary of State under President Clinton. \"What you see in this first agreement is a clear effort to make it harder for Iran to break out\" and quickly produce enough uranium for a bomb.\n\nOther Middle East analysts say that despite the U.S. role in the talks in Geneva that led to the deal, there is concern across the Middle East that the most worrying result is that it looks as if the United States is retreating from its traditional role as the guarantor of security in the region.\n\nThey say leaving Iran a threshold nuclear nation that can race across the weapons line in a matter of weeks or months means Israel and the Sunni nations must look more to each other to defend against Iran.\n\n\"Obama has now announced that the United States cannot be relied upon to stand up to Iran,\" says Michael Doran, who served as a Middle East adviser to President George W. Bush. \"Therefore, Israel and our Arab allies will be forced to live by their wits.\"\n\nCountries across the Middle East are now more likely to invest in nuclear programs of their own, form new alliances and reorient their policies to accommodate Iranian rather than American interests, Doran and other analysts say.\n\nAnd Iranian aims in the region are not limited to having a nuclear program it insists is for peaceful purposes even as its ruling unelected mullahs call openly for the elimination of the \"rabid-dog\" Zionists of Israel.\n\n\"Iran's bottom line is that it will trade its nuclear capability with the recognition of its hegemony over the region, which is what has just happened. Saudi-Iranian tensions and (tensions in) the broader Gulf region will increase,\" said Nadim Shehadeh of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a Middle East research think tank in London.\n\nMarwan Bishara, senior political analyst at Al Jazeera, which is owned by the government of the Persian Gulf state of Qatar, said the Saudis are most alarmed by the potential U.S.-Iran detente and the rise of an unrestrained Iran on the Middle East stage.\n\n\"Further Saudi-Iranian antagonism will lead to major sectarian escalation with incalculable price for the region,\" he said.\n\nIran arms Hezbollah, a powerful militant group along Israel's northern border in southern Lebanon that has fought wars with Israel. Both Iran and Hezbollah are sending fighters to Syria to save Iran ally Bashar Assad from Sunni Muslims who have risen against his dictatorship. Hezbollah has thousands of missiles from Iran, according to the United States.\n\nIran also has been caught sending sophisticated weaponry to Hamas, the Palestinian terrorist group that controls Gaza Strip and has fired thousands of rockets at Israel. Egypt has accused Iran of supporting the militancy of the Muslim Brotherhood within its borders. And Gulf States such as Bahrain say it is promoting uprisings among their Shiite populations.\n\n\"Iran is not a threat only to Israel; it is a threat to the whole world and especially to the Middle East,\" says Prof. Avraham Diskin, a political scientist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\n\n\"Iran is a Shiite country and very much interested in dominating the area while most of the region is dominated by Sunni regimes that are relatively open to the West,\" although not progressive toward human rights.\n\n\"These regimes feel threatened and, like Israel, have a very strong interest in blocking Iran's potential nuclear military capabilities,\" he said.\n\nAnd if they can't block it, Iran's Arab neighbors in the Gulf and Egypt \"may not sit and wait\" to see if Iran abides by the agreement during the next six months, he said.\n\nJordan, Israel and the Sunni monarchies in the Persian Gulf see the deal as the world letting Iran continue its nuclear work while pursuing its ambition of becoming the region's dominant power, says Danielle Pletka, a Middle East analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\"The Saudis, Kuwaitis, emiratis, Jordanians all are looking at the United States, which has been their security umbrella, and they have a dawning understanding like the Israelis that America no longer has their back,\" Pletka said.\n\nThe Saudis have said they will seek nuclear capability for themselves, and \"it's not ridiculous to assume\" there may be a domino effect across the region of countries seeking nuclear weapons, she said. \"I think that applies for Turkey as well.\"\n\nBut Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said such worries are overblown.\n\n\"The agreement reflects the Iranian desire to change their relationship with the rest of the world, and that desire makes the Middle East safer,\" Alterman said.\n\nSaudi King Abdullah has invited Rouhani to Saudi Arabia for the annual hajj pilgrimage. \"You can foresee an effort to bring them closer.\"\n\nThere are signs that the United States is pulling back from the Middle East. Obama did an about-turn on military action against Syria even though he said a strike was necessary after Syrian forces crossed Obama's \"red line\" by using chemical weapons. He has welcomed a major role for Russia in negotiations in the Middle East.\n\nObama has cooled the once-strong relationship that the United States had with Egypt, the most populous Arab state in the Middle East, over the Egyptian military's ousting of an elected Muslim Brotherhood government. Obama canceled aid and joint military exercises with Egypt, which has openly rejected U.S. demands for quick elections, despite shared interests in fighting terrorism and maintaining Egypt's peace with Israel.\n\nHowever, the United States maintains strong relations with Israel and Gulf Arab states: The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet is based in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia earlier this year inked a $60 billion deal for high-tech U.S. weaponry.\n\nMIXED RECORD ON NUCLEAR DIPLOMACY\n\nAaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle East peace negotiator and adviser to Republican and Democratic secretaries of State, says \"it's way too early\" to say the agreement will transform power relationships in the region.\n\nIt has brought comparisons, however, to one of the singular achievements, and failures, of U.S. nuclear diplomacy.\n\nThe administration of George W. Bush persuaded Libya to eliminate its nuclear program entirely in the aftermath of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Libya surrendered all of its nuclear weapons equipment to international inspectors, and 500 tons worth of centrifuges for uranium enrichment and other technology was shipped to the U.S. nuclear weapons plant at Oak Ridge, Tenn., for destruction.\n\nBut in trying to end North Korea's nuclear program in 2008, Bush inked a deal similar to Obama's in Iran that depended on the North Koreans to allow greater inspections, suspend some uranium enrichment and cease work on a plutonium plant.\n\nBush removed North Korea from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism in return for its agreement. Just a few months later, North Korea surprised the world when it tested its second nuclear device, in violation of the pact. In February 2013, it exploded a third one.\n\nContributing: Michele Chabin in Jerusalem, Mona Alami in Beirut and Jabeen Bhatti in Berlin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/05/iran-foreign-minister-interview-us-nuclear-deal-mohammad-javad-zarif-trump-administration/1892350002/", "title": "Read transcript of USA TODAY interview with Iranian Foreign ...", "text": "Editor, USA TODAY\n\nA transcript of USA TODAY’s interview with Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. USA TODAY foreign correspondent Kim Hjelmgaard interviewed Zarif in Antalya, a resort town on Turkey’s southwestern Mediterranean coast, where he was attending an economic conference. The transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nUSA TODAY: President Donald Trump’s administration is re-imposing all the crushing economic penalties that were lifted by the Obama administration as part of the 2015 nuclear deal. Is Iran ready for this?\n\nZARIF: Well, the question is, is the international community ready for it because the current U.S. administration is essentially asking all members of the international community to violate international law. The U.S. is not, itself, only violating, it’s asking others to violate, too, because you know when we agreed [to] the nuclear deal it was enshrined in a United Nations Security Council resolution. And the Security Council resolution, which was actually not only voted for by the United States, but sponsored by the United States, by the previous administration. The U.S. government called on all countries to help implement the resolution and not to do anything that would prevent its implementation.\n\nNow the United States, itself, is preventing the deal’s implementation and asking other countries not to engage in economic transactions with us, which means preventing the implementation of the resolution, because the objective of the resolution was to normalize Iran’s business relations with the rest of the world. So the United States is, in fact, punishing people and countries for observing international law and rewarding them for violating international law. Iran is used to U.S. sanctions. We’ve had them for almost 39 years. We haven’t had an easy history with the United States, but it did not start on November 4, 1979, [with the Iran hostage crisis]. It started long before that in 1953 [with a CIA -orchestrated plot that removed Iran’s democratically elected prime minister]. Nevertheless, we are used to measures that were never legal, but this time they are exceptionally illegal.\n\nIran has 7,000 years of history. We’ve lived through more difficult times. For eight years [the Iran-Iraq War], we lived through a war that was imposed on Iran and everybody supported the aggressor, [Iraq’s] Saddam Hussein. The United States supported it, the Soviet Union supported him, the Europeans supported him. The Soviets gave him MiG [jet] fighters, the French gave him Mirage [jet] fighters, the Brits gave him Chieftain tanks, the American gave him AWACS reconnaissance, the Germans gave him chemical weapons, the Saudis gave him $70 billion worth of assistance.\n\nEverybody pitched in, Iran survived, and now, as at that time, we were isolated.\n\nBut the United States is isolated, too. You heard, yesterday [Nov. 2], the Europeans again made a statement against the sanctions. Whether the private businesses will go along, it’s a different story, but the international communities [are] standing against these sanctions.\n\nUSA TODAY: Iranians may not be panicking [because of the sanctions]. They are not desperate [or on the verge of revolution, as sometimes characterized by the Trump administration]. But they are weary. And they are having trouble buying some [essential goods]. What do you say to average Iranians who are caught in the middle who just want to get on with living their lives?\n\nZARIF: They have every right to. On the essential goods, I disagree. The government is providing subsidies so that the necessities for peoples’ lives will be provided at the previous prices , but nobody claims economic sanctions don’t hurt. Economic sanctions always hurt, but they don’t achieve the policy objectives they intend to achieve. Sometimes, they achieve exactly the opposite.\n\nWhat I would say to the average Iranian is that for us, talking to the United States was a taboo. We broke that taboo, we spoke to the United States, we had the longest negotiations with the United States. We reached an agreement with the United States, not a two-page agreement, but a 150-page agreement. And the United States decided to walk away from it. It wasn’t our fault that the United States is not a reliable negotiating partner. It’s a problem that the international community is facing. And the U.S. has not just walked away from the Iran deal: It walked away from the Paris climate-change deal [in June 2017]. It walked away from an arms-control agreement with Russia [the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, or INF, in October]. It walked away from NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement, re-branded as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, in September]. It walked away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership [a 12-nation trade deal, in January 2017]. It walked away from UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, in October 2017). It walked away from the Human Rights Council [a UN body, in June.] Basically, there are rare exceptions where it hasn’t walked away.\n\nSo this is the type of U.S. administration that we're dealing with and I'm sure the Iranian community, the Iranian population, while I understand that they are unhappy with the situation right now, can also understand that it's not the fault of the government, but it is because we have a rogue regime in Washington that doesn't live by any principle of international law.\n\nUSA TODAY: The Europeans have been insisting for months the nuclear deal can exist without U.S. participation. They’ve come up with a concept called a “special purpose vehicle.” This is a financial mechanism that somehow is going to ensure that trade between Europe and Iran carry on. Is this ultimately doomed to failure? After all, Washington is looking at this closely and saying whatever the Europeans come up with, we’re not going to allow the sanctions to be avoided.\n\nZARIF: Here's the problem: The United States is exercising its economic power beyond the normal acceptable limits. Whenever you do that, you risk backlash. Now, this backlash is starting. It doesn’t mean that [the special purpose vehicle] will succeed. There’s no guarantee that it will, but it’s a seed of a new international monetary system. In spite of the U.S.’s overwhelming influence on the current international monetary system, people are fed up with the United States telling them what to do and what not to do. Simply fed up, and now you see between many countries, we’re in Turkey right now, Turkey has financial arrangements with many countries, with us, Russia, with China, with Ukraine, with other countries in order to use our own currencies. We have that arrangement with many [nations].\n\nThe more the United States puts pressure on various countries, the so-called weaponization of U.S. economy or weaponization of the U.S. dollar, the more it does that, the more people around the world will take measures to avoid it. The special purpose vehicle is one measure specifically designed as the first step to deal with Iran’s situation, but it’s ultimate objective, as we’ve heard from the Europeans, is not simply to insulate trade between Iran and Europe, or between Iran and its third-party partners, but in fact [for Europe] to insulate themselves from the pressure it faces from the United States.\n\nSo that's the seed of a new international reality, which may not bear fruit soon enough to address our concern, but it will be the beginning of a new phase of international economic relations.\n\nUSA TODAY: The United States is issuing oil waivers to eight countries. Are there other back channels and ways that Iran can continue to sell oil despite the sanctions?\n\nZARIF: Trump and his administration said they would bring Iranian oil exports to zero [because of the sanctions]. We said that was a dream that will never come true. … We have seen we were right. They were bluffing about this attempt to prevent Iran from selling oil. They know what the impact on the international economy would be and they’ll never be able to do it, period. We have always had various ways of selling our oil and we will continue to have ways of selling our oil, and the United States will continue to fail to implement that policy.\n\nBut what the United States is promoting ... because when you do this, you promote corruption, you promote lack of transparency. People, countries, will continue to trade. What the United States is doing is preventing transparency, preventing open trade. If we cannot openly trade our commodities, if we cannot get what we want to get from open, transparent international transactions, we will not lie down and wait to die. We will do it. We will do it through whatever means that is necessary.\n\nUSA TODAY: The U.S. midterm elections: What is the best outcome for Iran? Is it as simple as Democratic gains are good for Iran because they could conceivably provide a check on Trump’s agenda?\n\nZARIF: In one sentence, we’re not pinning any hopes on [the midterm elections] or 2020. What distinguishes Iran from some U.S. clients in the region is we have survived not only in spite of the U.S. but against U.S. … Iran has been through Democratic and Republican administrations in the past. … All of them hostile. … We rely on ourselves.\n\nUSA TODAY: Trump has said he’s willing to hold talks with President Hassan Rouhani, without pre-conditions. Your government up until this point has made it quite clear that you’re not interested in doing that. Why? Isn’t it always more fruitful to have diplomacy, to have talks rather than to retreat from diplomacy?\n\nZARIF: It is always useful to have diplomacy. And we’re not just saying it, we exercise it. I sat down with [former Secretary of State John] Kerry after basically 37 years of no talks between Iran and United States at any level. And we did it at the highest diplomatic level. And then we spent two years, day and night, negotiating in one way or the other together, and we achieved positive results. We thought that that would show the value of diplomacy; that you cannot gain through any other means. But this administration does not believe in diplomacy. This administration believes in imposition.\n\nFor negotiations to succeed, for any negotiation to succeed, you do not need mutual trust. Because when you sit with an adversary or even a friend in international relations, you cannot simply trust; otherwise you don't need to negotiate with them. You will just tell them that I'll do this and that, you'll do this, and that will be end of the story. But you sit down, you write things on the paper, you sign them, or you have them adopted by the [UN] Security Council because you do not trust each other.\n\nBut while mutual trust is not a requirement to start negotiations, mutual respect is a requirement. And mutual respect starts with respecting yourself, respecting your signature, respecting your own word. You cannot say that two years down the road there is another administration, which might not respect the agreement of this administration. You cannot say that in a year-and-a-half, in two years, in three years, we will have a different administration. … And the fact of the matter is, usually in democracies, administrations that succeed each other are not friendly to the previous administration.\n\nFor somebody to simply say: ‘I don’t like it. I want to walk away from it because I believe I am powerful enough to do it. What is the guarantee that they won’t do it again with the next agreement? [Trump] says it’s because it wasn’t ratified by Congress, that it was a personal agreement between President Obama and the Iranian government. I’ll tell them that first of all it is included in the Security Council resolution. And the Security Council is not … although President Trump may consider that chamber as a room in the White House as he tried to do [in September, at the United Nations’ General Assembly in New York], but it’s not. It’s an official organ of the United Nations. Even putting [a] Security Council resolution aside. The United States just walked out of a treaty ratified by the Senate: The 1955 treaty between Iran and the U.S. on which the International Court of Justice ordered the United States to stop some of the sanctions. The U.S. simply walked out of it because it didn’t like the order of the court.\n\nUSA TODAY: If there was a different U.S. administration would Iran consider discussing for a new nuclear deal? Would Iran at least consider having exploratory discussions with the Trump administration?\n\nZARIF: We were in the same room, myself and [former] Secretary of State [Rex] Tillerson were in the same room and we did talk. But everybody else did too and everybody told him the JCPOA [the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, known commonly as the Iran nuclear deal] is a reasonable document, that this nuclear deal is a reasonable document. And three of the countries that were sitting around the table were the closest allies of the United States and have been for the past 70 years or so. And they told him: ‘This is the best deal you can get.’ And he simply said: ‘I represent the president, who doesn’t think so. So going into a room and sitting down with a representative of this administration to explore what? And I’m not saying that we can’t negotiate with this administration, so we will negotiate with the next administration. There has to be the foundations for a fruitful dialogue, it doesn't have to be the next administration. It has to be a new approach, a different approach. I mean, we never negotiated in a positive atmosphere. Actually, Iran and the United States have a lot of differences. So we negotiated in an atmosphere of difference, of difference of view, of difference of interest, of difference of perspective. But we did reach an agreement on the topic that we were focusing on.\n\nUSA TODAY: Is there any contact between your administration and the Trump administration?\n\nZARIF: No.\n\nUSA TODAY: For the forseeable future?\n\nZARIF: I can see some discussion on the humanitarian issues of prisoners in the foreseeable future. But for the time being that would be limited to that.\n\nUSA TODAY: Saudi Arabia. Does Iran feel somewhat vindicated for its view of Saudi Arabia given happened with the killing of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi? Given indications that he was murdered either directly or indirectly with involvement from the Saudi state?\n\nZARIF: Unfortunately, a person has been murdered in a very brutal way. … Who provided $70 billion to Saddam Hussein? Who created the Taliban?Whose citizens were involved in the September 11 attacks? Who supported the Islamic State group in Syria? Who is bombing Yemeni civilians? Who abducted [Lebanon’s prime minister] and kept him in captivity for three weeks? … I mean, look at these realities. The United States has been not only making the wrong choice but the West in general has been sending the wrong signal. Basically, literally, telling the Saudi royal family that you can get away with murder, and they really believed it and they thought they could get away with murder, because unfortunately, they have been getting away with murder in Yemen.\n\nUSA TODAY: Iran blames the U.S. for exasperating all sorts of issues across the Middle East region. If you flip that over, the U.S. says that Iran is spending billions of dollars to fund global terrorism and its nuclear program and is generally sowing discord and confusion around the Middle East. Do you accept that Iran is complicit in some of these various theaters around the region? Because it seems like you have two countries that are accusing each other of the acting badly in the region in similar ways.\n\nZARIF: We don't need to accuse each other because look at the facts. Who was behind Al-Qaeda? Who created Al-Qaeda? Tell me who. Was it Iran or was it the U.S. in order to fight the Soviets? Who supported Saddam Hussein? Was it Iran? When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, who had been supporting him for the last for the preceding eight years? Who supported the referendum in Kurdistan? . … Who is instigating ethnic problems inside Syria by allowing Kurds to take over Arab land just as foot soldiers for the United States, for the U.S. to have a foothold in the region? Who is supporting the war in Yemen, the killing of innocent people? Are we bombing innocent people in Yemen?\n\nThe fact of the matter is, put allegations aside, the fact of the matter is Saudi aircraft, most of which are American built, are dropping bombs on school buses [in Yemen]. Now, you do that to anybody and they defend themselves. People, I mean, Yemenis have fought with well-equipped armies with stones long before the [1979] Iranian revolution, and they defeated them. Unfortunately, Saudi Arabia did not read history. They thought they could defeat the Yemenis in three weeks. We offered to the United States, I offered to [former U.S. Secretary of State] John Kerry the possibility of a ceasefire as soon as it started. The Saudi’s rejected it and said that we can win militarily in three weeks time, just as they thought they could win militarily in Syria in three weeks time. Now it’s seven years in Syria, almost four years in Yemen. The bloodshed continues. … Now, in Syria, who is behind the Astana Process [plan to resolve Syria’s civil war]? Who is trying to bring the hostilities to an end? If anything, the United States is trying to prevent that. It is Iran, Russia, and Turkey working together against the U.S. and its allies. So just look at the realities. I’m not making accusations. I’m not calling this group a terrorist or the other group. I’m simply using the available information based on [UN] Security Council resolutions. I don’t sit in the Security Council. The Security Council, where the United States is a permanent member, considers [the Islamic State group], the Taliban, the Al Nusrah Front and Al-Qaeda to be [non-state] terrorist organizations. The rest are national designations. These four organizations are those who are considered globally, there is consensus about that. And the United States or its allies had either created them, financed them, armed them, continue to support them.\n\nUSA TODAY: Do you accept that your government finances terrorist groups in Syria, groups in Lebanon?\n\nZARIF: We are in Syria on the invitation of the Syrian government fighting terrorists who are on the United Nations list of terrorists, not on a self-serving U.S. list of terrorists. We are in Syria for the same reason we were in Iraqi Kurdistan. We went to Iraqi Kurdistan to help them defeat ISIS. We’ve been consistent. Those we support in Lebanon are a part of the Lebanese government. We actually support the Lebanese government. We don’t imprison the prime minister of Lebanon. The United States, instead of making all these self-serving allegations which are not self-serving really because they hurt U.S. interests, instead of making these allegations which serve only a few clients, Israel and Saudi Arabia, the United States should look at the reality. Who's bombing Yemen? Who's imprisoning another country's prime minister? Who is helping the Islamic State group? Who is helping Al Nusrah Front? Whose arms are in the hands of the Islamic State group? You've seen the reports that ISIS was using American arms provided by Saudi Arabia. These are the realities. These are not my allegations. These are realities. These groups are UN-designated groups, not US-designated groups. There is a difference, because the United States designates whoever it doesn't like as a terrorist. Let me tell you an example. It may be a historical example: In 1984, the United States removed Saddam Hussein as a state sponsor of terrorism. In the same year ,it put Iran on the list. You know why? Because the United States at that time wanted to go and support Saddam Hussein in the war against Iran. Don’t expect me to consider the United States’ list of terrorism designations to have any credibility if it removes Saddam Hussein from the list and puts Iran on the list.\n\nUSA TODAY: The Danish security services said they foiled a recent planned attack by an exiled Iranian dissident group. That came after a similar allegation in France. That followed another one in Finland. Iran disputes these allegations and claims they are politically motivated to put distance between Europe and Iran as they have tried to forge ahead with the nuclear deal without Washington. Why would France and Denmark do this? They have been very supportive of the nuclear deal.\n\nZARIF: We live in a world where complicated intelligence operations are the order of the day. What makes us different from those who make the allegations is that we've offered ... I spoke to the Danish foreign minister last night, and I offered to him that we are prepared to conduct a joint investigation, that we are prepared to send a high-level intelligence officer. Now, we're talking about facts and we're talking about allegations. Let's look at the facts first. France houses, provides safe haven to an organization that was on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations until 2012, and on the EU list of terrorist organizations until about the same time, MEK. Denmark provides safe haven and support to an organization and people who went on international television financed by Saudi Arabia operating out of London called Iran International claiming, not condoning, claiming responsibility for an operation that was conducted in Iran, an operation that the government of Denmark itself condemned as a terrorist operation.\n\n\n\nThese are facts on the ground. This gentleman in the Danish allegation is not an obscure face. It’s not an alleged situation. This gentleman in person went on TV live, claimed responsibility for an operation that the government of Denmark considers and condemned as a terrorist operation. You have an organization in Paris that has been on the list of U.S. as well as Europe as a terrorist organization. These are facts. Now you have allegations. You have allegations that somebody connected with Iran tried to assassinate this person. Somebody connected with Iran tried to put explosives in that meeting that they had in Paris. These are allegations. Those are facts. If anybody should provide the explanation, it would be France and Denmark. Why are they giving refuge, safe haven to known terrorists? Why are they not prosecuting them? What we have done is we have officially asked both France and the United States to prosecute these people. We have asked the United Kingdom to look at the fact that there is a television station that is financed by Saudi Arabia that broadcasts live terrorist claims and applauds it. These are facts. The way we have approached these facts is through the legal means of telling them that you need to deal with it. Now, you have allegations. Just look at the chronology. On the day that our president arrives in Switzerland, Mossad [Israel’s intelligence service] helps France and Belgium to foil that plot of a bomb attack against MEK. On the day Europe was supposed to announce the establishment of SPV [a financial mechanism intended to keep the nuclear deal alive between Iran and Europe], Denmark makes the announcement with the help of Mossad that they have arrested this person. What we do is we ask both of them let's look at this together. Let's investigate. Now, France has been forthcoming and that is why we are discussing this with France. I hope that Denmark will be forthcoming, because I offered this to the foreign minister of Denmark last night, and I hope that he will accept it. I hope that they will listen to serious intelligence, not to politically motivated intelligence.\n\nUSA TODAY: A lot of Americans may find it hard to accept that Iran’s government is anything but a bad actor, whether that’s regionally, whether that's on the world stage, or whether that's acting against your own people in terms of human rights abuses. What evidence can you point to proves that Iran is simply a normal country trying to look after its own interests, just like every other country?\n\nZARIF: I would ask them just to look at the facts. Why are we being blamed for situations where it’s U.S. allies that are responsible? That’s a fact. In our region, there is a great deal of suspicion about the United States. Anywhere you go you see that suspicion about U.S. interests, about U.S. intentions, objectives. I don't know how much of it is well-founded. I know that the perceptions about Iran in the United States are based on past experience, mostly the hostage crisis. That is taken also out of context of how the Iranians at that time perceived U.S. intentions in the context of what had happened in 1953 and in the coup d'état against the democratically elected government in Iran. One way to deal with that, one way to deal with that historical baggage that we all had was to start a new phase. I had hoped that the nuclear deal could prove that another type of interaction would be possible.\n\nWe had dealt with a difficult issue. Seemingly an issue that could not have been resolved diplomatically. Everybody was analyzing when this was would start between Iran and the United States. We reached a very good deal [the 2015 nuclear deal]. A very good deal that does not address all my concerns, doesn’t address all American concerns. That’s why it’s a good deal. If it addressed all my concerns, it would have been submission by the United States. Had it addressed all the U.S. concerns, it would have been submission by Iran. That's why it's not submission, it's a deal. I think and I thought that we could create a different example, to put aside the past. This administration proved that was not possible.\n\nUSA TODAY: Is there any way beyond this impasse between Iran and the United States?\n\nZARIF: We need a different approach. We don't need an administration that has a different approach. I believe human beings are able to change. This administration can have a different approach.\n\nUSA TODAY: Is Iran willing to essentially wait out the Trump administration to get a new nuclear deal?\n\nZARIF: We are willing to wait out this approach. The Trump administration can change its approach. We don't interfere in the domestic politics of the U.S. It's up to the Americans to decide who they want to have to elect as their leader. We want to see a different approach. We don't care who is behind that approach.\n\nUSA TODAY: Let’s say there’s a different president, is Iran willing to talk?\n\nZARIF: If there is a different approach.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/05"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/955111/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-10-december-2021", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 10 December 2021 | The Week", "text": "1. Tories and PM face poll slump\n\nThe Conservative Party has fallen to its worst poll rating in 11 months as the prime minister faces criticism over Christmas parties held at No. 10 during last year’s lockdown and the introduction of new Covid rules. A YouGov poll for The Times found that Labour held a four-point lead, its biggest since January when the country was in the middle of the winter lockdown. More than two-thirds of voters are also now questioning Johnson’s integrity over his response to a Downing Street Christmas party held last year.\n\nThree big problems for Boris Johnson after leaked Christmas party video\n\n2. Dozens die in Mexico accident\n\nAt least 53 people are dead and dozens more injured after a truck carrying people, believed to be migrants destined for the US, crashed in southern Mexico. The truck overturned as it hit a bend in the city of Tuxtla Gutierrez. “The trailer couldn't handle the weight of people,” a witness said. “It took a bend, and because of the weight of us people inside, we all went with it.” The BBC said it was “one of the worst accidents of its kind in Mexico”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Johnson ‘could be suspended from Commons’\n\nBoris Johnson could be suspended from the House of Commons after he was accused of misleading his own ethics adviser. An official report suggested the PM gave differing accounts to investigators looking into the redecoration of his Downing Street flat. The Telegraph said the adviser, Lord Geidt, was “on the brink of quitting” following accusations that the PM misled him over the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat.\n\nThe Downing Street refurbishment claims explained\n\n4. Brexit fish wars reignited\n\nBritish government sources warned that France will not get all the 104 remaining licences it has demanded in the Brexit fish wars. Britain requires French fishermen to prove that they have fished four days out of 1,460 over 2012 to 2016 to qualify for a licence to fish UK waters but more than 100 boats have been unable to meet this term. Paris is threatening port blockades and litigation unless there is a “significant” gesture in granting the permits.\n\nThe war plan for post-Brexit fish fight with France\n\n5. PM’s press chief ‘attended party’\n\nBoris Johnson’s press chief addressed staff and gave out awards at a Downing Street party last Christmas that is now under investigation. ITV reported that Jack Doyle addressed up to 50 people who were in attendance at the alleged party, which was held during lockdown restrictions. The BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said Doyle, is “in charge of the government's messaging” and “this week the message has misfired, which makes his confirmed attendance a very big problem”.\n\nDominic Cummings gatecrashes Downing Street Christmas party row\n\n6. Sun ‘forced pregnant Miller into decisions’\n\nSienna Miller said The Sun forced her to make decisions “about my own body that I have to live with every single day” after the tabloid found out she was pregnant. The actress said the then editor, Rebekah Brooks, phoned her agent in 2005 to discuss the pregnancy before the actor had discussed it with close friends and family. Miller said Brooks “knew about my pregnancy in the most vulnerable moment of my life”. She was speaking after accepting a substantial settlement from Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers.\n\n7. Backbenchers revolt over Plan B\n\nBoris Johnson is facing a Tory backbench revolt over his so-called Plan B Covid restrictions. Dozens of Tory backbenchers have threatened to rebel or abstain amid fury over the proposed new rules and Johnson’s handling of the Christmas party scandal. The Guardian said the prime minister could be left relying on Labour support to win because at least 30 Conservative MPs are expected to vote against regulations on masks, home working and vaccine passports, while many more are vowing to miss Tuesday’s vote.\n\nInside Plan B: Tory anger and Boris Johnson’s ‘escape plan’\n\n8. Biden promises Ukraine support\n\nJoe Biden has pledged support for Ukraine in the event of a Russian attack. Following a 90-minute call with the US president late on Thursday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that the two “discussed possible formats for resolving the conflict” in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have carved out a self-declared state. Biden also spoke to the leaders of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.\n\nIs Russia getting ready to invade Ukraine?\n\n9. Kwarteng to back challenger auditors\n\nKwasi Kwarteng is to force FTSE 350 companies to give work to challenger audit firms to address KPMG, EY, PwC and Deloitte’s dominance of the accountancy industry. Ministers have been under pressure to show they have taken action to prevent corporate scandals before the fourth anniversary of the collapse of Carillion.

Pint price to rise amid cancellations\n\nThe cost of a pint is expected to rise by 10p as pubs face a surge of cancellations of Christmas bookings because of the Omicron variant. Clive Watson, executive chairman of the City Pub Group, which has about 50 pubs, said cancellations “accelerated” after Boris Johnson’s call for people to work from home where possible. Emma Sweet, marketing manager at the Brakspear group of pubs, said that its 130 premises had received hundreds of cancellations since the PM announced Plan B.\n\nLast orders called at 10,000 pubs, clubs and restaurants during pandemic", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Becca Stanek", "Harold Maass", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2015/12/19/live-clinton-sanders-omalley-democratic-debate-new-hampshire/77642878/", "title": "Third Democratic debate: Highlights from New Hampshire", "text": "Heidi M. Przybyla\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMANCHESTER, N.H. — Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley met for the third time Saturday night in a debate held at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H. The debate, hosted by ABC and the New Hampshire Union Leader, was moderated by David Muir and Martha Raddatz of ABC News.\n\nHere are the highlights; all times are Eastern.\n\n10:44 p.m.\n\nClosing statements:\n\nSanders begins by praising his competitors. “On our worst day we have a lot more to offer the American people that the right-wing extremists.” He cites his biography, his father having come from Poland with no money. His mother’s dream was to get out of their rent-controlled apartment, something she never lived to see. But they did go to college. “I know something about economic anxiety,” he said. That’s why we will “bring about a political revolution.” The U.S. belongs “to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.”\n\nO’Malley also cites his family and children, saying there’s nothing we wouldn’t do to give them a safer and healthier future. He cites immigration reform, investing in infrastructure, debt-free college and confronting terrorism. He also cites climate change as “the other great challenge we have.” Our country needs “new leadership” to lead us out of these polarizing times.\n\nClinton says if the next president is a Republican, “we know what will happen.” The rights of many groups, including women, gays and workers will be at risk. Social Security may face privatization. Veterans may see the VA privatized. Planned Parenthood will be defunded. “The list goes on because the differences are so stark,” she said. “This is a watershed election.” That’s why it’s so important to have a Democrat in the White House, said Clinton. “I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to their God-given potential.” She gets the final word, nodding to the debut of the new Star Wars movie last night: “Thank you, good night and may the Force be with you.”\n\n10:35 p.m.\n\nHillary Clinton is first answering the question of whether the role of the first spouse should change: “I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china” for state dinners, she says. Yet Bill Clinton would be dispatched on special missions.\n\nSanders praises Clinton for having transformed the role of first lady. Sanders touts his wife’s interest in and previous work on child welfare issues. She would help make reforms to a “dysfunctional child care system.” O’Malley’s wife is a district court judge in Maryland. As first lady of Maryland she still went to work every day and was also an advocate against domestic violence. She also worked on anti-bullying advocacy.\n\nClinton says she'll still 'pick the flowers' at state dinners\n\n10:25 p.m.\n\nThe topic is Libya.\n\nClinton is asked how much responsibility she, as former secretary of State, bears for the chaos in Libya. The conversation leads to Clinton, once again, being attacked by her competitors.\n\nShe walks through the reasons the U.S. got involved. Libya then elected moderates, “an indication” of their desire “to get on the right path.” She says the whole region has been rendered unstable because of Iraq and the effective propaganda of ISIS. There’s been a fragile agreement in Libya to try to create a national government. “This is not easy work, we did a lot to help,” she said. “We’re always looking for ways about what more we can do,” she said.\n\n“There wasn’t a lot of responsiveness at first,” to U.S. offers of assistance, she said. “The Libyans believed they knew what to do,” she said. “I’m not giving up on Libya,” she said. Asked again if mistakes were made: “There’s always a retrospective,” she said. “We offered a lot of help and it was difficult for the Libyans to accept.”\n\nSanders says there is a “fundamental difference” in opinion as he is not a fan of regime change. Clinton shoots back that Sanders voted for a resolution calling for the end of the Gaddafi regime. O’Malley joins in: “We probably let our lust” for regime change get ahead of our practical understanding of what it would lead to. O’Malley says Libya has become the “next safe haven” for ISIS.\n\n10:20 p.m.\n\nThe topic is the heroin epidemic.\n\nSanders says we have to tell the medical profession “they’ve got to get their acts together” in terms of flooding the market with opiates, which lead to heroin addiction. He also cited the need for increased access to treatments for the addicted. Clinton uses the opportunity to cite her personal interactions with families who’ve lost a loved one from overdose. She cites a plan for $10 billion in federal spending over 10 years to work with states. She also cites the need for more facilities and that police should carry with them the antidote to heroin overdose. O’Malley says the investment should be $12 billion. “That very time they show up with a near miss” at the hospital, “we should be intervening.”\n\n10:14 p.m.\n\nHow to bridge the divide between law enforcement and minority communities that they are supposed to protect? The FBI director has said a backlash against all law enforcement has created a “chill wind” going through law enforcement.\n\n“We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities” that “must be addressed,” says Clinton. Trust has been lost between law enforcement and the communities they are supposed to protect. Yet some officers are bridging the divide on their own. We need a bipartisan commitment to work together and “hear the voices” of Americans who’ve been harmed.\n\n“It’s possible to improve how we police the police,” says O’Malley, citing what he enacted in Maryland. Sanders and O’Malley cite drug treatment and sentencing reform. Sanders also cites community policing. “We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve” and to end minimal sentencing, invest in jobs and education and not more jails.\n\n10:04 p.m.\n\nThe topic is taxes.\n\nClinton vows not to raise taxes on the middle class, or families earning $250,000 or less. Sanders says Clinton’s pledge is tantamount to disagreeing with Lyndon Johnson on Medicare and Franklin Roosevelt on Social Security, in addition to measure like paid family and medical leave. “I have a way that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it,” says Clinton.\n\n9:57 p.m.\n\nThe cost of college is the issue.\n\nSanders is asked why his plan for tuition-free college isn’t just shifting the costs to the American people through the form of higher taxes.\n\nSanders says hundreds of thousands young people cannot go to college because their families can’t afford it. He cites a speculation tax on Wall Street to raise “substantial amounts of money.” We need “radical changes” in the area of college education because all people should be able to get it.\n\n“This one falls under the category of ‘I’ve already done this,’” says O’Malley, who calls for more money into Pell Grants. He cites a block grant program for the states and an income-based program for students. He cites his own student loan debt burden from the education of his children, which they’ll pay for the rest of their lives. He says Clinton has borrowed his proposals.\n\nClinton calls her plan “the new college compact.” The federal government will match money the states put back into the system. She says she doesn’t believe in free college for everyone, and that the focus should be on the working class and poor children. She has proposed debt-free tuition for those students.\n\nClinton also takes a swing at Sanders for proposing debt-free college and a single-payer health care system. “We’ve got to be really thoughtful about how we’re going to afford what we propose,” she says. Sanders says the middle class will pay substantially less because we would be doing away with private insurance.\n\n9:52 p.m.\n\nHealth care is the topic\n\nHow would you fix Obamacare?\n\nClinton says she’d build on its successes and “fix some of the glitches.” Out-of-pocket costs and prescription drug costs have gone up too much. She wants Medicare to be able to negotiate just like those companies negotiate with other country’s health systems. Make sure the health exchanges are “properly regulated so we are not being gamed.” We don’t have enough competition and oversight of insurance companies and what they’re charging, she says.\n\nSanders, who is calling for a single-payer system, is asked how much people will be expected to pay. He calls Obamacare “a step forward.” Even so, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions still can’t afford to go to the doctor. We also spend three times more per capita than what Britons pay. He says the insurance and drug companies “are bribing” the Congress. He says the average middle-class family will save thousands of dollars, without answering the question.\n\n9:40 p.m.\n\nHow do you raise incomes for middle-income families?\n\nSanders goes first. First, tell the wealthy their taxes are going up to “pay their fair share,” then raise the minimum wage, pass pay equity laws for women, put a tax on Wall Street speculation and make sure universities are tuition free. O’Malley cites his record in Maryland, including raising the minimum wage. He cites job creation from supporting the renewable energy industry, including solar. He cites universal national service to help cut youth employment.\n\nClinton weighs in by sounding like a general election candidate. She says economic mobility is an issue that unites Democrats, while none of the Republicans will raise the minimum wage or support policies to increase the incomes of middle-class Americans, citing similar issues including college affordability and the minimum wage. “This is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.”\n\nClinton, Sanders and corporate America: All you need is love\n\nShe’s asked in a follow-up question whether corporate American should love her. “Everybody should,” she says. She outlines her populist agenda before saying, essentially, that business leaders aren’t always the bad guys. Buffett rule including 30% tax rates on billionaires, “but I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.” Sanders is asked the same question, if corporate America will like him. “Nope they won’t,” he says, before launching into his of Wall Street and call for reinstatement of Glass-Steagall laws breaking up big banks. The greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy” and millions of lives. “I will fight and lead,” says Sanders.\n\nO’Malley hits Clinton for comments in the last debate, held in Iowa, on the issue of her closeness to Wall Street. “She tried to hide her cozy relationship” with Wall Street by citing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, said O’Malley, and she still won’t support breaking up the big banks. Clinton hits back: O’Malley “had no trouble” going to Wall Street for financial handouts when he headed the Democratic Governors Association.\n\n9:20 p.m.:\n\nOn fighting Assad and ISIS:\n\nSanders and Clinton clash over Middle East policy. “Our differences are fairly deep on this issue,” says Sanders. She listened to Bush and Cheney and voted for the Iraq War and is “too much into regime change” and “too aggressive” without appreciating the consequences of what happens afterwards. “Getting rid of dictators is easy,” but you have to think about “what happens the day after.”\n\nClinton says Sanders voted for regime change in Libya and to get rid of former leader Muammar Gaddafi. If we had not joined with Europeans “you would be looking at Syria.”\n\nThe two clash over whether the priority should be ousting Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad or destroying ISIS. Clinton says they need to focus on both and Sanders says that’s flawed. “The major priority right now,” says Sanders, “should be destroying ISIS.” O’Malley agrees with Assad that ISIS should be the priority. “We shouldn’t be the ones declaring that Assad must go,” said O’Malley. He derides a policy of “traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.”\n\nClinton says the reason “we’re in the mess we’re in” is because of Assad. “When we look at these complex problems I wish it could be either or,” she says, but leaving Assad in power helps create more terrorists “by the minute.” She says the world is behind us for a political solution but “we have to lead.”\n\nSanders says Clinton is 'too much into regime change'\n\n9:10 p.m.\n\nSanders is asked why he won’t support combat troops in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. can’t be policemen of the world, he says. There has to be a well-coordinated effort. “This is a war for the soul of Islam” and the troops on the ground should be Muslim, he says. Saudi Arabia and Qatar “have to step up to the plate,” said Sanders.\n\nClinton is asked whether she’s “fooling Americans” by saying we won’t send in combat troops. She says no, that’s exactly what ISIS wants to give them more targets and recruiting opportunities. “It’s absolutely the wrong policy” to imagine putting in tens of thousands of troops. She takes a dig at Trump for using rhetoric that alienates moderate Muslim allies needed to create a robust ground force.\n\nAsked a follow-up question, Clinton again pushes back against the notion that the U.S. will wind up sending large numbers of U.S. troops to the region. If we put together a bigger coalition “I think we can be successful.”\n\nO’Malley returns to his criticism that we’ve under invested in intelligence on the ground in the region and in diplomatic intelligence about leaders in the region.\n\n9:07 p.m.\n\nClinton is asked what she thinks of halting Syrian refugees from coming to the U.S. It’s something that New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, supports.\n\n“I don’t think a halt is necessary,” Clinton says. The U.S. should have a very tough screening process. “We don’t want to make it seem we are turning into a nation of fear,” said Clinton. After 18 months or so, we should prioritize those who have families here or who are mothers with small children, she said. That might soothe Americans who are uneasy about the idea. O’Malley is unequivocal against pausing immigration of refugees. “There is a pretty excruciating process” that they already go through. The victims are suffering genocide and brutality and we need to “act like the great country we are.”\n\n9:04 p.m.\n\nWould you create a law forcing tech executives to break into encrypted material to subvert terrorism plots?\n\nClinton does not agree that there should be a law. “I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts,” she said. “I would hope” they would work with law enforcement, which “needs the tools to keep us safe.”\n\nO’Malley says the federal government should have to get warrants but the people creating these products “have an obligation” to work with law enforcement.\n\n8:59 p.m.\n\nWhat do you say to those supporting Donald Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims?\n\nClinton praises former President George W. Bush for reaching out to the Muslim community after 9/11. She says terrorists are using Trump’s words for recruitment. “They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump” to recruit more radical Muslims, says Clinton.\n\nSanders says Trump is pulling the wool over the eyes of Americans by spewing hate about minority groups including Latinos and Muslims. Meantime he’s supporting policies that hurt average Americans. He thinks “low wages are a good idea.”\n\n8:50 p.m.\n\nOn guns:\n\nResponding to polls showing more Americans support purchasing guns to respond to the threat of terrorism, Clinton says it needs to be looked at as a “separate issue” from terrorism and accuses Republicans of fanning the flames of hate. Sanders says the vast majority of Americans support sensible gun safety measures, such as strengthening the instant background check system. O’Malley comes out swinging, saying Sanders voted against the 1993 Brady bill, for granting immunity for gun dealers. He then says Clinton “changes her position on this issue every election year it seems.” He says he’s the only candidate who’s actually passed gun safety laws, as former governor of Maryland.\n\nSanders tells O’Malley to “calm down” and Clinton asks him to “tell the truth.” Sanders punches back and says “do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people,” banning to ban assault weapons and for instant background checks. Clinton says O’Malley is misrepresenting her position. She supported the Brady bill and voted against giving gun dealers immunity, for instance. She calls on Sanders to sponsor legislation to remove the so-called Charleston loophole that allows people to purchase guns without a background check if the government hasn’t completed them in three days.\n\n8:42 p.m.\n\nClinton outlines her ISIS strategy, including an American led air campaign, go after everything from North Africa to South Asia. At home, we have to do a better job of sharing intelligence and information, including from the Internet, she says. We have to work more closely with technology companies. We must also work more closely with Muslim communities. “They will be our early warning signal,” she said. We must work with them and “not demonize them,” like the Republicans are doing.\n\nO’Malley highlights a lack of a robust counter terrorism strategy over the past 15 years. “The president had us on the right track,” but we need to increase the “battle tempo.”\n\nSanders highlights his vote against the war in Iraq and says he does not believe in unilateral American action. He says King Abdullah II of Jordan should be recognized as “one of the heroes” of the Middle East.\n\n8:35 p.m.\n\nOpening statements:\n\nClinton highlights the need to keep families safe and help the economy grow, not just for those at the top. She highlights her strategy to combat ISIS without another ground war. She says there’s a “distinct difference” between all of the Democrats and the Republicans, who would repeal the Affordable Care Act and give more tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy. Despite their “tough talk” they’d continue to let those on the no-fly terrorism watch list to buy guns, says Clinton.\n\nO’Malley said tonight’s debate is different because of the terror attack in San Bernardino. He said he visited a mosque last week and saw veterans, Boy Scouts and moms and dads. He said, in addition to terrorism, a major danger is “unscrupulous leaders” who “try to turn us against each other.” He says we must maintain our values against terrorists and “fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths,” in an obvious slam against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nSanders highlights his stump theme of income inequality, before hitting other issues include transitioning from fossil fuel to sustainable energy and a new foreign policy that takes on and destroys ISIS but doesn’t get us “involved in perpetual warfare” in the quagmire in the Middle East. We need a coalition that supports Muslim ground troops in the Middle East.\n\nThe data breach of Clinton’s campaign data is the first question.\n\nSanders says there was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up and information came to our campaign. “Our staff did the wrong thing, they looked at that information.” That person has been fired and they’re doing an internal investigation. But the DNC arbitrarily “shut off our access” to their own information. He called it “egregious.” He calls for an independent investigation into all data breaches as it’s unclear whether her campaign also had access to his campaign’s information. “It has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign.” He immediately agreed with the moderators’ suggestion that Clinton is owed an apology.\n\nClinton thanks him for the apology and says now that there’s an independent inquiry, “we should move on.”\n\n8:31 pm\n\nThe candidates take the stage.\n\n8:10 pm\n\nDem debate still at least 10 minutes away, getting off to a late start.\n\n7:45 pm\n\nTest one, two three, the debate begins in 15 minutes!\n\nMore coverage of the Democratic debate:\n\nHillary Clinton returns late after commercial break\n\nSanders to Clinton on data breach: 'Yes, I apologize'\n\nSanders to O'Malley: 'Calm down a little bit, Martin'\n\nHow to watch the New Hampshire Democratic debate\n\nSanders campaign says DNC has restored its access to voter database", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/19"}]}

I loved his earlier books, despite the shivers they induce — The Shining was my absolute favorite, but I also loved Salem's Lot and Langoliers. After The Stand he just got too dark and twisted for me, and the images from the books would stay in my mind for far too long. A wonderful horror writer but we've parted paths. I even tried the sequel to The Shining recently and only made it about 10 pages in …\n\nSharon Lynn Fisher, author of The Ophelia Prophecy\n\nLovecraft scares the heck out of me. I haven't read him in 20 years, but I vividly recall reading At the Mountain of Madness over a Christmas holiday, visiting family. It gave me an honest-to-goodness panic attack! Thinking back on it, I couldn't recall why it scared me so much, except that the most frightening aspect was never actually pictured or named. I had to look it up to figure out why — though the story catalogs a number of horrors, one of the characters sees something at the end that drives him mad, and he refuses to tell anyone what it was. That was it for me! It was years before I could read Lovecraft again.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nMira Grant, author of Parasite (Parasitology book one)\n\nThe scariest book I know — the one that makes me twitch and tremble and try to hide beneath my cats (which are at least very large, being Maine Coons, and can thus protect me) — is Misery by Stephen King. It's such a human evil. It's such a reasonable, step-by-step descent into something that is so very terrible, and so very realistic at the same time. It petrifies me. Which is probably why I've read it a dozen times.\n\nAmy Bartol, author of Under Different Stars\n\nJust the thought of Bodachs, the evil, shadowy creatures from Dean Koontz's epic series Odd Thomas makes me pull my foot back onto the mattress and cover my toes at night. It could be a thousand degrees; it doesn't matter. The blanket stays in place! If I let it slip, these shifty, malicious harbingers could steal into the world from a dark dimension and get me. In Koontz's novels, Bodachs form packs and troll an area, drawn to a location in frenzied anticipation of a horrific event. The blanket is my only protection ... well, that and sleeping with the light on.\n\nP.J. Dean, author of The Felig Chronicles\n\nI read The Legend of Hill House by Shirley Jackson in high school for an English class. That book scared the H-E-double-hockey-sticks out of me. The author did a fantastically creepy job of creating the claustrophobic atmosphere of an old, abandoned house, long thought to be haunted. Paranormal investigators come to debunk the myth. By the time their task is over, they barely get out alive and with their sanity intact. I've tried to re-read the book but just can't. If the 1963 film adaptation of the book, The Haunting, turns up on TV, I pass. Thanks for sleepless nights, Ms. Jackson.\n\nAngela Campbell, author of Spirited Away\n\nI really don't scare easily, but the book Hell House by Richard Matheson freaked me the heck out and gave me nightmares for days. I'm not even sure I finished it. I relish a good haunted-house story, but that one, simply put, is terrifying!\n\nJody Wallace, author of The Adventures of Mari Shu\n\nScary books where the villains are child predators. I have kids. I can't even, not anymore.\n\nS.E. Smith, author of Twin Dragons: Dragon Lords of Valdier\n\nI love Dean Koontz. The first book I ever read of his was Watchers. I swear I had dreams, OK nightmares, for weeks afterwards. I loved Einstein, the golden retriever, and actually felt sorry for the Outsider. His books, while some are really out-there, pull me into their world. I think I have read most of his books and still keep some of them on my bookshelf for rereading, including his Odd Thomas series.\n\nQ: Which Big Bad from an SF/F novel would you LEAST like to have trick-or-treat at your house?\n\nMy own choice: I'd have to go with the Alien (which has been in novels as well as the series of movies). Acid for blood … or any of the ghosts from Barbara Michaels' excellent 1970s novels. Just thinking about Ammie Come Home or The Crying Child and opening the door to find one of the apparitions from her imagination — eek!\n\nJeffe Kennedy, author of The Mark of the Tala\n\nThe monster that freaked me out first and stuck with me forever is the Rommalb from Patricia McKillip's The Forgotten Beasts of Eld. It uses people's fear against them and crushes them with it. In fact \"Rommalb\" is the name backwards, which is the only way to refer to it, since saying its name summons it. *shivers*\n\nJ. Kathleen Cheney, author of The Seat of Magic\n\nIn her Kencyrath novels, P.C. Hodgell has a character named Bane whom I either love or fear — not sure which. Bane had literally lost his soul, and so was willing to do just about anything to anyone. He made a career of cruelty. He may or may not have put that behind him, but the last time we saw him (I'm a book behind, I admit), he was made of bugs. He's also dead, which is why he's made of bugs. Either way, I don't want that walking through my door ...\n\nCara Bristol, author of Warrior (Breeder book three)\n\nI would least want to encounter Kylen Larson from Lisa Medley's urban fantasy novel Reap & Repent. Kylen is a reaper who has been possessed by a demon. If he showed up at Halloween, he wouldn't be looking for candy! Demons are the worst sort of bad guys because they originate from a place of pure evil.\n\nCathy Pegau, author of Caught in Amber\n\nThe Big Bad that I wouldn't want to see on my doorstep? The creature from Alan Dean Foster's Into the Out Of. Actually, I probably wouldn't ever see it coming, which is scary enough. There's a scene in the book where someone is attacked by it in an airplane restroom. And yeah, I was reading it ON a plane at the time O.O\n\nJoshua Roots, author of Summoned Chaos\n\nHands down, the Biggest of Big Bads I wouldn't want coming around for Halloween candy is Ysanne Isard from the Star Wars: X-Wing novels. Director of Imperial Intelligence, she ran the prison ship Lusankya where she tortured and brainwashed enemies of the Empire for fun. But brainwashing is small potatoes when you're a horrific sociopath ruling what's left of a murderous government. When it became apparent the New Republic would retake Coruscant, she developed a virus to wipe out the entire population of the planet before she fled.

A wide-ranging law regulating vaping that passed the Legislature earlier this year went into effect Thursday. It also prohibits opening vape shops within 1,000 feet of a school, church or child care facility and limits advertising on billboards to include only three vaping flavors, tobacco, mint and menthol. Critics say fruit-flavored vaping liquids attract younger users. One of the law’s sponsors, Democrat Rep. Barbara Drummond, told WBRC-TV she was shocked to see a 12-year-old in her Sunday school class with a vape, which she initially thought was a flash drive. Alabama was one of three states that previously did not regulate vaping.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The governor is moving ahead with a plan to increase prices at assisted living homes, a report says. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy proposed increasing Alaska Pioneer Home rates between 40% and 140% by Sept. 1, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The Dunleavy administration submitted the proposal to offset the state budget’s $12.3 million cut to funding for the homes, state officials said. There are currently three levels of service ranging from about $2,500 a month to $6,800 a month depending on the level of care needed. The proposal includes five levels of service ranging from about $3,600 a month to $15,000 a month, officials said. This new plan is intended to increase revenue, but some residents fear the higher prices will make the homes unaffordable.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Phoenix Police Department will train officers to track when they point their guns at people as the agency works to increase trust and transparency after a record number of shootings last year and national outrage over a cellphone video showing officers cursing and aiming guns at a black family. The department said Friday that the new policy was recommended by the National Police Foundation, which found Phoenix had 44 officer-involved shootings last year, more than any other U.S. department. Of those, 23 were fatal. A separate database that tracks fatal shootings by police showed Phoenix officers also killed more people than any other agency in 2018. The city is now the nation’s fifth largest, with about 1.6 million people.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State election officials have rejected an attempt to hold a referendum next year on a new law expanding what procedures optometrists can perform that’s sparked an unusually expensive and public lobbying fight. Secretary of State John Thurston’s office said Friday that supporters of the referendum fell short of the nearly 53,500 signatures from registered voters needed to put the issue on the November 2020 ballot. Thurston’s office said it determined the petitions submitted had 23,953 signatures. The new law allows optometrists to perform several procedures that currently only ophthalmologists can. It’s drawn heavy opposition from ophthalmologists who say the change puts patients at risk. Safe Surgery Arkansas, the group behind the referendum effort, says it’s prepared to go to court to challenge the petitions’ rejection.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: San Francisco International Airport is banning the sale of single-use plastic water bottles. The unprecedented move at one of the nation’s major airports will take effect Aug. 20, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The new rule will apply to airport restaurants, cafes and vending machines. Travelers who need plain water will have to buy refillable aluminum or glass bottles if they don’t bring their own. As a department of San Francisco’s municipal government, the airport is following an ordinance approved in 2014 banning the sale of plastic water bottles on city-owned property. The shift away from plastics is also part of a broader plan to slash net carbon emissions and energy use to zero and eliminate most landfill waste by 2021, airport spokesman Doug Yakel says.\n\nColorado\n\nCommerce City: Officials closed parks and canceled a Major League Soccer game’s fireworks display after plague was confirmed in prairie dogs in this Denver suburb. The Tri-County Health Department said Thursday that prairie dog burrows in Commerce City were being sprayed with insecticide to kill fleas that could transmit the disease to the rodents, people and pets. Health officials said Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge and Prairie Gateway Open Space were temporarily closed. Colorado Rapids officials canceled a fireworks show planned for after Saturday’s game against the Montreal Impact. They also restricted parking to asphalt lots. Rapids officials said the precautions would minimize the risk of exposure to fans, players and employees.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A contingent of Republican lawmakers is urging the state’s Department of Public Health commissioner not to comply with a request from top legislative Democrats to provide policy recommendations concerning vaccinations for schoolchildren. The five state representatives say it’s “wholly inappropriate” for the agency to be asked to provide an opinion on whether the General Assembly should eliminate its religious exemption. The group says it’s not the charge of the Department of Public Health to “offer opinions on civil rights issues.” Democratic Attorney General William Tong in May issued a nonbinding ruling that said there’s nothing in state law to prevent lawmakers from scrapping the exemption.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Police are offering a reward as they investigate the theft of a historical marker that memorializes the lynching of a black man accused of raping and killing a white girl. New Castle County said Saturday that a $2,000 reward is available to anyone who provides information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of those responsible for the theft. A concerned citizen noticed on Thursday that the state marker erected in June to commemorate the lynching of George White was missing. White, an ex-convict, was accused of killing 17-year-old Helen Bishop, whose throat was cut. In June 1903, a mob stormed a workhouse where White was being held, dragged him to the scene of the assault on Bishop, then burned him to death.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A man has pleaded guilty to felony bribery for paying more than $40,000 to police employees in the nation’s capital for confidential information from traffic crash reports. The Washington Post reports Marvin Parker, 60, admitted Wednesday to bribing the two employees for the information, to which the department restricted access in 2015. Prosecutors say Parker owns RPM Associates, a Maryland-based consulting firm. Court records say he bribed the workers from 2015 through 2017 and used the data to identify people involved in crashes. They say he would then contact them and offer to help them obtain legal and medical services. Police say the workers are no longer with the department. Parker hasn’t been detained.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: A state senator has filed legislation that would outlaw declawing of cats except under certain circumstances. The bill filed Friday by Democratic Sen. Lauren Book of Plantation would impose fines of $1,000 on veterinarians who declaw cats when it is not medically necessary. They could also be disciplined by the Board of Veterinary Medicine for doing so. There are health exemptions for such things as infections or disease that might make it necessary to declaw a cat. In many cases, people declaw cats because they can damage furniture and attack wildlife, such as birds. The bill is similar to a New York measure signed into law last month by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Book’s legislation is filed for the 2020 Florida session, which begins in January.\n\nGeorgia\n\nJekyll Island: A handmade flag that pranksters stole from Jekyll Island more than 40 years ago has been returned to the state park. The Brunswick News reports the flag featuring a crest of a seashell and a cotton ball was handed over to its executive editor and president, Buff Leavy, recently along with a handwritten note explaining that it had been swiped by Georgia Tech fraternity pledges in 1975. Leavy returned it to the Jekyll Island Authority. Rose Marie Kimbell, the archivist of the island’s Mosaic museum, says she suspects the flag was one of two that once flew atop flagpoles at the entrance to the Jekyll Island causeway. The flag will be placed on display at the museum, where Kimbell says it will be watched closely by a security camera.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Multiple sharks have been found without their fins, raising concerns among marine biologists, a report says. Three sharks were found and photographed Wednesday on the Big Island without fins, one of them gutted, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Two of the sharks were threatened oceanic whitetip shark species found alive and photographed off the coast of west Hawaii by dive tour operators, the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources says. The third was a whitetip reef shark found without fins and disemboweled, officials say. “Shark finning is not a new phenomenon, but the recent number of incidents is concerning,” department monitoring technician Stacia Marcoux says. “This is especially true for the threatened oceanic whitetip.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials at Boise High School want the mascot’s name changed. Officials tell the Idaho Statesman in a story on Saturday they hope to change the name from Braves to Brave. The plan will be presented at a Boise School District board meeting Aug. 12. Boise High Principal Robb Thompson says he wants the new name in place by Aug. 19 so it can be used for the 2019-2020 school year. But Thompson says it will take three to five years to change uniforms and imagery on campus. Last month Teton High School in eastern Idaho voted to retire its Redskins mascot. The Shoshone-Bannock tribes in June submitted a position paper to the Idaho State Board of Education asking that the state ban Native American mascots.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Two Democratic lawmakers say more money is needed to address the shortage of affordable, permanent and stable homes in the state. In June, Gov. J.B. Pritzker approved $200 million to fund Illinois’ affordable housing program through the state’s first capital plan in 10 years. Sen. Mattie Hunter and Rep. Delia Ramirez tell the State Journal-Register the money will make a “significant difference,” but it would take $1 billion more to address Illinois’ infrastructure concerns. Illinois Housing Council officials say more investment in permanent, supportive housing is needed to assist the “most vulnerable” renters, such as people with disabilities, veterans and homeless people. Ramirez says she hopes to propose legislation in January that would create a task force to examine housing needs across Illinois.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana State Fair has started its 17-day run during which it will be honoring everyday Hoosiers for their commitment to others. The fair opened Friday with its annual variety of food, farm animals, amusement rides and entertainers. It continues through Aug. 18. This year’s theme is “Heroes in the Heartland,” which each day will recognize teachers, farmers, police officers, firefighters, military members and others for their community service. This year’s fair queen cut a ceremonial ribbon during opening ceremonies with Gov. Eric Holcomb at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis. Organizers are hoping weather cooperates again for this year’s fair after it drew about 860,000 visitors last year and nearly 907,000 in 2017. Rain and high temperatures knocked attendance down to about 730,000 people three years ago.\n\nIowa\n\nGreenfield: Hopes by a small aviation museum that a stamp in its possession was rare enough to parlay a potential fortune crashed Friday when experts told them it wasn’t real – and likely not even worth the paper upon which it was glued. The Iowa Aviation Museum has had what it thought was a 1918 “Inverted Jenny” stamp on public display for some 20 years, dating back to when it was donated to the museum, glued to a board along with several other stamps. A notation from the donor attached to the board speculated it was worth about $73,000. An examination under a microscope confirmed it was likely cut out from a printed catalog. The news was disappointing for those at the museum, which also serves as the home of the Iowa Aviation Hall of Fame and had hoped to auction the stamp for hundreds of thousands of dollars and build a new museum hangar.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The governors in Kansas and Missouri have moved to end an economic “border war” that has gained their states unwanted national attention for using millions of dollars in incentives to entice companies into shifting jobs close to the Kansas City-area border. Their truce appears shaky. An executive order that Democratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly signed Friday showed that officials in both states have yet to fully resolve a final sticking point: the ability of cities, counties and other local governments in Missouri to offer more lucrative local tax breaks than their counterparts in Kansas. If Missouri officials don’t stop their generous local tax breaks, Kelly in her order threatens to call off the two states’ big, bipartisan deal, even with Friday’s declarations that the border war is over.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Louisville Zoo has announced the birth of a baby elephant. According to the zoo, a “strong and vigorous” African elephant male calf was born just before midnight Friday. The calf’s mother, Mikki, has been pregnant since October 2017 after being artificially inseminated. The 200-pound calf measures 98 centimeters tall, 77 centimeters long from head to tail, and 198 centimeters from the tip of his trunk to the tip of his tail. This is the zoo’s third elephant, joining 33-year-old Mikki and 47-year-old Asian elephant Punch. The zoo will now give the calf to bond with Mikki and Punch. The elephants will not be on exhibit until further notice. The calf has not yet been named.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Thousands of college students in the state face a surprising change as they start courses this month and pay their registration bills – their costs for attending class aren’t rising. For years, many students across Louisiana’s public university campuses faced repeated tuition hikes and, more recently, regular fee increases. But none of the state’s four college systems has enacted such mandatory, systemwide increases for upcoming fall semester classes. The decision not to raise fees comes after Gov. John Bel Edwards and lawmakers boosted state spending on higher education by $47 million in the $30 billion-plus state operating budget that started July 1. Nearly one-third of the increase ensures TOPS covers full tuition for all eligible students.\n\nMaine\n\nCape Elizabeth: A pair of Kenyan runners celebrated victories in the state’s most anticipated road race Saturday. Alex Korio won the men’s championships while Joyciline Jepkosgei won for the women at the annual Beach to Beacon 10K race in Cape Elizabeth. It was the 22nd installment of the race, which was founded by Cape Elizabeth native Joan Benoit Samuelson, the winner of the first women’s marathon at the 1984 Summer Olympics. The first Maine man to finish this year’s race was Dan Curts of Ellsworth, while the first Maine woman was Sofie Matson, who is heading into her junior year at Falmouth High School. The race starts near Crescent Beach State Park and ends in Fort Williams near Portland Head Light. It’s the biggest race in Maine, and it attracted more than 6,500 runners this year.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., took the high road in inviting President Donald Trump and other Americans to visit Baltimore but declining to respond in kind to the barrage of presidential tweets and comments disparaging him and the majority-black city he has long represented. “We are a great community,” Cummings, the chairman of a powerful House committee investigating the administration, said Saturday in his first public remarks about the controversy as he participated in the opening of a small neighborhood park near his home. Community leaders and residents gathered to cut the ribbon on a pocket of greenery and flowers, built from what had been a vacant lot often used as a dumping ground for trash. “Come to Baltimore. Do not just criticize us, but come to Baltimore, and I promise you, you will be welcomed,” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nOrleans: Shark sightings have forced officials to temporarily bar swimming at several of the state’s popular beaches in recent days. Nauset Beach in the Cape Cod town of Orleans was twice closed for swimming for periods of about one hour Saturday after great white sharks were spotted within a half-mile or so of shore, according the Sharktivity app, which is operated by the Atlantic White Shark Conservatory. Beaches in Wellfleet and Truro also kept swimmers out of the water for a time Saturday, as did several south-facing beaches on the island of Nantucket. A Martha’s Vineyard beach was twice closed earlier in the week over shark concerns. Surveillance has been stepped up this summer after two shark attacks off Cape Cod last year, including one that killed a 26-year-old Massachusetts man.\n\nMichigan\n\nSilver City: Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park in the Upper Peninsula is getting $550,000 in emergency shoreline repairs along a main entry road. MLive.com reports the state says high water levels along Lake Superior and recent storm damage have caused erosion that’s threatening County Road 107. Work is scheduled to begin Monday. Eric Cadeau, a regional field planner with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, says the work aims to prevent visitors from needing to take an 80-mile detour to get to another park entry point. The state is teaming with the Ontonagon County Road Commission on the project. High water levels on the Great Lakes, including Lake Superior, have been blamed for flooding and contributed to hazardous conditions along shorelines this year in the region.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMoorhead: Pennington County is about to become the state’s first to let cellphone callers stream live video and audio to dispatchers when they call 911 for help. Sheriff Ray Kuznia tells the Minnesota Public Radio News that the technology will be implemented later in August. Kuznia said it should help dispatchers make better decisions in responding to emergency calls such as car crashes and domestic incidents. A caller will dial 911 on a cellphone within the Pennington County service area. The dispatcher can send a text message to the caller’s cellphone if they want to take over the caller’s camera. The caller has to option to accept or decline. The emergency dispatcher would then be able to see wherever the caller points the camera.\n\nMississippi\n\nNew Albany: A family dog is being hailed as a hero after a man says the canine saved him and his son from a house fire. Marvin Foster of New Albany tells the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal he was getting out of the shower Tuesday when Dudley the dog bumped the bathroom door and alerted him about a fire in the kitchen. Foster got dressed and yelled to his son, Terrance, that they needed to get out of the burning home. The two men escaped, but a wall fell and jammed the bathroom door, trapping Dudley inside. New Albany firefighters rescued the dog and gave him water and oxygen. Dudley had burns to an ear and his eyes, and he inhaled smoke. He is recovering at a veterinarian’s office. Foster says the dog is his hero.\n\nMissouri\n\nCape Girardeau: Thousands of marriage records, some predating statehood, in Cape Girardeau County will be digitized and stored electronically as part of an effort to preserve historic documents. The Southeast Missourian reports that county commissioners signed off on the project Thursday. Half of the estimated $31,000 cost will be paid for through a grant. County recorder of deeds Crew Blattner says the work is critical because non-digitized records can be lost if there’s a natural disaster or water damage. The effort also will allow records to be searched through an online database. Some of the marriage records predate both Cape Girardeau County, founded in 1812, and Missouri, which gained statehood in 1821. Although they have been laminated, many of the oldest documents are yellowing and the meticulous, handwritten records starting to fade.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock has ordered flags lowered across the state Monday to mark the 70th anniversary of the deadly Mann Gulch fire. The Aug. 5, 1949, blaze north of Helena near the Missouri River killed 13 firefighters and was the subject of the Norman Maclean book “Young Men and Fire.” Bullock says in his proclamation that flags will fly at half-staff in memory of all wildland firefighters who have given their lives in the line of duty. The U.S. Forest Service is planning a ceremony at the Meriwether Picnic area near Mann Gulch on Monday. It includes plans for a flyover by the plane that transported 15 Missoula-based smokejumpers to the fire in 1949. The plane, now known as Miss Montana, also participated in the 75th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Swarms of mayflies have emerged from water along the Missouri River and are caking drivers’ windshields. The Omaha World-Herald reports mayflies spend 99% of their lives in water, but they rise above when they become winged adults to take part in a mating swarm. They quickly die after that. But their mating season is a nuisance. Pam Frana, a membership specialist for the Nebraska City Tourism and Commerce Department, blames the flooding for stirring up the mayflies. Dominator Fuel in Rock Port, Missouri, sold out of windshield wiper fluid in light of the mayflies’ arrival. Andrew Wagner, who works in Hamburg, Iowa, says they covered windshields so much that drivers couldn’t see where they were going. But he says the situation is better now that flooding has gone down.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: People driving between Reno and Las Vegas probably won’t notice anything unusual as they pass Walker Lake, at the base of Nevada’s Wassuk Range in one of the nation’s least-populous counties. But people who waited decades yearning for the lake to recover from its human-driven death spiral are marking a historic milestone. On July 5, for the first time since Europeans settled the remote and scenic Walker Basin, there’s water flowing through the Walker River exclusively for the benefit of the lake’s fish and wildlife. “It’s kind of a historical moment,” says Jeff Bryant, executive director of the Walker Basin Conservancy. From 1936 until April 16, it was illegal for the federal water master, or anyone else, to move water through the Walker River for anything other than nourishing crops or cattle.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire has been awarded a $108 million grant from NASA to use a space-based instrument to identify hazards like oil spills and algal blooms in the Gulf of Mexico, the southeastern United States and the Amazon River. The Geosynchronous Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer instrument, overseen by UNH’s Joseph Salisbury, will allow observations of ocean biology, chemistry and ecology in coastal waters as part of efforts to protect ecosystems and improve resource management. It is the largest NASA contract awarded to the university. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said findings from the instrument “will bring economic benefits to fisheries, tourism and recreation in the coastline area.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: Bruce Springsteen’s youngest son is becoming a firefighter in Jersey City, his mom says. Patti Scialfa on Thursday posted congratulations to their youngest child, Sam, on Instagram. She wrote that “you followed your dreams” and told her son to “stay safe” and “love your brave heart!” The 25-year-old took the civil service exam to become a firefighter in New Jersey’s second-largest city in March. He has served as a volunteer firefighter in Colts Neck. Springsteen and Scialfa have three children.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State health officials are seeking to shore up and standardize safeguards against brain injuries in youth sports beyond schools in non-scholastic athletic leagues and clubs. Coaches and many youth athletes automatically would undergo training to detect signs of a concussion and understand the potential consequences of a brain injury under rules proposed by the New Mexico Department of Health. The agency has scheduled a public hearing later this month on the proposal requiring annual training about concussions not only for coaches but also for parents and young athletes themselves – once they turn 11. Those children would sign a form each year that shows they completed a brain-injury prevention training session linked to standards from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: In a reckoning five years in the making, an administrative judge on Friday recommended firing a police officer over the 2014 chokehold death of an unarmed black man whose dying cries of “I can’t breathe” fueled a national debate over policing, race and the use of force. The city’s police commissioner will make a final decision this month on whether to fire Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is white, for his role in Eric Garner’s death. Pantaleo was suspended shortly after the judge’s decision became public, about two weeks after federal prosecutors closed the book on criminal charges. Mayor Bill de Blasio hailed the judge’s report as “a step toward justice and accountability,” while Pantaleo’s lawyer and a union leader said it penalized an officer for properly doing his job. Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr, said the report brought her “some relief” but was overdue and fell short of true accountability.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A judge has dismissed charges against two students accused of disorderly conduct and defacing a public monument after placing Ku Klux Klan hoods on statues at a Confederate monument. N.C. State students Enzo Niebuhr and Jody Anderson were arrested Easter Sunday during a protest at the North Carolina Women of the Confederacy monument in Raleigh. News outlets report that a judge dismissed the charges Friday after a hearing in which the students’ lawyer argued that their actions were protected speech. The officer who arrested them testified that the students used profanity and that placing hoods on the statues was like a hate crime.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A federal appeals court says the state’s voter identification requirements are constitutional, rejecting an argument by a group of American Indians who said they are a form of voter suppression. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the state Wednesday, overturning a lower court ruling. North Dakota’s law requires voters to show ID with a residential street address, which American Indians have argued is not always evident on reservations. They also say many tribal members aren’t aware of their address, don’t have a provable one because they’re homeless or stay with friends or relatives, or can’t afford to get an updated ID with a street address. Members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa sued the state in 2016 over the ID requirements.\n\nOhio\n\nTwinsburg: Twin brothers driving separately to the Twins Days Festival say each got pulled over for the second time in two years. But this time they got off without a ticket and just a laugh. Andy Baker says he and his twin brother, Chad, were driving from Nashville, Tennessee, to Twinsburg on Thursday when they were stopped. He says they were pulled over because the trooper thought the identical twins had identical license plates. But there’s a slight difference because one plate has a zero, while the other has the letter “O.” Baker told WEWS -TV in Cleveland that the trooper got a good laugh out of it and was a good sport. He says the brothers weren’t so lucky last year when they got tickets for speeding.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTahlequah: Expansion of the city’s Greenbelt Trail is on the horizon, and officials say the work should begin sooner rather than later. The Tahlequah History Trail originally started as a conceptual drawing of paths near Town Branch Creek in 1992 and expanded to a 2-mile trail system connecting all city parks to form the “Greenbelt.” The 10-foot-wide portion of the trail will use many features already available in the existing park system by connecting Sequoyah Park to Ross Park, and then to Felts Park, the Tahlequah Daily Press reports. Mayor Sue Catron, other city officials and curious residents recently took a “walk and dream” tour of the trail and exchanged thoughts and ideas while they painted a picture of plans. Tahlequah Planning and Development Director Clinton Johnson said the trail will include two emergency phone stations.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The latest homelessness count shows more people are sleeping outside in Multnomah County on any given night in 2019 than the last decade. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports about 20% more people were found living somewhere unfit for human habitation - in places including tents, in cars and under bridges – when the count was done on a single night this past winter compared to 2017, the last time the federally required count occurred. The 2,037 people who were found sleeping outside in Oregon’s most populous county are the highest the count has found and represent some of the area’s most entrenched issues – they are disproportionately of color, mentally ill or facing a substance abuse problem. The Point in Time count, released Thursday, is conducted by the county every two years.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBradys Bend: A cat in western Pennsylvania is bucking stereotypes with its love of swimming. Tissy is an orange Maine Coon who regularly cools off in the family pool in Bradys Bend Township, about 55 miles north of Pittsburgh. Sonny Herr tells the Tribune Review she rescued Tissy as a homeless kitten about five years ago from a parking lot near the county fair. She says Tissy got curious about water when the kitty was about a year old and started to swim. Tissy’s favorite thing is to swim with Herr’s 9-year-old daughter, Taylee. Tissy even wears a floatie around the waist and likes to be snuggled in the pool. The cat also loves bubble baths. According to the Cat Fancier’s Association, many cat breeds enjoy water, including the Turkish Angora, American shorthair, Norwegian forest cat and American bobtail.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: A bill renaming a local post office in honor of a 19th-century abolitionist and suffragist has cleared the U.S. Senate. Rhode Island’s congressional delegation introduced legislation in both chambers to honor Elizabeth Buffum Chace by naming the Central Falls post office after her. Democratic Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse say it passed the Senate last week and must now clear the House of Representatives. Chace dedicated her life to advocating for women’s rights and the abolition of slavery. The Rhode Island Historical Society says the home she built with husband Samuel Chace in Valley Falls, Rhode Island, in 1858 became a way station for escaped slaves and abolitionist speakers. Chace led the Rhode Island Women’s Suffrage Association in the late 1800s.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The city’s tourism marketing organization is rolling out a new online platform about African American history and culture in the region. The Post and Courier reports the new website, “Voices: Stories of Change,” is a complete overhaul of its predecessor, which had not been updated in about a decade. Explore Charleston Deputy Director Perrin Lawson says work on the new site started about 18 months ago. The main takeaway, he says, was the wide range of perspectives gathered that led the team to seek local contributors with personal connections to the subject matter. For example, an article on Robert Smalls was written by International African American Museum CEO Michael Boulware Moore. Smalls, who famously stole a Confederate ship in Charleston Harbor and later became one of the first African Americans elected to Congress, is Moore’s great-great grandfather.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Sioux Empire Fair is waiving entry fees for its livestock competition for the first time this summer as South Dakota farmers and ranchers deal with tariffs on foreign agriculture markets and spring flooding. Traditionally, the entry fees have been $10 to $25, depending on the class or species of animal being shown. It’s the 80th anniversary for the fair, which began over the weekend. Hundreds will showcase their cows, lambs, goats and pigs they’ve been raising in hopes of taking home some prize money. Many show more than one animal, so fair officials say the fees can add up quickly. Fair director Scott Wick says the fee waiver will be extended in future years.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: School officials have removed a piece of student art depicting President Donald Trump and the Statue of Liberty after receiving a threat. The painting has been hung in the hallway of Southwind High School – located just outside Memphis – since 2016. The painting shows Trump with his mouth covered by white brush strokes and the Statue of Liberty covering her face. School officials say the painting has not sparked any complaints over the years. However, the painting recently gained attention on social media, and the school decided to remove it after receiving a threatening phone call Friday. The district says it respects students’ rights to free speech and encourages students to express themselves “through art or in any other peaceful manner.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The city’s airport has begun testing a driverless shuttle outfitted with cameras and sensors to ensure passengers are transported safely and without the danger of being hit. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Friday announced the electric autonomous vehicle called Easy Mile EZ10 will be tested for six months in an environmental and people-moving project. An airport attendant is present to help travelers and for safety purposes. The shuttle, with seating for six and room for other passengers to stand, has a pre-programmed route between the Barbara Jordan Terminal and the rental car/ground transportation sites. The shuttle, operating on the upper level of Garage 1, complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and has wheelchair accessibility. Airport spokesman Bryce Dubee says it’s another mobility option for travelers.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s Supreme Court says language in a law that prevented gay couples from reaching a workable agreement with a surrogate to bear their child is unconstitutional. The Deseret News reports an opinion released by the high court Friday threw out that section of law because it denied same-sex couples a benefit long enjoyed by a husband and wife in Utah. The decision says that “same-sex couples must be afforded all of the benefits the state has linked to marriage.” The law in question allowed judges to approve surrogacy agreements if the intended mother – meaning a woman – could not bear a child or the pregnancy would be risky. A judge had refused to approve an agreement between a surrogate and a gay couple because both partners were male.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Select farms around the state will again be opening their operations to the public for a week this summer, starting next weekend. The fifth annual Open Farm Week takes place from Friday through Aug. 15 at over 40 farms across the state. The activities for visitors vary from farm to farm and range from milking cows and goats, picking vegetables and learning to make cheese to taking a farm tours and eating an on-the-farm dinner. A listing of the events can be found online at DigInVT.com.\n\nVirginia\n\nWachapreague: Scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science are doing research this summer that could result in a way for commercial fishermen to keep sharks from interfering with their fishing lines. VIMS Eastern Shore Lab has the advantage of being right on the water and near the last undeveloped stretch of barrier islands on the East Coast. The sandbar sharks researchers are observing this summer in a tank at the Seawater Lab come from right off the dock. When the research is over, the sharks are returned to the same waters. The research examines the response of the sharks to an electronic “tickler” device – officially called a bycatch reduction device. The hope is that with the right combination of electronic signals, sharks will be discouraged from attacking a baited fishing line.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: This week’s primary election doesn’t have any statewide races for voters to contend with, but it will be the first one where same-day voter registration, automatic registration and prepaid postage are all in effect in the state. On Tuesday, more than 360 local races will be decided by voters, ranging from city council races and school director races to two legislative seats where two recent appointees face primary challenges as they seek election to a full term. Laws passed over the last two legislative sessions that seek to make it easier for voters to register and cast their ballots are now all in effect. The state’s more than 4.4 million registered voters started receiving their ballots in the mail weeks ago for the top two primary, in which the top two vote-getters advance to the November ballot, regardless of party.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPrinceton: A local railroad model is drawing people from across the globe even before it’s finished. The work-in-progress replica, at the Princeton Railroad Museum, has already drawn in thousands of guests. Measuring at a whopping 22 by 16 feet, the model is something to behold, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Artist Dan Hosier says many guests have told him that visiting the model was a “priority destination” in their trip. The model itself offers both replications of places throughout the area and inspirational design. Places that can be spotted on the model include the Elkhorn tunnel, the Maybeury coke ovens, Pinnacle Rock and the former tree on Crumbpecker Hill. The entire project is Hosier’s “artistic representation of coal, railroad and lumber history in southern West Virginia.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State health officials say they’ve linked vaping to 11 recent cases in which teenagers and young adults developed “severe lung disease” that required hospitalizations. Officials say they’re investigating another seven cases that may also be linked to vaping. The health department says all the patients they interviewed reported vaping in the weeks and months prior to being hospitalized after experiencing shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, coughing and weight loss. Officials say the severity of the cases varied, and some patients needed assistance breathing. Some of the patients improved with treatment, but officials say they’re investigating whether the lung disease will cause long-term damage. Officials say investigators are trying to find out what vaping products were used.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The U.S. Forest Service wants to reduce designated habitat in the state and in Nevada for a ground-dwelling bird. The agency said Friday that its plan would target 200 square miles now set aside for sage grouse in Wyoming and Nevada, with nearly all of the reduction in Wyoming. A state official says the proposed changes simply align Forest Service plans with Wyoming’s map of state-designated sage grouse habitat. More than 8,000 square miles of national forest land has been set aside as protected habitat for the birds in Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming. The Natural Resources Defense Council says the proposed reduction “unravels” a 2015 Forest Service conservation plan. The agency said then the birds would not be listed as threatened or endangered because state and federal agencies had come up with plans to conserve its habitat.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/02/health/sleeping-pill-dangers-wellness/index.html", "title": "Sleeping pill dangers and how to avoid them | CNN", "text": "Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe stories of sleeping pills gone wrong are legendary.\n\nAsk any flight attendant, and you’ll hear amusing tales of people sleepwalking,taking off their clothes or even standing up and peeing into the neighboring airline seat.\n\nThe use of sleeping pills can also be deadly. Up to a half a million “excess deaths” in the United States were due to use of sleep medications called sedative-hypnotics, a 2010 study found.\n\nPeople with prescriptions for those sleep aids, which include zolpidem and temazepam, were over fourtimes as likely to die from accidents and health conditions stemming from use compared with those who did not use such drugs, the study said. Even people who took fewer than two sleeping pills a month were three times more likely to die than those who didn’t.\n\nIf you are using, or thinking of using a prescription or over-the-counter sleep aid, what do you need to know to do so safely? We asked Dr. Jing Wang, an assistant professor of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\nThis conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nCNN: When someone comes to you with insomnia or another sleep disorder, begging for help to go to sleep, do you give them a sleeping pill first thing for immediate relief?\n\nDr. Jing Wang: No, definitely not. We really try very, very hard not to do that. When someone comes in with insomnia, we take a really thorough medical and sleep history. It’s very important that the person shares personal details so we can identify what the source of the insomnia could be. Is it behavioral, or is it medication or medical illness-related?\n\nI will ask them, “What’s your daytime schedule? What do you do in the evenings?” to try and find their physical and emotional stressors. Is this person on a screen all the time at work and home?\n\nThen we home in on how that person gets ready for bed: “Do you have routines? Do you have a regular bedtime?” Frequently, insomnia is perpetuated by what we do in response to not being able to sleep. People get very creative in ways that may not be helpful: They get on the phone scrolling, checking emails or answering work messages, or sleep with the TV on. Both of these expose you to blue light, which sends a signal to the brain to wake up. Occasionally, you’ll get people saying I get up and work out, which is definitely not what you want to do!\n\nCNN: When might a sleep aid be advised?\n\nWang: Our first-line approach is to introduce patients to a form of cognitive behavioral therapy called CBTI, which is specifically for insomnia. It educates patients about healthy sleep behavior, such as regular bedtime and wake schedules, keeping screens and blue lights out of the bedroom, doing relaxing things before bed, and so on. It’s all about the associations that our brain makes with our sleep environment and how our behaviors or activities affect that.\n\nIf we have someone who is clearly struggling from a very acute onset of insomnia, and there is an identifiable factor or change in their life, then we might have a discussion about a short-term trial of a sleep aid for a few weeks or a month or so, and only with regular checkups.\n\nAnd we set clear expectations about short-term use, because we don’t want to just prescribe a sleep aid and have the person on it for the next 30 years. We want to get to the root of the problem in a healthier way by fixing what’s triggering the insomnia.\n\nCNN: Why is the long-term use of a sleep medication not healthy?\n\nCheck with a doctor before taking any type of sleeping aid. Shutterstock\n\nWang: It depends, as people have different responses and may be susceptible in different ways. Some of these sleep aids can become addictive, so the person feels they cannot sleep without it. They can be dangerous if mixed with alcohol or certain pain medications. Some cause daytime sleepiness and can interfere with driving and other motor activities.\n\nSedative sleep aids have been associated with hallucinations and dissociative behaviors. People have driven cars, cooked food, sleepwalkedand made phone calls, all without any recollection when they woke. After waking, people can be susceptible to drowsiness and confusion, like a hangover effect.\n\nCNN: Let’s talk about over-the-counter medications. Is that a problem?\n\nWang: Any medication is a double-edged sword: It has its uses but always has side effects.\n\nOne of the strongest pieces of counseling I always do with patients is to tell them to really try to avoid over-the-counter sleep aids. They can have unpredicted side effects, such as making you hyper instead of drowsy. There’s potential for interaction with prescription sedatives, which patients may also be on. And there’s always a potential of misuse or overuse because they think, “Oh, it’s over-the-counter so it’s safe.”\n\nTake melatonin. Some people have reported taking 30 or even 60 milligrams of melatonin and that could be dangerous; we just don’t know yet. It’s not really regulated, so non-melatonin substances can be mixed in the pill or tablet. You could get headaches, one of the known sort of side effects from melatonin. Or you could take itat the wrong time and interfere with your circadian rhythm.\n\nAntihistamines, for example, create dry mouth, dizziness and a kind of hungover feeling the next day. They may also have anticholinergic effects, like urinary retention, blurred vision, constipation and nausea. Chronic, regular use of these agents have in some studies been linked to increased risk of dementia.\n\nFinally, using over-the-counter sleep aids can potentially delay seeing their sleep problems as a concern and seeking care: “There’s no reason for me to see the sleep doctor or talk to my physician about my sleep problems. I can just keep using an over-the-counter agent.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/puzzles/crosswords/sally-hoelscher/2024/09/22/daily-crossword-analysis/75280486007/", "title": "Crossword Blog & Answers for September 22, 2024 by Sally ...", "text": "There are spoilers ahead.

Jayson TATUM was drafted by the Celtics in 2017. He is a five-time NBA All-Star. Add this to the list of sports information I've learned from crossword puzzles.\n\nAMC (30A: MacGuffins Bar theater chain) AMC, which is headquartered in Kansas, is the largest movie theater chain in the world. Some AMC locations include a MacGuffins Bar, where moviegoers can get a cocktail to enjoy with their movie. A MacGuffin is a plot device that utilizes a normally insignificant or unimportant object, event, or character to keep the plot moving forward. Alfred Hitchcock is known for popularizing the use of MacGuffins. For example, in Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 movie, The 39 Steps, the MacGuffin was plans for a silent plane engine.\n\nMARS (31D: Olympus Mons' planet) Olympus Mons is a volcano located on MARS. Olympus Mons is a shield volcano, a type of volcano with a low profile. Of course, low profile is relative. Olympus Mons is three times as high as Mt. Everest, and roughly the size of the state of Arizona. Scientists estimate that Olympus Mons last erupted approximately 25 million years ago.\n\nRandom Thoughts & Interesting Things\n\nELIOT (16A: \"Adam Bede\" novelist George) Adam Bede is George ELIOT's first novel, published in 1859. George ELIOT was a pen name of Mary Ann Evans. Adam Bede tells the stories of four characters living in a rural, small community (the fictional town of Hayslope) in 1799, one of whom is the title character.\n\nTONKA (19A: Toy truck brand) TONKA has been selling toy trucks since the 1940s. In 1991, the brand was acquired by Hasbro. TONKA trucks were originally mostly metal, but since the 1980s, some of the steel in their construction has been replaced by plastic. This answer reminds me of a story from my childhood (when TONKA trucks were still metal...). When I was two years old, my brother, who is a year older than me, threw a TONKA truck at me. We were both young, and I don't really remember the incident, but I do have a tiny scar near my right eye as a reminder.\n\nSHO (29A: \"The Chi\" network) The Chi is a TV series that premiered on Showtime (SHO) in 2018.

The harrowing historical epic “12 Years a Slave” trailed closely with nine nominations.\n\nAll were among the nine films nominated for best picture. The other nominees are “Captain Phillips,” ‘’Dallas Buyers Club,” ‘’Her,” ‘’Nebraska,” ‘’The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Philomena.”\n\nThe most notable omission by the academy was Tom Hanks, whose lead performance in “Captain Phillips” was widely considered a shoo-in. It was a particularly surprising snub since Hanks is widely beloved by the academy, having been nominated five times previously, winning for “Forest Gump” and “Philadelphia.”\n\nRobert Redford, expected by many to be nominated for the shipwreck drama “All Is Lost,” also missed out on a best actor nod. Redford has never won an acting Oscar.\n\nThe best actor nominees are Chiwetel Ejiofor (”12 Years a Slave”), Bruce Dern (”Nebraska”), Leonardo DiCaprio (”The Wolf of Wall Street”), Matthew McConaughey (”Dallas Buyers Club”) and Christian Bale (”American Hustle”).\n\nThe 77-year-old Dern is an Oscar nominee for the second time, 35 years after his nomination for Hal Ashby’s “Coming Home.” Few have taken more pleasure in awards season than Dern, revitalized by a film he’s happily viewed, he estimates, “approaching the upper 30s.”\n\n“I can’t see it enough to realize how lucky we all were with the collaboration that went on on this particular movie,” said Dern. “I feel somehow that the industry has suddenly today put their arms around our little movie.”\n\n“Nebraska” earned six nominations, including best director for Alexander Payne and June Squibb for best supporting actress.\n\nDisney’s making-of “Mary Poppins” tale “Saving Mr. Banks” surprisingly failed to land either a best picture nomination or a best actress nod for Emma Thompson.\n\nThe best actress nominees are Amy Adams (”American Hustle”), Cate Blanchett (”Blue Jasmine”), Sandra Bullock (”Gravity”), Judi Dench (”Philomena”) and Meryl Streep (”August: Osage County”).\n\nWith her nomination, Streep pads her record for most acting nominations. This is her 18th nod, including three wins, the last for 2011’s “The Iron Lady.”\n\nBut many enjoyed their first Oscar nomination Thursday, including Ejiofor, McConaughey, Michael Fassbender (”12 Years a Slave”), McQueen, Barkhad Abdi (a limo driver before being cast in “Captain Phillips”), Lupita Nyong’o (”12 Years”) and Jared Leto, who had devoted himself to music before returning to play a transsexual in the Texas HIV drama “Dallas Buyers Club.”\n\n“Yesterday I was doing jury duty, today I woke up with an Academy Award nomination,” said Leto. “Only in America.”\n\nDavid O. Russell’s Abscam melodrama “American Hustle” has ridden a wave of enthusiasm for its manic performances, all draped in thick 1970s style. It’s a repeat success for director David O. Russell (who received his third directing nomination) just a year after his “Silver Linings Playbook” was feted, like “Hustle,” with nominations in all four acting categories. A year after winning, Jennifer Lawrence was again nominated for “Hustle,” as was Bradley Cooper, both swapping lead nods for supporting nominations.\n\n“We have a very big family that’s been working together on some films going back three films,” said Russell, referring also to his “The Fighter.” ‘’It makes me feel very fortunate to have the trust of these actors and to build this bridge of trust that they would take these risks together with me.”\n\nMartin Scorsese’s “The Wolf of Wall Street” came into Thursday as one of the biggest question marks of an awards season that has often left many guessing. The nearly three-hour Wall Street extravaganza of money, sex and drugs became a lightning rod of debate, with many questioning whether it glamorized the infamous trader Jordan Belfort.\n\nBut “The Wolf of Wall Street” landed five big nominations, including best director (Scorsese, his eighth for directing), best supporting actor (Jonah Hill) and best adapted screenplay (Terence Winter). DiCaprio said he felt vindicated for what he said is clearly a cautionary tale of greed and hedonism.\n\n“To be recognized like this and to see that there were enough people out there who said, ‘Look, we get what this film’ — not what it’s trying to say, but what it’s trying to reflect,” said DiCaprio. “Nobody wants to be misunderstood.”\n\nAlso doing well was Spike Jonze’s futuristic romance “Her” (five nominations, including best original screenplay for Jonze). Jonze actually earned three nominations Thursday, including best song, for co-writing “The Moon Song” with Karen O.\n\nOne of the day’s biggest winners was the 27-year-old producer Megan Ellison, the daughter of billionaire Larry Ellison. Her Annapurna Pictures produced two of the best-picture nominees (”American Hustle” and “Her”) as well as the Wong Kar-Wai martial arts drama “The Grandmaster.” She celebrated by tweeting “17!” — the total nominations her films received.\n\nThough much of awards season had played out between favorites “12 Years a Slave” and “American Hustle” (both best picture winners at the Golden Globes on Sunday), the global box-office hit “Gravity” emerged Thursday thanks partly to its strength in technical categories. It was nominated for all seven technical awards, including cinematography, production design, editing and visual effects.\n\nAlfonso Cuaron’s innovative depiction of being lost in space has been hailed for reinvigorating the spectacle of the big-screen experience. Having taken in more than $670 million worldwide, it’s easily the most popular of the best-picture nominees.\n\nThough historically the most-nominated films have taken home best picture, that’s not been the case in recent years. In six of the last 10 years, the most-nominated film hasn’t triumphed in the end, including last year when Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln,” with 12 nominations, was beaten by Ben Affleck’s “Argo.”\n\nThe Coen brothers’ folk tale “Inside Llewyn Davis,” one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year, garnered only nominations for cinematography and sound mixing. And while 2013 was trumpeted as one of the best years for African-American cinema, movies like “Lee Daniels’ The Butler” and “Fruitvale Station” weren’t nominated (including Oprah Winfrey’s performance in “The Butler”).\n\nAlong with Nyong’o, Squibb and Lawrence, the best supporting actress nominees were Julia Roberts (”August: Osage County”) and Sally Hawkins (”Blue Jasmine”).\n\nDespite a lot of support, James Gandolfini wasn’t posthumously nominated for one of his final performances in “Enough Said.”\n\nWoody Allen scored his record 16th screenwriting nomination for “Blue Jasmine.” Also up for original screenplay are “American Hustle,” ‘’Dallas Buyers Club,” ‘’Her” and “Nebraska.” In the adapted screenplay category are “Before Midnight,” ‘’Captain Phillips,” ‘’Philomena,” ‘’12 Years a Slave” and “The Wolf of Wall Street.”\n\nTerence Winter, who penned the script to “Wolf,” was able to uniquely share the nomination experience with his wife, Rachel Winter, a producer of “Dallas Buyers Club.” Winter said it was “surreal.”\n\nPixar, usually a mainstay in the best animation category, was left out this year. Its “Monsters University” ceded the category to “Frozen,” ‘’The Wind Rises,” ‘’Despicable Me 2,” ‘’The Croods” and “Ernest & Celestine.”\n\nSurprisingly overlooked in the documentary category was Sarah Polley’s acclaimed family history “Stories We Tell.” Nominated were “The Act of Killing,” ‘’The Square,” ‘’Cutie and the Boxer,” ‘’Dirty Wars” and “20 Feet From Stardom.”\n\nNominated for best foreign-langue film were films from Italy (”The Great Beauty”), Denmark (”The Hunt”), Belgium (”The Broken Circle”), Cambodia (”The Missing Picture”) and Palestine (”Omar”).\n\nThis year’s Oscar telecast on March 2, with Ellen DeGeneres hosting for the second time, has particular pressure on it to live up to the increasingly popular Golden Globes. With hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, ratings for the Globes have increased the last two years and drawn good reviews. The Academy Awards have meanwhile struggled to freshen up its more prestigious brand.\n\nBut comebacks are always possible. The most notorious flop of 2013, “The Lone Ranger,” managed to land two nominations, for visual effects and makeup and hairstyle.\n\n———\n\nAssociated Press writers Anthony McCartney, Derrik J.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nMost people not in Hollywood are likely wondering: What does this mean for Smith's future and his future projects, which could involve hundreds or even thousands of blameless movie workers?\n\nHere's a look at what this means in terms of practical consequences, with help from some legal experts:\n\nWhat did the Academy say?\n\nIn a Statement released Friday announcing its decision, the Academy said that the 94th Academy Awards show was \"overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behavior\" of Smith. So he's persona non grata for the next decade, forbidden from attending \"any Academy events or programs, in person or virtually, including but not limited to the Academy Awards.\"\n\nThe Academy also apologized for its own missteps and gave a shout out to Rock for his grace under \"extraordinary circumstances.\"\n\n\"During our telecast, we did not adequately address the situation in the room. For this, we are sorry. This was an opportunity for us to set an example for our guests, viewers and our Academy family around the world, and we fell short — unprepared for the unprecedented.\n\n\"We also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted. Thank you.\"\n\n5 surprising revelations:Will Smith talks domestic violence, suicide and Tupac Shakur in new memoir\n\nCan Smith be nominated and win an Oscar in the next 10 years?\n\nYes, but the Academy said nothing about that. Cue Rachel Fiset, a former lawyer for the Academy, now a criminal defense lawyer in Los Angeles.\n\nShe says Smith is not banned from being nominated or winning in the future. If he wins, he can't be there to accept but he can send a representative to accept for him. It's happened before and more than once.\n\nSmith will not be allowed to vote for awards for the next 10 years, which would have been the case anyway after he resigned from the Academy last week. He also won't be able to attend the awards show and related events, and next year will miss the pleasure of following a tradition considered a big deal in Hollywood.\n\n\"He lost the ability to present the best actress award next year, which is a special moment in and of itself,” says Los Angeles entertainment lawyer Mitra Ahouraian.\n\nWas this punishment the worst the Academy could hand out?\n\nNo. The Academy could have expelled him permanently, banned him from being nominated or winning future awards, and/or rescinded his just-awarded Oscar.\n\n“Their decision is what makes the most sense and what I thought would happen,” says Ahouraian. “He shouldn't be allowed to attend the Oscars – that makes perfect sense and he lost that privilege by showing he doesn't know how to act.\"\n\nBut both Ahouraian and Fiset were surprised at the length of the ban; they expected five years or less. \"It had to be a long enough period to feel like punishment,\" Ahouraian says.\n\nFiset called it a \"pretty heavy-ish punishment.\"\n\n\"It may reflect how the industry is thinking of Will Smith at this time,” she says. “It looks like the temperature in Hollywood is angry at him, there is a bad feeling and it’s lingering. (This) shows that the board of governors, which includes producers, actors, writers, directors – a little sliver of every part of the industry – is showing what the movie-making industry feels about him right now.\"\n\nWhy were the Academy's options limited?\n\nFirst, because Smith resigned before the board could act to do worse.\n\n“He took away their ability to expel or suspend him, so now the punishment options were limited to: Are you allowed back into the Academy Awards?” Fiset says. “They didn’t address whether he could rejoin again (after 10 years)... They were silent on that because it was not the question in front of them. Since he’s no longer a member of the group, they could only choose to let him in or not at the awards.”\n\nOnly a handful of members have ever been expelled, including convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein and director Roman Polanksi, who was expelled in 2018 four decades after he pleaded guilty to statutory rape and then fled the country to avoid a harsh prison sentence.\n\nThe Academy did not rescind Smith's Oscar. Neither Weinstein's nor Polanski's Oscars have been rescinded, and Polanski got his in 2003 for directing \"The Pianist,\" decades after his guilty plea.\n\n\"They couldn't take back his Oscar when they didn't take back Harvey Weinstein and Roman Polanski's without causing a huge uproar in Hollywood and beyond,\" Ahouraian says.\n\nAnother option, banning Smith's future films from being eligible for nominations and awards, also would be seen as too extreme and unfair to the hundreds or thousands of people who work on any given movie, Ahouraian says.\n\n\"It wouldn't be just to disqualify his films from future awards given he's not the only one creating those films,\" she says. \"It would in essence end his career in Hollywood since the possibility of an Oscar is always an aspiration, and who would want to rule that out by working with him?\n\n\"That decision would be far too extreme and I don't think Hollywood would back it.\"\n\nPost-slap sales spike:Will Smith's memoir gets a boost; 'Half Baked Harvest' tops best sellers list\n\nWhy the pressure to punish Smith when other Academy members' punishments were belated?\n\nTimes have changed, and public opinion has changed. Also, a physical attack on TV doesn't happen every day.\n\n“There’s a more heightened awareness as to what actors and superstars can get away with – we’re living in a more enlightened world and the Academy is waking up, albeit slowly, to that,\" says Fiset. \"It’s hard for them to promote kindness and a non-violent society and at the same time have someone get slapped on their stage in front of millions of viewers.\n\n“The public was outraged so the Academy is just being in some ways reactive of public opinion,” she says. “It reflects the image of a newer society, one in which you don’t beat up a guy who insults your wife – you talk about it.”\n\n.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2024/01/26/lily-gladstone-killers-of-the-flower-moon-best-actress-nomination-reactions/72322686007/", "title": "Lily Gladstone's historic Oscar nomination thrills Native actresses", "text": "When Angela Startz was a girl, she would imagine what it would be like to accept one of the iconic golden statuettes at the Oscars.\n\n“When I was a kid and started performing, I definitely practiced my Oscar-winning speech, like full-on hairbrush in front of the mirror, coming up with what I would say and who I would thank,” said the Oklahoma City actor, dancer and podcaster.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2024/03/11/oscar-winners-2024-ignore-best-films-performances/72930887007/", "title": "Oscars 'Barbie' snub isn't the issue. Awards ignored the best movies", "text": "I’d be remiss to say the Oscars aren’t out of touch, most award shows are. Despite that, this year's Oscars got a couple things right.\n\nThe show had a joyous start with Da’Vine Joy Randolph winning best supporting actress for her painfully beautiful portrayal of Mary in \"The Holdovers.\" \"Poor Things\" swept the visual categories. \"Oppenheimer\" won seven awards, including Cillian Murphy winning best actor. \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" a brilliant film that more people should watch, deservedly won best original screenplay.\n\nDespite these satisfying wins (justice for Lily Gladstone), my mind was constantly thinking about the films and actors unrecognized. I remember the day nominations came and many were upset that \"Barbie,\" despite receiving eight nominations, was not nominated for best actress or director. There was a bounty of articles and essays articulating that disappointment, and I’m sure we’re in for even more after \"Barbie\" lost all but one Oscar Sunday night (congrats, Billie Eilish).\n\nHowever, the outrage was somewhat lost on me. I enjoyed \"Barbie\" well enough. I definitely think Greta Gerwig should have been nominated for best director, but the overwhelming outcry about the snubs seemed a tad disproportionate.\n\nSomehow \"Barbie\" only getting eight nominations was a loss to feminism even though other films like \"Anatomy of a Fall\" – which arguably offers a more nuanced portrayal of womanhood – received many nominations. It seemed to me like those who felt most maligned simply hadn’t watched any other films.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nOscars got it right:'20 Days in Mariupol,' 'The Zone of Interest' wins show the academy is listening\n\nThe best films and performances the Oscars didn't award\n\nIn fact, there were many movies and performances that were tragically overlooked at Sunday night’s ceremony and awards season as a whole.\n\n\"May December\" is based on the true story that took over popular culture in the 1990s of a middle school teacher pursuing a relationship with her student. The film stars Julianne Moore, Natalie Portman and Charles Melton. That trio gave some of the best acting performances of 2023, yet the cast did not receive a single nomination. The only nomination the film did receive was for best original screenplay, which it lost to \"Anatomy of a Fall.\" It’s certainly not lost on me, however, that a film satirizing Hollywood exploitation wasn’t received warmly by Hollywood.\n\nI watched Oscar best picture nominees.'Oppenheimer' will win, but here's what should.\n\n\"Past Lives,\" a film that chronicles two childhood lovers who reconnect after 20 years, received two nominations for best original screenplay and best picture, unfortunately losing both. What struck me was that for a film that is so atmospheric yet character-driven, it received no acting nominations.\n\nMany on film twitter voiced their disappointment with Greta Lee, who plays one half of the long lost lovers, Nora, not receiving a nomination for best actress. Teo Yoo, who plays Hae Sung, deserves to be part of the conversation as well. Yoo brings Hae Sung to life with such care. He portrays him with a subtly heartbreaking arrested development that’s borne out of the love he lost to Nora at such a young age. His performance is quiet, nuanced and empathetic – and it’s almost criminal that he was left out of the awards conversation.\n\nOscar nods honor 'Oppenheimer,'but what about Americans still suffering from nuke tests?\n\nThe best films and actors the Oscars didn't even nominate\n\nA.V. Rockwell’s incredible feature directorial debut, \"A Thousand and One,\" tells the story of a mother, Inez, who takes her son, Terry, from foster care to raise him in Harlem, where she grew up. The heartbreak of the film unfolds quietly as the audience are mere observers to the cyclical nature of poverty and the crime it breeds.\n\nAmon Warmann from \"Empire\" perfectly articulates the gravitas of Teyana Taylor’s performance as Inez: “At almost every turn she unveils new capabilities, playing all of Inez’s varied notes without sanding off her raw edges. It’s an eye-opening performance that should have us all excited about her future onscreen work.”\n\nThe film received zero nominations.\n\nAndrew Scott in \"All of Us Strangers\" was another performance tragically ignored by the Oscars. The film follows Adam, played by Scott, as he is pulled back into his childhood home and attempts to reconcile his identity and trauma with the ghosts of his late parents. He finds solace in Harry, played handsomely by Paul Mescal. It’s almost a miracle they found each other given their isolation.\n\nRelationships like that are like an oasis in a desert of sand. The film examines love, loss and the pain therein, and the ambiguous shades of gray in which life often paints.\n\nThe list goes on: \"The Iron Claw,\" Ava DuVernay’s \"Origin\" and \"Anatomy of a Fall\" actor Milo Machado-Graner, who gave one of the best performances last year (too bad the academy hates children).

SCOTUS released its decision electronically on Friday morning, upholding the ban.\n\nMultiple reports indicate that TikTok may shut down the platform itself on Sunday.\n\nIf implemented, the ban will make it illegal for U.S. internet hosting services and app stores to distribute TikTok.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has asked SCOTUS to pause the ban to give him a chance to \"save\" TikTok.\n\nUpdate:Supreme Court upholds law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. Read more.\n\nThe start of the weekend marks two days until the social media platform TikTok could be banned in the United States.\n\nTikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance has until Sunday to sell the platform under federal legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden last spring. If Beijing-based ByteDance fails to do so, TikTok will be banned in the U.S., making it illegal for U.S. internet hosting services and app stores to distribute the platform.\n\nThe legislation, which implements the ban, has been in the works for several years, as some government officials believe TikTok is a national security threat, and could be sharing U.S. user data with the Chinese government.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments last Friday from TikTok, which claims the ban is a breach of American's First Amendment rights. And after more than a week, the court handed down its decision to uphold law that could ban TikTok in the U.S.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nMore:Supreme Court may decide Friday if TikTok will be banned\n\nHere's what we know about the ban, in TikTok's potential final hours in the U.S.\n\nWhen will SCOTUS release its decision?\n\nThough SCOTUS justices were not scheduled to take the bench, the court said on its website on Thursday that it may release an opinion electronically Friday at 10 a.m. EST. And just after 10 a.m. Friday, the high court issued its ruling, upholding the law.\n\nWhat will the Supreme Court decision determine?\n\nSince SCOTUS upheld the existing legislation, ByteDance will have until Sunday to divest TikTok's American assets.\n\nDuring last week's hearing, Justice Samuel Alito asked if the court could temporarily block the law or administratively halt the law temporarily.\n\nU.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, defending the ban for the Biden administration, advised against a temporary block, unless TikTok was likely to win based on its First Amendment claim of a right to distribute its content. As for an administrative halt, Prelogar said she would defer to the justices on whether they have enough time to decide the case.\n\nDoes TikTok plan on shutting down the platform on Sunday?\n\nFollowing last week's Supreme Court hearing, it appears TikTok is preparing to shut down the platform on its own on Sunday, if a ban indeed goes into effect, per multiple reports.\n\nFollowing last week's Supreme Court hearing, it appears TikTok is preparing to shut down the platform on its own on Sunday if a ban indeed goes into effect.\n\nIn a statement Friday night, TikTok said it would need more clarity from the Biden administration and the Justice Department that the ban will not be enforced starting on Sunday.\n\n\"Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" said the statement sent to USA TODAY.\n\nEarlier on Friday, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew issued a response to the judgment via TikTok video, saying, \"I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship.\"\n\nHow could the ban affect users?\n\nIf the ban on TikTok goes into effect on Sunday, it will become illegal for U.S. internet hosting services and app stores to distribute the platform.\n\nTikTok users who already have the app downloaded on mobile devices will still have access to it, but they will be unable to update the app, which will likely become unusable over time. TikTok would also be unavailable through U.S.-based internet hosting services, meaning the TikTok website would not be accessible.\n\nWould there be a way to work around the ban?\n\nExperts are unsure of how exactly the ban would be implemented. But content creators are using this time to educate other users about virtual private networks (VPN), which allow online users to mask their locations. In theory, if a user used a VPN to set their location outside of the U.S., the user could be able to access TikTok.\n\nHowever, there are a few instances in which VPNs wouldn't work. Dan York, a senior adviser to the Internet Society, previously told USA TODAY that popular VPNs could be blocked and using out-of-country locations would result in slower or unreliable connections.\n\nYork advised users to do thorough research before using VPNs, as there are malicious companies that may want to take advantage of users looking to use one for the first time.\n\nWhat does Donald Trump think about the ban?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump will be sworn into office on Monday, the day after the ban could be set in place. Though he previously supported a ban on the platform, Trump asked SCOTUS last month to put a hold on the deadline to give his incoming administration \"the opportunity to pursue a political resolution of the questions at issue in the case.\"\n\nMore:TikTok CEO expected to attend Trump inauguration as ban looms\n\nThe Washington Post reported Wednesday that Trump is considering an executive order that would halt the ban for 60 to 90 days, a report USA TODAY is working to confirm. However, it is unclear if Trump would be able to issue such an order or how it would be implemented.\n\nWho is interested in buying TikTok?\n\nPerhaps most notably, Project Liberty, an organization led by billionaire Frank McCourt, announced last week that it made a formal offer to ByteDance to purchase the U.S. assets of TikTok. Project Liberty's President Tomicah Tillemann said in a statement that the organization would not publicly disclose the bid amount.\n\nMcCourt, former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, announced last month that Project Liberty had secured verbal commitments of up to $20 billion for the purchase. \"Shark Tank\" host and investor Kevin O'Leary announced last week that he was joining Project Liberty on the purchase plan.\n\nIf Project Liberty purchased TikTok, it would only be the U.S. assets, which do not include the algorithm, as China finds it to be its intellectual property.\n\nOthers who have expressed interest in the platform include Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk; YouTuber James \"Jimmy\" Donaldson, more commonly known as MrBeast; former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick; Walmart CEO Doug McMillon; and Microsoft as an entity.\n\nWhat other platforms are users flocking to?\n\nIn the ban's wake, several social media apps are fighting for the top spot on the Apple App and Google Play stores, with the number one spot held by the Chinese app RedNote, as of Thursday. TikTok-owned Lemon8 is at a close second, which is ironic, as the app could be subject to a ban under the legislation, too.\n\nMore:Wondering where to go if TikTok is banned? Here are 10 alternatives gaining traction\n\nOther platforms users are exploring include Instagram Reels, Facebook Reels, YouTube Shorts, Clapper, Triller, Fanbase, Neptune and Twitch.\n\n(This story has been updated with new information.)\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

For the last couple of weeks, I was oblivious to the news. And it felt good. Really good. I’d even go so far as to say it felt healthy.\n\nI didn’t read, watch or listen to any news. I didn’t scroll through Twitter or Facebook. I didn’t answer a single email. The only time I looked at my phone was to take a picture, check a wilderness navigation app or, using a satellite device, send my wife a text message letting her know where I was stopping that day.\n\nI was hiking the John Muir Trail in California, heading southbound from Yosemite Valley through three national parks — Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia — to the summit of Mt. Whitney, the highest point in the Lower 48.\n\nOr at least that was the plan. About a week into the hike, I got sick. I don’t know if, despite filtering water from streams and lakes, it was giardia. Or if it was altitude sickness. Or if maybe it was old-fashioned food poisoning from one slight detour to get a cheeseburger and a beer. All I know is that — and I’ll spare you the details — I went about four days unable to eat more than a few hundred calories in gels.\n\nMark Woods:An old park in the middle of Georgia worthy of becoming new national park\n\nMark Woods: A decade later, one thing hasn't changed — timelessness of our national parks\n\nMy friend David and I eventually got off trail for several days, which in and of itself is no easy task.\n\nOut of all the statistics about the JMT, the most dramatic figure might not be its length (211 miles), elevation change (47,000 feet) or summit of Whitney (14,505).\n\nNo, the stat that I find most remarkable about the John Muir Trail is how many roads cross it in those more than 200 miles.\n\nNone.\n\nIt’s an iconic American trail. It’s also an isolated one, winding between the Sierra Nevada mountain range, making it quite remote, which is great unless you need to get off it.\n\nWe did get off the trail temporarily, giving me a chance to recover. And when we got back on it, we eventually covered about 150 miles and made it to Whitney, summiting on a morning with gusts that gave it a sub-zero wind chill.\n\nI’ll admit there were moments when I wanted to be back home. But now that I’m back home, I want to be back in the wilderness.\n\nHiking in footsteps of Ansel Adams, John Muir\n\nAt home, my mind always seems to be racing. And not necessarily in a productive way.\n\nThe beauty of places like the Ansel Adams and John Muir Wildernesses isn’t just how there are moments when you feel like you’re walking through one of Adams’ photographs or Muir's writings — with alpine lakes, meadows and mountain passes set against a deep blue sky.\n\nPart of the beauty is how you’re focused on what is around you, in this moment, not what is happening elsewhere.\n\nYou have a lot of time to think while hiking. And that's one of the things I thought about. I still believe it’s critically important to pay attention to news, near and far. But in this age where news comes in more than a firehose — it's more like thousands of hoses flowing constantly — it’s also important to also get away from it. And there’s something to be said for at least temporarily shutting off all the spigots.\n\nAt one point, about a week into the hike, we veered slightly off trail to Red’s Meadow, an outpost where we had shipped a bucket filled with a resupply of dehydrated food and important staples, like peanut M&Ms.\n\nAt Red’s, we also had a surprisingly strong cell signal.\n\nI called my wife. After we talked about the trail and home, Toni said: “Just so you’re not the last person on earth to know … the Queen died.”\n\nWhen I got off the phone, I heard others around me saying this.\n\nThat wasn’t the only news that made it to the wilderness. Some other tidbits made it into the backcountry, passed from person to person, kind of like the old game of telephone, where someone whispers something into the ear of another and by the time it comes full circle it’s laughably altered.\n\nIn this case, as Floridians, someone told us that our governor had flown some migrants from San Antonio to Martha’s Vineyard. A Florida politician flying people from Texas to Massachusetts? I wondered if maybe that, like a game of telephone played in a place without phone service, wasn’t what actually happened. Even when we came off trail for a bit, I decided I didn’t want to know. I wanted to remain oblivious to what was making news for a little longer — other than wildfires and weather.\n\nFrom California hurricane back to Florida\n\nWe had planned to do this hike last year when I turned 60. The smoke was so thick that from the town of Lone Pine, a place where the Sierras typically dominate the view, you couldn’t see even a hint of a mountain range.\n\nThis year there weren’t any major wildfires burning in the Sierras. But once we got into the backcountry, there was a hurricane. Yes, in California. It was the first to hit the West Coast in decades. It dumped rain and hail into the Sierras. And it was followed by the effects of Pacific typhoon.\n\nAt the start of the hike, we had record-setting heat (above 100 degrees in Yosemite Valley) and craved shade. By the end, while camping at Guitar Lake at 11,500 feet, our water bottles froze and we craved sun hiking up to Whitney the next morning.\n\nIt was a reminder to be careful what you wish for. And that goes for being connected.\n\nIt is only a matter of time before we’ll be able to browse the internet and check social media anywhere on earth.\n\nWhile I was on the JMT, Apple announced that the iPhone 14 will have satellite connectivity. At this point, this means emergency SOS, not the ability to post to Facebook. But, again, that’s only a matter of time. Probably a very short time.\n\nI went from the wilderness to a flight home from, of all places. Vegas. Talk about whiplash. From canyons to slots.\n\nWhile there, I opened back up the firehose and started to read about Hurricane Ian heading toward Florida. And when I got home and tried to start writing this column, I got frustrated because we briefly lost power and internet.\n\nIt felt like another reminder to be careful what you wish for. Even if that wish is to be disconnected.\n\nmwoods@jacksonville.com\n\n(904) 359-4212", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/05/27/george-floyd-demonstration-memphis-shuts-down-union-avenue/5269833002/", "title": "George Floyd demonstration in Memphis shuts down Union Avenue", "text": "A silent demonstration Wednesday intended to protest the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery turned into separate verbal confrontations with Memphis police and two counter-protesters.\n\nThe protest, which was shared earlier on social media, began around 7:30 p.m. when a small crowd of individuals parked their cars on Rembert Street and exited vehicles carrying Black Lives Matter signs.\n\nWithin an hour, a crowd of 50-60 protesters faced off across the street from the Memphis Police Department precinct on Union Avenue, facing several dozen officers and the two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. One held a sign reading “police lives matter comply Confederate 901\" and the other with a sign reading \"all lives matter.\"\n\nMemphis police temporarily shut down a portion of Union Avenue from Barksdale Street to McLean Boulevard after the confrontation grew.\n\nWhen the protest started around 7:30 p.m., about 40 people gathered on the north side of Union, holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “stop killing black people” and “silence is violence.”\n\nFloyd and Taylor died during interactions with police officers. Earlier this week, Floyd died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for an extended period. Taylor was shot and killed in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, by officers executing a \"no-knock\" search warrant. Arbery was shot and killed while out jogging outside Brunswick, Georgia, after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect.\n\nWhat we know about death of George Floyd:4 Minneapolis police officers fired after 'horrifying' video hits social media\n\nProtesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up.\n\nKeara Akinmoladun, whose husband helped organize the protest along with a group of local black educators, said she wanted lawmakers and people across the country to know that Memphis stood in solidarity with those protesting and grieving across the country.\n\n“We want the immediate arrest of the people who killed George Floyd and Breonna Taylor,” she said. “There’s a lot of awareness, but we want action.”\n\nThe gathering was largely silent up until about 8 p.m. when counter-protesters George \"K-Rack\" Johnson and Ray Dunkin arrived. Both identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. In the past, the group has targeted Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer online for her role in protesting the equestrian statue of Nathan Bedford Forrest, which has since been removed from what is now Health Sciences Park.\n\nSeveral of the protesters crossed the street to confront the two men. MPD officers kept the two parties physically apart, but as the verbal confrontation escalated, more protesters started to cross Union and some stopped in the middle of the street, kneeling and blocking traffic.\n\nTheryn C. Bond, a prominent local activist and former Memphis City Council candidate, confronted the counter-protesters, who occasionally jeered at the crowd to \"go out for a jog\" — a reference to Arbery's slaying — as tempers flared.\n\nMore:'Stop killing black people': George Floyd's death sparks protests in Minneapolis, Memphis and Los Angeles\n\nShe was eventually corralled back to the north side of Union Avenue around 8:30 p.m., when MPD set up metal barricades to move the protesters back onto the sidewalk, separating the demonstrators and counter-demonstrators on opposite sides of the street.\n\nBond, who completed treatment for a form of cancer, spoke of the importance of being physically present at a physical gathering during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"I came out here to be supportive,\" Bond said. \"Because this is bigger than one person. This is about more than a list of hashtags that shouldn't even exist.\"\n\nReferring to the counter-protesters, Bond acknowledged their presence was almost predictable.\n\n\"What are we taught in science class? For every action, there's a reaction,\" Bond said.\n\nThe crowd who stood behind Bond during the confrontation was formed by both white and black Memphians.\n\n\"I was so impressed to see so many white allies,\" Bond said. \"Because sometimes we think, 'Everybody doesn't get it.' And I think with the recent murder of George Floyd by police... I think this was the proverbial nail in the unfortunate coffin for America to really understand what we mean when we say, 'Black Lives Matter.'\"\n\nBy 9 p.m., about a dozen more people had joined the protest with two dozen more watching from nearby and filming. About 50 MPD officers were on the scene with about 30 standing between the protesters and the two counter-demonstrators, who stood outside the MPD precinct on Union Avenue. About 40 MPD vehicles and a K-9 unit were also present.\n\nNo other counter-protesters were seen joining Johnson and Dunkin, who left the lawn of the precinct around 9 p.m., telling MPD officers that they appreciated them.\n\nAt least two individuals were handcuffed during the protest. Lt. Karen Rudolph said she could not provide a reason for the detainment until a report had been entered into the system.\n\nAfter the counter-demonstrators left, the remaining protesters sat on the sidewalk and grassy hill outside Midtown Church of Christ and continued to chant \"no justice, no peace\" and the names of people killed by police officers, at times asking the MPD officers present to cross the street and join them.\n\nAround 9:45 p.m., the crowd had swelled to more than 100 and protesters started moving west on Union Avenue to avoid the police barricades, led by Barbara Buress, also known as The Lil Dreadheaded Activist. MPD cruisers followed the protesters down the street.\n\nAt about 10:15 p.m., MPD Deputy Chief Samuel Hines sought a dialogue with protesters. He listened as Bond described what she felt was unfair treatment from police officers at the scene.\n\nAfter Bond said her piece, Hines asked the protesters if they would show the same enthusiasm and outrage for \"those individuals, those victims, those fathers, those sons and brothers that were killed,\" in reference to the homicides that occurred in Memphis over the weekend.\n\nHines told Bond that if she had a complaint about the conduct of an officer, she should file it with the police department. Hines, flanked by several officers, walked behind the barricade. He then motioned for the more than 20 officers lined up behind the barricade across Union Avenue at Barksdale Street to withdraw and back away. They did, slowly and resumed their positions about 30 feet behind the barricades.\n\nThe protesters then turned and headed west down Union again.\n\nAbout two hours later, the protest had moved to the parking lot of the Walgreens at Union and McLean.\n\nAfter silently standing dressed in riot gear on the fringes of the protest, the Memphis police department brought out barricades and placed them between its officers and protesters around 12:20 a.m. Before the barricades were placed, protesters had been lined up in front of the officers with their hands up, alternating between saying “hands up, don’t shoot” and “no justice, no peace.” About 75 people were actively protesting.\n\nMoments after the barricades went up, many of the protesters started to back away and spread farther across the parking lot.\n\nMemphis police officers began leaving the scene around 1 a.m. as the protest ended.\n\nThe deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery\n\nGeorge Floyd died Monday after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck after Floyd was restrained. The police department said they responded to a \"forgery in progress,\" found a suspect and ordered the suspect to get out of his vehicle.\n\nLatest updates:Minneapolis mayor wants officer charged; all 4 cops in George Floyd's death ID'd\n\nMore:4 Minneapolis police officers fired after 'horrifying' video hits social media\n\n\"Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance. He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance where he died a short time later,\" according to a statement by the department.\n\nA video of the incident showed an officer continuing to kneel on Floyd's neck as he said that everything hurt, asked for his mother and repeatedly said that he couldn't breathe. In the video, reportedly taken by a bystander, onlookers can be heard telling police officers that Floyd was not fine and asking them to check his pulse.\n\nFloyd became unresponsive about four minutes into the video. The officer did not remove his knee from Floyd's neck until emergency medical technicians put Floyd onto a stretcher, about four minutes after he became unresponsive.\n\nThe four officers involved in the incident have been fired. Minneapolis police identified the officers Wednesday as Derek Chauvin — the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck — Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has called for Chauvin to be arrested.\n\n\"We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,\" Frey said. \"There's somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes, every one of which the officer could have turned back ... and removed his knee from George Floyd's neck.\"\n\nBreonna Taylor was shot and killed by police inside her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, in the early hours of March 13. The officers were executing a \"no-knock\" search warrant as part of a narcotics investigation.\n\nDetails:Who are the 3 Louisville officers involved in the Breonna Taylor shooting? What we know\n\nRead more:What to know about the investigations into the police shooting of Breonna Taylor\n\nTaylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he did not hear officers announce themselves. He fired a single shot, hitting Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly in the femoral artery. Mattingly and detectives Myles Cosgrove and Brett Hankison then shot more than 20 rounds, striking Taylor at least eight times. She died in the hallway of the apartment.\n\nWalker was under investigation at the time, but the charges have since been dropped.\n\nMattingly required surgery but is expected to make a full recovery, police said. Mattingly, Cosgrove and Hankinson have been placed on administrative reassignment pending investigation.\n\nLouisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced on May 20 that the department's internal investigation into the case had been turned over to the office of Attorney General Daniel Cameron. He said the investigation was also sent to the U.S. Attorney and the FBI Louisville field office.\n\nAhmaud Arbery was shot and killed by while jogging through a residential neighborhood outside Brunswick, Georgia, on Feb. 23.

It took effect in September but had been suspended just Wednesday by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Pitman. Now the New Orleans-based appeals court has temporarily set aside Pitman's ruling while it considers the state's appeal to reinstate the law.

The bank is doing this in order to update its computer systems. In an online FAQ, BB&T said customers will not be able to make mobile deposits, transfer funds, access online bill pay services or set up a new Zelle payment through the website or mobile app during the planned outage. \"We expect all systems including mobile app, online banking, BB&T ATMs, and the Truist Contact Center to be back up and running by Sunday, Oct. 10,\" the bank estimated. Branches will also be unable to process transactions and ATMs will be offline during the outage. BB&T customers can use SunTrust ATM machines without paying a fee.\n\nNASA to temporarily suspend commands to Perseverance rover\n\nNASA will put sending command signals to its Mars missions on hold starting Saturday until Oct. 16. This is because of the Mars solar conjunction, where Mars and Earth are on opposite sides of the Sun. This biennial occurrence can interfere with signals sent between the planets. \"Percy,\" as the rover has been nicknamed, has made history since its Mars landing on Feb. 18. The rover is currently in Mar's Jezero Crater, described by NASA as \"a series of ridges covered by sand dunes, boulders and rock shards,\" awaiting further instructions.\n\nConsider unplugging for World Mental Health Day\n\nDid the Facebook and Instagram outages this week have you on edge?

On Tuesday, the attackers sent the vendor screenshots showing personal data files.\n\nMcKee said the decision to shut down the system and the HealthyRhode.ri.gov website came late Friday afternoon after Deloitte discovered that dangerous malware was embedded in the RIBridges computer code.\n\n\"As part of this investigation today, we discovered that within the Rhode Island Bridges system, a cybercriminal had installed dangerous malware that constituted an urgent threat,\" McKee said at a Friday night news conference. \"That is why tonight we have shut down the system. That means customers will temporarily not be able to access any customer portal related to the services on Rhode Island Bridges.\"\n\nThe cybercriminals threatened to release personal data, including names, addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers and bank information, state Chief Information Officer Brian Tardiff said Friday night.\n\nData breach:Call center is now open to answer questions about RIBridges cyberattack.

No identify theft connected to the breach had been reported by Friday night.\n\nBut state officials urged anyone who has applied for benefits through the system since 2016 to change passwords and monitor their bank accounts for suspicious charges.\n\n\"I understand this is alarming,\" McKee said at the news conference. \"Please know that Deloitte and the state are working with law enforcement as well as IT experts to minimize the impact on Rhode Islanders.\"\n\nWhy did the state keep the breach secret for a week?\n\nMcKee said he first learned of the breach not long after Dec. 5, but the state did not disclose that there could be a problem until the breach could be confirmed and to prevent triggering the release of personal data.\n\n\"According to Deloitte, the company received a message from a cybercriminal group that they were in possession of one terabyte of data and demanded a ransom in order to not release the data in their possession,\" Tardiff said. \"When it first began, we were unsure of exactly the veracity of the cybercriminals claims, and we purposely did not take action to avoid potential triggering of further damage to the environment.\"\n\nCyberattack:Governor says stolen data could be exposed in the coming week. Here's what to do right now\n\nHe would not say how much the hackers demanded or whether any payments had been made.\n\nAlthough malicious code had been detected, Tardiff said it was not a ransomware attack, where the hackers threaten to shut down a computer system if their demands are not met. Instead, the threat was to release private information.\n\n\"This is more of an extortion-type activity by this cybercriminal group,\" he said.\n\nTardiff said no breaches have been detected in any other state computer system.\n\nWhat is RIBridges?\n\nOriginally known as the Unified Health Infrastructure Project, RIBridges launched in 2016 as a centralized benefit eligibility system for a wide range of public benefits. It encountered widespread technical and operational failures after launch, resulting in delayed benefits, major cost overruns and a lawsuit against Deloitte.\n\nThe RIBridges system serves:\n\nMedicaid\n\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\n\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families\n\nChild Care Assistance Program\n\nThe HealthSource RI health insurance exchange\n\nRhode Island Works\n\nLong-Term Services and Supports\n\nGeneral Public Assistance\n\nThe healthsourceri.com website was still live, but included a popup message about the data breach.

For the past five months, I have quit something almost as hard to give up as drinking, smoking or drugs. I decided to stop reading the news. No newspapers, no online articles, no television, no Facebook. Cold turkey, and on Thanksgiving no less.\n\nMy thinking was pretty simple: News is inherently temporary and seems like it is becoming increasingly hollow. Between print, radio, television and digital, news is now recycled repeatedly. A breaking story can be noteworthy, but by the end of a news cycle, you can’t help but feel overwhelmed by meaningless dribble. I figured there was a better use of my time. And if something important happened, I figured the news would find me.\n\nSince Thanksgiving, all of my news has come from friends, colleagues and family. My wife, Cheryl, told me about fires and mudslides in Los Angeles, my neighbor Howard told me about political misdeeds, my chief financial officer informed me of stock market ups and downs, my friend Pete alerted me to a TMZ segment that featured me as the reincarnation of an arguably better-looking dead serial killer.\n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with news, and I certainly don’t subscribe to the “it’s all fake” philosophy. Often, the writing in newspapers is brilliant and insightful. But news is, by design, skewed toward the negative.\n\nNeed a break?

They're mostly a trick and rarely a treat\n\nNegative news catches our attention, captures our imagination and scares us into reading more, because negativity looms larger in the human brain than positive events. We are controlled by our emotions, and our emotions are controlled by fear. A tiny almond-shaped part of our brain called the amygdala drives all of this. Even though it’s small, the amygdala can override our decision-making and is hyper-tuned to negativity. Inside the amygdala, a single negative event makes roughly the same impression as five positive events.\n\nOur amygdala helped the human race survive in the wild —remembering a snake bite is more important than remembering a kind word. News exploits this quirk of human nature by focusing on negative events. But since we no longer live in the wild, negativity causes more harm than good and makes us more likely to suffer from depression.\n\nStudies have shown that people who watchnegative news are more likely to be stressed or anxious. They are also more likely to think catastrophically about their personal problems and challenges, even when those things have nothing to do with the news. Issues are often portrayed in terms of worst-case scenarios on the news, and once our brains get into worst-case mode, it’s nearly impossible to claw our way out. For that reason alone, it’s unfortunate that news consumption among Americans is increasing.\n\nNo one should put his or her head in the sand, unaware of what’s going on in the world. But you can get a pretty good idea of what’s happening without news, partly thanks to friends and family, and from long-form journalism. Reading a monthly publication, for instance, is healthier and just as valuable as staying in constant contact with the 24/7 news cycle.\n\nEven a politician or businessperson can get most of what they need without hitting the Twittersphere. For my part, Twitter is now used only for posting, Instagram and Facebook for seeing friends, and I have officially locked myself out of my phone’s news and alert feeds (and its barrage of apps).\n\nMy news hiatus may not last, but my experiment has had a positive effect so far. Since dropping the habit, I am more focused on things that matter. Conversations seem to have more depth, time seems more available for family and friends, and my understanding of what is really happening in the world has actually increased. This past weekend, while everyone else was fixated on the latest news eruption from Washington, I spent my time painting with my daughter.

None of these zombie universities are accredited or cleared to receive federal financial aid – hurdles that signal legitimacy. And their motives are cloaked in a mystery no federal oversight agency seems to have tried to solve.\n\nKari Kammel, who heads the Center for Anti-Counterfeiting and Product Protection at Michigan State University, was perplexed by the counterfeit sites. At USA TODAY’s request, she reviewed them and said she suspected identity theft could be at play for some.\n\n“They figured out a way to post something, get students to apply, take application information, take credit card information, take financial aid information,” Kammel said.\n\nKnow more about zombie colleges?Tell us about it. We won't use your information without first discussing it with you.\n\nSome of the imposter websites are tied to colleges that shut down long ago, like Morrison University in Nevada, which closed its doors in 2014, or Jones International, one of the first schools to offer college courses online, which followed in 2015. Others focused on institutions whose demise came recently, including the private Catholic Marymount California University, which closed nearly two years ago.\n\nBrian W.G. Marcotte, the real Marymount California’s final president, was troubled to learn of the new website from USA TODAY. He also was confused: Why would anyone spend so much time and energy creating a replica of the school? With other former staffers, Marcotte sent a cease-and-desist letter sent to the site’s domain registrar, Namecheap Inc., and posted a warning on the actual Marymount website.\n\n“We take it pretty personally that somebody is misrepresenting what we worked so hard for 54 years to create,” Marcotte said. “And to have somebody twisting the reality of where we are right now is very troublesome to us.”\n\nThe warning was posted on April 29, and by May 6, the imposter Marymount California website had been taken down. It was one of several changes that came after USA TODAY began asking questions.\n\nBut whoever is behind the websites will have an ever-growing pool of schools to emulate as more universities close. And regulators have had mixed success in addressing counterfeit school websites.\n\nKing’s College in Charlotte, which closed in 2018, attracted the attention of the North Carolina attorney general in December 2022, according to a local television station. More than a year later, that office is, “working with tech companies to limit the reach of these fraudsters to help prevent others from falling victim to the scam,” according to Olivia Weidie, deputy press secretary, who would not divulge precisely what the website was accused of doing.\n\nThat imposter website remains online.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission declined to say whether the websites even fall under its purview. In 2018, the agency fined operators of what appeared to be military recruiting websites, including one at army.com. But those sites were actually mining marketing leads for colleges. The fine, later suspended, was about $12 million, and the operators were required to surrender the domain names for the imposter sites.\n\nThe Education Department confirmed that the nine schools identified by USA TODAY were closed and that it didn’t approve the accreditor some of the universities claim. But the agency said it does not oversee unrecognized accrediting agencies or schools that are ineligible for federal aid.\n\nThough a web of connections links many of the closed universities, a nagging question remains: Where is the spider?\n\nAdministrators listed on the schools’ websites have almost no digital footprint. Phone numbers lead to prerecorded messages that in turn lead nowhere. Google Street View shows listed addresses often are nondescript office buildings instead of campuses.\n\nThe Stratford address, now in Kentucky, is a law office. When asked if it was home to a university, a receptionist there said no.\n\nOnline, Stratford provides information about its business, computer science, law and other degrees but posts no list of professors who teach advertised courses or schedule of when classes start. Are they offered online or in person? Does the school admit people on a rolling basis or do new students have to wait until the fall semester to start?\n\nWith no indication of whom to ask, I decided to apply to Stratford. I sent in an essay and the $75 application fee. Then, like aspiring university students across the country, all I could do was wait.\n\nNonexistent students, barely there administrators and a made-up bakery\n\nFormer Stratford University students provided the tip about the school’s resurrection because they were worried. The Education Department typically cancels federal financial aid debt for students if their university closes unexpectedly, as happened with Stratford. Some of the students haven’t gotten their debt forgiven yet, they said, and they feared it was because the college appeared to remain viable.\n\nA quick look suggested something was amiss.\n\nWhen the original Stratford was still open, its homepage featured a smiling dark-haired woman in a pink cardigan alongside the motto “Changing Lives… One Student at a Time.” The new Stratford website features the same woman and motto. The two websites also share a blue-and-white color scheme.\n\nFrom there, the replica version quickly veers into some unusual new territory. The school’s past president was Richard R. Shurtz, who didn’t return calls or requests for comment. The leader of the replicated website is described as a headmaster, a title seldom used in America. His name? Jonathan Doe.\n\nTracing titles, backgrounds and images leads down some winding paths.\n\nA reverse image search showed Jonathan Doe’s headshot is in high demand across the internet. He is identified as a speaker at a Norwegian church, the author of a book on currency trading, a dental office patient.\n\nThat's because his image is for sale on Adobe’s marketplace, described as a “studio portrait of a confident businessman.”\n\nA review of the school’s “Board of Trusties (sic)” does reference a university president, Silas Hawthorne, and a chief academic officer, Theron Beaumont. Neither could be located in real life despite their unusual names. A blog post says Thaddeus Ellington, the dean of students, used to teach at California Marymount University, but there’s no record of Ellington serving at that college – or any other.\n\nStudent profiles also appear to have been fabricated. Some undergrads are described as having played sports for the university, a difficult feat since the original Stratford hadn’t fielded teams for years. Rachel Stevens’ biography mentions her work at her family’s business, the Sweet Moments Bakery in Fairfax, Virginia. There’s no indication such a bakery ever existed.\n\nStevens’ student profile also is posted on a website called Hozpitality.com – with a “z.” That site is described as a “Social Media and Networking platform focussed (sic) on the Hospitality Industry,” with offices in Canada, Dubai and India.\n\nAnother post on that site gives Stratford University a backstory, acknowledging in broken English that it closed two years ago but is now on the upswing.\n\n“Despite early successes, SU encountered challenges leading to a temporary closure in Fall 22,” the post reads in part. “After 46 years of providing unwavering global service and high-quality education. Declining enrollment and financial restructuring needs prompted a difficult decision.”\n\nHozpitality’s website features posts about eight other closed universities that suggest they remain open. As with Stratford, some address their closure, saying they reopened thanks to an influx of dollars. For three – Colorado Heights, Jones International and Urbana University – the posts say an “EEI investment” made their reopening possible. They don’t specify what EEI is or why it’s interested in funding closed American colleges.\n\nAs I continued my reporting, the application pages for several colleges vanished. The replica website for Nyack College also came down after I reached out to Christian & Missionary Alliance, the group that had been affiliated with the former small Christian school. Hannah Castro, a spokeswoman for the group, said that the organization wasn’t aware of the website but that its legal counsel was “handling the situation.”\n\nThe state of Colorado was listed on websites as having approved four of the colleges. Megan McDermott, spokeswoman for the state Department of Higher Education, told me that was not the case. Her agency referred the cases to the Colorado Attorney General’s Office.\n\nAnyone with pocket change can look like a university online\n\nUncovering who is behind these websites proves to be a tall order. There are no restrictions on who can register sites through .college, .university, .education or .org web addresses − the domain endings used by the counterfeit universities.\n\nThey’re also cheap to register. A .education domain name, for example, costs only about $20 for a year via Google. That means anyone can throw up a website that seems like a place offering higher education.\n\nThe domain names do set them apart, because most American universities use .edu for their websites. That ending is generally reserved for institutions approved by an accreditor – quasi-governmental bodies certified by the federal government to ensure colleges meet a minimum academic threshold.\n\nNone of the zombie universities have been approved by recognized accreditors. A few do claim to be accredited by organizations like Gulf HEC or the United States Learning Commission – none recognized by the federal government.\n\nThough .edu domains require institutions to report who is behind them in public registries, other domain endings do not. What was available for the zombie schools was only the country where the web addresses are or were registered – the U.S., Australia, Iceland and Panama – and how much they cost.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies and internet regulators can get access to private domain information. In some cases, they can even force bad actors to take down websites.\n\nThat is how Somsak Jinaphan and his company, IDigitalAsset LLC, got caught. They had been tied to several cases of cybersquatting, which involves creating a web address nearly identical to an established business or brand, then offering turn it over or take it down – for a price.\n\nIn the mid-2010s, Jinaphan’s company registered a knockoff version of the private liberal arts school Davidson College, under the web address Davidson.College. The college uses Davidson.edu, and it wanted that fake address taken down.\n\nDavidson College’s board of trustees filed a complaint under the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers’ domain dispute policy. That body oversees web addresses worldwide. In the complaint, the trustees accused Jinaphan of using the counterfeit site to host ads and had put the knockoff url up for sale.\n\nAn independent panelist agreed with the school and required Jinaphan to turn the address over to the college.\n\nBack in 2017, Jinaphan also was listed as the owner of the domain stratford.university, according to the domain registry lookup, WHOXY. Jinaphan didn’t respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment, and the website’s current owner has opted to withhold their name.\n\nMartin Calihan, who was the last president of King’s College in Charlotte, faced a situation similar to Davidson’s. He told an NBC affiliate in 2022 that he had spent more than six months trying to get the fake website taken down. The University of North Carolina system in 2023 even sent a cease-and-desist letter. Calihan told the trade publication Inside Higher Ed that he also had set up a website warning of the scam.\n\nDespite those efforts, the copycat version of the King’s College website remains live. That’s likely, Kammel said, because the actual university is closed. Only the owner of a trademark can sue to enforce it, she said, and it’s impossible for a closed business to exercise that right.\n\nStill, Kammel had thought the media attention back then would have caused the website to go dark. Given that it’s still up, she wondered where the money was going for it and the other sites.\n\nI had the same question. I hoped following my application fee to Stratford might begin to offer some clues.\n\nWhat are these universities? How are they connected?\n\nIt had been more than a decade since I applied to any college, but luckily the Stratford application was straightforward. In addition to the essay, it required standard materials such as academic transcripts and proof of English proficiency for international students.\n\nIt also asked for a copy of a driver’s license or passport – and the corresponding numbers.\n\nI wanted to see how deep this rabbit hole went, but I wanted to hold on to my identity, so I skipped the field for driver’s license number and uploaded a redacted version of my ID.\n\nFor the application fee, I shielded my credit by setting up a temporary card that still allowed me to track transactions. The location to send the fee to was identified only as “Wire Now.” Once I did, I was charged a foreign transaction fee – another sign pointing to offshore operators.\n\nA few minutes later, a confirmation arrived in my inbox.\n\n“Taking the first step is often the most difficult. We congratulate you on that!” the message read. “With the submission of your application, it will take between 3-6 weeks before we return with a decision as we screen through each applicant carefully.”\n\nThere was no way to reply to the email, no one named in it and no contact information other than a generic email already present on the university’s website.\n\nI chose Stratford because I had written about its closure, but the process would probably have been the same for any of the other resurrected universities. Every one of their applications asks nearly identical questions: What are your goals in life? Why do you want to attend this university? And what do you hope to achieve with a university education?\n\nThey all also request similar identifying information, charge a $75 application fee and warn applicants that their personal information will be stored.\n\nSimilarities don’t end with the application forms, either. Jones International and Stratford, for example, use identical language to describe their law programs.\n\n“The Law Center at Stratford University is ranked as one of the top two law schools in the country in offering energy-specific courses, especially those in oil and gas,” reads the Stratford description. Jones International simply subs in “Jones International.”\n\nPerhaps the strongest tie is that someone set up limited liability companies in California under the names of the closed institutions. Some of the companies list EEI Education as their manager, although it’s unclear whether that is the same EEI referenced in the Hozpitality postings. Those companies also share common addresses and business officers, including CEO Teoh Tong Wah and Roy Virgen Jr.\n\nWah doesn’t have much of a web presence that I could locate. His listed address in Singapore is a massive shopping complex. Virgen would be a different story.\n\nWho raised these universities from the dead?\n\nVirgen is in the business of advising and launching new colleges through his company, American Education Inc. He is listed as the CEO of at least two universities, which include American Management University and Southern Valley University.\n\nOnline, Virgen appears to lead a full life. In addition to his role as CEO of several colleges – usually a full-time job – he is identified as an adjunct lecturer at several schools, including two University of California campuses. He also had several acting and producing credits for movies, including “Amityville Shark House” and “Bermuda Island.”\n\nI reached out to the Gmail associated with his IMDB account but did not expect a response. Within hours, he called to explain.\n\nThe movies, he said, were just for fun. He said his company often helps set up new universities, especially in California. He added that he had let colleges use his name as the leader of their institutions but stopped after some institutions did so without permission.\n\nAsked about the resurrected colleges, Virgen offered contradictory snippets of information. He said in a phone call that a Singapore group had approached him about relaunching the Morrison brand. The group told him it had acquired the university’s name and wanted to bring it back as an accredited college. But in a later email, he said “Morrison University” had sought consultation from his group in 2021, nearly seven years after the school had closed.\n\nOn the phone call, he said he worked to set up an LLC under the Morrison University name. The plan was to restart the college in California and offer courses to students from certain professional organizations. That, he said, would allow the school to sidestep the normal bureaucracy associated with opening a new college.\n\nUltimately, Virgen said the state of California denied the application, which he attributed to news coverage of Morrison’s closure. He noted that his group would sometimes get “strange phone calls” from prospective students with questions about the university’s address, which appears to be an office building in Pasadena, California.\n\nVirgen said he offered to set up a new university under a different name, but the Singapore group was not interested. So he cut ties, he said, and “that’s where I left it at.”\n\nIn an initial conversation, Virgen didn’t mention the other LLCs that have his name or his company’s mailing address. Asked via email why many of the closed schools had his company’s street address as their mailing address, he didn’t directly respond.\n\n“We will take more time in vetting future clients as well as letting them know not to use our address on their websites so that our information is not copied by others,” he wrote. “Also, we are looking for ways to get illegitimate sites to stop using our programmatic information or implying that I or my business are consulting with them.”\n\nVirgen was also listed as the CEO of Florida Grace College, a website that was taken down after I asked Virgen about it. He later said in the email that it was a school that hadn’t “got off the ground and so we let the website lapse.”\n\nI asked for the name of his client in Singapore, but he didn’t provide it. He also did not respond when I asked whether he had helped set up California LLCs named after Jones International, Kings College, Southern Vermont College or Urbana University.\n\nThough it was clear these universities were trying to present a distorted reality, Virgen got me no closer to knowing why. It had been two weeks and I still hadn’t heard back from Stratford, either, so it was time for me to try another school.\n\nHow many fake colleges are there online?\n\nThe Ministry of Higher Education Commission describes itself as a college accreditor, and Jones International, Southern Vermont and Urbana University claim it approved their operations. It’s not recognized by the federal government, but a review of the ministry’s membership rolls online revealed a whole new world of misrepresentations and fake colleges.\n\nThe ministry claims to have approved real universities such as Carnegie Mellon and the University of Phoenix – which actually are accredited by federally recognized agencies.\n\nIt also claims dozens of clearly fictitious schools, like “University of Wayne State Pennsylvania.” That school’s website appears to be an amalgamation of Wayne State University, a public school in Detroit, and Pennsylvania State University. “New York Central University” evokes New York University, with a logo reminiscent of the iconic NYU torch.\n\nNot listed on the site are the three who claimed it: Jones International, Southern Vermont or Urbana University. Stratford is listed on the ministry’s website, but the ministry isn’t listed on Stratford’s site.\n\nThe set of universities that appear on the ministry website were more direct about the information they want from applicants. Questions about what I would do with a university education were replaced by questions about how well-connected I am. One asked whether I was a business owner, a “high profile corporate,” or an option that reads: “I belong to Royal Family.”\n\nI opted for the student option at the City University of Michigan but couldn’t find an actual application form. I closed the window thinking that was the end of it only to receive a call later that same day from Gary Rice, who said he was from the City University of Michigan. I made it clear that I am a reporter, but that did not deter him.\n\nRice asked what I had studied as an undergrad – creative writing. He then suggested I would be a perfect match for a master’s degree in … creative writing.\n\nLike the first batch of schools, City University of Michigan wanted a record of my past studies and my driver’s license. It also wanted a copy of my passport and didn’t offer alternatives when I explained that I am one of the roughly 50% of Americans who don’t have one.\n\nRice, who said he was a professor in charge of talking to potential students, said that once I submitted that information I could start my studies right away − no application fee required.\n\nAfter we hung up, I looked up the college’s address. Google Street View turned up an empty parking structure,\n\nThere was another suitor in the wings, though. True to their word, the folks behind Stratford got back to me in about three weeks in an email that landed at 10 p.m. East Coast time. It shared “exciting news.” I had been accepted. It would take me only a year to earn my undergraduate degree at a monthly cost of $2,530.\n\nNothing on this journey could be simple, though. I had applied to Stratford but the email announcing my acceptance came from Vanguard College, with a web address that corresponded with a Singapore web address.\n\nVanguard’s website offers little about itself. It does include links to pay for degrees through other colleges, specifically the Swiss School of Management and the International American University, which is accredited in the U.S.\n\nSerena Magnanti, the Swiss School of Management’s vice president, told me it had partnered with Vanguard College “solely for recruitment purposes.”\n\n“Regarding the links on Vanguard College’s website, while we were not previously aware of the details, we are actively investigating the process and purpose behind them,” she wrote. “Please rest assured that we are fully committed to looking into this matter and ensuring transparency.”\n\nThe International American University didn’t respond to questions, but a staff member did cc me when they forwarded my email to the university’s president, Ryan Doan.\n\n“Hi RD, FYI,” the message read.\n\nThe Vanguard website also features student testimonials via a YouTube video in which they seem to be referencing working with a college coaching company, not an actual college. The acceptance email implored me to reach out if I needed help. So I responded: “I thought I had applied to Stratford University, but I see you are emailing me from an address tied to Vanguard College? Can you explain?”\n\nNo response, but days later, I received another email from a Stratford University address from someone new, who urged me to check my email for my acceptance letter.\n\n“I did receive a message from someone saying I was accepted to the university, but it came from Vanguard College,” I wrote on April 29. “Can you explain the connection there? I thought I had applied to Stratford?”\n\nAgain, crickets. But by April 30, I had a different kind of answer: The “apply now” button had disappeared from Stratford’s website and the web address for the application page returned a 404 error.\n\nMuch like the actual Stratford, the imposter seems to be closed for business − at least for now.\n\nChris Quintana is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team with a background in higher education and student loans.

Penney trying to avoid liquidation, smaller retailers closing or requesting rent relief, and venues like theaters still temporarily shut down due to COVID-19, anywhere from 1 in 4 malls to 1 in 2 could go out of business altogether, analysts projected.\n\nSave better, spend better: Money tips and advice delivered right to your inbox.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe bleak turn of events has provided more fuel to online retailers already swiping market share away from malls that were relying on diminishing foot traffic to apparel shops and department stores in particular.\n\n“There are malls that this crisis will accelerate their closure, no doubt,” said Kat Cole, president and chief operating officer of Focus Brands, parent company of mall classics like Cinnabon and Auntie Anne’s. “How many is anybody’s guess, but we’re hoping it’s a minority.”\n\nBed Bath & Beyond store closings:Bed Bath announces plans to permanently close 200 stores over next two years\n\nFace mask requirements:Can stores make you wear a mask? Do kids have to wear masks?\n\nAnalysts at Coresight Research, which tracks retail closures, projected that about 25% of America’s malls would disappear within the next three to five years.\n\nBut that could rise to as many as 50% “if we can’t stop the bleeding,” Coresight CEO Deborah Weinswig said in an interview. “That ends up changing the face of America.”\n\nIn general, analysts say that high-end “A” malls are in the best shape because their luxury retail tenants have higher profit margins and thus are better able to withstand the downturn. But so-called “B” and “C” malls, which have lower-priced stores and more vacancies, are facing a high risk of closure.\n\n“They’re trying to plug the holes in a dam,” Weinswig said.\n\nEven malls that bet big on in-person experiences that were considered to be extremely resilient in the age of digital retail are suddenly experiencing nothing but pain.\n\n“A lot of the things that malls have built-in like gyms, movie theaters and restaurants, food service are just not able to operate and pull in customers the way they once did,” Saunders said. “They’re either having to shut down or limit capacity or customers are very reluctant to go there.”\n\nMall occupancy rates hit their lowest level in at least a decade in the second quarter of 2020 at 94.4%, according to CoStar Group, which tracks real estate.\n\nOf the nation’s 1,793 enclosed shopping malls, nearly 500 “are at risk due to their location being poor” or “due to their dependence” on office workers or tourism for foot traffic, CoStar senior consultant Kevin Cody said.\n\nRetailers filing for bankruptcy\n\nWhile some retailers have flourished during the pandemic, nearly all of them – such as Walmart, Target, Kroger and Home Depot – offered essential services of some kind, including groceries and home improvement goods. Few are typically located in malls.\n\nOn the other hand, department stores and apparel retailers, which dominate most malls, have been floundering. And many are already facing existential crises.\n\nRecent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings have included department store chains J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus as well as apparel retailers Brooks Brothers and J. Crew. Those four have said they hope to use the restructuring process to cut debt and emerge as more sustainable companies.\n\nBut their plans also include hundreds of store closures, including 242 planned by J.C. Penney alone, raising the prospect that malls throughout the country will be hollowed out in the coming months.\n\nRetailers have already announced the closure of more than 80 million square feet of space so far in 2020, according to CoStar. That compared with 114 million for all of 2019, which had the liquidation of Payless ShoeSource, Gymboree and Charlotte Russe.\n\n“Malls are going to certainly see a lot of those closures. And I think that mall owners are going to have to get creative in order to survive,” CoStar consultant Robin Trantham said.\n\nStore closings 2020:As many as 25,000 stores could permanently close this year due to COVID-19 impact\n\nCOVID-19 changing liquidation sales:JCPenney, Tuesday Morning, Pier 1 going-out-of-business sales different because of COVID-19\n\nBill Taubman, chief operating officer of Taubman Centers, one of the largest mall property owners in the country, pointed out that most of the retailers that have tumbled into bankruptcy in recent months had significant challenges before the pandemic erupted.\n\nFor example, J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus and J. Crew had billions of dollars in debt that weighed them down, placing them on watch-lists for Chapter 11.\n\n“The COVID crisis has impacted them in a way that has deteriorated their business plan. I can agree with that for sure. But I don't know that COVID was the cause of the issue to begin with,” Taubman said.\n\nBut he acknowledged that the pandemic will require malls to adapt their approach, especially because retail leasing is not expected to rebound quickly, even if a vaccine ultimately puts an end to the crisis.\n\n“I think we're seeing a higher rate of evolution right now than we have in the past and we're going to have to move,” Taubman said. “But there are so many new tenants out there that are interested in space and interested in experiencing bricks and mortar and I don't think that's going to fade. I think it's going to take a hiatus for a while because people don't have the money right now.”\n\nThe challenges facing department stores, in particular, are especially problematic for malls – and not just because of the foot traffic they’re supposed to deliver. Many malls also have clauses in their leases that allow other, smaller tenants to leave if anchor tenants drop out.\n\n“The department store is just a format that does not work anymore,” said Chris Kuiper, a CFRA Research stock analyst who tracks mall companies. “People don’t want to wade through a four-story megastore to find a couple of items. So instead of these anchors being a traffic generator, they became an anchor in a literal sense, dragging down these malls.”\n\nExperiential model fades\n\nThe great hope for malls was supposed to be a sharp pivot toward experiences and services. But in-person, indoor interaction is considered one of the riskiest activities during the pandemic – and thus many of those operations have been shut down for months, with little promise of reopening soon amid an outbreak in states like Texas, Arizona and Florida.\n\n“That has unfortunately turned into a massive liability because those are the things that are going to stay closed,” Kuiper said. “So they’re really facing no good options at this point.”\n\nThe key question is whether the experiential model is finished or simply on hold.\n\nPhiladelphia resident Marta Rusek, 35, considers herself a lifelong mall shopper and before the pandemic was regularly going to the AMC movie theater at her local mall.\n\nNow, Rusek, who works as a nonprofit organizer and has a compromised immune system, has no plans to return anytime soon. She even recently dreamt about going to a mall again but called it a “COVID-19 nightmare” because in the dream she accidentally left her mask at home.\n\n“I'm not going to feel safe going into the theater or being around large crowds of people until the day those magic words that ‘there's a vaccine available and it's over’ are spoken,” Rusek said.\n\nOn that day, malls that had bet on food, entertainment, fitness centers and other services could zoom right back to the front of the pack.\n\nMichael Brown, a partner in the consumer practice of global strategy and management consultancy Kearney who has studied the future of retail, said the experiential model remains compelling for malls in the long run.\n\n“We all believe that the COVID pandemic is temporary. We don’t know if it’s temporary for six, 12, 18 months or longer, but it is temporary,” Brown said. “At some point in time, we will gather in public together to enjoy dining or entertainment or sports or recreation together. That’s why we say this is really just an accelerator. The strong will survive, but they will take a financial hit in the short term.”\n\nCOVID-19 impacts:AMC theater chain warns that it may not survive disruption from coronavirus pandemic\n\nShopping reinvented:America's stores, malls reopen with masks, curbside pickup and closed fitting rooms\n\nBrown rejected the suggestion that Americans will stay away from mall restaurants, for example, after the pandemic.\n\n“Dining at home is nice, but the food doesn’t arrive as hot, it’s not presented as well and somebody always has to do the dishes when you’re done,” Brown said. “So it’s not a substitute for dining out.”\n\nDespite short-term difficulties for tenants like fitness centers, which have been forced to shut down in many states, malls are still likely to move in that direction when this is over if only because of the pressure e-commerce continues to place on physical stores, CoStar’s Trantham said.\n\n“While it may take a while for fitness centers and restaurants to expand at the same rate as they were before, we will still believe that they will recover eventually,” Trantham said.\n\nIn the long run, mall property owners may need to pivot once again, turning toward alternative options for their space, like hotels, apartments, or online product fulfillment centers, analysts say.\n\n“Real estate is real estate, so if you’ve got a good piece of land you can turn that into something totally different,” Kuiper said.\n\nThey also need to invest in new ideas like consolidated areas within the mall where shoppers can pick up products that they bought online from retailers located inside the mall, analysts said.\n\nHowever, many malls can’t make long-term plans right now. They’re too busy dealing with the present.\n\nFor example, mall owner CBL & Associates warned in a public filing that it faces a risk of going out of business. The company missed a key interest payment in June, having racked up about $4.5 billion in debt.\n\nCBL, which has 108 properties in 26 states, reported rental revenue of $161 million in the first quarter, down 18.5% from a year earlier, as store closures, rent concessions and bankruptcies took a toll.\n\n“There’s just too much debt on these assets that will never produce that level of cash flow anymore,” Kuiper said.\n\nMalls come under pressure to provide rent relief\n\nIn many cases, retail tenants are requesting rent relief from mall property owners as they navigate the crisis. Nordstrom, J.C. Penney and The Cheesecake Factory are examples of retailers that have either failed to pay in full or are negotiating temporary rent reductions.\n\n“They don’t have to close if the mall developers can figure out how to restructure their rents to make sense for their tenants,” Focus Brands executive Cole said, referring in general to retailers that are seeking a break.\n\nWithout rent relief, store closures could accelerate. That will undermine mall finances and place additional pressure on them because with additional vacancies, remaining tenants won’t want to pay full price for the space either, Saunders said.\n\n“In the present environment, it’s going to be really difficult for the mall and property owners to fill those gaps,” Saunders said.\n\nOne alternative to rent relief might be for mall owners and retailers to join forces.\n\nMall owners Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners are reportedly considering a joint bid to buy J.C. Penney in a strategy that mall companies have deployed with increasing frequency in recent years. In February, Simon was part of a group that agreed to buy fashion retailer Forever 21 out of bankruptcy, and in 2016, Simon was part of a group that bought fashion retailer Aéropostale out of bankruptcy.\n\nOfficials with Simon and Brookfield declined to comment on the reports.\n\n“They’re thinking they’re going to save themselves by saving their customer – the one that pays them rent,” Kuiper said.\n\nLucky Brand bankruptcy:Lucky Brand files for bankruptcy citing COVID-19, looks to sell company to Aéropostale owner. Is your store closing?\n\n'Wearing a mask is not about fear':Retailer group urges governors to require everyone to wear a mask\n\nBut it’s a risky proposition because mall property owners don’t have much experience running retail operations that are subject to the whims of fashion and the challenges of competing with digital players like Amazon.\n\n“The whole advantage of being the landlord is you don’t care who your tenants are as long as they pay rent,” Kuiper said. “I get what they’re doing, and it might make sense on one level, but long term I just don’t see it.”\n\nEven in a best-case scenario, malls are “going to be weakened coming out” of the pandemic, said Nick Shields, an analyst at Third Bridge who covers retail and real estate investment trusts.\n\nOutdoor malls are best positioned to make it through, he said. “This is their time to shine.”\n\nMall owners will need to collaborate closely with tenants and local officials to come up with creative solutions to survive this crisis, in addition rent relief, said Coresight’s Weinswig. But a bevy of lawsuits by landlords against retailers for a failure to pay rent points to an adversarial posture that could lead to a downward spiral.\n\n“I think the back half (of 2020) is going to be unlike anything we’ve ever seen,” she said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporters Nathan Bomey and Kelly Tyko on Twitter @NathanBomey and @KellyTyko.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/09/29/biltmore-estate-what-we-know-in-the-aftermath-of-asheville-flooding/75434207007/", "title": "Biltmore Estate: What we know in the aftermath of Asheville flooding", "text": "(This story will be updated)\n\nThe Biltmore Estate is assessing damage and will remain temporarily closed after devastating rain from Tropical Storm Helene caused catastrophic flooding in the Asheville area.\n\n\"Due to significant flooding, impassable roads and widespread power outages in our region from Tropical Storm Helene, Biltmore is temporarily closed,\" read a statement Saturday on the social media account for the historic house and museum.\n\nUPDATE:Biltmore Estate shares first look at Helene damage, parts of property had 'significant flooding'\n\nThey are asking people to check biltmore.com/weather-update for the latest.

And voting is already underway in 20 states. CBS news polling shows this remains a race either presidential candidate could win. The CBS news vice presidential debate starts now.\n\nJD VANCE: Fight for every single vote, and we're going to take this country back.\n\nTIM WALZ: And we are ready to continue to build the future together.\n\nJD VANCE: We're going to turn this whole country red with President Donald J. Trump's leadership.\n\nTIM WALZ: You know, it's at the end of this little journey? Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States.\n\nThis is a CBS news special. Live from CBS news headquarters in New York. America decides the Vice Presidential debate.\n\nNORAH O' DONNELL: Good evening. I'm Norah O'Donnell and thank you for joining us for tonight's CBS news vice presidential debate. We want to welcome our viewers on CBS, on other networks here in the US and around the world. We have a consequential night ahead, and our focus is the issues that matter to you, the voter. Let's introduce the candidates: Minnesota's democratic governor Tim Walz and Ohio's republican senator JD Vance. Tonight, meeting for the first time.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan. In order to have a thoughtful and civil debate, these are the rules that both campaigns have agreed to. Questions will be directed at one candidate who will have two minutes to respond. The other candidate will be allowed two minutes for rebuttal. Then each candidate will get another minute to make further points, with an additional 1 minute each at the discretion of the moderator. The primary role of the moderators is to facilitate the debate between the candidates, enforce the rules, and provide the candidates with the opportunity to fact check claims made by each other.\n\nNORAH O' DONNELL: CBS news reserves the right to mute the candidates microphones to maintain decorum. We have not shared the questions or topics with the campaigns. The stage is set. Governor, Senator, thank you for joining us. Let's get started. Tonight, our country is facing several unfolding crises. The Middle East is on the brink of war. Americans are suffering from the catastrophic impact of Hurricane Helene and now a labor strike as 25,000 dock workers from Maine to Texas are picketing. We're going to begin tonight with the Middle East, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. Earlier today, Iran launched its largest attack yet on Israel. But that attack failed thanks to joint US and Israeli defensive action. President Biden has deployed more than 40,000 US military personnel and assets to that region over the past year to try to prevent a regional war. Iran is weakened, but the US still considers it the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, and it has drastically reduced the time it would take to develop a nuclear weapon. It is down now to one or two weeks time. Governor Walz, if you are the final voice in the situation room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran? You have two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, thank you. And thank you for those joining at home tonight. Let's keep in mind where this started. October 7th, Hamas terrorists massacred over 1400 Israelis and took prisoners. Iran, or, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental, getting its hostages back, fundamental, and ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute, fundamental necessity for the United States to have the steady leadership there. You saw it experienced today, where, along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, able to stop the incoming attack. But what's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter. It's clear. And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80 year old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment. But it's not just that. It's those that were closest to Donald Trump that understand how dangerous he is when the world is this dangerous. His Chief of Staff, John Kelly, said that he was the most flawed humanity being he’d ever met. And both of his Secretaries of Defense and his national security advisors said he should be nowhere near the White House. Now, the person closest to them, to Donald Trump, said he’s unfit for the highest office. That was Senator Vance. What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership. We've seen a calmness that is able to be able to draw on the coalitions, to bring them together, understanding that our allies matter. When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed. And as the Vice President said today, is we will protect our forces and our allied forces, and there will be consequences.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator Vance, the same question, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: So, Margaret, I want to answer the question. First of all, thanks, Governor. Thanks to CBS for hosting the debate. And thanks most importantly to the American people who are watching this evening and caring enough about this country to pay attention to this Vice Presidential debate. I want to answer the question, but I want to actually give an introduction to myself a little bit because I recognize a lot of Americans don't know who either one of us are. I was raised in a working class family. My mother required food assistance for periods of her life. My grandmother required Social Security help to raise me. And she raised me in part because my own mother struggled with addiction for a big chunk of my early life. I went to college on the GI bill after I enlisted in the Marine Corps and served in Iraq. And so I stand here asking to be your Vice President with extraordinary gratitude for this country, for the American dream that made it possible for me to live my dreams. And most importantly, I know that a lot of you are worried about the chaos in the world and the feeling that the American Dream is unattainable. I want to try to convince you tonight over the next 90 minutes that if we get better leadership in the White House, if we get Donald Trump back in the White House, the American Dream is going to be attainable once again. Now, to answer this particular question, we have to remember that as much as Governor Walz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence. People were afraid of stepping out of line. Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration. What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies and, God forbid, potentially launching against the United States as well. Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States’ global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world. Now, you asked about a preemptive strike, Margaret, and I want to answer the question. Look, it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe. And we should support our allies wherever they are when they're fighting the bad guys. I think that's the right approach to take with the Israel question.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator. Governor Walz, do you care to respond to any of the allegations?\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, look, Donald Trump was in office. We'll sometimes hear a revisionist history, but when Donald Trump was in office, it was Donald Trump who… we had a coalition of nations that had boxed Iran's nuclear program in in the inability to advance it. Donald Trump pulled that program and put nothing else in its place. So Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership. And when Iran shot down an American aircraft in international airspace, Donald Trump tweeted, because that's the standard diplomacy of Donald Trump. And when Iranian missiles did fall near US troops and they received traumatic brain injuries, Donald Trump wrote it off as headaches. Look, our allies understand that Donald Trump is fickle. He will go to whoever has the most flattery or where it makes sense to him. Steady leadership like you witnessed today, like you witnessed in April. Both Iranian attacks were repelled. Our coalition is strong, and we need the steady leadership that Kamala Harris is providing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, the US did have a diplomatic deal with Iran to temporarily pause parts of its nuclear program, and President Trump did exit that deal. He recently said just five days ago, the US must now make a diplomatic deal with Iran because the consequences are impossible. Did he make a mistake? You have 1 minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Margaret, diplomacy is not a dirty word, but I think that's something that Governor Walz just said is quite extraordinary. You, yourself, just said Iran is as close to a nuclear weapon today as they have ever been. And, Governor Walz, you blame Donald Trump, who has been the Vice President for the last three and a half years, and the answer is your running mate, not mine. Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure. Now, we talk about the sequence of events that led us to where we are right now, and you can't ignore October the 7th, which I appreciate Governor Walz bringing up. But when did Iran and Hamas and their proxies attack Israel? It was during the administration of Kamala Harris. So Governor Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world. Donald Trump has already done it once before. Ask yourself at home, when, when was the last time? I'm 40 years old. When was the last time that an American President didn't have a major conflict, breakout? The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was President.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, we have a lot to get to. Norah?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Margaret, thank you. Let's turn now to Hurricane Helene. The storm could become one of the deadliest on record. More than 160 people are dead and hundreds more are missing. Scientists say climate change makes these hurricanes larger, stronger and more deadly because of the historic rainfall. Senator Vance, according to CBS news polling, seven in ten Americans and more than 60% of Republicans under the age of 45 favor the US taking steps to try and reduce climate change. Senator, what responsibility would the Trump administration have to try and reduce the impact of climate change? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Sure. So first of all, let's start with the hurricane because it's an unbelievable, unspeakable human tragedy. I just saw today, actually, a photograph of two grandparents on a roof with a six year old child, and it was the last photograph ever taken of them because the roof collapsed and those innocent people lost their lives. And I'm sure Governor Walz joins me in saying our hearts go out to those innocent people, our prayers go out to them. And we want as robust and aggressive as a federal response as we can get to save as many lives as possible. And then, of course, afterwards, to help the people in those communities rebuild. I mean, these are communities that I love, some of them I know very personally. In Appalachia, all across the Southeast, they need their government to do their job. And I commit that when Donald Trump is president again, the government will put the citizens of this country first when they suffer from a disaster. And Norah, you asked about climate change. I think this is a very important issue. Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer, but one of the things that I've noticed some of our democratic friends talking a lot about is a concern about carbon emissions. This idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument, so we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true. Well, if you believe that, what would you, what would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world. What have Kamala Harris's policies actually led to? More energy production in China, more manufacturing overseas, more doing business in some of the dirtiest parts of the entire world. When I say that, I mean the amount of carbon emissions they're doing per unit of economic output. So if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water, the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people. And unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor Walz, you have two minutes to respond.\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, we got close to an agreement because all those things are happening. Look, first of all, it is a horrific tragedy with this hurricane, and my heart goes out to the folks that are down there in contact with the Governors. I serve as co-chair of the council of governors as we work together on these emergency managements. Governors know no partisanship. They work together to… all of the Governors and the emergency responders are on the ground. Those happen on the front end. The federal government comes in, makes sure they're there, that we recover. But we're still in that phase where we need to make sure that they're staying there, staying focused. Now, look, coming back to the climate change issue, there's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen. Senator Vance has said that there's a climate problem in the past, Donald Trump called it a hoax and then joked that these things would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in. What we've seen out of the Harris administration now, the Biden Harris administration is, we've seen this investment, we've seen massive investments, the biggest in global history that we've seen in the Inflation Reduction Act, has created jobs all across the country. Two thousand in Jeffersonville, Ohio. Taking the EV technology that we invented and making it here. Two hundred thousand jobs across the country. The largest solar manufacturing plant in North America sits in Minnesota. But my farmers know climate change is real. They've seen 500 year droughts, 500 year floods, back to back. But what they're doing is adapting, and this has allowed them to tell me, “Look, I harvest corn, I harvest soybean, and I harvest wind.” We are producing more natural gas and more oil at any time than we ever have. We're also producing more clean energy. So the solution for us is to continue to move forward, that climate change is real. Reducing our impact is absolutely critical. But this is not a false choice. You can do that at the same time you're creating the jobs that we're seeing all across the country. That's exactly what this administration has done. We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current. And that's what absolutely makes sense. And then we start thinking about, “How do we mitigate these disasters?”\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you, Senator. I want to give you an opportunity to respond there. The Governor mentioned that President Trump has called climate change a hoax. Do you agree?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, look, what the President has said is that if the Democrats, in particular, Kamala Harris and her leadership, if they really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America, and that's not what they're doing. So clearly, Kamala Harris herself doesn't believe her own rhetoric on this. If she did, she would actually agree with Donald Trump's energy policies. Now, something Governor Walz said, I think is important to touch upon, because when we talk about “clean energy,” I think that's a slogan that often the Democrats will use here. I'm talking, of course, about the Democratic leadership. And the real issue is that if you're spending hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars of American taxpayer money on solar panels that are made in China, number one, you're going to make the economy dirtier. We should be making more of those solar panels here in the United States of America.\n\nTIM WALZ: We are. In Minnesota.\n\nJD VANCE: Some of them are, Tim, but a lot of them are being made overseas in China, especially the components that go into those solar panels. So if you really want to make the environment cleaner, you've got to invest in more energy production. We haven't built a nuclear facility, I think one, in the past 40 years. Natural gas. We got to invest more in it. Kamala Harris has done the opposite. That's raised energy prices and also meant that we're doing worse by the climate.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, your time is up. Governor, would you like to respond?\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, look, we're producing more natural gas than we ever have. There's no moratorium on that. We're producing more oil. But the folks know, and my… like I said, again, these are not liberal folks. These are not folks that are green, new deal folks. These are farmers that have been, drought one year, massive flooding the next year. They understand that it makes sense. Look, our number one export cannot be topsoil from erosion from these massive storms. We saw it in Minnesota this summer. And thinking about, “How do we respond to that?” we're thinking ahead on this and what Kamala Harris has been able to do in Minnesota, we're starting to weatherproof some of these things. The infrastructure law that was passed allows us to think about mitigation in the future. How do we make sure that we're protecting by burying our power lines? How do we make sure that we're protecting lakefronts and things that we're seeing more and more of. But to call it a hoax and to take the oil company executives to Mar-a-Lago, say, give me money for my campaign and I'll let you do whatever you want. We can be smarter about that. And an all above energy policy is exactly what she's doing, creating those jobs right here.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, your time is up. The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that the earth's climate is warming at an unprecedented rate. Margaret?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. We're going to turn now to immigration. The crisis at the US-Mexico border consistently ranks as one of the top issue for American voters. Senator Vance, your campaign is pledging to carry out the largest mass deportation plan in American history and to use the US military to do so. Could you be more specific about exactly how this will work? For example, would you deport parents who have entered the US illegally and separate them from any of their children who were born on US soil? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: So first of all, Margaret, before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding. We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies. Ninety-four executive orders suspending deportations, decriminalizing illegal aliens, massively increasing the asylum fraud that exists in our system, that has opened the floodgates. And what it's meant is that a lot of fentanyl is coming into our country. I had a mother who struggled with opioid addiction and has gotten clean. I don't want people who are struggling with addiction to be deprived of their second chance because Kamala Harris let in fentanyl into our communities at record levels. So you've got to stop the bleeding. You've got to re-implement Donald Trump's border policies, build the wall, re-implement deportations. And that gets me to your point, Margaret, about what do we actually do? So we've got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country. What do we do with them? I think the first thing that we do is we start with the criminal migrants. About a million of those people have committed some form of crime in addition to crossing the border illegally. I think you start with deportations on those folks, and then I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers. A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country. And by the way, that'll be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing a good day's work. And the final point, Margaret, is you ask about family separation. Right now in this country, Margaret, we have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost. Some of them have been sex trafficked, some of them hopefully are at homes with their families, some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris’s wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, “You know what? I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies.” I wish that she would do that, it would be good for all of us.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, do you care to respond to any of those specific allegations, including that the Vice President is, quote, “letting in fentanyl and using kids as drug mules, among other things…”\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well…\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … regarding children?\n\nTIM WALZ: The drug mule is not true. But I will say about this, about the fentanyl, because this is a crisis of this, the opioid crisis. And the good news on this is the last twelve months saw the largest decrease in opioid deaths in our nation's history, 30% decrease in Ohio. But there's still more work to do. But let's go back to this on immigration. Kamala Harris was the Attorney General of the largest state and a border state in California. She's the only person in this race who prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drug interventions. But look, we all want to solve this. Most of us want to solve this. And that is the United States Congress. That's the Border Patrol Agents, that's the Chamber of Commerce. That's most Americans out here. That's why we had the fairest and the toughest bill on immigration that this nation’s seen. It was crafted by a conservative senator from Oklahoma, James Lankford. I know him. He's super conservative, but he's a man of principle, wants to get it done. Democrats and Republicans worked on this piece of legislation. The Border Patrol said, this is what we need in here. These are the experts. And the Chamber of Commerce in the Wall Street Journal said, pass this thing. Kamala Harris helped get there. Fifteen hundred new border agents, detection for drugs, DOJ money to speed up these adjudications on this. Just what America wants. But as soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this Donald Trump said “No,” told them to vote against it because it gives him a campaign issue. It gives him, what would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things? And they need to be done by the legislature. You can't just do this through the executive branch. So, look, we have the options to do this. Donald Trump had four years. He had four years to do this. And he promised you, America, how easy it would be. I'll build you a big, beautiful wall and Mexico will pay for it. Less than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime. But here we are again, nine years after he came down that escalator, dehumanizing people and telling them what he was going to do. As far as a deportation plan, at one point, Senator Vance said it was so unworkable as to be laughable. So that's where we're at. Pass the bill. She'll sign it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator, the question was, will you separate parents from their children, even if their kids are US citizens? You have 1 minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Margaret, my point is that we already have massive child separations thanks to Kamala Harris’ open border. And I didn't accuse Kamala Harris of inviting drug mules, I said that she enabled the Mexican drug cartels to operate freely in this country, and we know that they use children as drug mules, and it is a disgrace and it has to stop. Look, I think what Tim said just doesn't pass the smell test. For three years, Kamala Harris went out bragging that she was going to undo Donald Trump's border policy. She did exactly that. We had a record number of illegal crossings. We had a record number of fentanyl coming into our country. And now, now that she's running for President, or a few months before, she says that somehow she got religion and cared a lot about a piece of legislation. The only thing that she did when she became the Vice President, when she became the appointed border czar, was to undo 94 Donald Trump executive actions that opened the border. This problem is leading to massive problems in the United States of America. Parents who can't afford health care, schools that are overwhelmed. It's got to stop, and it will when Donald Trump is President again.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, what about our CBS news polling, which does show that a majority of Americans, more than 50%, support mass deportations?\n\nTIM WALZ: Look, we fix this issue with a bill that is necessary. But the issue on this is this is what happens when you don't want to solve it. You demonize it. And we saw this, and Senator Vance, and it surprises me on this, talking about and saying, “I will create stories to bring attention to this.” That vilified a large number of people who were here legally in the community of Springfield. The Republican Governor said, “It's not true. Don't do it.” There's consequences for this. There's consequences. We could come together. Senator Lankford did it. We could come together and solve this if we didn't let Donald Trump continue to make it an issue. And the consequences in Springfield were the Governor had to send state law enforcement to escort kindergarteners to school. I believe Senator Vance wants to solve this. But by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point. And when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanize and villainize other human beings.\n\nJD VANCE: Tim…\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor. Governor, your time is up. Senator, I'll give you 1 minute, but let me just ask you the question first. The governor has made the point, and I think as a sitting lawmaker, you know that Congress controls the purse strings and any funding. So you have said repeatedly that Donald Trump would, through executive action, solve this. Do you disagree that Congress controls the purse strings and would need to support many of the changes that you would actually want to implement? You have 1 minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Look, Margaret, first of all, the gross majority of what we need to do at the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job. I've been to the southern border more than our Borders are, Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol Agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job. Of course, additional resources would help. But most of this is about the President and the Vice President empowering our law enforcement to say, “If you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico, you've got to go back through proper channels.” Now, Governor Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield. Look, in Springfield, Ohio and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you have got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes. The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris’s open border. It is a disgrace, Tim. And I actually think, I agree with you. I think you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, you have 1 minute to respond.\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well, it is law enforcement that asked for the bill. They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was… that's because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything. On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree. It should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done. This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then you start to make a difference in this and you start to adhere to what we know. American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about, “To the least amongst us, you do unto me.” I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded, it's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Governor. And just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status. Temporary protected status. Norah.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, Margaret, Margaret, I think it's important because…\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, senator. We have so much to get to.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: We're going to turn out of the economy. Thank you.\n\nJD VANCE: Margaret. The rules were that you guys were going to fact check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on. So there's an application called the CBP One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in, applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator.\n\nJD VANCE: That is the facilitation of illegal immigration, Margaret, by our own leadership. And Kamala Harris opened up that pathway.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator, for describing the legal process. We have so much to get to.\n\nTIM WALZ: Those laws have been in the book since 1990.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, gentlemen. We want to have -\n\nTIM WALZ: The CBP app has not been on the books since 1990. It's something that Kamala Harris created, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut. We have so much we want to get to. Thank you for explaining the legal process. Norah?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you, Margaret. The economy is a top concern for voters. Each of your campaigns has released an economic plan, so let's talk about the specifics. Governor Walz, Vice President Harris unveiled a plan that includes billions in tax credits for manufacturing, housing and a renewed child tax credit. The Wharton School says your proposals will increase the nation's deficit by $1.2 trillion. How would you pay for that without ballooning the deficit? Governor, I'll give you two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Thank you. And Kamala Harris and I do believe in the middle class because that's where we come from. We both grew up in that. We understand. So those of you out there listening tonight, you're hearing a lot of stuff back and forth. And it's good. It's healthy. That's what this is supposed to happen. You should be listening. “How's this going to impact me?” The bold forward plan that Kamala Harris put out there is, one, is talking about this housing issue. The one thing is there's 3 million new houses proposed under this plan with down payment assistance on the front end. To get you in a house. A house is much more than just an asset to be traded somewhere. It's foundational to where you're at. And then making sure that the things you buy every day, whether they be prescription drugs or other things, that there's fairness in that. Look, the $35 insulin is a good thing, but it costs $5 to make insulin. They were charging $800 before this law went into effect. As far as the housing goes, I've seen it in Minnesota, 12% more houses in Minneapolis, prices went down on rent, 4%. It's working. And then making sure tax cuts go to the middle class, $6,000 child tax credit. We have one in Minnesota, reduces childhood poverty by a third. We save money in the long run and we do the right thing for families and then getting businesses off the ground. The law, as it stands right now, is $5,000 tax credit for small business, increasing that to $50,000. Now, this is a philosophical difference between us. Donald Trump made a promise, and I'll give you this. He kept it. He took folks to Mar-a-Lago. He said, “You're rich as hell. I'm going to give you a tax cut.” He gave the tax cuts that predominantly went to the top caste. What happened there was an $8 trillion increase in the national debt, the largest ever. Now he's proposing a 20% consumption or sales tax on everything we bring in. Everyone agrees, including businesses. It would be destabilizing it. It would increase inflation and potentially lead to a recession. Look, this is simple for you. Where are we going? Kamala Harris has said to do the things she wants to do. We'll just ask the wealthiest to pay their fair share. When you do that, our system works best. More people are participating in it, and folks have the things that they need.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, I want to give you a moment to respond on that. But similarly, the Wharton School has done an analysis of the Trump plan and says it would increase the nation's deficit by 5.8 trillion. My question is the same for you. How do you pay for all that without ballooning the deficit? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, you're going to hear a lot from Tim Walz this evening, and you just heard it in the answer, a lot of what Kamala Harris proposes to do. And some of it, I'll be honest with you, it even sounds pretty good. Here's what you won't hear, is that Kamala Harris has already done it. Because she's been the Vice President for three and a half years, she had the opportunity to enact all of these great policies. And what she's actually done instead is drive the cost of food higher by 25%, drive the cost of housing higher by about 60%, open the American southern border and make middle class life unaffordable for a large number of Americans. If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to do them now, not when asking for a promotion, but in the job the American people gave her three and a half years ago. And the fact that she isn't, tells you a lot about how much you can trust her actual plans. Now, Donald Trump's economic plan is not just a plan, but it's also a record. A lot of those same economists attack Donald Trump's plans, and they have PhDs, but they don't have common sense and they don't have wisdom, because Donald Trump's economic policies delivered the highest take home pay in a generation in this country, 1.5% inflation, and to boot, peace and security all over the world. So when people say that Donald Trump's economic plan doesn't make sense, I say “Look at the record he delivered: rising take home pay for American workers.” Now, Tim admirably admits that they want to undo the Trump tax cuts. But if you look at what was so different about Donald Trump's tax cuts, even from previous Republican tax cut plans, is that a lot of those resources went to giving more take home pay to middle class and working class Americans. It was passed in 2017, and you saw an American economic boom unlike we've seen in a generation in this country. That is a record that I'm proud to run on and we're going to get back to that common sense wisdom so that you can afford to live the American Dream again. I know a lot of you are struggling. I know a lot of you are worried about paying the bills. It's going to stop when Donald Trump brings back common sense to this country.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, do you want to respond to that? What has Kamala Harris done for the middle class?\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Yeah, well, Kamala Harris’ day one was Donald Trump's failure on COVID that led to the collapse of our economy. We were already before COVID, in a manufacturing recession. But 10 million people out of work, largest percentage since the Great Depression, 9 million jobs closed on that. That was day one. Whether it was the Infrastructure Act or other things, we moved. Now, you made a question about experts, said this, I made a note of this. “Economists don’t, can’t be trusted. Science can't be trusted. National security folks can't be trusted.” Look, if you're going to be President, you don't have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does. My pro tip of the day is this, if you need heart surgery, listen to the people at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, not Donald Trump. And the same thing goes with this and I ask you out there, teachers, nurses, truck drivers, whatever, how is it fair that you're paying your taxes every year and Donald Trump hasn't paid any Federal Tax 10 to last 15 years, in the last year as President? That's what's wrong with the system. There's a way around it. And he's bragged about that. We're just asking for fairness in it, and that's all you want.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: You have a minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Governor, you say trust the experts, but those same experts for 40 years said that if we shipped our manufacturing base off to China, we'd get cheaper goods. They lied about that. They said if we shipped our industrial base off to other countries, to Mexico and elsewhere, it would make the middle class stronger. They were wrong about that. They were wrong about the idea that if we made America less self-reliant, less productive in our own Nation, that it would somehow make us better off. And they were wrong about it. And for the first time in a generation, Donald Trump had the wisdom and the courage to say to that bipartisan consensus, we're not doing it anymore. We're bringing American manufacturing back. We're unleashing American energy. We're going to make more of our own stuff. And this isn't just an economic issue. I mean, I've got three beautiful little kids at home: seven, four and two. And I love them very much. And I hope they're in bed right now. But look, so many of the drugs, the pharmaceuticals that we put in the bodies of our children are manufactured by nations that hate us. This has to stop. And we're not going to stop it by listening to experts. We're going to stop it by listening to common sense wisdom, which is what Donald Trump governed on.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, your time is up. Governor Walz, can you address that? I mean, voters say they trust Donald Trump on the economy more. Why?\n\nTIM WALZ: If you're listening tonight, and you want billionaires to get tax cuts, you heard what the numbers were. Look, I'm a union guy on this. I'm not a guy who wanted to ship things overseas, but I understand that, look, we produce soybeans and corn. We need to have fair trading partners. That's something that we believe in. I think the thing that most concerns me on this is, is Donald Trump was the guy who created the largest trade deficit in American history with China. So the rhetoric is good. Much of what the senator said right there, I'm in agreement with him on this. I watched it happen, too. I watched it in my communities and we talked about that. But we had people undercutting the right to collectively bargain. We had right to work states made it more difficult. We had companies that were willing to ship it over, and we saw people profit. Folks that, folks that are venture capital, in some cases, putting money into companies that were overseas, we're in agreement that we bring those home. The issue is Donald Trump is talking about it. Kamala Harris has a record. Two hundred fifty thousand more manufacturing jobs just out of the IRA.\n\nJD VANCE: May I respond to that?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Yes.\n\nJD VANCE: So, appreciate that. So if you notice, what Governor Walz just did is he said, “First of all, Donald Trump has to listen to the experts.” And then when he acknowledged that the experts screwed up, he said, well, “Donald Trump didn't do nearly as good of a job as the statistics show that he did.”\n\nTIM WALZ: No, that's a gross generalization.\n\nJD VANCE: So what Tim Walz is doing. And I honestly, Tim, I think you got a tough job here because you've got to play whack-a-mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take home pay. Which, of course, he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which, of course, he did. And then you've simultaneously got to defend Kamala Harris's atrocious economic record, which has made gas, groceries, and housing unaffordable for American citizens. I was raised by a woman who would sometimes go into medical debt so that she could put food on the table in our household. I know what it's like to not be able to afford the things that you need to afford. We can do so much better. To all of you watching, we can get back to an America that's affordable again. We just got to get back to common sense, economic principles.\n\nTIM WALZ: I hope we have a conversation on health care then.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator. Governor.\n\nJD VANCE: Please.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We have a lot to get to ahead, gentlemen, on many topics. But right now I want to talk about personal qualifications. The Vice President is often the last voice the President hears before making consequential decisions. We want to ask you about your leadership qualities, Governor Walz. You said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protest in the spring of 1989. But Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year. Can you explain that discrepancy? You have two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Well, and to the folks out there who didn't get at the top of this, look, I grew up in small, rural Nebraska, town of 400. Town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service. I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher. Passionate about it, a young teacher. My first year out, I got the opportunity in the summer of 89 to travel to China, 35 years ago, be able to do that. I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams, we would take baseball teams, we would take dancers, and we would go back and forth to China. The issue for that was, was to try and learn. Now, look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. They, look, I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community. I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect. And I'm a knucklehead at times, but it's always been about that. Those same people elected me to Congress for twelve years. And in Congress I was one of the most bipartisan people. Working on things like farm bills that we got done, working on veterans benefits. And then the people of Minnesota were able to elect me to governor twice. So look, my commitment has been from the beginning, to make sure that I'm there for the people, to make sure that I get this right. I will say more than anything, many times, I will talk a lot. I will get caught up in the rhetoric. But being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life. I learned a lot about China. I hear the critiques of this. I would make the case that Donald Trump should have come on one of those trips with us. I guarantee you he wouldn't be praising Xi Jinping about COVID. And I guarantee you he wouldn't start a trade war that he ends up losing. So this is about trying to understand the world. It's about trying to do the best you can for your community, and then it's putting yourself out there and letting your folks understand what it is. My commitment, whether it be through teaching, which I was good at, or whether it was being a good soldier or was being a good member of Congress, those are the things that I think are the values that people care about.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, just to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy?\n\nTIM WALZ: No. All I said on this was, is, I got there that summer and misspoke on this, so I will just, that's what I've said. So I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protest, went in, and from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in governance.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, governor. Senator Vance, in 2016, you called your running mate, Donald Trump, unfit for the nation's highest office, and you said he could be America's Hitler. I know you've said, you've been asked many times, and you've said you regret those comments and explained, you then voted for Donald Trump in 2020. But the Washington Post reported new messages last week in which you also disparaged Trump's economic record while he was President. Writing to someone in 2020, quote, “Trump thoroughly failed to deliver his economic populism.” You're now his running mate, and you've shifted many of your policy stances to align with his. If you become Vice President, why should Americans trust that you will give Donald Trump the advice he needs to hear, and not just the advice he wants to hear? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Margaret, because I've always been open and sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the President, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record. But most importantly, Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans. A secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it. It's one of the reasons, Margaret, why I've done so many interviews is because I think it's important to actually explain to the American people where I come down on the issues and what changed. Now you pointed out to messages from 2020. Margaret, I've been extremely consistent that I think there were a lot of things that we could have done better in the Trump administration the first round, if Congress was doing its job. I strongly believe, and I've been a United States Senator, that Congress is not just a high-class debating society. It's not just a forum for senators and congressmen to whine about problems. It's a forum to govern. So there were a lot of things on the border, on tariffs, for example, where I think that we could have done so much more if the Republican Congress and the Democrats in Congress had been a little bit better about how they governed the country. They were so obsessed with impeaching Donald Trump, they couldn't actually govern. And I want to talk about this tariff issue in particular, Margaret, because, you know, Tim just accused this of being a national sales tax. Look, the one thing, and you're not probably surprised to hear me praising Joe Biden, but the one thing that Joe Biden did is he continued some of the Trump tariffs that protected American manufacturing jobs. And it's the one issue, the most pro worker part of the Biden administration. It's the one issue where Kamala Harris has run away from Joe Biden's record. Think about this. If you're trying to employ slave laborers in China at $3 a day, you're going to do that and undercut the wages of American workers unless our country stands up for itself and says you're not accessing our markets unless you're paying middle class Americans a fair wage.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Norah.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you. Now to the issue of reproductive rights. Governor Walz, after Roe v. Wade was overturned, you signed a bill into law that made Minnesota one of the least restrictive states in the nation when it comes to abortion. Former President Trump said in the last debate that. You believe abortion, quote, in the 9th month is absolutely fine. Yes or no? Is that what you support? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: That's not what the bill says. But look, this issue is what's on everyone's mind. Donald Trump put this all into motion. He brags about how great it was that he put the judges in and overturned Roe versus Wade, 52 years of personal autonomy. And then he tells us, oh, we send it to the states. It's a beautiful thing. Amanda Zaworski would disagree with you on it's a beautiful thing. A young bride in Texas waiting for their child at 18 weeks. She has a complication, a tear in the membrane. She needs to go in. The medical care at that point needs to be decided by the doctor. And that would have been an abortion. But in Texas, that would have put them in legal jeopardy. She went home, got sepsis, nearly dies, and now she may have difficulty having children. Or in Kentucky, Hadley Duvall, a twelve year old child raped and impregnated by her stepfather. Those are horrific. Now, when got asked about that, Senator Vance said, two wrongs don't make a right. There is no right in this. So in Minnesota, what we did was restore Roe v. Wade. We made sure that we put women in charge of their health care. But look, this is not what, if you don't know Amanda or a Hadley, you soon will. Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies. It's going to make it more difficult, if not impossible to get contraception and limit access, if not eliminate access to infertility treatments. For so many of you out there listening, me included, infertility treatments are why I have a child. That's nobody else's business. But those things are being proposed, and the catchall on this is, is, well, the states will decide what's right for Texas might not be right for Washington. That's not how this works. This is basic human right. We have seen maternal mortality skyrocket in Texas, outpacing many other countries in the world. This is about health care. In Minnesota, we are ranked first in health care for a reason. We trust women. We trust doctors.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, do you want to respond to the governor's claim? Will you create a federal pregnancy monitoring agency?\n\nJD VANCE: No, Norah, certainly we won't. And I want to talk about this issue because I know a lot of Americans care about it, and I know a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic. And, you know, I grew up in a working class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options. And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know she's watching tonight, and I love you. And she told me something a couple years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship. And I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable is that my party, we've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American People's trust back on this issue where they frankly just don't trust us. And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies. I want it to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options. Now, of course, Donald Trump has been very clear that on the abortion policy specifically, that we have a big country and it's diverse. And California has a different viewpoint on this than Georgia. Georgia has a different viewpoint from Arizona. And the proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions, let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big, a very diverse, and let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, would you like to respond and also answer the question about restrictions?\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Well, the question got asked, and Donald Trump made the accusation that wasn't true about Minnesota. Well, let me tell you about this idea that there's diverse states. There's a young woman named Amber Thurmond. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurman died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights as basic as the right to control your own body is determined on geography? There's a very real chance, had Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade. When you listen to Vice President Harris talk about this subject, and you hear me talk about it, you hear us talking exactly the same. Donald Trump is trying to figure out how to get the political right of this. I agree with a lot of what Senator Vance said about what's happening. His running mate, though, does not. And that's the problem.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, your time is up. Senator, let me ask you about that. He mentioned it was, I think, referring to a national ban. In the past, you have supported a Federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks. In fact, you said if someone can't support legislation like that, quote, you are making the United States the most barbaric pro-abortion regime anywhere in the entire world. My question is, why have you changed your position?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, Norah, first of all, I never supported a national ban. I did during, when I was running for Senate in 2022, talk about setting some minimum national standard. For example, we have a partial birth abortion ban in this, in place in this country at the federal level. I don't think anybody's trying to get rid of that, or at least I hope not, though I know that Democrats have taken a very radical pro-abortion stance. But, Norah, you know, one of the things that changed is in the state of Ohio, we had a referendum in 2023, and the people of Ohio voted overwhelmingly, by the way, against my position. And I think that what I learned from that, Norah, is that we've got to do a better job at winning back people's trust. So many young women would love to have families. So many young women also see an unplanned pregnancy as something that's going to destroy their livelihood, destroy their education, destroy their relationships. And we have got to earn people's trust back. And that's why Donald Trump and I are committed to pursuing pro-family policies. Making childcare more accessible, making fertility treatments more accessible, because we've got to do a better job at that. And that's what real leadership is.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, your response?\n\nTIM WALZ: I'm going to respond on the pro abortion piece of that. No, we're not. We're pro women. We're pro freedom to make your own choice. We know what the implications are to not be that women having miscarriages, women not getting the care, physicians feeling like they may be prosecuted for providing that care. And as far as making sure that we're educating our children and giving them options. Minnesota's a state with one of the lowest teen pregnancy rates. We understand that, too. We know that the options need to be available, and we make that true. We also make it, we're a top three state for the best place to raise children. But these two things to try and say that we're pro-children but we don't like this or, or you guys are pro abortion, that's not the case at all. We are pro freedoms for women to make their choices. And we're going, and Kamala Harris is making the case to make options for children more affordable. A $6,000 child tax credit. But we're not going to base out on the backs of making someone like Amber Thurmond drive 600 miles to try and get health care.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator.\n\nJD VANCE: May I respond to that? First of all, Governor, I agree with you. Amber Thurmond should still be alive. And there are a lot of people who should still be alive, and I certainly wish that she was. And maybe, you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me, but as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion, where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion. That is, I think, whether it's not pro choice or pro abortion, that is fundamentally barbaric. And that's why I use that word, Norah, is because some of what we've seen, do you want to force catholic hospitals to perform abortions against their will? Because Kamala Harris has supported suing catholic nuns to violate their freedom of conscience? We can be a big and diverse country where we respect people's freedom of conscience. And make the country more pro baby and pro family. But please.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Yes, Governor, please respond.\n\nTIM WALZ: Look, this is one where there's always something there. This is a very simple proposition. These are women's decisions to make about their healthcare decisions and the physicians who know best when they need to do this, trying to distort the way a law is written, to try and make a point. That's not it at all.\n\nJD VANCE: What was I wrong about? Governor, please tell me. What was I wrong about?\n\nTIM WALZ: That is not the way the law is written. Look, I've given.\n\nJD VANCE: But how.\n\nTIM WALZ: I've given this advice on a lot of things that getting involved, getting, that's been misread. And it was fact checked at the last debate. But the point on this is, is there's a continuation of these guys to try and tell women or to get involved. I use this line on this. Just mind your own business on this. Things worked best when Roe v. Wade was in place. When we do a restoration of Roe, that works best. That doesn't preclude us from increasing funding for children. It doesn't increase us from making sure that once that child's born, like in Minnesota, they get meals, they get early childhood education, they get healthcare. So the hiding behind we're going to do all these other things when you're not proposing them in your budget? Kamala Harris is proposing them. She's proposing all those things to make life easier for families.\n\nJD VANCE: I asked a specific question, Governor. And you gave me a slogan as a response.\n\nTIM WALZ: It's not the case. It's not true. That's not what the law says. So they fact checked it with President Trump.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Gentlemen, there's a lot to discuss. We have to move on. And we're going to be right back with much more of the CBS news Vice Presidential debate in just a moment.\n\nSecond Segment\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Welcome back to the CBS news Vice Presidential debate. We want to turn now to America's gun violence epidemic, the leading cause of death for children and teens in America is by firearms. Senator Vance, you oppose most gun legislation that Democrats claim would curb gun violence. You oppose red flag gun laws and legislation to ban certain semi automatic rifles, including AR-15s. So let me ask you. Earlier this year, for the first time, the parents of a school shooter were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in prison. Do you think holding parents responsible could curb mass shootings? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Yeah. Well, Norah, on that particular case, I don't know the full details, but I certainly trust local law enforcement and local authorities to make those decisions. I think in some cases the answer is going to be yes, and in some cases the answer is going to be no. And the details really matter here. Of course. For example, if a kid steals a gun, that's going to be different than if a parent hands over a gun knowing that their kid is potentially dangerous. Look, I want to just sort of speak as a father of three beautiful little kids, and our oldest is now in second grade. And like a lot of parents, we send our kids to school with such hope and such joy and such pride at their little faces on the first day of school. And we know, unfortunately, that a lot of kids are going to experience this terrible epidemic of gun violence. And of course, our hearts go out to the families that are affected by this terrible stuff. And we do have to do better. And I think that Governor Walz and I actually probably agree that we need to do better on this. The question is just how do we actually do it? Now, here's something that really bothers me and worries me about this epidemic of violence. The gross majority, close to 90%, and some of the statistics I've seen of the gun violence in this country is committed with illegally obtained firearms. And while we're on that topic, we know that thanks to Kamala Harris’s open border, we've seen a massive influx in the number of illegal guns run by the Mexican drug cartel. So that number, the amount of illegal guns in our country is higher today than it was three and a half years ago. But what do we do about the schools? What do we do to protect our kids? And I think the answer is, and I say this not loving the answer because I don't want my kids to go to school and a school that feels unsafe or where there are visible signs of security. But I unfortunately think that we have to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger. And of course, we've got to increase school resource officers because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience. So we've got to make our schools safer, and I think we've got to have some common sense, bipartisan solutions for how to do that.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, you have two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, I think all the parents watching tonight, this is your biggest nightmare. Look, I got a, I got a 17 year old, and he witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball. Those things don't leave you.\n\nJD VANCE: Awful.\n\nTIM WALZ: As a member of Congress. I sat in my office surrounded by dozens of the Sandy Oak parents, and they were looking at my seven year old picture on the wall. Their seven year old were dead. And they were asking us to do something. And look, I'm a hunter. I own firearms. The Vice President is. We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out. In Minnesota, we've enacted enhanced red flag laws, enhanced background checks, and we can start to get data. But here's the problem. If we really want to solve this, we've got folks that won't allow research to be even done on gun violence. And this idea that we should just live with it. And I, here's what I do think and this is a good start to the conversation. I 100% believe that Senator Vance hates it when these kids, it's abhorrent, and it breaks your heart. I agree with that. But that's not far enough when we know there are things that worked. I've spent time in Finland and seen some Finnish schools. They don't have this happen even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country. There are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there. It just doesn't make any sense. Kamala Harris, as an Attorney General, worked on this issue. She knows that it's there. No one's trying to scaremonger and say, we're taking your guns. But I ask all of you out there, do you want your school's hardened to look like a fort? Is that what we have to go… when we know there's countries around the world that their children aren't practicing these types of drills? They're being kids. We owe it to them to get a fix. These are things that shouldn't be that difficult. You can still keep your firearms, and we can make a difference. We have to. If you're listening tonight, this breaks your heart.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator?\n\nJD VANCE: Tim, first of all, I didn't know that your 17 year old witnessed the shooting. And I'm sorry about that. And I hope,\n\nTIM WALZ: I appreciate that.\n\nJD VANCE: Christ, have mercy. It is awful. And I appreciate what Tim said, actually, about Finland. ‘Cause I do think it illustrates some of the, frankly weird differences between our own country's gun violence problem and Finland is. Okay, first of all, we have way higher rates of mental health abuse or mental health substance abuse. We have way higher rates of depression, way higher rates of anxiety. We, unfortunately, have a mental health crisis in this country that I really do think that we need to get to the root causes of because I don't think it's the whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem. But I do think it's a big piece of it. Another driver of the gun violence epidemic, especially that affecting our kids. It doesn't earn as many headlines, but is the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities. And this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, and take gun offenders off the streets. I think there's a whole host of things that we can do here, but I do think at our schools, we've got to talk about more security.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, thank you. Governor, you previously opposed an assault weapons ban, but only later in your political career did you change your position. Why?\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it. Look, the NRA. I was the NRA guy for a long time. They used to teach gun safety. I'm of an age where my shotgun was in my car so I could pheasant hunt after football practice. That's not where we live today. And several things I want to mention on this is talking about cities and where it's at. The number one, where the most firearm deaths happen in Minnesota are rural suicides. And we have an epidemic of children getting guns and shooting themselves. And so we have, and we should look at all of the issues, making sure folks have healthcare and all that. But I want to be very careful. This idea of stigmatizing mental health, just because you have a mental health issue doesn't mean you're violent. And I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat. Sometimes it just is the guns. It's just the guns. And there are things that you can do about it. But I do think that this is one, and I think this is a healthy conversation. I think there's a capacity to find solutions on this that work, protect Second Amendment, protect our children. That's our priority.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Gentlemen, thank you. Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. Let's turn now to the top contributor to inflation, the high cost of housing and rent. There's a shortage of more than 4 million homes in the United States and this contributes to the high housing crisis. Governor Walz, the Harris campaign promises a $25,000 down payment assistance for first time homebuyers and a $10,000 tax credit. They also promise to build 3 million new homes. Where are you building these new homes and won’t handing out that kind of money just drive up prices higher?\n\nTIM WALZ: No, it's not handing out. First, let me say this, this issue of housing. And I think those of you listening on this. The problem we've had is that we've got a lot of folks that see housing as another commodity. It can be bought up. It can be shifted. It can be moved around. Those are not folks living in those houses. Those of you listening tonight, that house is a big deal. I bought and owned one house in my life. My mom still lives in the house where I was. And when I think of a house, I'm thinking of Christmas services after midnight Mass, where you go with your family. We need to make it more affordable. And one of the things, as I said, this program that the Vice President is pushing forward and bringing a new way of approaching. This is something we're doing in Minnesota from that lead. We in the state invested in making sure our housing was the biggest investment that we'd ever made in housing. It starts to make it easier. We cut some of the red tape. Local folks, look, we can't do at the Federal level, but local folks make it easier to build those homes. And then that down payment assistance. I can tell all of you out there, one of the, certainly for me, using the GI bill was one thing, but a veteran's home loan, the big thing about a veteran's home loan is you don't have to pay the down payment. Those are things that make it there. Now, look, you're going to pay it back and you're going to pay your mortgage. Those are things that we know in the long run, the appreciated value, the generational wealth that's created from it. And I will give Minneapolis an example. Minneapolis is the one city where we've seen the lowest inflation rates. We've seen a 12% increase in stock because we put some of these things in. And we're implementing a state program to make sure we give some of that down payment assistance. We get it back from people, because here's what we know. People with stable housing end up with stable jobs. People with stable housing have their kids able to get to school. All of those things in the long run, end up saving our money. And that's the thing that I think we should be able to find some common ground in. But we can't blame immigrants for the only reason that's not the case that's happening in many cities. The fact of the matter is, is that we don't have enough naturally affordable housing, but we can make sure that the government's there to help kickstart it, create that, create that base.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator Vance, as far as your campaign's position, the promise is to seize federal lands to build homes, remove regulation, provide tax breaks, and cut back on immigration, which you say pushes up prices. Where are you going to build all the new homes you're promising? And what part of any of this plan will provide immediate relief? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Tim just said something that I agree with. We don't want to blame immigrants for higher housing prices. But we do want to blame Kamala Harris for letting in millions of illegal aliens into this country…\n\nTIM WALZ: Pass the bill.\n\nJD VANCE: …which does drive up costs, Tim. Twenty-five million illegal aliens competing with Americans for scarce homes is one of the most significant drivers of home prices in the country. It's why we have massive increases in home prices that have happened right alongside massive increases in illegal alien, alien populations under Kamala Harris's leadership. Now, Tim just mentioned a bunch of ideas. Now, some of those ideas I actually think are halfway decent, and some of them I disagree with. But the most important thing here is Kamala Harris is not running as a newcomer to politics. She is the sitting Vice President. If she wants to enact all of these policies to make housing more affordable, I invite her to use the office that the American people already gave her, not sit around and campaign and do nothing while Americans find the American Dream of home ownership completely unaffordable. Now, you asked Margaret what would immediately change the equation for American citizens? If you lower energy prices. As Donald Trump says, “Drill, baby, drill.” One of the biggest drivers of housing costs, aside from illegal immigration, is think about it: if a truck driver is paying 40% more for diesel, then the lumber he's delivering to the job site to build the house is also going to become a lot more expensive. If we open up American energy, you will get immediate pricing release, relief, for American citizens, not, by the way, just in housing, but in a whole host of other economic goods too.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, you still have 23 seconds there. Do you want to answer?\n\nTIM WALZ: Can I have it?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Where, Governor, we will get to you in a moment. But, Senator, where are you going to seize the federal lands. Can you clarify?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, what Donald Trump has said is we have a lot of federal lands that aren't being used for anything. They're not being used for national parks. They're not being used. And they could be places where we build a lot of housing. And I do think that we should be opening up building in this country. We have a lot of land that could be used. We have a lot of Americans that need homes. We should be kicking out illegal immigrants who are competing for those homes, and we should be building more homes for the American citizens who deserve to be here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, I do want to let you respond to the allegation that the Vice President is letting in migrants\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, of course, that's not true. And again, you have the facts. I guess we agreed not to fact check. I'll check it. That, look, crossings are down compared to when Donald Trump left office. But it's, again, blaming and not trying to find the solution. I was going to ask, though, on this question, are we going to drill and build houses in the same federal land. And I think when people hear federal lands, these are really important pieces of land. Now, Minnesota doesn't have a lot of federal lands. I know in the western part of the countries we do. There's not a lot of federal lands in and around Minneapolis, for example. So the issue is, I don't understand the federal lands issue unless we see this. And I worry about this as someone who cares deeply about our national parks and our federal lands. Look, Minnesota, we protect these things. We've got about 20% of the world's fresh water. These lands protect. They're there for a reason. They belong to all of us. But again, this is when you view housing and you view these things as commodities, like there's a chance to make money here. Let's take this federal land and let's sell it to people for that. I think there's better ways to do this. We've seen it in Minnesota. We're able to refurbish some of these houses. We're able to make some investments, that gets people in. And I'm still on the fact, on this, economist, Senator Vance, you said you don't like the economist, which economists are saying that it is immigrants that's adding to the cost.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, governor, your time is, your time is up.\n\nTIM WALZ: Sorry.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, Senator, on that point, I'd like for you to clarify. There are many contributing factors to high housing costs. What evidence do you have that migrants are part of this problem?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, there's a Federal Reserve study that we're happy to share after the debate. We'll put it up on social media. Actually, that really drills down on the connection between increased levels of migration, especially illegal immigration, and higher housing prices. Now, of course, Margaret, that's not the entire driver of higher housing prices. It's also the regulatory regime of Kamala Harris. Look, we are a country of builders. We're a country of doers. We're a country of explorers. But we increasingly have a Federal administration that makes it harder to develop our resources, makes it harder to build things, and wants to throw people in jail for not doing everything exactly as Kamala Harris says that they have to do. And what that means is that you have a lot of people who would love to build homes who aren't able to build homes. I actually agree with Tim Walz. We should get out of this idea of housing as a commodity. But the thing that has most turned housing into a commodity is giving it away to millions upon millions of people who have no legal right to be here.\n\nTIM WALZ: What are the federal regulations? I deal with this as a Governor.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You can very quickly reply.\n\nTIM WALZ: I'm sorry. I get this as a Governor, and I don't necessarily disagree with that, that in some cases, many of those are local, many of them are state. I don't know which ones are federal, but I think whenever we talk regulations, people think they can get rid of them. I think you want to be able to get out of your house in a fire. I think you want to make sure that it's fireproof and those types of things. So which are the regulations? Because the vice president's not responsible for those. Congress writes those.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you, gentlemen. We have a lot to get through. You're passionate about the housing crisis. I can tell. But Norah?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you. One of the top problems facing Americans is the high cost of health care. Senator Vance, at the last Presidential debate, former President Trump was asked about replacing the Affordable Care act. In response, he said, I have concepts of a plan. Since then, Senator, you've talked about changing how chronically ill Americans get health insurance. Can you explain how that would work? And can you guarantee that Americans with pre-existing conditions won't pay more? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, of course, we're going to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions. In fact, a lot of my family members have gotten health care, I believe, you know, members of my family actually got private health insurance, at least, for the first time, switched off of Medicaid onto private insurance for the first time, under Donald Trump's leadership. And I think that, you know, a lot of people have criticized this “concepts of a plan” remark. I think it's very simple common sense. I think, as Tim Walz knows from twelve years in Congress, you're not going to propose a 900 page bill standing on a debate stage. It would bore everybody to tears and it wouldn't actually mean anything because part of this is the give and take of bipartisan negotiation. Now, when Donald Trump was actually President, and again, he has a record to be proud of, prescription drugs fell in 2018 for the first time in a very long time. Under Kamala Harris's leadership, prescription drugs are up about 7%. Under Donald Trump's entire four years, they were up about one and a half percent. He introduced pricing transparency. Think about healthcare. You go into a hospital, you try to buy something, and nobody knows what it actually costs. That price transparency will actually give American consumers a little bit more choice and will also drive down costs. And we talked about, you know, the reinsurance regulations is what I was talking about. Look, Donald Trump has said that if we allow states to experiment a little bit on how to cover both the chronically ill, but the non chronically ill. It's not just a plan. He actually implemented some of these regulations when he was President of the United States. And I think you can make a really good argument that it salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along. I think this is an important point about President Trump. Of course, you don't have to agree with everything that President Trump has ever said or ever done, but when Obamacare was crushing under the weight of its own regulatory burden and healthcare costs, Donald Trump could have destroyed the program. Instead, he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care. It's not perfect, of course, and there's so much more that we can do. But I think that Donald Trump has earned the right to put in place some better healthcare policies. He's earned it because he did it successfully the first time.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor.\n\nTIM WALZ: All right, here's where being an old guy gives you some history. I was there at the creation of the ACA, and the reason it was so important is I come from a major healthcare state, home of the Mayo Clinic, home to Medical Alley, 3M, Medtronic, all of those. We understand healthcare. It's why we're ranked first on affordability and accessibility and quality of health care. And so what I know is under Kamala Harris, more people are covered than they have before. Those of you listening, this is critical to you. Now, Donald Trump all of a sudden wants you… go back and remember this. He ran on, the first thing he was going to do on day one, was to repeal Obamacare. On day one, he tried to sign an executive order to repeal the ACA. He signed onto a lawsuit to repeal the ACA, but lost at the Supreme Court. And he would have repealed the ACA had it not been for the courage of John McCain to save that bill. Now fast forward. What that means to you is you lose your pre-existing conditions if you're sitting at home and you got asthma, too bad. If you're a woman, probably not. Broke your foot during football, might kick you out. Your kids get kicked out when they're 26. Kamala Harris negotiated drug prices for the first time with Medicare. We have ten drugs that will come online, the most common ones that'll be there. But look, this issue, and when Donald Trump said, “I've got a concept of a plan,” it cracked me up as a fourth grade teacher because my kids would have never given me that. But what Senator Vance just explained might be worse than a concept, because what he explained is pre-Obamacare. And I'll make this as simple as possible because I have done this for a long time. What they're saying is if you're healthy, why should you be paying more? So what they're going to do is let insurance companies pick who they insure. Because guess what happens? You pay your premium. It's not much. They figure they're not going to have to pay out to you. But those of you a little older, gray, you know, got cancer? You're going to get kicked out of it. That's why the system didn't work. Kamala Harris will protect and enhance the ACA.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, thank you. Senator, you have not yet explained how you would protect people with preexisting conditions, or laid out that plan.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, look, we currently have laws and regulations in place, in place right now that protect people with preexisting conditions. We want to keep those regulations in place, but we also want to make the health insurance marketplace function a little bit better. Now, what Governor Walz just said is actually not true. A lot of what happened and the reason that Obamacare was crushing under its own weight is that a lot of young and healthy people were leaving the exchanges. Donald Trump actually helped address that problem, and he did so in a way that preserved people's access to coverage who had preexisting conditions. But again, something that these guys do, is they make a lot of claims about if Donald Trump becomes President, all of these terrible consequences are going to ensue. But in reality, Donald Trump was President. Inflation was low, take home pay was higher, and he saved the very program from a Democratic administration that was collapsing and would have collapsed absent his leadership. He did his job, which is govern in a bipartisan way and get results, not just complain about problems, but actually solve them.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, did enrollment under the Affordable Care Act go up under the Trump Administration?\n\nTIM WALZ: It's higher now that we've seen it go up. Look, people are using it. The system works. And the question about this of young people or whatever, that's the individual mandate piece of this. And Republicans fought tooth and nail, saying, well, Americans should be free to do this. Well, then what happens?\n\nJD VANCE: You think the individual mandate's a good idea?\n\nTIM WALZ: I think the idea of making sure the risk pool is broad enough to cover everyone, that's the only way insurance works. When it doesn’t, it collapses. You are asking pre-ACA where we get people out. Look, people know that they need to be on healthcare. People expect it to be there. And when we are able to make it, and we are making it this way, when we incentivize people to be in the market, when we help people who might not be able to afford it get there, and we make sure then when you get sick and old, it's there for you. Because I heard people say, well, I don't want to buy into Medicare or whatever. Good luck buying healthcare once you get past 70. So look, the ACA works. We can continue to do better. Kamala Harris did that. The way she made everything better was negotiating those ten drugs on Medicare for the first time in American history.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you. Margaret?\n\nJD VANCE: Can I address that?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: We’re, I apologize. We're out of time. We have a number of subjects to discuss. Margaret?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk about families in America. There is a childcare crisis in this country, and the United States is one of the very few developed countries in the world without a national paid leave program for new parents. Governor Walz, you said that if Democrats win both the White House and Congress, this is a day one priority for you. How long should employers be required to pay workers while they are home taking care of their newborns? You have two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well, that's negotiable. And that's what Congress worked. But here's what the deal is. Americans sitting out there right now, you may work for a big company. Look, we're home in Minnesota to some of the largest Fortune 500 companies. Kamala Harris knows that in California. Those companies provide paid family medical leave. One is, I think they're moral and they think it's a good thing, but it also keeps their employees healthy. We in Minnesota passed a paid family medical leave. You have a child. You, and I had to go back to work five days after my kids were born. This allows you to stay home a certain amount of time. What we know is that gets the child off to a better start. The family works better. We stay in their employers. We get more consistency in that. So Kamala Harris has made it a priority. We implemented it in Minnesota, and we see growth. That's how you become a pro-business state. But the negotiations on it, and here's the issue, those big companies are able to offer it. Those of you out there who don't have it, just imagine what happens if you get cancer or your child gets sick. We know what happens. You end up staying home. In some places, that means no paycheck, because you've got no protection on that. This is the case of an economy that Donald Trump has set for the wealthiest amongst us. He's willing to give those tax breaks to the wealthiest, he's willing to say, “Bust those unions up. Do whatever.” What we're saying is the economy works best when it works for all of us. And so a paid family medical leave program, and I will tell you, go to the families or go to the businesses and ask them. As far as childcare on this, you have to take it at both the supply and the demand side. You can't expect the most important people in our lives to take care of our children or our parents, to get paid the least amount of money. And we have to make it easier for folks to be able to get into that business and then to make sure that folks are able to pay for that. We were able to do it in Minnesota, and I'm still telling you this, we were listed as the best state. We're still in crisis on this. A Federal program of paid family medical leave and help with this will enhance our workforce, enhance our families, and make it easier to have the children that you want.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator, do you support a national paid leave program? And if so, for how long should employers be mandated to pay their employees while they are home taking care of their newborn? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Yeah. Well, first of all, Margaret, a number of my Republican colleagues and some Democrats, too, have worked on this issue, and I think there is a bipartisan solution here because a lot of us care about this issue. I mean, look, I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I'm so proud of her. But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult. And it's not just difficult from a policy perspective. She actually had access to paid family leave because she worked for a bigger company. But the cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want. A lot of young women would like to go back to work immediately. Some would like to spend a little time home with the kids. Some would like to spend longer at home with the kids. We should have a family care model that makes choice possible. And I think this is a very important substantive difference between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’s approach. I mean, look, if you look at the Federal programs that we have that support paid family leave right now, the community development block grant, and there's another block grant program that spends a lot of money from the federal government. These programs only go to one kind of childcare model. Let's say you'd like your church, maybe, to help you out with child care. Maybe you live in a rural area or an urban area, and you'd like to get together with families in your neighborhood to provide childcare in the way that makes the most sense. You don't get access to any of these federal monies. We want to promote choice in how we deliver family care and how we promote childcare because, look, it is unacceptable. And, you know, of course, Tim and I have been on the campaign trail a lot the past seven or eight weeks. And one of the biggest complaints I hear from young families is people who feel like they don't have options, like they're choosing between going to work or taking care for their kids. That is an incredible burden to put on American families. We're the only country that does it. I think we could do a heck of a lot better.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you. You have also said, Senator Vance, many things about the American family. The Federal Reserve says parents will spend nearly as much on childcare as they do on housing each month. So I want to get your thoughts on this. President Trump recently said, as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it's, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kinds of numbers we'll be taking in. Is President Trump committed to the $5,000 per child tax credit that you have described? You have 1 minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, what President Trump said, Margaret, I just want to defend my running mate here a little bit, is that we're going to be taking in a lot of money by penalizing companies for shipping jobs overseas and penalizing countries who employ slave laborers and then ship their products back into our country and undercut the wages of American workers. It's the heart of the Donald Trump economic plan. Cut taxes for American workers and American families. Cut taxes for businesses that are hiring and building companies in the United States of America. But penalize companies and countries that are shipping jobs overseas. That's the heart of the economic proposal. And I think what President Trump is saying is that when we bring in this additional revenue with higher economic growth, we're going to be able to provide paid family leave, childcare options that are viable and workable for a lot of American families.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Can you clarify how that will solve the childcare shortage?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, because, as Tim said, a lot of the childcare shortages, we just don't have enough resources going into the multiple people who could be providing family care options. And we're going to have to, unfortunately, look, we're going to have to spend more money. We're going to have to induce more people to want to provide child care options for American families because the reason it's so expensive right now is because you've got way too few people providing this very essential service.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator. Governor Walz, your ticket also has some childcare tax credit proposals. Do you think Congress will agree to the $6,000 credit for newborns and $3,000 credit for children over the age of six, as your campaign has promised? Is that realistic?\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, well, if these members of Congress are listening to anybody, I can tell you, and this is the biggest issue everybody listening tonight knows. I mean, I'm sure they were shocked to hear it's not that expensive. And let's be clear whether it's $5000 or $6000, that pays you about three or four months. Let's be clear of where we're at on this. It's because we got out of an imbalance on this. We thought we were going to get by by not paying people. I don't think Senator Vance and I are that far apart. I'm not opposed to what he's talking about on options. We've done scholarships, types of things. I think we need to be open to making the case. But the issue here is, the question you asked is you're not going to pay for it with these tariffs. That's just adding another $4,000 on the family and taking less. So not only do they not get the money to pay for that, they're $4,000 in the hole. That's Wharton School. That's his alma mater. And so I think the issue here is those members of Congress, I can't believe they're not here. When I go to businesses, sure, they'll talk about taxes sometimes. But they will lead with childcare and they will lead with housing, because we know the problem is, especially in a state like Minnesota, we need more workers because our economy is growing, but we need the workforce.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you. We need to move on. Norah?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Let's talk about the State of Democracy, the top issue for Americans after the economy and inflation. After the 2020 election, President Trump's campaign and others filed 62 lawsuits contesting the results. Judges, including those appointed by President Trump and other Republican Presidents looked at the evidence and said there was no widespread fraud. The Governors of every state in the nation, Republicans and Democrats, certified the 2020 election results and sent a legal slate of electors to Congress for January 6th. Senator Vance, you have said you would not have certified the last Presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors. That has been called unconstitutional and illegal. Would you again seek to challenge this year's election results, even if every Governor certifies the results? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, Norah, first of all, I think that we're focused on the future. We need to figure out how to solve the inflation crisis caused by Kamala Harris's policies. Make housing affordable, make groceries affordable, and that's what we're focused on. But I want to answer your question because you did ask it. Look, what President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020. And my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square. And that's all I've said. And that's all that Donald Trump has said. Remember, he said that on January 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully. And on January 20th, what happened? Joe Biden became the President. Donald Trump left the White House. And now, of course, unfortunately, we have all of the negative policies that have come from the Harris-Biden administration. I believe that we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country, but unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens. And it's Kamala Harris saying that rather than debate and persuade her fellow Americans, she'd like to censor people who engage in misinformation. I think that is a much bigger threat to democracy than anything that we've seen in this country in the last four years, in the last 40 years. Now I’m really proud, especially given that I was raised by two lifelong blue collar Democrats to have the endorsement of Bobby Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, lifelong leaders in the democratic coalition. And of course, they don't agree with me and Donald Trump on every issue. We don't have to agree on every issue, but we're united behind a basic American First Amendment principle that we ought to debate our differences. We ought to argue about them. We ought to try to persuade our fellow Americans. Kamala Harris is engaged in censorship at an industrial scale. She did it during COVID, she's done it over a number of other issues. And that, to me, is a much bigger threat to democracy than what Donald Trump said when he said that protesters should peacefully protest on January 6th.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor.\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, I've enjoyed tonight's debate, and I think there was a lot of commonality here. And I'm sympathetic to misspeaking on things. And I think I might have with the Senator, but…\n\nJD VANCE: Me too, man.\n\nTIM WALZ: There's one, there's one, though, that this one is troubli", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/02"}]}

You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms.\n\nCNN —\n\nIt’s been less than a week since deadly storms impacted the Deep South, and once again we are looking at the potential for the same areas to get more severe storms.\n\nLast Monday, tornadoes swept through towns just north of Austin and killed a woman north of Dallas when her home was destroyed. The following day, a deadly EF-3 tornado raked across the New Orleans area.\n\nWith the threat of tornadoes returning, the thought of it has us shaking our heads. Not again.\n\nMore strong storms expected for the South\n\nWe’re looking at another multiday severe weather week. Tuesday and Wednesday will bring the possibility of severe storms and tornadoes. However, I want to start with Wednesday, because I think it’s going to be our biggest day, then I’ll jump back to Tuesday’s threat.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed a Level 3 out of 5 “enhanced” risk of severe weather for Wednesday for parts of the Lower Mississippi River Valley. Jackson, Memphis, Birmingham, Baton Rouge and New Orleans could all see strong storms and even tornadoes.\n\n“The line should enter the region shortly after noon arriving in the Baton Rouge area around 4 p.m., New Orleans 7 p.m., Gulfport 9 p.m. and exit the area around midnight Wednesday night into Thursday morning,” said the National Weather Service (NWS) office in New Orleans.\n\nThe SPC said the main threat with the line of storms will be wind gusts, exceeding hurricane force at times, above 74 mph. And they emphasized tornadoes will be possible. The NWS office in New Orleans echoed the same message in its forecast discussion.\n\n“Even if the line [of storms] remains intact, a QLCS tornadic environment will exist and if this line is capable of breaking into any discrete cells it would further enhance the possibility of tornadic development.”\n\nQLCS (quasi-linear convective system) tornadoes form very quickly with little warning along a line of storms. They are the exact types of tornadoes we talked about last week, which our friend Chris Weiss and other scientists are out in the field trying to study. In fact, Weiss emailed me, saying they were going to be out again this week to once again put their lives on the line to study the storms.\n\nYou never want to hear more storms are headed your way if you are in an area just devastated by a tornado. Lauren Nash, NWS New Orleans meteorologist, told me on the phone they have been trying to get the message out to the public to be prepared.\n\n“So, what we’re just trying to do is tell everybody that every event is different, and every event you need to stay aware. But those who were impacted, not only by the tornado last week, but also by Ida, they’re all in substandard housing. So there just has to be a little extra emphasis on making sure that they stay weather aware and know where to go if a watch or a warning is issued.”\n\nTo be honest, we’re still wrapping our heads around what happened in the New Orleans area last week. The images have been jaw-dropping. A school bus was lifted and carried, we’ve seen entire houses lifted off their foundations, homes and businesses destroyed. It was utter destruction for some neighborhoods in hard-hit St. Bernard Parish.\n\nThe neighborhood of Arabi, near New Orleans, which was hit hard by an EF-3 tornado on March 23.

Nash told me much of it has been cleaned up, but what is still lying around could pose a potential threat if the winds gusts top 60 mph, as expected Wednesday.\n\n“Whenever you have that 60-70 mile per hour winds, it’s going to pick up a lot of that debris. So, it’s important to stay inside when we have a wind advisory out and if we do have warnings, just go into an interior room.”\n\nIf you are in one of the areas where severe weather is expected this week, here’s a quick reminder of how to stay safe when severe weather strikes.\n\nWe will have to watch the forecast closely over the next few days to see if the SPC increases the threat level for storms.\n\nSevere weather to impact the Plains\n\nI mentioned earlier there would also be a threat of severe weather on Tuesday.

However, the country does not recognize same-sex marriages.\n\nChina also does not recognize same-sex marriages despite growing awareness of LGBTQ issues in the country. While there are no laws against same-sex relationships in China, it remains a taboo topic that is routinely scrutinized and even censored on social media.\n\nSome corners of Asia have seen recent progress on the issue, however.\n\nIn 2019, the self-ruled island of Taiwan became the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nAnd this month, Thailand edged closer to becoming the first place in Southeast Asia to legalize same-sex unions when lawmakers passed four different bills aiming to provide greater rights to gay couples, such as the ability to adopt children and manage assets jointly.", "authors": ["Kathleen Magramo Jorge Engels Junko Ogura", "Kathleen Magramo", "Jorge Engels", "Junko Ogura"], "publish_date": "2022/06/21"}, {"url": "https://college.usatoday.com/2014/09/11/why-is-the-sky-dark-on-the-tv-students-share-911-memories/", "title": "'Why is the sky dark on the TV?': Students share 9/11 memories", "text": "Dan Reimold\n\nCollege Blog Player with Autoplay\n\nI still remember the silence on the other end of the phone.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, I was in my college residence hall in suburban Philadelphia. My father called me in the morning from his office fairly close by. We were talking nonstop over each other and watching NBC when the second plane hit the towers and it was clear the word accident would be replaced with attack.\n\nIn that initial moment of confusion, my dad dropped his work phone while craning his neck to get a closer look at a nearby TV. For about 30 seconds, I heard nothing but a staticky stillness, prompting me to whisper-hiss, \"Dad? Dad, what's going on? Dad, are you OK?\"\n\nCut to the present. This past month, more than a decade after the 9/11 attacks, Beloit College released the latest version of it Mindset List. As its many devotees know, the annual list is \"a look at the cultural touchstones and experiences that have shaped the worldview of students entering colleges and universities.\"\n\nAccording to the 2014 edition, current collegians have grown up amid a myriad of scientific, political and satirical influences -- from Fox News, The Daily Show and a cloned sheep named Dolly to celebrity selfies, prescription drug ads and the fight for same-sex marriage.\n\nYet, it was the top entry on this year's list that most intrigued me: \"During their initial weeks of kindergarten, [current college freshmen] were upset by endlessly repeated images of planes blasting into the World Trade Center.\"\n\nAs a college professor nowadays instead of a student, I wondered if current undergraduates — freshmen and upperclassmen — were actually exposed to those repeated images at such a young age. And I wondered what other images come to mind as they reflect on that day 13 years later.\n\nSo I asked them.\n\nBelow are the 9/11 memories of a sampling of my students at Saint Joseph's University (SJU) in Philadelphia. In general, they were not directly affected by the attack, but like many of us they were still profoundly impacted — at an age when most did not fully comprehend what was happening and why their parents, teachers and friends were so concerned.\n\n\"The worst sound a child can hear is her mother crying.' The worst sight a child can see is her country falling apart through a television screen. The worst thing a child can experience is all of these things without the understanding of why it’s happening. My elementary school teacher turned on the TV during class. How strange, I thought, for her to interrupt class for a TV show. The loudspeaker came on and my principal announced everyone needed to go home. There was some kind of emergency. Mom picked me up. I had a weird feeling. Mom and dad's friends were on our living room couch. They looked sad. Dad sat across from them in a chair and stared at the TV. I went over to him and hung onto the chair he was sitting in. Silence covered the room like my favorite blanket covered me at night. I looked at the TV. I looked at everyone’s faces. I looked at the TV again. And I started to cry.\" - Alli Murray, junior communications major at Saint Joseph's University\n\n\"I distinctly remember the words, 'Mark, you have an early dismissal.' I was standing on the school playground. Recess was over. Confusion set in. Mark was the ninth or 10th kid to leave early. Usually kids with early dismissals just left. Only unscheduled dismissals were announced to the school, and the loudspeakers had been dismissing students all day. I could tell something was strange. I looked at the recess aide, trying to read her face for more information. I found no comfort. The combination of shock and worry had left her motionless, as if she was frozen in time. Too young to comprehend the look, my confusion never progressed to worry or fear. We returned to class. No announcements were made. No teacher turned on the news. The day continued on as normal, yet eerily small classes left something unsaid. All I remember is a vast feeling of confusion. Clarity about that day would only come years later. I would watch the events for myself. That’s when I felt the fear.\" - Brian Radermacher, junior international relations major at SJU\n\n\"Is your mom OK?' I stared at my blonde-haired best friend Alex as the rest of our third-grade class gazed at the TV. Alex’s big blue eyes looked right past me as she said, 'I don’t know. She had a meeting there this morning.' I put my hand on her shoulder. Third-grade me didn’t know what to say. Alex’s name stumbled from the loudspeaker, asking her to come to the office. I gave her my package of Dunkaroos — the one my mom had packed me for snack time — before my teacher took Alex downstairs. I didn’t know what else to say or do. A few minutes later, Alex ran back into our classroom and hugged me, crying. She told me, 'Her meeting in New York got cancelled when she was on her way this morning. She turned around before she even crossed the bridge.' Again, I was speechless, but this time it was the good kind of speechless. A few sighs of relief, the return of my Dunkaroos and one long hug later, I knew everything was OK again in our third-grade world. I wasn’t so sure about the other world.\" - Jessica Sweeney, senior English major at SJU\n\n\"I remember thinking to myself, 'Why is this morning recess longer than usual?' I was new to the second-grade lifestyle, but I didn't think a longer recess was part of it. The hallways echoed with voices coming from classroom TVs. The TVs were only used on special occasions. So at first I thought this was a sure sign of a fun day ahead. But my teachers seemed more serious than usual. There was whispering and multiple teachers' meetings throughout the day. I got off the bus and my whole family was already home, which was weird. Nobody wanted to know how my day was. They just wanted to watch the news. My parents had the same look all of my teachers had. They shut off the news and told me I couldn't watch TV that night. They told me something happened in New York -- bad guys crashed planes into some buildings. At 11 p.m., when I was supposed to be in bed, I sat at the top of the steps secretly watching the news on the living room TV. I remember planes and smoke and crying. Before that moment, I thought the worst kind of people were the boys who wouldn’t let the girls play wall ball with them. But I guess I couldn’t stay that naïve forever.\" - Mary Kate Viggiano, junior communications major at SJU\n\n\"There was a chilling silence followed by a crazed rush: 'Attention faculty and students, the World Trade Center has just been hit by a plane.' I thought to myself, 'World Trade Center? What's that?' I was in third grade at the time and had only ever referred to the buildings as the Twin Towers. The single-file line my classmates and I were forming to walk to the library quickly dissipated into a scamper of squeaky tennis shoes and cries. We didn't know exactly what was going on, but we knew something was not right. The principal dismissed us and my mom picked me up in our gray Toyota Sienna mini-van. We then picked up my dad from his office and went home. My dad turned on the TV and I watched as the screen displayed a burning building, crumbling steadily. A short while passed. I can still remember my mother's shriek as the camera showed the second plane hit its twin.\" - Alex Zerpa, senior English major at SJU\n\n\"My brother was always small growing up. He sat in the front row for his first-grade class picture. He was the first up to bat on our T-ball team. He sported the nickname 'little Puleo.' That was Jesse. Yet, when he was led by the hand into my classroom on September 11, 2001 — amid teachers pacing in front of televisions, parents forming frantic lines in the lobby and hushed conversations drowning out loudspeaker announcements — Jesse looked smaller than ever. I remember looking to the grown-ups, waiting for someone big to pick me up or bend down to comfort me. I remember one parent after another coming in with grief and worry on their faces. And I remember my brother gently grabbing my elbow and leading me away from the chaos to a quiet corner. We sat cross-legged, facing one another. 'It's OK,' Jesse said. Even though he was young and tiny and his voice cracked slightly, I remember thinking he was braver than all those big people that day. I reached out my hand to take his. In that moment, I believed him. I have never thought of my brother as small again.\" - Samantha Puleo, junior criminal justice major at SJU\n\n\"More than 20 rambunctious first-graders piled onto the carpet, chatting and giggling, without a care in the world. Mrs. Accardi situated herself in her chair at the front of the classroom, preparing to read one of her many short story books. Then the phone rang. I was very silent and still on the carpet as I watched the expression on Mrs. Accardi's face go from glee to gloom. My intuition told me something was off. No other child in the classroom seemed to notice. I could not help but face away from the noise and the kids on the carpet. I watched Mrs. Accardi struggle to keep her composure. At the end of the call, Mrs. Accardi quietly walked back to the front of the classroom. 'Children,' she said, 'something very, very terrible has just happened. I cannot answer any questions, but school is cut short today and you will be going home. If you have any questions, please ask your parents.' That is when everything became a blur.\" - Malia Reynolds, junior communications major at SJU\n\n\"I woke up on September 11th feeling ill, but not enough to stay home. It was a feeling of weakness and fear that I did not quite understand. I arrived at school and filed into my classroom. I took my seat and stared blankly at the television screen. Our teacher always had the news on in the morning, so nothing felt out of place. The morning bell rang and we all stood and recited the Pledge of Allegiance. I started to feel even weaker. I asked to sit down because I felt as if I could not stand. I looked past the teacher and watched these words fill the screen: \"BREAKING NEWS: NEW YORK CITY NORTH TOWER OF WORLD TRADE CENTER HIT.' I suddenly fell to the floor. I was the first student in my class to see the crash. I think back to 9/11 now and reflect on how intensely sick I felt from the moment I woke up that day. Something was not right, and it bothered me that I could not understand why I felt that way. That day was the first and last time I ever felt that way.\" - Sara LaMachia, junior communications major at SJU\n\n\"Without fail, Pa Tom was always parked outside the school one hour early', in his blue and white Cadillac, waiting to pick me up from third grade. My classmates would invariably look out the window and say 'Pa Tom’s here, almost time to leave!' My third-grade teacher even knew my grandfather by name. At first, on 9/11, when our principal proclaimed over the loudspeaker we all needed to 'go home immediately,' Pa Tom and his Cadillac were nowhere to be found. My teacher walked me up the steps with tears in her eyes, clenching my hand as if I was her own child. I wondered how something so bad could happen on such a beautiful, warm and sunny day. I wanted to know what was going on. I wanted to feel safe. When I reached the top of the steps and turned the corner, Pa Tom was waiting inside for me, not in his usual parking lot spot. In the midst of something so tragic, something I barely understood, I have never felt safer than when I saw Pa Tom walking down the hall in his blue jeans. I never wanted anything more than to be strapped safely in the backseat of his blue and white Cadillac.\" - Denise Sciasci, senior English major at SJU\n\n\"Mrs. Kelliani was scurrying around the classroom, doing chores like she was in a rush to have guests over at her home. She closed the blinds that covered our classroom windows only to then separate two of the blinds to take a peek out. The loudspeaker echoed through the school hallways, instructing teachers to close their doors and stay away from the windows. A teacher from down the hall came into our classroom, almost jogging, wheeling a television in on a stand. Mrs. Kelliani floated around the room rather quickly. I felt safe, but could also see the panic oozing from her eyes. I remember later walking into my home through my garage door and seeing my mom sitting on the couch, tears pouring down her face. My dad stood by her side, his arm on her shoulder. And for the first time that day I was exposed to the true emotion of the incident, and the news that reported it to the country.\" - Olivia McEachern, junior English major at SJU\n\n\"A faint jingling emanated from the tan dial-up phone on the wall of my third-grade classroom. Mrs. Vanderspurt danced over to it, flashing her permanent smile and pointer finger to the class — silently telling us to give her a minute. Gripping the phone close to her ear, I noticed her smile fade away. Water began to build up in the bottom corners of her bright blue eyes. Something was wrong. As if a script lay in her hands, she announced to the class there had been an incident in New York City. I instantly questioned the safety of my Aunt Beth who resided in the city. Minutes after hearing the news, several of my classmates began leaving school. One by one they raced to their wooden cubbies, grabbed their backpacks and embraced their guardians. I watched the thin red second-hand on the classroom clock tick by. I wiggled in my seat, awaiting the school's regular parent pick-up at 3:20 p.m. I spotted my mom when I walked out of the school's dark green front doors. I rushed to her side. With my head titled toward the sky, I noticed frightening gray smoke clouds and asked, 'Is Aunt Beth OK?' Being told that my aunt was safe made me feel at ease. Then I learned my Uncle Steve, a former state trooper, was headed into the city.\" - Kelly Patterson, senior marketing major at SJU\n\n\"The TV flickered on and off, on and off. The image of glass spires cutting through a smoke-filled sky flashed so fast across the screen I thought I had imagined it. When I asked my mother why she kept turning the TV on and off, she told me that as long as the news was still running, daddy was OK. He worked for a TV news station. Earlier, when my mother, usually brimming with questions about my day, picked me up from school in silence, I knew instantly something terrible had happened. I spent the day perched on a barstool in the kitchen, watching my mother repeat the on-and-off relationship with the television. She made phone calls in hushed tones. “New York ... firemen ... helping ... leaving…\" I picked up these words through the whispers, but they didn’t make sense. I knew daddy was a volunteer firefighter in our small suburban Philadelphia hometown, but why would he be going to New York? When she got off the phone, I asked her if daddy was on another fire call. She said no, he was at work making sure the news stayed on the air. The curious third-grader in me kept asking questions: 'When is daddy coming home? Why is the sky dark on the TV? Are you OK?' She answered hesitantly, her normal confidence stripped away.\" - Leigh Anne Tiffany, senior biology major at SJU\n\n\n\nDan Reimold, Ph.D., is a college journalism scholar who has written and presented about the student press throughout the U.S. and in Southeast Asia.

Christianity is the third most popular religion in Singapore after Buddhism and Taoism, covering nearly one in five Singaporeans according to the 2020 census. At the same time, the city-state is home to various evangelical mega churches that preach against homosexuality.\n\nLee noted in his speech that gay rights remains “a highly sensitive and contentious” issue to conservatives in the country.\n\n“What we seek is a political accommodation, one that balances legitimate views and aspirations among Singaporeans,” Lee said.\n\n“But everyone has to accept that no (one) group can have things their way,” he added.\n\nTo gay rights activists, the continuing ban on same-sex marriage is a significant blow. At stake is more than the option of having a white wedding in church: in Singapore, couples in registered marriages have access to greater housing subsidies and adoption rights than single people.\n\nSo while activists in the LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) community welcomed the repeal of the gay sex law, many were disappointed too.\n\nAnd that disappointment will only have deepened with the suggestion by some of Lee’s ministers that not only would the government remain opposed to gay marriage – it may even create extra hurdles to prevent people from seeking to challenge the marriage laws in court.\n\nLaw minister K Shanmugam said in an interview with state media that Parliament, rather than the courts, would hold the power to define marriage – effectively making it harder for people to legally challenge the government’s policies as several gay men have attempted in recent years.\n\nThat has played well with some conservative religious groups.\n\n“We are heartened that the government has indicated they will be taking steps to protect the prevailing norms and values of the Singaporean society on the issue of marriage,” said Bishop Titus Chung in a statement issued on behalf of the Diocese of Singapore.\n\nThe National Churches Council, made up of several local churches and Christian organizations, said that its members “further appreciated” the government’s assurance that it would “uphold and safeguard the institution of marriage.”\n\nAnd the Singapore Catholic Church also welcomed the government’s move. “Otherwise, we will be taking a slippery road of no return, weakening the fabric of a strong society which is founded on the bedrock of holistic families and marriages,” it said.\n\nActivists, meanwhile, have signaled their disappointment.\n\n“Any move by the government to introduce further legislation or constitutional amendments that signal LGBTQ+ people as unequal citizens is disappointing,” more than 20 activist groups said in a joint statement.\n\n‘This isn’t the end’\n\nStill, some activists say they prefer to focus on the positives, at least for now.\n\nAs associate law professor Eugene Tan of the Singapore Management University put it: “Singapore removed a law long regarded as being discriminatory towards gay men. To view the current situation as removing one prohibition in favor of preserving another is overlooking the progress made.”\n\nIn 2012, Gary Lim and Kenneth Chee, a gay couple who had been together for 15 years, challenged the law against gay sex at Singapore’s High Court.\n\n“For us, repealing (the gay sex law) was never about gay marriage,” the couple said. “We are just both relieved that after ten years, (its abolition) has happened during our lifetime.”\n\nA gay rights supporter at the annual Pink Dot event in Singapore. AFP Contributor/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHowever, they admit to being disappointed with the government’s remarks on marriage.\n\n“We expected that to happen, but it isn’t the end,” Lim said. “The work doesn’t stop and with this repeal, things will get stronger and move forward as the queer community heals.”\n\n“Getting married would be a nice acknowledgment of our relationship and love for each other but at this point, it isn’t the most important thing,” Chee said.\n\n“But it (puzzles me) how our marriage would affect straight marriages, that I don’t understand,” he added.\n\n“I hope that the conservatives can one day see gay people are not dangerous or a threat to them or their children. They don’t have to fear us.”\n\n“And maybe in the future we can all forge a relationship and work together.”", "authors": ["Heather Chen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/10/21/over-25-years-later-roots-of-lgbt-history-month-remain-in-missouri/71157732007/", "title": "LGBT History Month was founded by a Missouri educator in 1994 ...", "text": "Growing up gay in rural Potosi, Missouri during the 1960-70s, Rodney Wilson wasn't sure where he fit.\n\n\"Queer people existed in the shadows,\" Wilson said. \"That area of the world, that area of our country ... there was not space for them (the LGBTQ community).\n\n\"I didn't know any other people in Potosi who were lesbian or gay.

The House would then need to approve the legislation before sending it to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law. Supporters of the bill are eager to pass the legislation through the House before the end of the year with Republicans set to take control of the chamber in January. The bill would not set a national requirement that all states must legalize same-sex marriage, but it would require individual states to recognize another state’s legal marriage. So, in the event the Supreme Court might overturn its Obergefell v. Hodges decision that legalized same-sex marriage in 2015, a state could still pass a law to ban same-sex marriage, but that state would be required to recognize a same-sex marriage from another state.\n\n2. World Cup\n\nUS and Iranian soccer players will take the pitch for a critical World Cup match today at 2 p.m. ET. At this stage of the tournament, the US Men’s National Team must win or will be eliminated. It will also be a match charged with political tension as the two countries have had no formal diplomatic relations since 1980. This week, Iran’s state media called for the US to be kicked out of the World Cup after US Soccer changed Iran’s flag on its social media accounts to show support for the protesters in Iran. Additionally, a security source said Iran threatened families of its own national soccer team with imprisonment and torture if the players fail to “behave” ahead of the match today. The warning came after Iranian players refused to sing the nation’s national anthem in their opening match against England on November 21 to support the protest movement against the country’s regime.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback He was imprisoned in Iran.

Rail strike\n\nPresident Biden has called on Congress to pass legislation “immediately” to avert a freight rail shutdown that would “devastate the economy.” The looming rail strike, which could begin as early as December 9, would cause product shortages, spiking prices and factory production issues. Additionally, a strike could cost the US economy $1 billion in its first week alone, according to a new analysis from the Anderson Economic Group. Democratic leaders say they could act as soon as this week by officially adopting a September tentative agreement approved by labor and management leaders. While the railroads say they are hopeful that a strike by more than 100,000 union members can be avoided, they have so far rejected the demands that union negotiators say their members want – including new terms for paid sick days and better working conditions.\n\n4. Volcano eruption\n\nHawaii’s Mauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano, is erupting for the first time in nearly 40 years. Lava is flowing down one side of the volcano but there is no indication of a threat to nearby communities, and no evacuation orders have been issued, the US Geological Survey said. “All indications are that the eruption will remain in the Northeast Rift Zone,” the agency said in an advisory, referring to an area where a volcano is splitting, allowing for lava flow. Ash is now accumulating on the island, prompting some airlines to temporarily suspend service. Red hues from the eruption also illuminated the sky Monday, according to footage captured by Matthew Liano, a resident of Kailua-Kona. “The glow is like nothing I’ve seen here living in Kona for most of my life,” Liano told CNN.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See images of Mauna Loa erupting for first time since 1984 03:05 - Source: CNN See images of Mauna Loa erupting for first time since 1984 03:05\n\n5. Twitter\n\nElon Musk on Monday claimed that Apple has “threatened” to pull Twitter from its iOS app store, a move that could be devastating to the company Musk just acquired for $44 billion. “Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won’t tell us why,” Musk said in one of several tweets taking aim at Apple and its CEO. In another tweet, Musk claimed that Apple has mostly stopped advertising on the platform and called out the 30% transaction fee Apple charges large app developers to be listed in its app store. Removal from Apple’s app store, or that of Google, would be detrimental to Twitter’s business, which is already struggling with a loss of advertisers following Musk’s takeover and a rocky initial attempt at expanding its subscription business.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nWhite House unveils 2022 holiday decorations\n\nThe Christmas trees are up and the presents are wrapped!

She told me her missing daughter, Annette, had been married to a man named Felix Vail, and that Annette wasn’t the only one gone. She knew of two others.\n\nA day after Mother’s Day, May 14, 2012, I met the 64-year-old, bright, short-haired woman and followed her to the property in Montpelier, Mississippi, where she planned to confront Vail.\n\nShe told me what she was going to say to him: “You may never go to jail, but I want you to know that I know and a lot of others know that you took the lives of these three women. You haven’t really gotten away with it.”\n\nWe parked and walked up to his gate, which was locked. She told me he lived down this path.\n\nI followed her over the gate, and we walked down the path, the tall weeds blocking the light.\n\nWhen we reached a clearing, we could see two trailers — a silver one gleaming in the sun and a second one 28 feet long and damaged.\n\nI followed her to the silver trailer. She knocked. No one answered.\n\nShe checked the door. Locked.\n\nCupping her hands, she peeked inside and saw no one.\n\nSo where is this Felix Vail guy?\n\nI turned around and noticed a patch of woods next to the trailers.\n\nWhen I looked back, Rose was marching toward the damaged trailer. I hurried to catch up.\n\nShe checked the front door. Locked.\n\nCircling the trailer, she noticed the back window was missing. She pulled the plastic off the window and slipped inside.\n\nShe opened the front door. Now I could see.\n\nShe rummaged through the trailer and began tossing things she found.\n\nA machete clanked on the floor. Another machete clanked beside it. Then another. Then another.\n\nThen a long sword clanked. Then another. Then another.\n\nA chill ran up my spine, and I glanced back at the woods. Could he be watching us?\n\nFelix Vail discovered he could disappear.\n\nThe blond boy stepped into the sandbox where he liked to play on the family’s dairy farm in the community of Montpelier a half-hour north of Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nHe figured out that, if he stood in the sandbox where a tree blocked his mother’s view, she couldn’t see him.\n\nHe would take one step back, then another, then another, slipping farther and farther away.\n\n“She’d come and find me out there in the orchard 100 yards away,” he recalled in a series of recorded conversations he had with undercover private investigator Gina Frenzel. “I’d be fine or climbing one of the trees.”\n\nHe drifted off for hours at a time, and later, overnight.\n\nHe began testing other boundaries, tasting what he called the “nonsexual” parts of a girl in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen his mother caught him and scolded him, he slid down the wall, crying. “I just crumbled,” he recalled. “I just wanted to die. It was the only time in my life.”\n\nWhat upset him most was he couldn’t do it anymore. “It wasn’t a wrong thing until she was told it was wrong,” he said. “Damn ego, my mother. She totally polluted her son with ego and lies.”\n\nAt school, he excelled. In fifth grade, he made straight A’s, but five times the teacher noted he was “inclined to mischief.”\n\nHe also excelled on the farm. At age 16, he produced 130 bushels of corn in a 5-acre contest, topping every farmer in Clay County.\n\nHis father, Ray, gushed to the newspaper, “I thought my patch was good, but he beat me easily. His is the best I’ve ever seen.”\n\nA year later, Vail volunteered for the military, hoping to be a pilot. When he took an aptitude exam, “I scored the highest score,” he recalled.\n\nBut the military found him unfit for military service. “They said I was not the kind of person who would follow orders,” he recalled, “and that I would be a disciplinary problem.”\n\nOther signs of trouble arose. After his mother announced the family couldn’t keep their mother cat’s offspring, he scooped up the kittens and shot them, recalled his sister, Kaye Faulkner.\n\nWhen a charismatic evangelist came to town, he became one of about a dozen teenage boys who responded to an “altar call” at the Montpelier Baptist Church.\n\nHe told his family he believed he had been called by God to preach.\n\nOn the day he delivered his 10th sermon, he said he felt an “infinitely greater” power, which he compared to sticking his finger in a light socket. “I started getting electrical rushes and thrills and tingles and ... sweat popping out.”\n\nHe later wrote that he saw a “being” that day, “shimmering like a moon-sized sun with infinite energy radiating out from it in all directions at once.”\n\nSuddenly, he said he knew the deepest thoughts of parishioners. “I knew who was screwing who.”\n\nHe never preached again.\n\nFateful meeting\n\nBy the time Felix Vail received his diploma from Montpelier High School in 1957, he was already working an enviable job at one of several plants surrounding the Cities Service (later known as CITGO) refinery in Sulphur, Louisiana — thanks to his favorite uncle, a supervisor there.\n\n“I’m making lots of money,” he recalled. “I have two cars, a motorcycle and a boat. I’m dating about 20 women.”\n\nSlender and 6 feet tall, he drove his Karmann Ghia convertible to nearby Lake Charles, where he hung out at the country club and strolled across the McNeese State College campus, searching for the prettiest women he could find.\n\n“He told me he was an ordained minister,” recalled Cynthia Miller, a student then. “I asked, ‘Where’s your Bible?’ He said, ‘I don’t have it with me.’ ”\n\nShe said he took her to a McNeese football game and afterward asked her for sex. She turned him down.\n\n“Suppose the world ends tomorrow,” he said. “You’ll never know.”\n\n“Well,” she replied, “then I’ll never know.”\n\nSome, however, took him up on his offer. “The majority of women were available to me just for the asking,” he recalled.\n\nMany noticed his light blond hair and piercing blue eyes. “He looked,” one sorority member recalled, “like he had been kissed by heaven.”\n\nMary Horton noticed him.\n\nShe had grown up in the Louisiana swamps, where Cajun food and music overflowed.\n\nShe became homecoming queen at Eunice High School, where she graduated and began attending McNeese State College. She was so popular all five sororities invited her to join.\n\nShe chose Chi Omega, and her friends marveled at how, no matter what, she seemed to find the good in people.\n\nHer cute figure and perky personality captivated many men, and the football team nominated her for the homecoming court.\n\n“All of us horny men were secretly in love with her,” recalled Vail’s friend, Bob Hodges. “She was a doll, very sweet. I would have lifted that girl up on high.”\n\nBy 1960, she began to date Vail, who took her to company shrimp boils, where they stuffed themselves and danced the night away.\n\n“I am so deliciously happy!” she wrote in one of many letters to a childhood friend. “Felix and I have been doing some really unusual things this week and having fun.”\n\nDriving around in his blue Lincoln with a white hardtop, the couple visited an African-American church, played 45s at his relatives, dined at A&W Root Beer and sipped from the same glass of lemonade.\n\nBut their relationship was not all bliss.\n\nOn June 20, 1960, Mary confided, “I really do love Felix, but I don’t think that I like him anymore. He really is sweet, but we don’t see eye to eye on things.”\n\nShe talked of being miserable with Vail and asked her friend to set her up on a date with someone else, hoping Vail would leave her.\n\n“I never could break up with anyone,” she wrote. “I always keep hoping when there is no hope.”\n\nIn response to that date, Vail came to her, sharing that he was suffering from a disease.\n\n“What disease?”\n\n“Mary.”\n\nShe welcomed his words. “He did all the talking, and I just listened. I really had nothing to say — I mean, about us,” she wrote. “He said he’s changed. I have to.”\n\nThe couple dated again, and she continued to see others.\n\nShe joined classmate Kelley McFarland at a house party, and McFarland later heard Vail was so angry he wanted to kill him.\n\nMcFarland said he tracked down Vail at a bar on Cities Service Highway and approached Vail, who responded, “I’d rather not talk about it here.”\n\nThe two men met in the dark woods. Although McFarland sensed Vail’s anger, he and Vail exchanged no blows and went their separate ways.\n\nAfter this, Mary described herself as “miserable,” writing that “Kelley and Felix (were) threatening to kill one another.”\n\nVail remained jealous, she wrote. “Felix says that he doesn’t even want me to walk around the block with another boy now, and I know just what kind of miserable feelings he’s going through. It’s just tearing me up, and I can’t do anything.”\n\nShe reiterated her love for Vail in letters. “He’s going to move to Lake Charles next week, so he’ll be closer now.\n\nOne night at a pool party, Vail “walked up to Mary and just slapped the heck out of her,” recalled her former boyfriend from high school, Leonard Matt.\n\nHe wanted to retaliate, but others held him back.\n\nBefore fall ended, Vail told Mary he wouldn’t give her a Christmas gift because he didn’t believe in giving at designated times.\n\nShe planned to buy him something anyway, “even if it’s a lollipop,” she wrote her friend. “This is one thing I love, and it won’t change for me.”\n\nWhen her friends questioned his refusal to give, she defended him, calling him a “wonderful person.”\n\nIn an Oct. 12, 1960, letter, Mary confided, “I say things that I don’t mean when I’m angry — like at Mom and Felix, for example, and I usually say the ugliest things to the ones that I love most because they are capable of hurting me the most. You always hurt the ones you love, the ones you shouldn’t hurt at all.”\n\nSadness and fear\n\nFelix Vail and Mary Horton married on a sunny day, July 1, 1961, in Eunice, Louisiana. When he slipped on her wedding ring, she nudged him, reminding him to say the marriage vow. As they headed for their honeymoon in Orange, Texas, rain pelted their gray convertible, drenching them before they could get the top back up.\n\nThat fall, she dyed her hair brown, back to her original color, and began her job as a second-grade teacher at Moss Bluff Elementary School.\n\nFellow teacher Myrtis Quinilty gave her a ride each day. She said they decided to join a local gym together because “Felix did not want her to lose her figure.”\n\nWhen December came, Mary worried she might be pregnant, and Quinilty said Vail didn’t want a child.\n\nA fellow teacher drove Mary to the doctor, where she learned the news. “We had been so careful and still I got pregnant,” Mary wrote.\n\nFor a week in February 1962, the couple celebrated a “real honeymoon” in Acapulco, Mexico, where they rode in a boat, soaked in the sun, ate lobster and listened as a band serenaded them.\n\nBack home, Mary dyed her hair blond. Vail worked the late-night shift and often stayed gone. When he returned, he talked about playing golf and bowling in leagues.\n\nMary wrote in a May 3, 1962, letter, “Felix hasn’t been acting so sweet earlier, but I haven’t helped. I never stand up for him or say anything nice to him.”\n\nHer sister-in-law, Sue Jordan, told her the only reason Vail believed Mary wanted to get married was to have a baby — not because of him.\n\nAfter Mary heard this, she wrote her friend, “I can see, looking back, from many things I said how they could have been misunderstood.”\n\nShe insisted “we are very happy now,” but her sadness seeped through, writing how unattractive she felt being pregnant.\n\nShe switched her hair color to baby blonde. A month later, she tried silver blonde.\n\nOn the couple’s first anniversary, they greeted their baby, Bill, whom she adored and sang to.\n\nWithin a month, she suspected she might be pregnant again.\n\n“My stomach has begun to get larger, and I don’t eat much,” she wrote. “It kind of excites me in a way.”\n\nShe talked of expanding her skirt. “Wonder if it’s not a tumor or something else. It hurts when you press my stomach on the right.”\n\nInside the Maree Apartments, where they lived in Lake Charles, strange things happened. One morning, the couple awoke to find their front door had been removed from its hinges.\n\nAnother time, they found the front door on their apartment wide open. Nothing was missing.\n\nMary began receiving threatening calls.\n\n“She was afraid,” Quinilty recalled. “Mary told me, ‘Felix and I decided it must be somebody watching because he only calls when he’s not here.’ ”\n\nDespite her fear of drowning and of anything that crawled, Vail took her by boat into a wildlife reserve, where she saw an alligator sunning itself before slithering into the water.\n\nWhen they spotted snakes curled up on the muddy bank, Vail blasted them with his shotgun. Dirt rained down.\n\nHe gunned the 40-horsepower motor, taking her way out into the Gulf of Mexico “until we couldn’t see the camps anymore,” she wrote, “and the water was so rough that I was a little scared.”\n\nShe heard “a funny creaking noise, and I just knew that the boat had sprung a leak because we had hit the waves so hard like at Acapulco.”\n\nVail bailed water, and they made it home.\n\nShe confessed to several Chi Omega sisters that her husband had done “something awful” in Mississippi. She wouldn’t say what.\n\nShe spoke with her mother about divorcing him, recalled her brother, Will Horton. Their mother, Lillie Mae Horton, a devout Catholic, urged her daughter to stay and work things out.\n\nDeath and disappearance\n\nDarkness had long enveloped Shell Beach on Oct. 28, 1962, when Vail drove up in his boat at 7:30 p.m., saying his wife, Mary, had accidentally fallen into the Calcasieu River while they were laying trotlines.\n\nAfter two days of searching, authorities recovered her body near the spot where he had told authorities she disappeared.\n\nHer funeral followed the next day, Halloween.\n\nHer former roommate Cynthia Miller, attended with her husband, wearing a black maternity dress.\n\nWhen she walked up to Vail to share her condolences, he replied, “I’m sorry y’all couldn’t come to our party.”\n\n“What party?”\n\n“We called y’all, but y’all weren’t home.”\n\nThe words stunned her because “I never got a call from him,” she recalled. “My husband didn’t like him at all.”\n\nThe more she pondered, the more puzzled she grew. “What is he talking about a party at a funeral? Mary is dead.”\n\nFour days after the funeral, deputies arrested Vail at work, hauling him to jail and questioning him. He refused to take a lie detector test.\n\nThe coroner ruled the death an “accidental drowning,” and Vail walked free from jail days later.\n\nMonths later, he picked up his son, Bill, from the Louisiana home of his late wife’s aunt and headed for Mississippi.\n\nFelix Vail traded the Mississippi hills for the San Diego cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. His brother, Ronnie, was stationed there in the Navy, doing four tours in Vietnam, where he earned three bronze stars.\n\nVail left his son, Bill, behind with his mother and father, who continued to operate the family’s dairy farm in Montpelier.\n\nIn 1965, Mercy Hospital employed him as a technician, and he began working for Dr. Ivan Baronofsky, an open-heart surgery pioneer who had been chief of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.\n\nFellow surgeon Dr. Elliot Senderoff recalled Baronofsky’s experimentations, including a wild one that failed to curb angina with X-rays. “He was always having ideas about ways to do things.”\n\nVail oversaw a kennel of 40 dogs for the heart research and helped operate a heart-lung machine. At night, he took college courses in English and speed-reading, working toward a college degree.\n\n“I have to go to bed,” he wrote his mother, Nell Rose, in a March 9, 1965, letter. “It is 10 p.m., and we have surgery tomorrow at 7:15 a.m. I will have help with the pump on this one, but after it, I’ll have to operate it alone. I hope the first patient doesn’t die. Quite a few people do in heart surgery, so it is possible.”\n\nHe urged her to lie about his whereabouts. “You can tell people about my job, but tell them I am in Alaska.”\n\nWithin a few months, he returned to Mississippi and took his son, Bill, back with him. From that point forward, Bill split time between California and Mississippi.\n\n“I kept changing my accent so as not to attract attention,” Bill said in an interview he recorded months before his 2009 death from cancer.\n\nWhen “love-ins” began at the park, Vail visited them, watching people listen to music, roll around in the grass and smoke marijuana.\n\nAfter an affair with a married nurse, he traded his medical work for life as a hippie, hitchhiking, bicycling and exploring. For months, Bill lived on a farm run by a religious cult called the Holy Order of MANS.\n\nHe said his father made him try marijuana and LSD as a child. “He thought it would enlighten my mind. I didn’t like it.”\n\nAs for companions, “my father went through more girlfriends than I could count.”\n\nOne of them was Robin Sinclair. She met Felix Vail at a San Diego bus stop in 1967.\n\nThe 17-year-old slender brunette was spending the summer with her sister when he approached her.\n\n“He was into the metaphysical, getting in touch with the subconscious,” she recalled. “He was a different person than I had ever met before.”\n\nThey began dating. When summer break ended, she returned to the San Francisco Bay area without him.\n\nIn October 1968, while listening to Iron Butterfly and other bands play at a concert, Vail appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. She saw it as a sign they belonged together.\n\n“He was always on a very even keel, like he was a little detached and studying everybody,” she said. “He was the observer.”\n\nVail had his young son with him, and they bounced from place to place.\n\nBill “was neglected,” Robin recalled, “and Felix let him smoke pot. Bill would just run wild. He would make some friends with people at a hamburger stand, and they fed him.”\n\nAt the time, she said, “I was young and naive and concerned with my next joint. I didn’t worry about any of that.”\n\nAfter being evicted for failing to pay rent, they watched another couple’s home over the Christmas holidays, she said.\n\nBefore the pair returned, she learned she was pregnant, sharing the news with Vail. “He said, ‘Well, I don’t think you’re emotionally stable enough to handle the pregnancy.’ ”\n\nWhen morning came, Vail had vanished with his son, she recalled.\n\n“A friend told me that he went back to Mississippi, that it was time for his son to go to school and that he didn’t want to be with me.”\n\nHeartbroken, she moved back in with her parents. “There was no place to go, and I was sick, sick, sick.”\n\nIn August 1969, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, and penned Vail an angry letter.\n\nTwo months later, he showed up, and she told him, “Get out of here. I don’t want to see you again.”\n\nVail and Sharon Hensley meet\n\nFelix Vail spent time in a second-story apartment on Nob Hill in San Francisco.\n\nOne night, a neighbor above him knocked on his door, saying they were filming upstairs and had run out of electrical plugs. Could they plug their extension cord into one of his outlets?\n\nVail agreed, and the neighbor invited him to watch them make their porn film. He stepped upstairs, glimpsing the writhing bodies.\n\nOne day while housesitting at a high-rise apartment, he stripped and stepped out onto the balcony, soaking up the sun. Some time later, he looked up to see a brunette joining him.\n\nShe was 20 with long, dark hair. Her name was Sharon Hensley, so attractive that she had modeled while growing up in North Dakota.\n\nThey became friends and then more than friends, despite him being a decade older.\n\nVail handed her a copy of “The Grape Cure,” the 1928 book in which author Johanna Brandt claimed a combination of fasting and eating grapes had cured her of stomach cancer.\n\nDespite physicians condemning the diet as “quackery,” Vail and Hensley became believers, filling a bathtub with grapes they collected from vineyards.\n\nThey hitchhiked across California, living off the land. Vail’s 8-year-old son, Bill, accompanied them as they slept near vineyards and orchards.\n\nHe recalled his father sharing how his mother died. “(He said) he and my mother were out fishing …, that a boat had come by and caused a big wave and knocked my mother out of the boat and she didn’t know how to swim, had on no flotation and immediately sank and drowned. My father said he almost died trying to rescue her.”\n\nThen one summer day, when his father thought he was outside playing, he overheard his father sobbing and speaking to Sharon.\n\n“He told her that he had murdered my mother,” he recalled. “I heard the girlfriend saying, ‘Oh, I know you just must feel responsible for it.’ … He said, ‘No, you don’t understand. I really did kill her.’ ”\n\nEmotions flooded Bill. He wanted to hit his father. Then run. Then cry.\n\n“I was just so angry with my father,” he said. “He was actually a good father in many ways, but still how do I reconcile what I’ve just heard? I couldn’t.”\n\nShortly after that, the trio hiked to Mexico’s Baja Desert, where they camped and fasted, “which is miserable for an 8-year-old,” he recalled.\n\nHe decided to pray. “I really started talking to God, and just said, ‘God, get me home.’ ”\n\nTo him, home meant Mississippi, living with his grandparents.\n\nAfter their desert trip, the trio trekked north until they reached a vineyard near Merced in in central California, where Bill met a 13-year-old migrant worker.\n\n“He was very curious about me living with no shirt and no shoes,” he recalled. “We got to be friends.”\n\nIt was Aug. 21, 1970, when Bill began to share the story of his father with his new friend. “The more he heard of my story, he said, ‘Why don’t you just turn him in to the police?’ ”\n\nWhen Bill heard those words, “It was like ‘ding.’ The light came on,” he recalled. “He told me there was a town about two miles away, and I started walking right then.”\n\nIn the town of Livingston, he found the police station, where he told officers he was hungry and tired of using the drugs his father gave him, that he wanted to go back to school and live like other kids, and that he had overheard his father admit to killing his mother.\n\n“At first, they didn’t believe me, just kind of shooed me out, said, ‘Yeah, kid, go away,’ but I was committed,” he said. “I was not going to take ‘no’ for an answer.”\n\nHe camped out on the front steps until one detective listened.\n\nAt a beach along the Merced River, authorities found his 31-year-old father and 21-year-old Sharon Hensley, carrying a bag filled with LSD capsules.\n\nTheir only food? A bag of grapes.\n\nPolice charged the couple with LSD possession and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\n\nNewspapers across the U.S. printed stories about the arrests, and the National Enquirer published a photograph of the towheaded boy playing with a “lawn toy instead of drugs after being placed in a foster home.”\n\nVail received a six-month jail sentence, plus three years’ probation, after pleading guilty to a lesser charge of LSD possession.\n\nCalifornia authorities shared their information with Louisiana authorities. Once again, the district attorney in Lake Charles passed on prosecuting Vail for murder.\n\nBill returned to Mississippi to live with his grandparents, who gained full custody.\n\nOn Jan. 23, 1971, he saw his father and Sharon Hensley in their driveway.\n\nHe stood frozen, wondering where he could run. “I really thought he was going to kill me,” he said. “My grandmother came back out and reassured me that he wasn’t going to hurt me.”\n\nAfter a while, he and his father sat down and spoke, and his father said he did not blame him for time spent in prison, Bill recalled. “He actually blamed the girlfriend, which was strange ‘cause she had nothing to do with it.”\n\nVail’s family questioned how he and Sharon could legally be in Mississippi when they were supposed to be serving their time on probation in California. They soon realized they couldn’t.\n\nA day later, the sheriff came. He told Vail’s family he had a cablegram from California, asking him to pick up the couple for questioning.\n\nVail’s mother told the sheriff she didn’t know where her son was.\n\nFour days later, Vail and his girlfriend, Sharon, hid on a car’s floorboards as his family transported them out of town. At the bus station in Grenada, Mississippi, the family gave the couple enough money to return to the West Coast.\n\n“Don’t know if (it) was the right thing to do,” Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family. “We definitely feel that they both need psychiatric help. But there seems to be no way that can be arranged. So God help them, and us, is our prayer.”\n\n‘She believed in love’\n\nSharon Hensley grew up in the state capital of Bismarck, North Dakota, where buffalo once roamed free on the hills. A post-World War II baby born five days before Christmas in 1948, she dated football players and belonged to the high school’s Demonettes, an award-winning dance team founded by a former Rockette.\n\nOne summer day, she and her best friend, Connie Woodworth, stepped into the Missouri River and nearly drowned. Another time, when they drove with their boyfriends on a gravel road, Sharon panicked rounding a curve, and the car rolled three times.\n\nThrown clear, she rushed to check on her friends. When she discovered they were OK, she wept, Woodworth recalled. “She was a person who cared deeply for her friends and family.”\n\nThe girls graduated in 1966, and Sharon attended Bismarck Junior College, where she took classes in dancing and acting, performing in a play with her older brother, Frank.\n\nYounger brother Brian adored his sister. Although she was 11 years older than him, when the radio brimmed with Beatles songs in 1964, Sharon and her girlfriends played the records and had him dance with them.\n\nWhen summer came, he tagged along with them as they sunbathed on the river’s sandbars. “It was heaven for a 6-year-old,” he said.\n\nThey picnicked, played volleyball, snapped Polaroids and tossed a new toy called the Frisbee, he recalled. “I just remember sunshine and happiness.”\n\nIn 1967, Sharon discovered she was pregnant. Wanting to escape her hometown, she followed her brother Frank and other classmates to San Francisco, where thousands of other young people were already gathering for the “summer of love.”\n\n“She believed in love,” Brian recalled. “She believed in happiness. She believed in flowers and beads.”\n\nAfter arriving in the Bay area, she stayed in a home for unwed mothers, where she gave birth to a girl she named “Cherry” after the popular Neil Diamond song. She told friends she wanted to keep the child, but was unable to.\n\nTwo years after leaving for California, Sharon was in jail and her mother, Peggy, headed there with a $5,000 cashier’s check to bail her out. “I’m going to get Sharon and bring her home,” she announced.\n\nBut when she returned, Sharon wasn’t with her.\n\n“She said she had lost her daughter,” Brian recalled. “She cried almost every night.”\n\nDepression overwhelmed his mother. “She was never the same after that.”\n\nIn the summer of 1972, Sharon appeared unannounced with Vail at her childhood home in Bismarck. They had been hitchhiking, eating macrobiotic foods, meditating and practicing yoga.\n\nThe more the family witnessed, the more horrified they became. Sharon wore a mini-skirt with no panties and had armpit hair and leg hair like a man, Brian recalled. “I thought she was freaking way out.”\n\nShe had been losing weight and with it some of the curves that made her a model. She was also losing clumps of hair.\n\nShe seemed brainwashed, Brian said. “You could just tell she was not the same person, that this guy was controlling what she was saying.”\n\nIf someone asked her a question, “either Felix would answer the question for her, or she would look at Felix while she was giving the answer.”\n\nBrian went one day with Vail to the Elks Club, where his father was a member. “They had a workout room, and Felix gets totally naked.”\n\nVail tested out the exercise equipment then strolled into the steam room, where “these older gentlemen just freaked out on him because he was hippie looking and walking around naked.”\n\nThe men forced Vail to leave. When he objected, insisting he was a guest of Harry Hensley, one man shot back, “The hell you are. I know Harry Hensley better than that.”\n\nBrian said he traveled with the couple to a small grocery store. While Vail distracted the clerk, Sharon stuffed jars of grape juice into a duffle bag. “I could even hear the bottles clanging.”\n\nWhile the clerk questioned what was going on, Sharon dashed out with the bottles. When the clerk tried to pursue her, Vail stood in the way.\n\n“We got away,” Brian recalled. “The cops didn’t come.”\n\nThe couple left North Dakota and traveled to Mississippi, where they stayed with Vail’s family. On the dairy farm, they helped paint the family home.\n\nThe couple also sunbathed in the nude, drawing more than a few glares from neighbors.\n\nPeggy Hensley received a telephone call from Sharon, who said she and Vail were heading to New Orleans and then to Miami to make pornographic films.\n\n“What daughter tells her mother she’s going to do a porno?” Brian asked. “I think it was a cry for help. That’s what my mom thought.”\n\nHe said his mother wanted to travel south in hopes of getting her daughter back, but his parents were unable to do that.\n\nIn early 1973, Sharon telephoned and talked of traveling to South America, where she and Vail would eat natural foods and write a book, Brian recalled.\n\nIt was the last conversation any family or friends had with his sister.\n\nSharon’s last letter contained a picture, which showed her holding a pen and sitting at a table at the home of Vail’s parents. She captioned the Polaroid: “Making travel notes.”\n\nWhen Brian gazed at the photograph, all he could see was her sorrow, a shell of the sister he loved.\n\nSharon disappears\n\nIn New Orleans, Sharon Hensley worked as a table dancer at a strip club — something Vail said she had done before in San Bernardino, California, and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n“Guys would give her another $100 to dance on their table, rather than go to the next table,” Vail recalled. “She’d make a $1,000 a night sometimes.”\n\nVail left with Sharon for Miami, where they lived in a commune and worked at a health food store not far from the Voyager Inn, where the porn movie, “Deep Throat,” had been surreptitiously shot for $25,000. Now on its way to grossing $600 million, the film helped turn Miami into a mecca for porn flicks.\n\nThe couple managed to get a telephone number for Len Camp, who had worked on the iconic movie, and Vail recalled a man approaching them.\n\n“He asked if we had ever been in movies and did we realize the camera might love us?” Vail recalled. “He didn’t say porn.”\n\nThe couple took him up on the offer, which paid them $500 a day, he said.\n\nWhen they arrived, there was no script. Instead, they ad-libbed sex scenes, Vail recalled.\n\nRather than casting Vail in the part of a sexual stud, the director had Vail take on a different role. “You get on the bed, and you start masturbating,” he recalled. “They walk in and look, and you’re surprised.”\n\nFor him, it was hardly enjoyable. “So much of it was ridiculous.”\n\nMonths passed, and Sharon Hensley’s family never heard from her. Worried, her mother telephoned Vail’s mother.\n\nIn March 1974, Sharon’s mother received a letter from Vail, who wrote that he was in west Florida: “I share your concern about Sharon but then she is of age and she should have the right and freedom from you to decide for herself how she wants to live her time on earth.”\n\nHe wrote that he last saw Sharon about a year ago in Key West with an Australian couple traveling around the world. All he recalled was the first names of the couple, who were talking with Sharon about “island hopping around South America and the West Indies and they talked of stopping in Hawaii for a while, maybe a couple of years in the Philippines, then India, Egypt and the Mediterranean islands and coasts. I don’t know which of these (if any) they decided on or in what order.”\n\nBrian remembered his mother throwing down the letter, not believing a word.\n\n“Felix didn’t remember the boat’s name, the couple’s last name or much of anything else,” he said, “but, boy, he sure had down their travel itinerary.”\n\nIn fall 1975, Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family about what her son had told her: “He was surprised that you had not heard from Sharon by this time.”\n\nVail told his mother the names of the couple that Sharon left with were Frank and Sally — different names than he gave a year earlier.\n\nVail explained that before Sharon left, she burned all of her identification cards, got new IDs and declared that she would become a completely different person.\n\nHis mother told her family, “My heart goes out to you. I know how hard (it) would be if Felix had gone like that.”\n\nVail’s son, Bill, recalled his father taking him aside and mentioning Sharon. “He said she would never bother anyone ever again.”\n\nThe words upset Bill, who believed his father had just confessed to another killing. “There was not a soul I could tell about it because I had had my experience in court when I was 8,” he wrote. “No one would believe me. It would be my word against his, and no one would believe a 13-year-old.”\n\nWhile riding a bus back home to north Mississippi in 1975, Felix Vail spotted a 17-year-old girl seated behind the driver. He scooted beside Sharon Campbell, who was half his age. He told her how fit she looked, saying he needed someone like her to keep him fit.\n\nIn a 2014 sworn statement, she said she felt flattered and shared her telephone number. Not long after returning home, he showed up in a yellow Volkswagen bug.\n\nDuring one conversation, he shared that his first wife had drowned while they were fishing. She felt sorry for him.\n\nHe talked of California, the mountains and other places he had visited. His words intrigued her, so different from her cloistered upbringing that she had begun to rebel against.\n\nHe wanted her to travel with him, and she told him the only way her parents would let her do that would be if they were married.\n\nOn July 24, 1975, they tied the knot and honeymooned in Gulf Shores, Alabama.\n\nThe couple never consummated the marriage because he was unable to “obtain an erection,” she told Louisiana prosecutor Hugo Holland.\n\nAfter their honeymoon, the couple, along with her 1-year-old son, traveled to Clinton, Oklahoma, where Vail said he had a job.\n\nDuring the day, he left, and she and her son hung out at the hotel, swimming in the pool.\n\nSeveral weeks later, she went with Vail to visit his relatives in Louisiana. There, she said a niece told her, “You probably need to know that he killed his first wife.”\n\nShe said the niece continued, saying, “Yeah, they arrested him. … We all believed that he did it. … He drowned her out of a boat.”\n\nThe teenage bride discounted what she was hearing, thinking he would be in prison if he had killed someone.\n\nBut as months passed, she concluded he “had no value in the female gender,” she said. “He hated women.”\n\nShe later traveled with Vail to his parents’ home in Montpelier.\n\nWhile there, he “was outdoors doing something around that yellow (Volkswagen) bug,” she said. “I walked out there. I don’t think he knew I was coming out there.”\n\nHe opened a compartment, and she said she saw “sinister, surgical looking saws of all shapes and sizes in a neat, neat formation. They were so clean … like you would see in a surgery clinic. I mean, they were that sterile.”\n\nTo her, the sight screamed evil. “It scared me. I said, ‘I’m not going anywhere with you.’ ”\n\nShe left, annulled the marriage and never looked back.\n\nIn 1977, Vail joined a crew for Western Geophysical, a seismograph company with an office in nearby West Point, Mississippi.\n\nThey traveled across the U.S., stomping geophones into the ground. The devices helped locate oil and natural gas pockets.\n\nMost of the crew were in their 20s. Vail was the exception. Fit, thin and tan, he wore a pageboy haircut, but his craggy neck gave away that he was approaching 40.\n\nMembers of the crew said Vail regarded eating meat as unholy, but believed marijuana and LSD were “God’s creations,” giving insight into the divine.\n\nWhen the crew discovered Vail missing one day, they retreated to find him hanging from a tree. He was meditating, arms crossing his chest.\n\nWorking with the crew that summer, Vail found himself in jail again.\n\nOn June 28, sheriff’s deputies arrested him near Bath, New York, less than an hour and a half south of Rochester, on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance.\n\nVail explores ‘enlightenment’\n\nOn a bus heading back to Mississippi, Vail ran into a woman named Ella from Holland. “She was rich,” he said. “She had made her money in Transactional Analysis.”\n\nThis new approach to psychoanalysis had become a national rage, fueling such bestsellers as “I’m OK, You’re OK” and “Games People Play.”\n\nElla planned to attend the International Transactional Analysis Association Conference in San Francisco, but in the meantime, “she was going to see America,” Vail recalled.\n\nHeading for New Orleans, she exited the bus instead with Vail and went with him to his childhood home of Montpelier. From there, they rode together on his motorcycle across the country until they arrived at the symposium in August 1977.\n\n“It was one of the most interesting weeks,” Vail recalled.\n\nWhile there, he listened to speakers about Transactional Analysis, which describes parent, adult and child “ego states” when people interact with each other\n\nVail recalled a presentation from a group known as the “Frog Pond,” which believed that people could have their lives transformed, just as fairy tales described frogs being transformed into princes or princesses.\n\nDuring that presentation, the Frog Pond people shared sexual research, Vail said. “Normally, orgasms are only a few seconds. They found a way to sneak into the orgasm and hold the orgasm … (for) several hours.”\n\nAfter the conference, Vail headed south, reconnecting with an old friend, Brian Biedebach, and a San Diego native named Carolyn, whom he had dated in 1975 in Placerville, California. Their romance had flourished in that old Gold Rush boomtown, but when she returned from work one day, Vail had vanished like the prospectors.\n\nNow reunited, the pair resumed their relationship. They married on Christmas Eve 1977 and rented a modest house in San Bernardino. “He decided he had allergies to everything,” she recalled. “We had to scrub the house from top to bottom and put plastic on things.”\n\nWhile she worked at her job, he never found one, other than trying to grow marijuana once in the back yard.\n\nShe covered all the couple’s expenses, paid to get his teeth fixed and even bought him a Karmann Ghia. “I was paying for so many things, I was starting not to trust him.”\n\nHe signed a note to repay her for the car, but she said she “never saw a dime.”\n\nShe had long been frugal with her earnings as a teacher, saving $23,000 toward a future home.\n\nWhen Vail learned of this, he became upset she wouldn’t give him some of it, telling others, “Carolyn doesn’t believe in community property.”\n\nShe did pay about $600 (the modern equivalent of nearly $2,400) for him to attend the Erhard Seminars Training (known as est), where trainers promised participants they could break free from their pasts.\n\nWhen Vail returned home, he kept her up all night, saying he should be an est trainer “because he was so much more enlightened,” she recalled.\n\nHe insisted they drive two hours to San Diego to talk with her mother, trying “to alienate me from my mother by convincing me that she never loved me,” she said. “How stupid was that. How stupid was I.”\n\nThe marriage disintegrated soon after the couple went on a double date with Biedebach and Alexandra Christiansen. While they drove in a car together, Carolyn said Christiansen glared at Vail in the rearview mirror and asked, “So why did you get married?”\n\nThe next day, Vail left with Christiansen.\n\nCarolyn said she soon found out he also had an affair with a neighbor. “I was so furious.”\n\nShe telephoned Vail’s mother and detailed what had happened. “Doesn’t this surprise you?” she asked.\n\n“No,” his mother replied.\n\nThat response confirmed that he had “a history of behaving this way,” she recalled. “If your parents don’t defend you, there’s something wrong there.”\n\nWhen he showed up later to collect a few things he left behind, she had friends serve him with divorce papers.\n\n“He was not responsible. He was immoral. But, boy, he knew it all.”\n\nAfter taking the divorce papers, Vail backed his car all the way across the property until he smashed into her MGB sports car.\n\nAbout a month later, he telephoned and told her, “I love you.”\n\nUtilizing a phrase popular in est circles, she replied, “I got it.”\n\nShe never looked back, moving more than 100 miles away. “He was so mentally deranged I couldn’t get far enough away.”\n\nAnnette\n\nIn summer 1981, Mary Rose and her teenage daughter, Annette Craver, greeted people at a friend’s yard sale in the Montrose neighborhood in Houston, Texas, not far from Rice University. They had contributed a few items before their move to San Antonio.\n\nThey had just returned from a vacation in Mexico, and Annette felt heartsick, still infatuated with a boy named Adolfo, who was unable to join her in America. Two years earlier, her father, a Vietnam veteran, had died in a car crash in Mexico.\n\nWhile people poked through stacks of clothes and books, Vail pulled up on a motorcycle and spoke with Annette, a singer-songwriter who at 15 was so bright she was starting her senior year at a private school aimed at those entering the medical profession. He was 41 and had done some carpentry work in the area.\n\n“When I saw her, I thought, ‘That’s going to be my new girlfriend,’ ” he recalled.\n\nAfter moving with her daughter to San Antonio, Rose struggled to find work and relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nAnnette boarded with an art teacher near her high school and dreamed of becoming a midwife, assisting with three births. Vail began to visit her there.\n\nIn April 1982, Rose and her daughter invested in a Tulsa home that had a rental cottage behind it. Rose began renovating both of them.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Annette joined her mother in Tulsa. Vail appeared a few days later.\n\nHe convinced Annette to leave with him on his motorcycle. They lived off the $500-a-month Social Security check that she received from her father’s death, Rose recalled. “It was over one year before I saw her again.”\n\nThat fall, Annette became pregnant and underwent a painful abortion. “Ideally, we should have been ready to have it, go off into the woods and live happily ever after, but as it was neither of us was ready (me mainly),” she wrote. “That sure shot down my ‘I can’t wait to have a baby’ trip.”\n\nThe couple rode south of the border, stopping near Cancun at Isla Mujeres, where her old boyfriend lived, Annette wrote in a Dec. 4, 1982, letter to her mother. “The first couple of nights I looked everywhere for him.”\n\nShe confessed, “Felix has come close to leaving me a couple of times already because of my fantasy that Adolfo was better than anyone I could ever be with, including him.”\n\nSeven months later, she saw her old flame. “He’s teaching children, doing artwork,” she wrote her mother in a postcard. “He asked about you.”\n\nThe couple trekked to Sausalito, California, to see friends.\n\nJerry Woodall recalled seeing the couple outside. “They were in a sleeping bag at 10 in the morning, about 20 feet away. Felix was on top of her and having sex. Annette was looking at me, grinning and waving.”\n\nHis then-wife, Meredith McMackin, recalled the scene as “just embarrassing. We were trying to ignore it.”\n\nShe recalled Vail as a “very handsome” and “spiritually enlightened” man who seemed to have it all together.\n\nShe noticed, too, “this coldness and controlling aspect to his personality. Annette was so open and alive, but I think he just totally dominated her. He would try to convey that he was this higher form of being. At first, I thought maybe he was evolved, but then I realized it was this arrogant act.”\n\nLater that summer of 1983, police in California arrested Vail for violating probation a dozen years earlier.\n\nAnnette telephoned Woodall, who gave her $200.\n\nAfter Vail walked free from prison, he and Annette decided to marry. Because she was only 17, she needed permission.\n\nShe told her mother that she loved Vail, that the couple was already “spiritually married” and that the couple would marry in Mexico if she refused.\n\nNot wanting to lose her daughter completely, Rose said OK.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 1983, the couple married in Bakersfield, California.\n\nFour months later, Annette turned 18, making it possible for her to collect more than $98,000 on life insurance policies taken out by her late father. Accompanied by Vail, she withdrew all the money in cash from a San Antonio bank. She bought a Fiat convertible that Vail liked and paid for his dental work.\n\nIn a letter to a friend, she described her husband as “a separate entity from his family. I’ve met them all, and we visit but infrequent. And Felix has established his own code of ethics which free him from any obligation.”\n\nOne day in April 1984, Rose returned home to find Annette waiting on her doorstep. She spoke of divorcing Vail and enrolling in college.\n\nShe talked, too, of Vail’s temper, Rose recalled. “She confessed to me that she had lied to me about Felix breaking his hand by dropping a pot on it. She said the truth was Felix took a swing at her face. She dodged the blow, and he hit the wall.”\n\nA few weeks later, Vail showed up, Rose said. “They fought almost constantly. He left after a few days. He was insanely jealous of her, would go into a rage when she talked of her desire to go out with younger men.”\n\nShe and Annette worked on renovating the two homes, enjoying their time together, she recalled. “We started a garden.”\n\nAnnette received a letter from Vail, who vowed their time apart would fuel their love. “After we hung up,” he wrote, “I went out to a park and ran and hung and talked with god and smoked some and shot some pool and rode with the top down out through the marsh playing ‘Iron Butterfly’ [“In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida”] and bathing every inch of your body-spirit being with love.”\n\nHe referred to their being apart as “deprivation jail” — “only this time it’s your ego that is our (my) jailer.”\n\nThe idea of her cutting away ego’s “feeder roots and creating roots between your spirit and the cosmic ground of loving makes me hot for you,” he wrote her. “My mind is kissing you everywhere.”\n\nVail returned to her daughter’s life, Rose recalled. “Annette told me, ‘Felix is the wisest person in the world, and I can’t make decisions without him.’ ”\n\nHis influence on Annette grew stronger. She compared Vail to God, Rose said.\n\nThe reunited couple insisted Rose leave. “They became very angry and adamant about me getting out and deeding the place over to Annette.”\n\nRose said Annette fell under Vail’s control and became hostile, accusing her of being a thief.\n\nShe felt devastated. “I have never felt so low in my life.”\n\nWhen thoughts of taking her own life swept over her in spring 1984, she said she realized she had to leave to survive, heading to California to stay with family and friends.\n\nBefore departing, she deeded the house to Annette for $7,000.\n\nWhen Rose later spoke to Annette about the two cats she left behind, Yawni and Puff, Annette shared that Vail had killed them, calling them “a bother.”\n\nIn a July 24 letter, Rose encouraged her daughter to keep their communication open and continue her education. “I feel afraid that you are allowing all of Felix's attitudes to become yours and hope that you will be able to sort out what is true and what is manufactured through his fear.”\n\nBy the time that letter arrived, Annette had already added Vail to the deed. A month later, she deeded him both homes.\n\nAs fall neared, the couple told neighbors they were leaving on vacation. When Vail returned to Tulsa in October, he was driving the Fiat alone.\n\nA neighbor, Wende Austin, asked where Annette was. Vail replied that Annette had a lot of money on her when they parted company and that she might see some people she knew in Denver.\n\nUpon learning that Annette had failed to return, Rose telephoned Vail. “He told me that while they were camping, Annette had a sexual dream about being with other men in Mexico, and she wanted to go there,” she recalled. “He claimed that the dream made them both realize that she should have her freedom.”\n\nThe next day, she said Vail told her he had put Annette on a bus with $50,000, but gave no further details.\n\nHis explanation made no sense to Rose, who wondered how her daughter could have been carrying this much cash since the couple hadn’t planned in advance to split up.\n\nOn Oct. 22, 1984, Rose filed a missing person’s report. She told the Tulsa Police Department that each person who talks with Vail “gets a different story about the amount of money that Annette took with her and where she might be. We all believe that he knows where she is or has done something with her.”\n\nFelix Vail answered the door, seeing Detective Dennis Davis and another officer from the Tulsa Police Department. It was Jan. 22, 1985, and Vail had been expecting them.\n\nWeeks earlier, he had dropped off a photograph of Annette at Davis’ request. Two weeks before that, Vail had filed for divorce, citing an inability to find her after a “diligent search.”\n\nHe invited the officers in, and they chatted for more than two hours.\n\nDavis said her mother, Mary Rose, mentioned her daughter had received more than $90,000 from her father’s estate.\n\nVail confirmed that was true, saying the couple had spent much of that money traveling in foreign countries. He said they kept their money in cash because they didn’t trust banks and that he had found about $10,000 in cash when he returned home.\n\nThe next day, Vail telephoned a lawyer, who promised to talk with the officers and tell them to “leave me alone,” he wrote in his journal.\n\nBy the time Davis returned five days later, Vail had a detailed alibi: The couple left Tulsa between noon and 3 p.m. Sept. 13, 1984, and stayed the night in a hotel in Claremont, Oklahoma. After two nights of camping on the river, Annette awoke and told Vail she had decided to leave him. He took her to the Trailways Bus Station in St. Louis and left before she bought the ticket.\n\nHe told the officers she told him she was headed for Denver, where she planned to get a fake ID card and leave for Mexico.\n\nThey asked Vail if he would take a lie detector test. He said no.\n\nAfter the officers left, Vail wrote in his journals about Annette’s mother, Rose. She is “making Davis dance, and he’s trying to make me dance.”\n\nVail claimed Annette had bought a gun. “I regret some not letting Annette kill her [mother] when she wanted to & Annette is free of her (at least as long as she stays incommunicado).”\n\nHe wondered what to do about Rose. “Now how do I get free of her short of giving her the property?” he asks in his journal. “One way (that I don’t know how to do) is prove to Davis she is manipulative old whore who’s [sic] motivation is accusing me (of whatever) is mostly money and very little if any parental concern for Annette.”\n\nHe scribbled a letter to Rose. He blamed her for the “bad things” in Annette, saying she had “stymied the love between us to the point where we both decided that she could get more ... from miscellaneous emotionally and sexually hungry men than she was getting from me.”\n\nHe wrote that after the couple came back from Costa Rica, Annette “began seeing friends and relatives ... and doing what she called completing her relationships with them for the purpose of getting ready to drop everybody and start over.”\n\nHe wrote that she “disappeared herself from you because she realized that you probably would never voluntarily stop re-energizing in her and superimposing on her the same value system you live by that makes her see you and your mother (and herself partially) as zero self image whores for approval in the form of male attention as prerequisite to the periodic and temporary permission to feel good about yourselves.”\n\nVail explained the two left each other “with no plans to communicate in the future … I have not the slightest idea where she might have gotten to by now. I will tell you that I love the spirit part and very much respect her right to freedom and so I also assure you that even if I did know, I would not tell you.”\n\nHis response felt like a cold slap to Rose. She could feel police interest in her daughter’s disappearance growing cold, too. Perhaps they would be less skeptical if she talked to them in person.\n\nShe returned to Tulsa in April 1985, letting Vail know she would be in town.\n\n“Dear Mary, I would like to see you to [sic],” he wrote her. “I think it could be more than lovely to be with you some. I look forward to it. Love, Felix.”\n\nWhen she arrived, she was unable to reach him and grew worried about her daughter. She slipped inside the rental cottage where her daughter had lived. All of Annette’s clothes were gone, and so were nearly all her possessions, including the diary she kept.\n\nInside a Barbie suitcase, Rose found a photograph of her daughter and several of her identification cards. She also located things that Annette had written, including a Feb. 17, 1984, note that contradicted Vail’s claim that the couple had spent most of her inheritance on their travel to Mexico and Central American countries.\n\nInstead, the note detailed how they used the money to buy the Fiat, pay off all of Vail’s loans, and deposit $36,000 into Louisiana Savings. “As of today, we have $41,600 in cash.”\n\nRose shared the information with police.\n\nDetective Davis showed up again, “acting like Columbo with two more questions,” Vail wrote in his journal.\n\nHe had told Davis before that he and Annette kept their money in cash. Now he acknowledged the couple divided the money into smaller cashier’s checks.\n\nAfter a while, Davis left. Vail hoped the answers satisfied the detective.\n\nHe dreamed about Annette in bed “with this great big ugly fat guy,” he wrote in his journal. “She was feeling dumb and ridiculous for having let him into her and being at the same time as high as she could be … (from) the energy of his desire and attention.”\n\nVail never heard again from the detective, who closed the missing person’s case.\n\nRose kept telephoning, hoping to talk with Vail. She tried him at home in Tulsa. She tried him at his parents’ home in Mississippi.\n\nOn Sept. 14, 1985, she finally reached him in Tulsa. When she asked about Annette’s missing clothes, he told her he had given all of them to charity.\n\nWhen Rose asked about Annette’s whereabouts, he refused to say where she was.\n\nShe mentioned that she was talking to police. When she pressed for more details about what happened to all the money that Annette inherited, she said Vail shot back, “That’s all you really care about — her money.”\n\nShe hung up.\n\nEach day in his journals, Vail wrote about his encounters with women. He hopped from bed to bed, sometimes in the same night.\n\nWhen the sex was good, he described it as “electric” and “mutually orgasmic.” When he was unable to have sex with a woman, he blamed it on her “fat.”\n\nWhen problems arose in the relationships, he blamed their egos, never his own.\n\nDecember came, and temperatures dipped below freezing. Vail watched television, “vibrating on commercials.”\n\nHe thought about Annette. He had told Tulsa police she was schizophrenic and suicidal. Now he wrote that everyone he had met 3 or older was “schizo.”\n\nLess than two weeks before Christmas, he stepped out into the snow at 1 a.m. After watching the movie, “The Hotel New Hampshire,” he returned to the icy white, this time in his bare feet. “It’s coming down in bigger flakes now & around 2 inches, it is magic to walk & frolic in it, falling & fallen, clothes on & clothes off.”\n\nBurning bridges\n\nFed up with the lack of progress in her daughter’s disappearance, Rose returned in 1987 to Tulsa, where she began working at her old job as a manager for the Bakery on Cherry Street.\n\nShe spent thousands on private investigators. When they were unable to locate Vail, she decided to look herself.\n\nTipped off that he was staying at someone’s house, she went there with a friend and found him sitting outside.\n\n“So where did Annette go?” she asked.\n\n“Mexico.”\n\n“Where in Mexico did she go?”\n\nHe told her that he and Annette had made a pact they would contact each other after five years.\n\nHe never looked up, never stood up and never looked her in the eye.\n\nShe walked away, shaking her head in disbelief. She didn’t believe a word.\n\nVail became fast friends with Tulsa native Scott Porter, an expert in martial arts who held more than one black belt.\n\nVail believed he was a martial arts expert, too, after practicing flying kicks into a mattress.\n\nEach morning, he and Porter worked out, lifting weights together before hitting a Chinese buffet.\n\nOver lunch, Vail shared that he had never felt bound by society’s rules, Porter recalled. “He dropped his silverware and began eating with his hands like a caveman.”\n\nAt nights, the pair played pool, drank beer and sometimes visited strip clubs in Tulsa, where Vail tucked dollar bills into the strippers’ panties. “Tulsa had more churches than gas stations,” Porter said, “but also more strip clubs than anywhere else I’ve lived.”\n\nBack home, Vail listened to the songs of Porter, who still dreamed of a career in music.\n\nThe two men reminisced about the women missing from their lives. Vail, at 45, had been married to Annette, just 18, and Porter, at 28, had dated Rose, who was 36.\n\nPorter had driven Rose to California before returning home alone. “My heart was absolutely broken,” he recalled. “She needed to move on, and I didn’t.”\n\nNot long after Annette vanished, Rose telephoned Porter and shared her suspicions that Vail had something to do with her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nPorter began examining each word his friend spoke.\n\nWhile he discussed his hopes of reuniting with Rose, he noticed Vail never mentioned that possibility with Annette.\n\nOne night, Vail seemed more open. “He was crying like a baby,” Porter recalled, “angry it didn’t work out differently.”\n\nVail explained that Annette “wanted to ‘recreate’ herself and that she didn’t want any contact with any portion of her past life. She wanted to totally break with herself.”\n\nWhile Vail talked of breaking with the past, Porter was busy searching for his.\n\nHe had been adopted and decided to move to Minnesota to reconnect with his birth parents. While there, he met his future wife, Jennie.\n\nReturning to Tulsa with a small son and another on the way, he renewed his friendship with Vail, who was so kind he later watched the boys while the couple went out on dates.\n\nOnce, during a discussion of fidelity, Porter said Vail shared that he felt “nobody could ever be faithful to one person.”\n\nMonths later, Vail “starts hitting on my wife,” Porter said.\n\nUpset about this, he took Vail on a walk and confronted him.\n\nVail denied it all, Porter recalled. “He said, ‘No, no, she was hitting on me.’ ”\n\nAs they crossed the Arkansas River Bridge, a fleeting thought ran through his head. “I was wanting to throw Felix off and wondering if I’d get away with it.”\n\nViolence and jealousy\n\nVail began dating Beth Field. She was attracted to his intelligence, and the pair grew close.\n\nArguments followed, and he kept calling her a “whore.” During a December 1987 argument, he became so violent he ruptured her eardrum, according to court records.\n\nShe told Vail there was no justification for physical violence, and she said he replied, “If you quit behaving like a whore, I’ll quit hitting you.”\n\nShe recalled discussing the issue with a therapist. “I finally told this woman, ‘It’s all very nice, but one of us is going to be dead before this works.’ ”\n\nField took the advice of a close friend and attended an intensive 10-day meditation course in August 1988 on Colorado’s Western Slope. To her surprise, Vail came, too.\n\nAfter the course, she received a telephone call from Rose, sharing details about the disappearance of her daughter, Annette.\n\nFrom that point forward, Field said she began to examine Vail’s words more closely, realizing “the probability that he had taken Annette’s life.”\n\nHe told Field he and Annette had gone camping, that she decided she wanted to get away from her mother and that he had helped her set up an opportunity for her to change her name and move on.\n\nVail denied any involvement in Annette’s disappearance.\n\n“Then one time,” Field recalled, “he said, ‘What if I said yes?’ ”\n\nFour months after the meditation course, he entered her home unannounced. Already drunk, he accused her of “imagined promiscuity,” according to the court order.\n\nHe slapped her, struck her and threw her across the bedroom.\n\n“Will I get out alive?” she asked.\n\n“It depends on what you tell me,” Vail replied.\n\nThe judge gave her a protective order, requiring Vail to keep his distance. Two weeks later, the sheriff reported that Vail was nowhere to be found.\n\nField said she felt caught in a “sick, addictive relationship, and it took quite some time to fully unravel it.”\n\nOver time, her attachment to him began to fade.\n\nWhile Field was visiting a meditation center in Texas in 1990, Vail arrived and castigated her, and she felt the same anger and defensiveness rising up as before, she said.\n\nShe walked away to compose herself, and when she returned, she sat down next to him. “I told him, ‘There is a part of you that goes off, and it’s sick and it’s dangerous.’ ”\n\nShe said he looked at her and asked, “Really?”\n\n“Yes, really.”\n\nThis time, the message seemed to soak in.\n\nVail left the next day, and with a single exception about five years later, she did not see him again.\n\nMary Rose moved to Ashland, Oregon, in 1989, working as an administrator for a private Waldorf School. She was hoping for a quieter life than the one she had in California.\n\nMore than a year later, she visited a psychic, asking if she could talk about her daughter Annette.\n\nThe psychic put her hands over her forehead and spoke. “Oh, my gosh, this is not something I usually talk about when I see images like this.”\n\nShe never shared what she saw, but Rose knew her daughter was dead and that she needed to get to the bottom of this.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, she removed the back seats from her Toyota van and put in a makeshift bed for sleeping. She made curtains to hang over the windows.\n\nShe had previously talked by telephone with Felix Vail’s sister, Sue Jordan, who now lived in Canyon Lake, Texas.\n\nNow Rose decided to drive the more than 2,000 miles there, hoping she might find out more in person.\n\nJordan answered the door and invited her in. The two women sat in the living room, and Jordan recalled the last time she saw Annette. In October 1984, the family attended the Cam-Cal Fair in Sulphur, Louisiana, along with Vail and Annette.\n\n“She told me Felix was giving Annette a hard time,” Rose recalled. “He criticized the way she was dressed.”\n\nDays after the fair, the couple left together, and a few days after that, Vail returned alone, “extremely distressed, eating meat and drinking alcohol,” she said Jordan told her.\n\nThat struck Rose as strange because Vail was a longtime vegetarian.\n\nJordan shared that Vail told her that Annette wanted to leave, that he took her to a bus station and that she left with some Mexican men, heading for Mexico.\n\nJordan also mentioned that Vail’s first wife had drowned. That was news to Rose.\n\nBefore she left, she said Jordan remarked, “Oh, you know, there was another woman that disappeared. I remember her mother calling my mother for years, checking to see if they’d heard from her. I think her name was Sharon.”\n\nAfter the conversation, Rose sat down at a typewriter, pecking out every word she could remember. She also telephoned the public library in Lake Charles.\n\nThe librarian remembered the 1962 drowning of Vail’s first wife, Mary. She recalled that he had taken out life insurance policies on his wife prior to her drowning. She also said the insurance companies were suspicious and didn’t pay the full value.\n\nThe librarian made copies of those newspaper articles and mailed them to her.\n\nAfter reading them, Rose reached out to Mary’s family in Louisiana, speaking to Will Horton. He shared his suspicions about Vail and a copy of the 1971 National Enquirer article. When she read it, she learned that Sharon’s last name was Hensley.\n\nThat solved one problem, but created another. Where was Sharon Hensley from? She had no idea.\n\nIn 1994, she read in the newspaper about Dolores Strehlow’s disappearance from Medford, Oregon, seven years earlier. Police had just arrested her husband, thanks to the work of Detective Terry Newell.\n\nShe contacted Newell, who was able to help her find the family of Sharon Hensley.\n\nWhen Rose dialed the Hensley family, Sharon’s mother, Peggy, answered.\n\n“Do you happen to know who Felix Vail is?” Rose asked.\n\n“You bet I do.”\n\n“We need to talk.”\n\n‘A fraud, bum and kind of a joke’\n\nNow back in Mississippi, Vail lived with his mother and father in their home in Montpelier.\n\n“Beginning lucid in the daily conscious waking dreaming and in the nightly sleep dreaming is the beginning purpose of this journal,” he wrote May 6, 1988. “A 24-hour-a-day lucid conscious spirit presence is my nature. … Starting tonight all the dreams go in this book.”\n\nIn one dream, he made his “fat” wife (whom he called “my cow wife”) disappear so he could be with a beautiful, black-haired woman.\n\nDuring the day, he worked some on the family’s farm. He also tinkered with his Fiat and used his gravity boots to hang upside down in a barn.\n\nOne day, he “chased off a poor three-legged hound dog,” he wrote in his journals. The next, he “shot the 3-legged dog and cleaned up the garbage.”\n\nHe detailed winning pool games and bedding women, sometimes having sex in a grain bin, an old bus or their homes while their husbands are away. “We are amping each other’s electric in a way we both desperately need right now in our lives,” he wrote Feb. 28, 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Robin Sinclair telephoned a Mississippi newspaper, wanting to buy an advertisement to remind Vail that he had a daughter he had never met.\n\nThe newspaper put her in touch with Vail, and the two began to write letters and talk on the telephone.\n\nIn one note, Vail “stated he had never gotten over me,” she recalled.\n\nShe felt confused by his words, she said, because she was already living with a man who made her happy — and who would become her future husband.\n\nWhen Vail arrived a few months later, she said the same magic she had felt more than two decades earlier had vanished. “I realized that he was a fraud, bum and kind of a joke.”\n\nPursuit for justice\n\nMary Rose contacted everyone she could think of, including the FBI.\n\nThe detective who had helped her before, Terry Newell, made contact with Jim Bell, a national expert in serial killings working for the FBI.\n\nWhen Rose talked with Bell, she felt she had hit the jackpot.\n\nHe was interested in working on the Vail case if he could swing the time. He remained busy with active serial killer cases, helping train task forces across the U.S.\n\nVail’s son, Bill, told Rose that he was willing to testify, as long as authorities provided protection to his family.\n\nBoth the Tulsa police and the district attorney’s office in Lake Charles revived their investigations into Vail, now considered a suspected serial killer.\n\nBell suggested the victims’ families gather with authorities at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, to share information on Vail.\n\nHe was unable to work on the case and left the FBI in 1995. The meeting in Quantico never materialized, and the cases involving\n\nVail grew cold again.\n\nRose felt devastated. She had worked so hard to make something happened and nothing had. She knew the other families felt devastated, too.\n\nShe sought counseling to help her cope with the grief.\n\nOne night, she listened to a recording of Annette performing her songs, including “Sunset in Winter”: “I’m dying, leaving orange tears, blood upon your face … Throw me gilded kisses, silent sorrow, but do not stay up and wait for me, for I may not return.”\n\nTears streaked down her cheeks. She knew Annette would never return.\n\n‘Not the man I know’\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Vail began dating a woman in Mississippi. At the time, he was 55, and she was 44.\n\n“In 10 years, I never saw a temper,” the woman said.\n\nShe recalled Vail taking care of his parents before their deaths. “Felix was very attentive,” she said. “He was just a kind man.”\n\nAlthough he never worked a job, she said he was the most frugal person she ever met. “He could probably live off $300 a month. He got rental money from the house in Tulsa.”\n\nOne day, she tried to step across the swollen creek in front of her house. Knocked off her feet, the current dragged her downstream.\n\n“If I had died in the creek,” she said, “I would have been added to the list of people that Felix supposedly killed.”\n\nShe knew of the allegations that Vail had something to do with Annette Vail’s disappearance, but she was unaware of Sharon Hensley’s disappearance or suspicions surrounding Mary Horton Vail’s death.\n\n“That man,” she insisted, “was not the man I know.”\n\nRose moved to western Massachusetts, hoping to heal.\n\nIn the fall of 1997, family members and friends held her hands during a memorial service for Annette, whose songs played.\n\nAt night, Rose sometimes stepped outside, gazing at the stars and pondering the past.\n\nShe fumed at herself for letting Annette marry Vail, for failing to stand up to him and for leaving Annette behind in Tulsa.\n\nHer anger boiled toward Vail. Why, she wondered, was he not behind bars?\n\nA dozen years later, she read about a local support group for parents whose children had died.\n\nWould she fit in? She didn’t know, but decided to go anyway.\n\nShe shared stories about Annette, passing around her pictures and poetry.\n\nRose’s work with support groups and sessions with a local therapist helped her do something she had been unable to do for a quarter century — release the heavy burden she felt she had been carrying since her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nAfter a therapy session in which she had sobbed at Annette’s loss, she returned home and listened to one of her daughter’s songs.\n\nAnnette strummed a guitar, and her voice rose. Her mother felt the joy of her daughter and her all-too-brief life, finally able to listen to the music without weeping.\n\nSon’s mixed feelings\n\nVail’s son, Bill, became an Eagle Scout and graduated from Mississippi State University in the top 5 percent of his class.\n\nHe became a mechanical engineer, working for corporations such as Sinclair Oil, and remained active in church and Boy Scouts.\n\nIn 1984, Bill married his wife, Janet. Years later, he received a call from Rose and then from authorities.\n\n“They asked, ‘Did I believe he may have murdered her (Annette)?’” Bill said. “And I said, ‘Yes, I believe based on past experiences, it was entirely possible.’ ”\n\nHe explained his complicated feelings to Rose.\n\n“Felix is a mixture of opposite extremes — he is capable of incredibly unselfish love, and simultaneously he is capable of doing the incredibly selfish and black things he has done,” he wrote. “He values, even demands, honesty and integrity, yet he admittedly will lie whenever it is convenient.”\n\nVail held mixed feelings toward Bill.\n\nIn a letter to his son, he bragged about him holding “center stage with a whole room full of PhDs by simplifying logic sequence problems for them when you were 5.”\n\nBut in his journals, he criticized his son’s Christian faith as “herd animal mentality,” saying, “Ego finally took him over.”\n\nIn a letter, Vail told Bill that after death, he and his half-sister, Simone, should “split up whatever ‘stuff’ I will have accumulated … I love you both equally with all the heart I have.”\n\nBill replied in a letter: “I have always loved you. I can’t help but love you.”\n\nBut barricades remained to their relationship, the biggest of which was “the murder of my mother,” he wrote.\n\nHe mentioned the pain of learning about these two other missing women and recalled what his father had told him about Sharon Hensley.\n\n“I was so angry that you told me because there was absolutely no one I could talk to about it,” he wrote. “I had to keep it to myself knowing that no one would believe you had killed her based on those words, at least not in court.”’\n\nDiagnosed with esophageal cancer, Bill heard from doctors that he didn’t have long to live. “Now,” he told his uncle, Will Horton, “I’ll get to be with my mom.”\n\nMonths before dying in 2009, Bill talked about his father in a recorded interview with his pastor at Grace Church in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\n“Part of me loves him,” he said. “He was a good father. I know that’s hard to believe given what he’s done. ... I have to keep a distance because of what he’s able to do — for my family’s sake.”\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2009, Bill died, and Vail wrote in his journal, “I feel a large empty hole in my being where his life presence has been for 47 years.”\n\nHe then wrote about getting a good haircut.\n\nVail drove to Kansas, but skipped the funeral. If he had attended, he would have heard the recording, his son detailing how he overheard his father talk about killing his mother.\n\nWhen Vail learned of the recording, he wrote Pastor Tim Howey, asking for a copy: “Bill never mentioned to me in his whole life any of the negative stuff about drugs and murder that had been put in his mind about me.”\n\nVail blamed his son’s statements on “false memories,” saying, “I have not known about it until now and am stunned.”\n\nAs for the accusations of murder, he wrote, “I have saved several people’s lives. I have never taken any.”\n\nOn May 14, 2012, I went with Mary Rose as she tried to confront Felix Vail about her missing daughter, Annette. He wasn’t there, but she found a stack of machetes and swords in one of his trailers.\n\n“Could DNA tests be done to see if there is blood on these?” she asked.\n\nI was wondering the same thing.\n\nShe handed me a spiritual tome by the Holy Order of MANS. When I opened it, I read the words, “Look not into the past, for it is no more.”\n\nBefore we left the area, Vail’s sister, Kaye Faulkner, stopped us. She wanted to talk.\n\nRose and I sat in her living room as she spoke about attending the 2009 funeral of Bill Vail. “Bill said he overheard Felix saying he killed his mother.”\n\nShe turned to me. “You should get a copy of that recording.”\n\nShe was convinced, she said, that Felix had killed all three women.\n\nShe was surprised he was still alive. Last year, a tornado smacked his trailer, and he had somehow survived, receiving only minor injuries.\n\nI told her I was interested in talking to her brother. She gave me his cellphone number. She also shared the numbers for her other brother, Ronnie, and her sister, Beth.\n\nWhen Felix Vail didn’t answer, I left him a message that I was interested in speaking with him about these women’s disappearances. Ronnie promised to speak to his brother on my behalf.\n\nOver dinner, Rose opened two manila folders filled with hundreds of pages of documents she had collected on Vail.\n\nThere was the judge’s protective order for Beth Field after Vail had beaten her a second time and the National Enquirer article on the 1970 arrests of Felix Vail and Sharon Hensley.\n\nRose showed me similarities between the two letters Vail wrote — one to her after Annette disappeared and the other after Sharon disappeared.\n\nIn each letter, he insisted to the families that the women had gone away because they wanted to disappear, start over and leave their pasts behind.\n\nWas he the one who really wanted to leave his past behind?\n\nRose shared the 1962 autopsy report on Vail’s wife, Mary, and a stack of newspaper clippings on her drowning in Lake Charles.\n\nVail told deputies that he and his wife had gone trotline fishing, that she was shining a flashlight and that when she warned him about a stump, he jerked the boat to avoid it, and she accidentally fell out. He told them he dove into the water, but was unable to save her.\n\nLake Charles\n\nArriving in Lake Charles, I stood along the Calcasieu River, examining the place where Vail told deputies his wife had drowned.\n\nThe dark, swift river, which bore the Atakapa word for “crying,” swept by as I stood on the dirt.\n\nReassembling this case was going to be even tougher than I thought. Whatever reports the sheriff’s office had made at the time had all been lost.\n\nI stopped by the Southwestern Louisiana Genealogical and Historical Library, which shared copies from old city directories, and I began tracking down those who had lived in the Maree Apartments with Felix and Mary Vail.\n\nOne of them was Judson McCann II. When he finally answered the door, he invited me inside his apartment, filled with photographs of him deep-sea fishing.\n\nHe had been close with Vail, and Mary Vail’s death had always shocked him. He said he couldn’t believe she would be out on the river at night.\n\nHe also couldn’t believe Vail’s claim that he was laying trotlines. He and Vail golfed, but he never recalled Vail fishing. Instead, Vail used his boat to waterski.\n\nMcCann described Vail as a ladies’ man. “Many nights, his car wouldn’t be home, and Mary would be there with the lights on.\n\nWhen Felix was gone, it wasn’t because he was trotline fishing.”\n\nAnother close friend, Bob Hodges, told me that when Mary drowned, “I’ll be truthful with you, that was the end of my friendship with Felix.”\n\nHe never knew Vail to fish and described Vail’s explanation about how his wife drowned as “horse manure. That’s what I think of that story.”\n\nThe odds of one man having one wife drown and two others disappear seemed beyond belief.\n\nI decided to ask criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University what the odds of such a scenario would be. “Smaller than the threshold of chance,” he said. “Either he tends to select partners that lead higher risk lives or something else is going on that’s more nefarious.”\n\nThe family of Vail’s wife, Mary, told me she had been a member of Chi Omega. I contacted a librarian from McNeese State University, who pulled out the old yearbooks and created a list of the members between 1957 and 1961. She shared the list, and I began contacting them.\n\nThey talked of how much she feared drowning. “Nobody believed it was an accident,” her college roommate, Sandra Sudduth Pratt, told me.\n\nI shared the Oct. 30, 1962, autopsy report with renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden of New York City.\n\nHis conclusion? Foul play took place in her death.\n\nThe report showed large bruises with bleeding into tissues on the left side of the neck, which he said suggested she suffered forceful neck trauma before entering the water.\n\nThere were also hemorrhagic bruises to the right calf and left leg above the knee, which he said were consistent with a struggle before her submersion.\n\nMost convincingly of all was the scarf authorities found around her neck that extended 4 inches into her mouth, which suggested traumatic asphyxia before entering the water, he said.\n\n“Somebody had to push that scarf into her mouth. She had to have that scarf wedged in her mouth before she went in the water.”\n\nJoining forces\n\nA half-century after his sister, Mary, drowned, Will Horton went out onto the Calcasieu River and gazed at the place where she breathed her last.\n\nHe never knew she died in this section of the river that snakes north of downtown Lake Charles. He had always believed she had drowned much farther south.\n\nHe said he had looked up to his sister, seven years older than him. “It’s haunting. I keep wanting to talk with her.”\n\nHe told me Mary Rose had contacted him in the 1990s. “You could have knocked me over with a feather when I found out there were two other women.”\n\nHe and Rose bonded in their common cause for justice. She shared letters Vail had written and other documents she had been saving since 1984. Horton shared his sister’s autopsy report, death certificate and other documents his family had been saving since her death in 1962.\n\nHe said he told Rose, “No matter what happens, this is going to be for all three women.”\n\nA cousin put him in touch with former detective “Rabbit” Manuel, who had headed up the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Office’s investigation back in 1962.\n\nManuel had worked thousands of cases, but he had never forgotten Mary’s death, Horton said. “He said Felix’s story just didn’t add up. The fishing tackle was dry. The trotline was dry. The boat was dry. Even Felix’s cigarettes were dry, despite him telling the deputies he dove straight in the water to save Mary.”\n\nHe and Manuel met with “Lucky” DeLouche, who directed the Violent Crimes Task Force, an elite unit that investigated homicides.\n\nThree young detectives took notes as they talked. Manuel shared details from the case, saying deputies wanted to prosecute, but the district attorney wouldn’t let them. Horton shared the autopsy report, Vail’s letters and his belief that Vail was a serial killer.\n\nHorton said DeLouche replied, “This absolutely fits the profile of a serial killer.”\n\nThe other detectives agreed.\n\nThe task force discussed sending Vail’s son, Bill, in to secretly record a conversation with his father. Horton objected, saying that might put Bill in jeopardy.\n\nDeLouche left the task force, and the case grew cold again.\n\nHorton gazed out at the Calcasieu River as Calcasieu Parish Deputy Ron Johnson guided the boat. He had fished and dived in this river since the 1960s.\n\nJohnson led us north of the old Halliburton docks, where newspaper articles said Mary’s body had been recovered.\n\nHorton said his sister feared drowning and refused to swim where she couldn’t see the bottom. “Mary was scared of the dark water, so why was she out there? And why was she out there without wearing a life preserver?”\n\nHe wondered why Vail had failed to seek help closer, rather than boating back toward Shell Beach, more than 5 miles south, especially since he claimed to have trouble cranking his engine.\n\nHe questioned Vail’s story about running trotlines, saying he had waterskied in that high-powered boat many times, but “I never saw a fishing pole. I never saw a tackle box.”\n\nHe said ski boats aren’t designed for trotline fishing because they sit up too high on the water.\n\nHe said a ski boat sits up high on the water, but a boat that sits close to the water is needed to run trotlines. “Felix didn’t even have a trolling motor.”\n\nHe questioned Vail’s claim that Mary fell from the boat when he steered to avoid a stump.\n\nJohnson said dredging during World War II enabled Navy ships, oil tankers and other vessels to use this waterway. He said a trotline can’t survive such traffic, and that’s why fishermen place their trotlines elsewhere.\n\nHorton said Vail never explained to the family what happened that night.\n\n“Our family had a lot of questions, but we never got any answers.”\n\nAnother disappearing act\n\nShortly after Rose rummaged through the old trailer, looking for clues, Vail disappeared again.\n\nHe returned on Labor Day weekend in 2012, only to sell his 17 acres and depart. He left his storm-damaged trailer behind, but the machetes and knives that had lined his floor were gone.\n\nI telephoned his brother, Ronnie, who told me, “I don’t know where he went. He probably doesn’t want anyone to know where he is.”\n\nRonnie, who had worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for 22 years, told me when he heard allegations of the disappearances of these women, “We were all just shocked.”\n\n“Did the FBI ever interview you?”\n\n“No. I’m surprised they haven’t.”\n\nAfter my story on Felix Vail, “Gone” appeared in The Clarion-Ledger on Nov. 11, 2012, I traveled to Montpelier to meet a man who had telephoned me.\n\nWesley Turnage grew up with Vail and recalled a conversation he had in the months following his 1963 graduation from Montpelier High School.\n\nHe said he had car trouble one day, and Vail gave him a ride to the Knickerbocker Manufacturing Co. in nearby West Point, where they both worked.\n\nDuring that drive on Mississippi 46, he said Vail talked first of his son, Bill, and then of his deceased wife, Mary, calling her his “ex-wife” — a word that struck Turnage as strange since the two were not divorced at the time of her death.\n\nHe said the longer Vail spoke, the angrier the man got. “You could see a rage in his eyes.”\n\nVail referred to Mary as a “bitch,” saying she thought another child would help solve their marriage problems, Turnage recalled.\n\nHe quoted Vail as saying, “She wanted to have another kid. I didn’t want the one I got. I fixed that sorry bitch. She will never have another one.”\n\nTime marched on, but he said he never forgot what Vail told him. “It’s like 9/11. Some things stick in your mind.”\n\nI returned to Lake Charles, puzzled by how Vail dodged an indictment in the 1962 death of his first wife, Mary.\n\nHer brother, Will Horton, joined me in the Calcasieu Parish clerk’s office as I pored through stacks of records, trying to find out more information about the grand jury that met on the case Jan. 7, 1963.\n\nFlipping through the pages, I noticed a lot of criminal cases had been dismissed in 1962. When I added them up, I realized then-District Attorney Frank Salter Jr. had the judge dismiss 882 criminal cases — more than three cases for each working day.\n\nHorton told me the original detectives in the case told him that Salter wouldn’t allow them to present the evidence they had collected against Vail.\n\nThat matched the stories I had heard from grand jurors’ families.\n\nHorton left while I continued to dig. A half hour later, he called me to let me know he was talking with District Attorney John DeRosier.\n\n“He’s from Eunice, just like me,” Horton said.\n\nI walked over and met DeRosier, a Vietnam veteran who viewed himself as the guy wearing the white hat and battling the bad guys. He even kept a life-size cutout of John Wayne in his office.\n\nHe said he would be willing to reopen the case if there was enough evidence.\n\nAfterward, I telephoned a retired lawyer who had known Salter.\n\nThe cheerful, white-haired man, who built boats and model airplanes, greeted Horton and me at the door, inviting us to join him at the kitchen table.\n\nA talented attorney in both civil and criminal court, Russell Tritico Sr. had won a 1980 civil judgment, forcing chainsaw manufacturers to put chain brakes on their products.\n\nThe 84-year-old retired lawyer recalled the corruption of those days. He worked back then under his uncle, Joe, who represented then-Sheriff “Ham” Reid, accused of taking bribes but never convicted.\n\nTritico said the sheriff was so paranoid, he stayed in his patrol car, and he never answered the telephone at home unless he heard the right sequence of rings.\n\nHe described Salter as a longtime prosecutor whose “close friends were mostly what I called hoodlums.”\n\nIn the 1950s, Salter began his legal career as an assistant district attorney for then-District Attorney Ed Shaheen, but when the senior prosecutor sought re-election in 1960, Salter ran against him.\n\nTritico said the major issue Salter raised was Shaheen had dismissed too many cases. “Then Frank becomes DA and does the same thing.”\n\nDismissals became business as usual, and defense lawyers showered office secretaries with gifts, especially at Christmas, he recalled. “It was easy money. Of course, the victim might not be happy.”\n\nHe knew about the 1962 death of Mary Horton Vail.\n\nWhen his uncle, Joe, ran against Salter in 1966, her death became a political issue. The candidate showed a photograph of her body after it was recovered from the river as proof of Salter’s political favors.\n\nI asked Tritico about Cities Service, and he told me the company was like the General Motors of the Lake Charles area. I knew Vail’s uncle, Thomas Finnie, had worked there as a supervisor and had arranged for Vail’s job.\n\nIn searching for Salter’s obituary, I had run across the one for his father, who also worked at Cities Service. When I visited Finnie’s 94-year-old widow, Virginia, she confirmed the couple’s friendship with the district attorney.\n\nI shared what Vail said about trotline fishing that night, and Tritico shook his head. The longtime fisherman questioned why Vail would have traveled so many miles up the Calcasieu River when he could have laid trotlines not far from where he kept his boat.\n\n“You don’t run trotlines in deep water.”\n\nFinding Felix\n\nSo where had Vail gone? Had he just disappeared like the women he professed to once love?\n\nI telephoned more of his relatives and friends. They were just as clueless as me.\n\nWeeks after “Gone” was published, I received a telephone call from a man who had read my nearly 9,000-word story online. We discussed Vail, the case against him and his disappearance before the man volunteered, “I know where he is.”\n\n“You do?”\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas. Would you like his post office box?”\n\n“You bet.”\n\nBack in Jackson, I telephoned Enzo Yaksic of Boston, the founder of the Serial Homicide Expertise and Information Sharing Collaborative. No matter what questions I had about serial killers, Yaksic had the answers, thanks to a huge database he had amassed.\n\nMy search for answers in the Vail case led Yaksic to contact Armin Showalter, acting chief for the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, which specialized in serial homicide investigations.\n\nYaksic shared a copy of “Gone” with Showalter, who in turn contacted Calcasieu Parish Deputy Randy Curtis, now taking on the Vail case.\n\nCurtis telephoned me, explaining that he was a 20-year law enforcement veteran who had been transferred from the Violent Crimes Unit to the Forensic Cold Case Division. After reading “Gone,” he called back, wondering if I knew where Vail was these days.\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas,” I said.\n\nDays later, the deputy telephoned with news that the FBI had discovered Vail purchased property at 737 Shadyview Drive in Canyon Lake.\n\nOn Jan. 18, 2013, Curtis decided to confront Vail. He found the suspected serial killer at that address, living in a storage shed so large it could be a home.\n\nCurtis said he read Vail his rights before asking him about the death and disappearances of the women.\n\nVail refused to say anything, accusing families and The Clarion-Ledger of lying about him.\n\nThe whole time, Vail couldn’t stop smirking.\n\nThe sight of that smirk angered Curtis, who worked days, nights and weekends on the case.\n\nOne day, he called to tell me he had found something. Big.\n\nConsensus: Vail killed Mary\n\nNot long after this call, Will Horton shared the number of his cousin, who was in the same rosary group with a caretaker for 90-year-old Isaac “Sonny” Abshire Jr.\n\nI drove to Lake Charles and sat down with the man, who was finishing his lunch in front of the television. He remembered Vail well. The pair had worked together at a chemical plant next to the Cities Service refinery in nearby Sulphur. They refrigerated the chemical butadiene, used to produce tires.\n\nAbshire described Vail as “my helper” and “a good worker. I liked him.”\n\nVail was looking for a place closer to his girlfriend, Mary Horton, who was living in Lake Charles. Needing the cash, Abshire offered him a room for rent.\n\nHe accepted, and Mary became a frequent visitor. “I was kind of like a big brother to her. She was a sweet little girl.”\n\nAfter the couple decided to get married, Vail moved out.\n\nAt work, his disposition soured. He talked about how ugly his wife was when she was pregnant and that he didn’t like his baby.\n\n“Even a dog loves their children,” Abshire said he replied.\n\nOn the Friday before her drowning, the couple visited, bringing their infant son, Bill. Mary confided in Abshire, asking if he\n\nthought Vail could take her baby away.\n\nTwo nights later, word came that Mary had drowned in the Calcasieu River.\n\nDeputies contacted Abshire’s father for help in the search.\n\nAbshire and two fellow workers went out the next day to drag the river. The next morning, Oct. 30, 1962, he returned with one of them, Jimmy May, to continue dragging.\n\nWhile they were talking, “something popped up. A guy with binoculars asked, ‘Does she have blonde hair?’ I said, ‘Yes, that’s her.’ ”\n\nThey recovered the body, and Abshire could never forget what he saw. Her body was rigid, and a scarf was wrapped around her neck before going into her mouth. “It had a big ol’ knot in it.”\n\nThe deputies on the boat boiled in anger, all voicing the same opinion — that Vail had killed Mary. “They believed it was foul play.”\n\nA deputy shared copies of photographs taken that day, and Abshire had held onto them ever since, placing them in a folder he marked “Keep.”\n\n“You hung onto these photos for 50 years?” I asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe told me he gave the photos to Deputy Curtis. He also handed over a copy of the 1962 sheriff’s report, which listed 15 points suggesting Vail’s guilt.\n\nDespite being behind on major bills, Vail had managed to pay an entire year’s premiums in advance for a $50,000 life insurance policy on his wife. He had a second life insurance policy on her for $8,000, which promised to pay double if she died by accident.\n\nDeputies reported that witnesses said Vail told them he didn’t love his wife, that she was stupid and that she looked vulgar.\n\nDeputies also reported that Vail had “sexual relationships with other females and at least one male.”\n\nMost witnesses they talked to felt he was capable of killing his wife.\n\nVail told deputies that his wife was wearing an off-white leather jacket when she went into the water. But she wasn’t wearing the jacket when her body was recovered.\n\nInside his boat, deputies found two life preservers. Mary had not been wearing one, despite her fear of drowning.\n\nAs for the trotline, deputies found it coiled inside Vail’s tackle box.\n\n“That’s why,” Abshire told me, “they thought it was fishy.”\n\nWhen he returned to work, he told his co-workers what he witnessed.\n\nWord spread, and he said his boss hauled him in and told him to stop sharing what he saw.\n\nEventually, Abshire faced off with Vail. “He said he had lawyers that were ready to sue me for everything I had for all I was saying about him.”\n\n“Get your lawyers ready,” he said he replied. “I want to get on the (witness) stand and tell everybody what happened.”\n\nAfter some time passed, Abshire said Vail telephoned him, asking if he still wanted to tell everything to the lawyers.\n\n“Get ‘em,” Abshire said he replied. “I’m still ready to talk. I want to get on the stand and tell ‘em what I know.”\n\nNot long after, Vail left town.\n\nI asked him if he believed Vail had killed his wife.\n\n“Oh, my God, yes.”\n\nMarriage made in hell\n\nOver gumbo and crawfish étouffée, Steve Horton talked about his aunt Mary, whom his family adored so much that he and his wife had named their daughter after her. He showed me her 1962 death certificate, signed by the coroner, Dr. Harry Snatic. The certificate said she “fell from (the) boat while fishing and accidentally drowned.”\n\nHorton detailed the many errors. Snatic had put down the wrong date of her birth. The wrong date of her death. The wrong occupation (“housewife” rather than “teacher”).\n\nHe pointed to the neat signature, “William Vail.” It looked nothing like the handwriting of William Felix Vail that I was familiar with.\n\nHe then directed me to the date of Vail’s signature, Oct. 31, 1962.\n\n“That was the same day as the funeral, which was in Eunice,” he said. “How could he have signed this in Lake Charles?”\n\nHorton shared other documents, which showed Vail had failed to pay any money toward the $1,014 bill for his wife’s funeral, her headstone or her burial plot.\n\n“Dear Sir, I would have contacted you sooner if I had known anything definate (sic) about when I can pay you,” Vail wrote\n\nArdoin’s Funeral Home in 1963. “Thank you for your patience and I’ll be in your office the first part of April to settle the bill. Yours truly, Felix Vail.”\n\nVail never showed and never paid, despite receiving thousands on two life insurance policies he took out on his wife.\n\nThe funeral home won a $1,306 judgment in Mississippi against Vail. He still didn’t pay.\n\nIt was during a bridge game in 1969 that Mary’s mother learned Vail had never put a penny toward the funeral, Horton told me.\n\n“She was so embarrassed, she went and paid.”\n\nI spoke with funeral home operator Gene Ardoin. He remembered Mary as “a beautiful girl. They had a marriage not made in heaven, but made in hell.”\n\nTrip to Canyon Lake\n\nWhen I drove into the Canyon Lake neighborhood where Vail lived, I saw deer grazing on the lawns.\n\nPaperwork I copied at the courthouse showed David Thomason had deeded his property to Vail after he paid the back taxes.\n\nDigging into Thomason’s background, I discovered he and Vail shared something in common — each had a wife who died in an “accidental drowning.”\n\nI decided to dig deeper.\n\nThomason’s estranged wife, Kathey, had drowned in Canyon Lake on July 3, 2005. Her family still had questions.\n\nHer mother, Cathy Simon, still lived in Canyon Lake. She told me her daughter tried to get away from Thomason, who was charged twice with assault but was never prosecuted. “She was terrified of him.”\n\nOn the back lot of Vail’s property, I could see the boat Kathey supposedly fell from and drowned.\n\nFriends told me Thomason was out of town at the time.\n\nIf he did take out a life insurance policy on her, I couldn’t find it, but I did find that insurance companies had shelled out more than a half million in proceeds to him, including $215,400 for a house fire that the fire marshal had ruled a suspicious arson.\n\nVail now lived on this property, and when I pulled up outside his home, I noticed there were no windows. The padlocked fence had barbed wire across the top.\n\nI called out his name and told him I was interested in speaking to him about the missing women. There was no answer.\n\nOn March 10, 2013, I received an email from Gina Frenzel, a redheaded private investigator, whose colleagues nicknamed her “Batgirl.”\n\nObsessed with serial killers, she had read the e-book version of “Gone” before going online to discover Felix Vail was now living in Canyon Lake.\n\nThat was only an hour and a half away from her home in Kerrville, Texas, where her grandfather had been chief of police for 20 years.\n\n“I’m a licensed private investigator,” she wrote me. “Let me know if you need any help.”\n\nI promised I would. Later, I sent a second email, saying I would like to find out more about the suspicious burning of David Thomason’s house on the property where Vail now lived.\n\nOn April 3, she tried to talk to Thomason, and when she was unable to, she telephoned and said she was going to see Vail.\n\n“He won’t talk to you,” I told her.\n\n“Wanna bet?” she replied.\n\nShe called back later with the news that Vail had indeed talked. She told him she was an investigator looking into Thomason’s fire, and he had spoken almost nonstop to her.\n\nShe returned several more times, recording each of her conversations with Vail, who shared details about his life and lectured her about the dangers of ego, even as his own ego overwhelmed their conversations.\n\nHe claimed to have a genius-level IQ surpassing 140 and talked of memories from the womb, saying he could “feel the sunshine” on his mother’s belly.\n\nI shared information from Frenzel’s visits with the expert, Yaksic. He provided many hours of advice and insights, saying Vail seemed “more in line with a cult leader” than a suspected serial killer.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/iowa-mourns/2020/10/12/coronavirus-covid-deaths-in-iowa-lives-remembered/3477467001/", "title": "These are the names of more than 800 of the Iowans who have died ...", "text": "The numbers associated with Iowa’s coronavirus pandemic come regularly. They appear in our inboxes and on our feeds like clockwork, sandwiched between big box store discounts and emails from friends.\n\n4,706 positive cases one day.\n\n40 deaths another.\n\nOver 400,000 recovered to date.\n\nMore than 6,100 lost.\n\nIn the routine of it all a callus grows, a protection against what these numbers actually stand for — people.\n\nBehind these figures are storytellers and hard workers, Cubs fans and pie bakers, mothers and daughters, fathers and sons. Behind these numbers are our fellow Iowans.\n\nThe Iowa Mourns project is a result of months of research to reveal the stories of neighbors and friends lost to the pandemic. In writing about them, we focused on the light of their lives instead of the darkness of their diagnoses, and sought to chronicle who they were, what they did and how they’ll be remembered.\n\nIowa Mourns was made possible by an unprecedented partnership of nine daily newspapers across Iowa’s two premier newspaper organizations — the Register, Ames Tribune, Burlington Hawk Eye and Iowa City Press-Citizen of the USA TODAY Network; and the Council Bluffs Daily Nonpareil, Mason City Globe Gazette, Quad-City Times, Sioux City Journal and Waterloo Courier of Lee Enterprises. Journalists from all over the state contributed, ensuring we painted a true picture of how Iowa has changed from river to river.\n\nWe remain committed to telling these stories. If you would like your loved one remembered in this way, email me at ccrowder@dmreg.com or submit their name here.\n\nTogether, we can make certain the Iowans lost will always be more than a number.\n\n— Courtney Crowder\n\nREMEMBERING:\n\nA\n\nConnie Abegglen, 74, Merrill.

Three archaeologists and an architect are wearing yellow vests and carrying iPads, snapping pictures and recording information about every structure built before 1969. Those actions are part of a two-week effort, during which Paleowest Archaeology will visit 2,500 structures in west Montgomery neighborhoods to identify culturally significant buildings, histories and landmarks related to the struggle for civil rights. Once the data is compiled, a historian and researcher will comb through the information to provide a complete history of the culturally significant neighborhoods. “Montgomery has a rich civil rights history,” said Robert Smith, planning director for the city and the mastermind behind the project. “The city does not have a comprehensive document of that civil rights history.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A state labor department report says recent job gains after three years of losses could signal the end of the state’s recession. The report says Alaska saw year-over-year job growth for seven straight months, starting in October. This followed revisions to 2018 figures. The Anchorage Daily News reports the department revises job numbers after releasing initial estimates. While the growth was small, department economist Karinne Wiebold says it strengthens the case that the economy is recovering. The numbers remain subject to change, and Wiebold says it’s too early to say the downturn is truly over. The recession, which began in 2015, is the longest Alaska has seen, though it wasn’t on the level of an economic crash that occurred in the 1980s.\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Dozens of Asian-owned businesses have set up shop in western Mesa, with two large supermarkets serving as anchors for development that includes restaurants and other businesses. The commerce cluster is aided by proximity to Mesa Community College and the presence of Arizona State University’s main campus in neighboring Tempe. With the closing of the Chinese Cultural Center in Phoenix last year, many see the Asian business district in Mesa as a natural successor to become a hub for Asian-Americans in metro Phoenix. Property manager Steven Diep says when Mekong Plaza opened in 2008, fewer than 10 Asian-owned businesses were open in the area. Now, Mekong is at full occupancy with 28 tenants and has spurred development in the rest of the Asian business district in Mesa.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Hemp and CBD producers are hopeful about the future of the industry in the state. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that CBD has been extracted from Arkansas’ first legal hemp harvest. CBD is a chemical compound derived from cannabis plants, and users say it can ease pain, anxiety, epilepsy, nausea and hangovers. It doesn’t cause a high and is often sold as a dietary supplement. Hemp also belongs to the cannabis family and can be used in products including rope and paper. Congress legalized industrial hemp in December. Industry experts expect the CBD market in Arkansas to explode over the next five years. Some farmers hope they’ve found their newest cash crop. The Food and Drug Administration is assessing how it should regulate CBD, which is largely unregulated by the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Clarita: A fast-moving brush fire erupted near a huge amusement and water park Sunday, sending hundreds of visitors to the exit to escape clouds of smoke and ash before fire officials asked them to stay put while they worked to contain the blaze. Six Flags Magic Mountain and Hurricane Harbor announced the evacuation shortly after noon, citing concern for the safety of park visitors and employees. About a half-hour later, the park said on its Twitter account that fire officials asked guests to shelter in place due to nearby road closures. Park visitors were asked to move to the back of the 260-acre property, away from firefighting activity near the entrance, said Rachel Gallat, who was visiting a friend who works at the park. “I was getting iced coffee and when I walked outside, ash was raining down on me,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A ski resort trade association expects visits to the state’s ski resorts to be up 13% from last year following a snowy winter and spring that extended the ski season. The Denver Post reports Colorado Ski Country USA released its projections Thursday, showing a nearly 12% increase in visits from the five-year average. The group that represents 23 resorts expects the season to end with 13.8 million skier days, which measures people participating in skiing or snowboarding for any part of one day at a resort. The Rocky Mountain region is projected to end the season with 24 million skier days. The region includes Utah, New Mexico, Wyoming and Montana.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMiddletown: Wesleyan University’s Center for the Arts has received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to support residency activities of the dancer Netta Yerushalmy. The $15,000 Art Works grant also will support a performance by Yerushalmy on Oct. 4 in the Center for the Arts Theater. Center for the Arts director Sarah Curran said support from the NEA is central to its ability to bring contemporary dance to audiences that might not otherwise be able to see it. Yerushalmy grew up in Israel and has been based in New York since attending college there.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Parts of a neighborhood damaged in the 1968 riots ignited by Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination are set to be redeveloped after many years of empty restoration promises. The 36-block West Center City neighborhood never rebounded from the riot and an ensuing nine-month occupation by the National Guard. It has struggled with vacant homes and gun crimes ever since. For decades, city officials promised restoration and development initiatives that didn’t happen. Now state grants to demolish and rebuild several properties have been awarded, and the Wilmington Housing Authority also plans to renovate and sell about 20 properties. A demolition and rebuilding project by the nonprofit Wilmington Land Bank started last week and is set to be completed by March.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Logan Circle in northwest D.C. has been named one of the nation’s 28 friendliest neighborhoods, WUSA-TV reports. The National Geographic Traveler magazine list is based on user-generated data such as walkability, home affordability, and social surroundings such as the number of nearby restaurants, breweries and cafes. National Geographic Traveler also used perception data from TripAdvisor and Yelp to create the unranked list of the United States’ most open-minded and open-hearted neighborhoods. Logan Circle made the list for its design-centric shops and dozens of restaurants in early 20th-century and contemporary buildings. The list features Colada Shop for its rooftop Cuban cocktails and empanadas, as well as Miss Pixie’s Furnishings & Whatnot for unique finds like old postcards and 1960s lamps.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: A famous part of South Beach is getting a makeover. City of Miami Beach officials unveiled tons of new equipment Sunday for the popular outdoor workout area along A1A, known as Muscle Beach. Locals and tourists frequent the area, which includes equipment for push-ups and pull-ups. Muscle Beach is free and open to the public. But the area was lacking in strength training equipment. The city added a multi-modality training center for up to 80 people including 18 pull-up stations, a rope climb tower and five squat stations. There are also medicine balls, kettle bells, bumper plates and battle ropes.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: The Richmond County Coroner’s Office has made progress in matching the military grave markers that were discovered at an old funeral home. Coroner Mark Bowen says the majority are for veterans who have been buried locally. The National Cemetery Administration, the Richmond County Vital Records Office and Richmond County Cemetery Services are also assisting in finding the graves of the veterans whose names are inscribed on the markers. About 125 bronze and marble markers were found. They date back to the late 1960s. The Augusta Chronicle reports that a deputy had discovered the markers in packages under old blankets and trash in the home’s garage. The deputy was assisting a land official who was preparing to show the property to Atlanta investors when the grave markers were discovered.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The head of Honolulu’s planned rail line has submitted a revised recovery plan for the $9.2 billion project. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation CEO Andrew Robbins hand-delivered the plan to federal officials in San Francisco on Friday. The Federal Transit Administration has been withholding about $744 million in promised funding until it approves an updated recovery plan. The agency demanded that the city submit a recovery plan when the project’s price tag jumped from $5.3 billion. The City Council approved the plan by an 8-1 vote on Wednesday. The 20-mile-long rail line is due to connect Honolulu’s western suburbs to the airport, downtown and the Ala Moana Center, Oahu’s biggest mall.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal authorities are taking public comments on a plan to conduct an extensive environmental study involving killing wolves and other predators in the state that attack livestock, deer and elk. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that it will take comments through July 10 on a planned environmental impact statement. A federal judge ordered the study last year after ruling the Agriculture Department’s Wildlife Services violated environmental laws by not providing the justification to support its decision to expand killing mountain lions, coyotes, bears and other predators in Idaho. The new environmental impact statement will replace the agency’s 2016 Idaho environmental assessment involving those predators, as well as its 2011 wolf environmental assessment that guides its wolf-killing decisions in the state.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Dispensaries in the state are staffing up and remodeling in preparation for the legalization of recreational marijuana. The General Assembly approved the marijuana legislation last month, and it now awaits a signature from Gov. J.B. Pritzker. He plans to sign it, making Illinois the 11th state, along with the District of Columbia, to permit recreational use. Under the new law, adults could buy and possess up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use. The measure would let the state’s 55 medical marijuana dispensaries submit applications to set up two more dispensaries to sell marijuana for recreational use. Companies already in the medical marijuana market said expansion to meet recreational needs could result in a hiring boom. If approved, sales would start Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The fifth annual Chreece hip-hop festival will bring Talib Kweli to the city. Kweli, a rapper known for eight solo albums as well as collaborations with Mos Def, Kanye West and Hi-Tek, headlines a 70-act lineup announced Monday. Chreece is slated for Aug. 24 at multiple Fountain Square venues. Kweli, who made landmark 1998 album “Black Star” with Mos Def, is one of multiple national acts on the festival’s roster. Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine and Benny the Butcher will share the stage, representing Griselda Records. Houston rapper Fat Tony will promote his 2018 album “10,000 Hours.” The Chreece roster includes high-profile Indiana acts Flaco, Drayco McCoy, Trajik, Sirius Blvck & John Stamps, Clint Breeze & the Groove, Mathaius Young and Parris LaDame.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: It’s a stinky distinction, but the state leads the nation when it comes to the amount of poop its people and livestock generate, research from a University of Iowa scientist shows. Christopher Jones, a UI research engineer, calculated Iowa’s population would be the equivalent of 168 million people, based on the waste from the state’s 3.2 million people and nearly 110 million chickens, pigs, turkeys and cattle. It’s about as many people as in Bangladesh, a country in south Asia. Factor in land size, and Iowa ranks first in the nation for waste creation, Jones writes in a blog he’s titled “50 Shades of Brown.” “Just to ensure clarity, in Iowa, we are generating as much fecal waste in every square mile as 2,979 people,” he says. “For reference, Iowa City is the second-most densely populated city in Iowa and has 2,775 people per square mile. So imagine an Iowa-sized Iowa City.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: May was the wettest month in state history. The Kansas State University Weather Data Library says average rainfall in May was 10.26 inches, the wettest month on records going back 125 years. The Kansas News Service reports the deluge broke the previous record set in June 1951. In addition, 19 weather stations recorded monthly totals of more than 20 inches. The rainfall was uneven but followed typical patterns of being drier in the west and wetter in the east. Southeast Kansas stations averaged 17 inches in May, while west central Kansas stations averaged only 5.31 inches, which is still 175% of normal rainfall for the region in May. The amount of water moving through the state was the highest the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kansas Water Science Center has ever seen.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: An analysis of traffic stop data has found African Americans in the city are disproportionately stopped and are three times more likely to be searched than white drivers. Of 130,999 stops between 2016 and 2018, African Americans accounted for 33% of the stops, although they make up only about 20% of Louisville’s driving-age population. Of 8,942 searches, 57% involved African Americans. That’s despite a much higher incidence of contraband found with white drivers. According to the analysis, police found contraband in 72% of the searches of whites versus only 41% for African Americans. Speaking before the Metro Council Public Safety Committee on Wednesday, Police Chief Steve Conrad outlined changes in which stops will no longer be “a matter of routine.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nSt. Joseph: New cabins are open at Lake Bruin State Park. The Louisiana Office of State Parks opened the accommodations at the site in St. Joseph on Friday. The park is in the Mississippi River delta, in the state’s southeast. Two standard cabins and one deluxe cabin are available for reservations. The one-bedroom cabins sleep up to four people and have a barbecue pit, fire ring and picnic table. They rent for $85 a night Sunday through Thursday and $95 a night on Friday and Saturday. The three-bedroom deluxe cabin sleeps up to eight people and has a two-car carport and two dedicated boat slips. It rents for $150 per night Sunday through Thursday and $175 per night on Friday and Saturday.\n\nMaine\n\nSkowhegan: Apparently hungry and thirsty vandals have trashed a fairgrounds booth, stealing 120 whoopie pies and drinking half a gallon of iced tea. John Youney, a director of the Skowhegan Lions Club, tells the Morning Sentinel that a refrigerator full of cookies was also emptied and that plastic gloves and silverware littered the floor. Youney says there’s about $1,000 worth of damage or stolen goods. The group discovered the break-in at its Skowhegan fairground booth Sunday morning and believes it occurred overnight Saturday. Youney says whoever is involved can confess and work off their crime by assisting the club with its volunteer work. A police officer said he could not comment on the investigation.\n\nMaryland\n\nBurkittsville: A video game inspired by the Maryland-based horror film “The Blair Witch Project” is expected to come to PCs and Xboxes in August. The Baltimore Sun reports the game was announced Sunday at a video game conference in Los Angeles. The game will draw on events from the 1999 film, with a release date of Aug. 30. The movie was shot in locations in Maryland, including the town of Burkittsville. The film follows a group of college students as they create a documentary in the Maryland woods about the legend of the Blair Witch. The low-budget film earned a reputation as a cult classic that popularized the “found footage” horror genre. According to the trailer, the game follows a detective’s search for a missing person amid supernatural occurrences.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: The town is taking a literary twist this week. The eighth annual Nantucket Book Festival opens Thursday and runs through June 16. It features more than 30 local authors, including Nantucket native and bestselling writer Nathaniel Philbrick. Philbrick will discuss the third book in his Revolutionary War series, “In the Hurricane’s Eye: The Genius of George Washington and the Victory at Yorktown.” Other participating award-winners include “Washington Black” writer Esi Edugyan, “The Library Book” author Susan Orlean, and Dave Cullen, who’s authored books about the Columbine and Parkland school shootings. The festival is operated by the Nantucket Book Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded to celebrate and promote the joys and rewards of reading, writing and literacy.\n\nMichigan\n\nHolland: Families can follow the yellow brick road as a project brings “The Wizard of Oz” to a local park. The Holland Sentinel reports that yellow bricks have been laid in Centennial Park as part of the Holland Oz Project. It’ll direct visitors to a living mosaic book that’s been constructed out of plants and flowers in a tribute to the L. Frank Baum novel and classic 1939 film. The outdoor exhibit in western Michigan will also include life-sized bronze sculptures of characters that Dorothy met along her journey through the whimsical world of Oz. The sculptures will be installed in August. The city has collaborated with the Holland Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, Holland in Bloom and the Herrick District Library to bring the project to life.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinnetonka: A local dog rescue organization says it’s saving the lives of golden retrievers by flying them to the U.S. from China, where they’re used in the dog meat trade. KARE-TV reports that Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest says its volunteers in China take in dogs that have been rescued from butchers and slaughterhouses. The Minnetonka-based group says its Chinese shelters can house hundreds of rescued dogs at a time. Humane Society International estimates that 10 million dogs are consumed each year in China. RAGOM board member Nicole Stundzia says a volunteer family recently traveled to the country to bring five golden retrievers to the U.S. Stundzia says volunteers are limited in the number of dogs they can travel with. The group says such rescues are challenging and costly.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state Supreme Court has changed the rules to say a person seeking to become a lawyer has to pass the bar exam within three attempts or will have to go back to law school for at least 12 semester hours before they can retake it. The rule change comes after the annual passage rate on the Mississippi Bar exam has dropped from 79% in 2014 to 48% last year. The rule change says an applicant has to successfully complete 12 additional semester hours of law school courses at an American Bar Association accredited law school on subjects covered by or skills necessary to pass the bar exam. After going back to law school and successfully completing the 12 hours or additional course work, an applicant will be permitted to take the bar exam one additional time, the state Supreme Court order says.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Area attorneys whose underwire bras had been setting off jail metal detectors can now see their clients without removing their lingerie for screening, but only if they agree to talk to their clients by phones separated by glass. KCUR-FM reports that the new protocol was announced Thursday, the same day nearly 100 defense attorneys signed an open letter complaining that the restrictions were making it difficult to represent inmates. Jackson County Department of Corrections Director Diana Turner described the option of allowing attorneys to have non-contact visits without clearing metal detectors as a “happy medium.” But it didn’t sit well with attorney Denise Kirby, who signed the open letter. She says the compromise shows a lack of understanding about what it takes to defend an inmate.\n\nMontana\n\nStevensville: Trumpeter swans have built a nest in a wildlife refuge that biologists hope will lead to the first offspring documented in the Bitterroot Valley following restoration efforts. The Ravalli Republic reports the large waterfowl couple constructed the nest on top of a muskrat lodge on a remote pond at the Lee Metcalf National Wildlife Refuge. Refuge project leader Tom Reed says he discovered the nest in recent weeks. Reintroduction efforts began decades ago after the swan population was decimated by hunters and feather collectors. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes wildlife director Dale Becker says 60 trumpeter young were recorded from about 18 nests in Montana last year. He says the young usually appear right after Memorial Day, but this year they’re a bit late.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health officials in the eastern part of the state are taking steps to control mosquito populations that carry West Nile and other diseases as a wet spring has led to more breeding grounds for the biting insects. The Douglas County Health Department says it’s using mosquito larvicide in potential breeding sites or stagnant waterways to help curb the spread of West Nile virus. The department is also trapping mosquitoes every other week. Trapped mosquitoes are counted and tested for Zika, West Nile virus and chikungunya at the state public health lab. The department also has begun collecting dead birds – including crows, black-billed magpies and blue jays – to test them for West Nile virus. Nebraska reported a nation-high 245 West Nile cases in humans last year, including 11 deaths.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Lawmakers have agreed to let voters decide next year whether to amend the state Constitution to recognize same-sex marriages, add a voters’ bill of rights and overhaul the state board of pardons. The measures are among a handful of proposed changes to Nevada’s Constitution that lawmakers took on during their legislative session this year. As in most states, it isn’t easy to amend Nevada’s Constitution. Changes can either come from a citizen-driven ballot initiative, which would need to be approved by voters twice, or from the Legislature. Any proposal from lawmakers to amend the Constitution must be approved by the Legislature two sessions in a row and then approved by voters on the ballot. The state Constitution currently includes an unenforceable ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state would join more than a dozen counterparts requiring insurance coverage of fertility treatments under a bill that passed the House. Supporters of the bill said the requirement would help the state attract young families as its population ages. They said they heard from many couples who said they work in Massachusetts in order to obtain coverage. Opponents said they were concerned about the impact such a mandate would have on insurance premiums for small businesses. The House passed the bill and sent it back to the Senate, which previously passed a different version.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: “Seinfeld” star Jason Alexander, rock band The Smithereens, rocker Southside Johnny Lyon, New York Giants Harry Carson and Bart Oates, and legendary basketball player and coach Anne Donovan are among this year’s inductees to the New Jersey Hall of Fame. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the winners of the Hall’s 11th class Monday at a ceremony at Newark Liberty International Airport. They include “Jaws” author Peter Benchley of Pennington, longtime Star-Ledger sport columnist Jerry Izenberg of Neptune and “Game of Thrones” author George R. R. Martin of Bayonne. Other winners include Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez of Old Bridge, Hoboken teachers activist Elizabeth Allen, and Newark cardiac surgeon Victor Parsonnet. The induction ceremony will be held Oct. 27 in Asbury Park.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest city is the latest to embark on upgrades to its portion of the historic Route 66 Highway. Officials in Albuquerque want to see improvements to a barren stretch of Route 66 in an area that some complain is a forgotten part of the city, KRQE-TV reports. City officials are eyeing a $2.3 million plan that would add medians, landscaping and lighting along the Mother Road west of downtown. Currently, there are no sidewalks, landscaping or bike lanes and very few streetlights. Albuquerque has the largest part of Route 66 in an urban area. The move comes as an endangered federal program that has helped preserve the historic Route 66 Highway for two decades is set to end, and federal legislation to designate Route 66 as a National Historic Trail remains stalled in Congress.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The creators of the High Line park turned a disused rail line into an urban oasis, art showcase and tourism magnet that welcomes 8 million visitors a year. The park is now marking two milestones. Its final section opened Wednesday, days before the 10th anniversary Sunday of the opening of the first section on June 9, 2009. The elevated rail line was built in the 1930s to raise freight trains above street level. Efforts to preserve the line started in the 1980s, after the trains stopped running. The blocks surrounding the High Line then were largely undeveloped and considered dangerous by some. Anthony Annaruma remembers the area when it was frequented by sex workers. Now, he’s working on a new building where apartments will sell for millions of dollars.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBrevard: The General Assembly is looking to impose stricter guidelines on zip lines and high ropes courses after some deaths in the state. A bill before the North Carolina Senate seeks greater oversight of the “aerial adventure course” industry, just in time for summer camp season. But some camp owners say they feel the law could increase expenses and paperwork and force some operations to close altogether. Some course owners also questioned whether safety would improve. The bill is known as Sanders’ Law, named for 12-year-old Sanders Burney, who died in 2015 when her harness snapped during a zip line accident at a YMCA camp.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nNew Salem: A mud run is expected to draw hundreds of people for good, dirty fun in western North Dakota. Medieval Rush will be held Saturday in New Salem. It’s billed as the longest mud run in North Dakota, at 3.2 miles. The event has a medieval theme and runs rain or shine. Gates open under the big cow statue “Salem Sue” at 9 a.m. Opening ceremonies are set for at 11 a.m. This year’s event also will add a medieval dirt bike race through the mud. Participants must be at least 14 years old. The Bismarck Tribune reports about 700 people take part each year.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A new interactive exhibit at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is set to open next month. Cleveland.com reports that the “Interactive Garage” exhibit opening July 1 will enable visitors to play instruments on their own or with friends or strangers at the museum. Visitors can get help with instruments from trained professionals on site. Rock Hall president and CEO Greg Harris said earlier this year that the museum has been working to create a more immersive, hands-on experience for visitors. The exhibit opens July 1 and will take up the entire second floor of the museum. It will include keyboards, mixing boards, guitars, drums, studio space and a lounge for playing acoustic instruments.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Researchers at the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University are jointly developing drone technology to more accurately forecast the weather. The Journal Record reports that OU School of Meteorology professor Phil Chilson says he launched the project in 2008, and it received a boost of National Science Foundation funding in 2015. Chilson said a “long-recognized lack of observation” in the bottom 2 miles of the atmosphere hinders storm forecasting. OSU is building the drones, and OU is focusing on the meteorology portion, which includes what type of information and equipment is required for the unmanned aircraft. Both schools are working through regulatory concerns with the Federal Aviation Administration. OSU professor Jamey Jacob says the development of drones for more accurate storm prediction will cause a “paradigm shift.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two protesters have been sentenced to five days in jail for throwing horse lubricant mixed with gold glitter on two police officers at a protest. The Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office says the defendants were protesting against a rally organized by a right-wing group called Patriot Prayer when the officers asked to see what was in two 4-gallon buckets they were carrying. Prosecutors say Robert Majure and Tristan Romine-Mann instead sprayed the slimy liquid on the officers and ran. Prosecutors say the two attempted to “fist bump” in celebration after they were arrested and cuffed in a patrol car. A jury convicted them of harassment and acquitted them of a charge of disorderly conduct.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDeer Lake: The rustic training camp where Muhammad Ali prepared for some of his most famous fights has undergone an elaborate restoration and opened to the public Saturday as a shrine to the heavyweight icon’s life and career. The famed Deer Lake camp was in disrepair when California real estate investor Mike Madden, son of retired broadcaster and NFL Hall of Fame coach John Madden, bought it shortly after Ali died in June 2016 at age 74. Ali bought the wooded, out-of-the-way property about 90 miles from Philadelphia in 1972 and installed 18 primarily log buildings, including a gym, dining hall, small mosque, visitors’ cabins and a horse barn. It was at Deer Lake where Ali prepared for his epic bouts against George Foreman and Joe Frazier, attracting crowds who watched him work. He trained at the camp until his last fight in 1981.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Community College of Rhode Island is using a sensory tool to help the public understand what it’s like to live with dementia. CCRI bought an instructional program known as the Virtual Dementia Tour with help from the state. For the first time, it’s offering free demonstrations to the public. The demonstrations will be held Tuesday at the Lincoln campus, June 18 at the Providence campus, June 21 at the Warwick campus and June 25 at the Newport campus. The demonstrations, facilitated by CCRI nursing staff, take about half an hour. Registration is required in advance. CCRI says it’s the only college in the state to offer this technology, and it’s trying to do more to help caregivers and health care professionals understand how to treat people with dementia.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state has passed a new law that bars protein grown in a laboratory via stem cells from being advertised as “meat.” Primary sponsor Republican Rep. Randy Ligon of Chester says he didn’t want people to confuse lab-grown protein with the real thing. The lawmaker and member of the South Carolina Cattlemen’s Association told The Post and Courier of Charleston he doesn’t want to stop research into the alternative food, but he does want to make sure consumers understand what they are getting. The bill passed both the House and Senate unanimously, and Gov. Henry McMaster signed it into law last month. Lab-grown meat hasn’t made it into stores yet, but federal agencies have announced how they will regulate the industry.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A Native American woman is bringing attention to the impact of methamphetamine addiction from within the South Dakota Women’s Prison. Heather Shooter, 37, started the support group Sober is Sacred to encourage other inmates to join the fight to demand more drug treatment services at the Pierre facility. Within the past year, the group has put on two anti-meth rallies at the women’s prison, where many inmates share stories about how the drug derailed their lives. About 64% of women in the prison are incarcerated on a primary drug charge, most of which involved meth. Shooter has been in prison since April 2017 for participating in a high-speed police chase with her 6-year-old in the car while high on meth. “That was my wake-up call,” she said. “This is my chance to change.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee Promise scholars can fulfill their community service requirement during a volunteer event in state parks this month. According to a news release, 54 of the state’s 56 parks will be offering a volunteer event. Most of those will take place Saturday, June 22. Work projects include landscaping, invasive plant removal, litter pickup and trail maintenance. Tennessee Promise provides scholarships for eligible students to attend state community and technical colleges for free. Students must complete eight hours of community service. The deadline to complete the service this year is July 1. Details of Tennessee Promise Saturday events are available on the state parks website.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Houston Zoo’s new Texas Wetlands Exhibit showcases some whooping cranes that were relocated from Maryland after their federally funded habitat closed last year. The Houston Chronicle reports that the $20 million Texas complex, which opened in late May, is the first of four exhibits being built to mark the zoo’s 100th anniversary in 2022. The cranes are among three species featured in the exhibit. The other two are American alligators and bald eagles, and all three are native to Texas. At one time, all were nearing extinction. Zoo CEO Lee Ehmke says that the goal is to make the new exhibit engaging and genuine, for both visitors and animals. Whooping cranes have been listed as endangered since 1967.\n\nUtah\n\nMapleton: A woman in Utah County is celebrating 15 years rehabilitating wildlife in her backyard. The Daily Herald reports Patti Richards rescues hundreds of birds each year, including falcons, eagles, hawks and talking crows. Richards said she channeled her passion for birds and bears into starting the Great Basin Wildlife Rescue out of her home. The rescue has also taken in bobcats and foxes. Richards said the majority of the birds are released back into their natural habitat once they’ve recovered from their injury or illness, but some are relocated to zoos and animal facilities throughout the country. The rescue is also home to several education birds who work at schools, memorials and fundraisers. Richards said the rescue has received a lot of community support that has helped it continue to thrive.\n\nVermont\n\nWhite River Junction: The state attorney general’s office says a second forum for a hate-free Vermont is being held this week in White River Junction. The office says the event was organizated in conjunction with the Vermont NAACP, the Vermont Partnership for Fairness and Diversity, and others. Organizers say the purpose is to generate community conversation about bias incidents and hate crimes in Vermont. The moderator says the series “is intended to take the pulse of Vermonters’ experience of discrimination” and to bring together policymakers and community members to discuss the issues. Community members are encouraged to tell their stories. The event takes place Thursday from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Hartford High School.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: He was known as the man Norfolk never forgave. David Farragut, the U.S. Navy’s very first admiral and a major player in Union Navy operations during the Civil War, called Norfolk home before the war. But when Virginia seceded from the Union, his loyalty to the United States led him to flee north and continue to serve with the Union Navy – a “betrayal” that residents of this Southern city didn’t forget, The Virginian-Pilot reports. In 2016, more than 150 years after the war’s end, Norfolk named a quarter-acre pocket park in Freemason after Farragut. The park, essentially a small lawn and dog park, was dedicated in May. The park’s name stands out in Norfolk history and is perhaps indicative of a shifting attitude: Many public spaces and buildings in the city bear the names of Confederate military men. Farragut’s park is the first to recognize a Union officer.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: Skagit County officials estimate the growing elk population in the region is costing farmers $1.4 million a year. The Skagit Valley Herald reports that figure is slightly down from the $1.5 million estimate released in January. The new estimate by the Skagit County Assessor’s Office is based on 140 survey responses from farmers involved in a state program that offers tax benefits to keep farms in production. In survey responses, damage to fences and crops were listed as the top issues. Assessor Dave Thomas says the average for farms reporting elk damage was $13,000. Individual damages were as high was $150,000. Rural property owners have complained about damages as the North Cascades – or Nooksack – elk herd has grown in recent years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMinden: Thirty years after residents marched to bring attention to the PCB contamination causing cancer in their community, members of Minden Community Action say more work must be done. The Register-Herald reports the group organized a Saturday march as a re-enactment of a 1989 march for the contaminated Fayette County community. The march aimed to draw attention to ongoing problems and also honor local residents who pushed the federal government to act. Minden was contaminated after workers at the now-defunct Shaffer’s Equipment Co. dumped the carcinogenic industrial chemical PCB around the town. There have been three cleanup efforts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and none has fully removed the contamination.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State agriculture officials are concerned farmers will be tempted by quick access loans and credit cards as many take on more debt this year. Frank Friar, an economic development specialist for the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, tells Wisconsin Public Radio the state agency is worried farmers may turn to predatory lending agencies after years of low crop prices. The American Farm Bureau Federation warns that farm debt is at a record high, lending standards are tightening, and the cost of credit is rising. Katie Wantoch, an agriculture agent with the University of Wisconsin-Extension, says farmers in debt may also spend more on their credit cards, which will likely worsen their financial situation. Wantoch says there may be more fees they didn’t anticipate.\n\nWyoming\n\nPine Bluffs: Roman Catholics from the region have marked the 20th anniversary of a shrine featuring one of the largest concrete sculptures in the U.S. A 30-foot sculpture of the Virgin Mary stands at the center of the Our Lady of Peace Shrine outside Pine Bluffs in southeast Wyoming. It’s the largest sculpture in the state. Nearby at the shrine are 14 carvings representing the Stations of the Cross, a series of events in the life of Jesus. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports a Mass and devotional prayers took place at the shrine Saturday. Ted and Marjorie Trefren of Cheyenne built the shrine in 1999 after touring shrines in Europe.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/10/01/upcoming-concerts-phoenix-october-2022/8121232001/", "title": "Best Phoenix concerts in October 2022: Zach Bryan, Lil Nas X ...", "text": "Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters brings his This Is Not a Drill Tour to Glendale in a month that also features concerts by the Doobie Brothers and the Who in their first Valley concert since 2013.\n\nBut it's not all classic rock this month in metro Phoenix.\n\nGoldrush: Neon Dreams brings three days of EDM to Phoenix Raceway, Colombian superstar Karol G plays Footprint Center and Pusha T brings his tour in support of a strong contender for the hip-hop album of the year to the Van Buren.\n\nHere's a look at those and other October concerts coming to metro Phoenix, including a co-headlining concert by two of Arizona's biggest band's, Jimmy Eat World and the Maine.\n\nInterview: How Jimmy Eat World and the Maine came together for the concert of a lifetime\n\nNeed a break?

Profanity, extreme violence, gore, drug use, stoner humor.\n\nJesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart. A timid stoner who works at a small-town convenience store in West Virginia suddenly discovers that he is a Jason Bourne-style sleeper agent with lethal assassin skills in this blood-spurting, bullet-spewing action-comedy. Directed by Nima Nourizadeh (“Project X”) who gets some fun performances from his actor but never settles on an established tone. With Topher Grace, John Leguizamo, Bill Pullman and Tallahassee’s very own Tony Hale.

Profanity, sexual content, drug use, self-destructive tendencies.\n\nAmy Winehouse, Blake Fiedler-Civil. The meteoric rise and tragic fall of Grammy Award-winning English singer Amy Winehouse (“Rehab”) is skillfully mapped out through home movies, concert footage and interviews in this intensely intimate documentary by director Asif Kapadia (the equally powerful “Senna”). Even though you know how it’s going to end, this bio is still heart-wrenching. Opens Friday. (A)\n\nAll Saints Cinema: 8 p.m. (7 p.m. on Sunday and Thursday)\n\nAnt-Man\n\nPG-13, 117 minutes. Action violence.\n\nPaul Rudd, Michael Douglas. Based on a comic-book character that first appeared in 1962, a charming con man who just got out of prison is recruited by a scientist to don a suit that will shrink him to the size of a very powerful insect. With Michael Peña, Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll and Stan Lee. Directed by Peyton Reed (“The Yes Man,” “Bring It On”), who knows he’s not making a “Dark Knight” flick here, so he amps up the mumbo-jumbo plot, humor and silliness. The running time is still too long for a superhero flick, though. (B-)\n\nIMAX: 4, 9:15\n\nTallahassee Mall: 2:45, 5:30, 11\n\nD-Day 3D: Normandy 1944\n\nNot rated, 40 minutes. War violence, child endangerment, smoking.\n\nNewscaster and author Tom Brokaw narrates the stories behind World War II’s biggest military gamble and the world’s largest naval armada in this highly informative documentary about the Allies invading France. It’s not as jarring or gory as the opening sequences of “Saving Private Ryan” (1999) and concentrates on military tactics with some pretty nifty animation and graphics. Suitable for younger students who need to learn about the amazing sacrifice, money, courage and luck that went into saving the Free World one June morning in 1944. (B+)\n\nIMAX: 1, 6:15\n\nThe Diary of a Teenage Girl\n\nR, 102 minutes. Profanity, strong sexual content, nudity.\n\nBel Powley, Alexander Skarsgard.

Narcissistic agent Ari Gold, who is now a studio head in Hollywood, has to grovel before rich Texas hicks to finish financing an expensive film with his old, A-list movie-star client. The big-screen version of the hit HBO comedy series was directed by its creator Doug Ellin (”Kissing A Fool”). This cameo-heavy, party-hearty bro’ fantasy about Hollywood is saved by Piven’s gleefully nasty turn as the unbelievably obnoxious Gold. The rest is just rude sex humor and gratuitous nudity. With Kevin Connolly, Kevin Dillon, Billy Bob Thornton, Haley Joel Osment, Mark Wahlberg, Debi Mazar and cage-fighter Ronda Rousey. Liam Neeson has the best cameo in the show as he flips off Piven’s character. (C+)\n\nMovies 8: 12:10, 2:35, 4:50, 7:20, 9:45\n\nFantastic Four\n\nPG-13, 106 minutes.

Violence, scary images, creepy giant clown.\n\nVoices of Amy Poehler, Lewis Black. The very vocal, sprite-like emotions living in an 11-year-old girl’s mind are thrown into disarray after her parents move the family from hockey-loving Minnesota to hipster-happy San Francisco. The latest animated comedy from Pixar is a darkly brilliant, dazzling dive into the subconscious. The visuals nearly overwhelm the story in the last act but it’s one of Pixar’s most audacious, daring efforts. With the voices of Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Kaitlyn Dias, Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan. (A-)\n\nIMAX: 2, 7:15\n\nJean-Michel Cousteau’s Secret Ocean 3D\n\nNot rated, 40 minutes. Nothing objectionable.\n\nOceanographer Dr. Sylvia Earle narrates as director Jean-Michel Cousteau takes a close look at the secret lives of lobsters, spotted sea hares, lionfish, arrow crabs, Christmas tree worms, sea cucumbers and other tiny aquatic beings in waters around Fiji and Bimini. Cousteau is the son of the famed environmental crusader and underwater pioneer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nIMAX: 10 a.m., noon\n\nJurassic World\n\nPG-13, 124 minutes. Profanity, violence, scary special effects.\n\nChris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard. Thanks to an “entertainment anomaly,” a monstrous, genetically engineered dinosaur goes on a killing spree in an island theme park just in time for a visit by the uptight park manager’s annoying nephews. The manager never takes off her high heels as she runs through the jungle and that’s just the start of the many implausible mistakes in this extended advertisement for Mercedes vehicles. It’s pretty dumb, even by dumb popcorn-movie standards. John Williams’ intrusive soundtrack is louder than the killer lizards. Directed by Colin Trevorrow (“Safety Not Guaranteed”). Produced by Steven Spielberg, whose fingerprints are all over it. With Vincent D’Onofrio, B.D. Wong and Judy Greer. (C-)\n\nTallahassee Mall: 10:15 a.m., 1:15, 4:15, 7:15, 10:30\n\nLove & Mercy\n\nPG-13, 121 minutes. Profanity, drug use, verbal abuse, smoking galore.\n\nPaul Dano, John Cusack. Being a musical genius takes its toll on Beach Boys mastermind Brian Wilson after he records his masterwork, “Pet Sounds,” and then descends into drugs and mental illness. Well-acted bio-pic directed by Bill Pohlad, who produced “12 Years A Slave.” With Elizabeth Banks and Paul Giamatti. Dano is perfectly cast as the young, doughy, fragile Wilson. A rare musical that actually gives credit to the studio musicians who helped Wilson create some of his greatest pocket symphonies. (B+)\n\nMovies 8: 12:20, 7:15\n\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\n\nPG-13, 116 minutes. Violence, brief nudity, sexual content and humor.\n\nHenry Cavill, Armie Hammer. During the early 1960s, at the height of the Cold War, good-looking spies from the CIA and the KGB must set aside their differences during a high-risk mission to Rome. Big-screen adaptation of the TV series from the ’60s is big on style and flash, but little else. Directed by Guy Ritchie (“Snatch”). With Alicia Vikander (the hot robot from “Ex Machina”), Hugh Grant and Jared Harris. (B-)\n\nGovernors Square: 12:25, 3:35, 7:15, 10:10\n\nTallahassee Mall: 8, 10:45\n\nMinions\n\nPG, 91 minutes. Comic violence, dark humor, bathroom jokes.\n\nVoices of Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton. Tiny yellow, banana-shaped creatures seek out notorious figures — everyone from Dracula to Napoleon — to serve and eventually end up in Swinging London during the ‘60s working for a James Bond-style villain (voice of Sandra Bullock) in this animated spin-off from “Despicable Me” (2010). Co-directed by Pierre Coffin, who was responsible for the last two “Despicable Me” comedies. If you can get past all the gratuitous flatulence jokes, it’s a harmless, silly little lark. (B)\n\nGovernors Square: 12:40\n\nTallahassee Mall: 12:15, 2:45, 5:15\n\nMission: Impossible - Rogue Nation\n\nPG-13, 131 minutes. Profanity, violence, brief nudity.\n\nTom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson.

Violence, disturbing images, smoking.\n\nIan McKellen, Laura Linney. In 1947, the famed detective Sherlock Holmes, now a cranky geezer in his early 90s who is happier when focused on beekeeping, is haunted by one unsolved case. Directed by Bill Condon (“Gods and Monsters”). Opened Friday.\n\nTallahassee Mall: 10:45 a.m., 1:30, 4:15, 8:15, 10\n\nNo Escape\n\nR, 101 minutes. Profanity, violence, gruesome images, sexual assault.\n\nOwen Wilson, Pierce Brosnan. An American businessman and his young family relocate to Southeast Asia just in time to get caught in the middle of a violent rebel coup in this political drama from horror director John Erick Dowdle (“As Above, So Below,” “Quarantine”). Opened Wednesday.\n\nGovernors Square: 12:50, 4:20, 7:35, 10:35\n\nTallahassee Mall: 11:30 a.m., 2:15, 5, 7:45, 10:30\n\nPink Floyd’s The Wall (1982)\n\nR, 99 minutes. Profanity, violence, sexual content, angst.\n\nBob Geldof, Bob Hoskins.

The announcement came as Congress readied legislation that would devote $1.375 billion to the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump demanded.\n\nDeclaring an emergency would let Trump sidestep Democratic opposition to more wall funding, but it could draw legal challenges from lawmakers and others who viewed the move as a power grab. Although that could delay construction of his border barriers, an extended legal battle would give Trump a potent political issue to run on in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"Everyone’s going to come out of the woodwork,\" said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas-Austin law professor who teaches national security law. \"I think we’re going to see an array of lawsuits that actually would all have to be dealt with separately.\"\n\nMore:How congressional Democrats could fight a Trump wall emergency declaration\n\nMore:What to know about national emergencies and their role in US history\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the administration is \"very prepared\" for legal challenges.\n\nThe potential for an extended legal battle may explain why Trump backed away from the emergency scenario last month. The president, who faced criticism from some Republicans for the idea, said he wouldn't declare an emergency imminently. Republicans noted a future Democratic president could also use an emergency to work around Congress.\n\nLitigation could go all the way to the Supreme Court, which has smacked down attempts by both Trump and President Barack Obama to make end runs around Congress. How long that takes would depend on several factors:\n\n• Which programs the White House might try to tap for funding.\n\n• Whether Trump tries to speed the seizure of property from unwilling owners.\n\n• Who could be harmed by the order and would have the right to sue.\n\n• What court or courts are chosen by challengers seeking favorable verdicts.\n\nFor weeks, Trump weighed invoking a national emergency as the political impasse over the wall led to a partial government shutdown that became the longest in U.S. history. White House aides acknowledged that lawyers reviewed the ramifications.\n\nThe president expressed confidence in the legal strategy. \"The law is 100 percent on my side,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats blasted the move. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer called the decision a \"gross abuse of the power of the presidency\" in a joint statement.\n\nLegal experts differed over how much latitude Trump would have to free up money for the wall on his own. They cautioned that those who favor an emergency declaration may trade a deadlock in Congress for a lengthy legal fight in the federal judiciary.\n\nWalter Dellinger, an assistant attorney general and head of the Office of Legal Counsel under President Bill Clinton, said a lawsuit could reach the Supreme Court in a matter of months but probably would not be resolved quickly.\n\n“I think that a clear majority of the Supreme Court will be deeply troubled by the invocation of emergency authority in this case,” Dellinger said. \"In the normal course, we might not expect a decision until June of 2020 at the earliest.\"\n\nPresidents have broad authority to declare an emergency but are more restricted in how they can use it. White House officials zeroed in on provisions that would let Trump capture unused money Congress set aside for other purposes.\n\n“None of these statutes is a blank check,\" Vladeck said.\n\nAnother question that would have to be decided early in the process: Who has the right to sue? Lawmakers might sue by arguing the president usurped their power through an emergency declaration. Homeowners on the border whose property could be seized to build the wall also might have a case, experts said.\n\nLitigation may turn in part on whether Trump erred in declaring an emergency in the first place. Though the president described the situation on the border as a \"security and humanitarian crisis,\" the number of people apprehended attempting to cross the border illegally has fallen considerably over the past decade.\n\nCourts have traditionally given presidents leeway to decide matters of national security.\n\n\"There’s just not a lot of guidance in these statutes about what actually constitutes a national emergency,\" said Margaret Taylor, senior editor and counsel at the legal blog Lawfare and a former Democratic aide on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"Congress and the courts have been deferential to presidents on that decision.\"\n\nOn the other hand, presidents have faced successful challenges after they took action to sidestep Congress. Obama's effort to shield from deportation about 5 million undocumented immigrants through an executive order faced a high-profile lawsuit from Texas that dragged on for months before the Supreme Court killed the program.\n\nChallengers presumably would bring their lawsuits to district court judges they considered likely to look askance at Trump’s action – a practice known as “forum shopping” that’s used by both liberals and conservatives to improve their chances. Liberals often file cases within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, based in California; conservatives often opt for the 5th Circuit, which includes Texas.\n\nSignaling that he may have learned from the extended legal challenge that for months blocked his travel ban on predominately Muslim countries, Trump predicted opponents might try to bring a challenge to an emergency declaration in the 9th Circuit.\n\n\"What will happen? I'll be sued. It'll be brought to the 9th Circuit. We'll probably lose there, too,\" Trump said. \"And then hopefully we'll win in the Supreme Court.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/17/national-emergency-declaration-debate/2898779002/", "title": "Trump national emergency: Calif. AG Becerra 'definitely' will sue", "text": "California's Democratic Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Sunday that he will \"definitely and imminently\" file a lawsuit against the Trump administration to contest the declaration of a national emergency at the southern border.\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared the emergency on Friday after signing a funding bill that included less than a quarter of the money he had requested for the construction of a border barrier, which he says is necessary to stop illegal immigration.\n\nBut Democrats like Becerra do not believe conditions at the border constitute an emergency.\n\n\"It’s clear that this isn’t an emergency – it’s clear that in the mind of Donald Trump he needs to do something to try to fulfill a campaign promise,\" Becerra said in an interview on ABC's \"This Week.\" The construction of a border wall has been a central issue for Trump since he first announced he was running for president in 2015.\n\nPreviously:Trump declares national emergency to free up billions of dollars for border wall\n\n'Dangerous precedent': U.S. Chamber joins conservative critics of Trump's emergency declaration\n\nTwitter:Democrats cry #FakeTrumpEmergency after White House declaration\n\n\"That doesn’t constitute a national emergency that would require us to essentially stand down on all sorts of federal laws and also violate the U.S. Constitution,\" said Becerra, a former congressman.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said the emergency declaration and a border wall was needed to combat what he characterized as an \"invasion\" of migrants across the southern border. He said open areas on the border allowed the free flow of drugs and dangerous criminals into the U.S.\n\nBy declaring a national emergency, along with other measures and the $1.375 billion Congress did approve, Trump will have about $8 billion to spend on border barrier construction – far more than the $5.7 billion he initially demanded.\n\nWhite House adviser Stephen Miller, who is considered one of the chief architects of Trump's immigration policies, pushed back at the idea that the president's action was unconstitutional in an interview Sunday.\n\n\"Congress in 1976 passed the National Emergency Act and gave the president the authority, as a result of that, to invoke a national emergency in many different circumstances, but among them the use of military construction funds,\" Miller said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nHost Chris Wallace pressed Miller to cite another example from the 59 times presidents used the National Emergency Act where it was invoked to obtain money that Congress had refused to appropriate. Miller did not cite such a precedent and took issue with the premise of the question.\n\n\"They didn’t refuse to appropriate it,\" Miller said. \"They passed a law specifically saying the president could have this authority. It’s in the plain statute. That’s the decision that Congress made, and if people don’t like that, they can address it.\"\n\nOpponents of Trump's wall point to government statistics that the number of migrants crossing the border annually has declined in recent years. Many of the migrants who are making the journey are asylum seekers who seek out immigration officials when they arrive at the border.\n\nThey also point to government data that show that immigrants commit crimes at a lower frequency than U.S. citizens and that a wall is unnecessary because most of the drugs and people enter the U.S. at established points of entry. On Friday, Trump said he did not find that data credible.\n\nFact check:President Donald Trump's national emergency remarks\n\nMore:Trump is wrong about fact-checkers\n\nCritics who say the president is using his emergency powers to skirt Congress' constitutional authority over spending have pointed to his own word when he announced he would declare the emergency.\n\n\"I didn’t need to do this. But I’d rather do it much faster,\" Trump said at one point during the lengthy news conference on the White House lawn Friday.\n\n\"It’s become clear that this is not an emergency, not only because no one believes it is, but because Donald Trump himself has said it’s not,\" Becerra said. \"Typically, our presidents have focused on issues where the national interests are clearly at stake. The national interests aren’t at stake here.\"\n\nAt least two lawsuits already have been filed in response to Trump's emergency declaration. The liberal watchdog group Public Citizen filed a federal lawsuit Friday in Washington, D.C., just hours after Trump's announcement. The group argues Trump exceeded his authority and disregarded the separation of powers outlined by the Constitution. The suit includes three Texas landowners whose property would be seized by the government through eminent domain to build part of the border barrier.\n\nA second lawsuit was filed by the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics. It argues that the White House did not provide the supporting documents needed to justify the national emergency declaration.\n\nCongressional Democrats vowed to do what they can to stop Trump from using his executive authority to shift the Defense Department money toward wall construction.\n\n\"The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the courts, and in the public, using every remedy available,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement Friday.\n\nRep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said that he plans to introduce a \"resolution to terminate\" that could block the emergency declaration. Such a measure would likely pass in the Democrat-controlled House and could make it through the Senate, where a number of Republicans have objected to the precedent set by Trump's use of executive authority.\n\nBut if the resolution made it through both chambers, the president would almost certainly veto it. It is unlikely that enough congressional Republicans would join Democrats to override a veto.\n\n\"Obviously, the president is going to protect his national emergency declaration,\" Miller said Sunday when asked if he thought Trump would veto such a resolution.\n\nContributing: Alan Gomez and Christal Hayes\n\nAnn Coulter and Hannity?:The off-topic things Trump said in national emergency speech\n\nMore:Emergency declaration is clearest sign Donald Trump and Republicans are divided going into 2020 campaign", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/20/national-emergency-dems-resolution-block-trump/2931055002/", "title": "National emergency: Dems to offer resolution to block Trump's action", "text": "WASHINGTON – House Democrats will initiate action Friday to try to block President Donald Trump's declaration of an emergency along the southern border.\n\nTrump announced the declaration last week as a means of freeing up billions to pay for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border after Congress failed to give him the money he demanded.\n\nDemocrats have called the declaration an overreach of Trump's power and have vowed to fight it but on Wednesday, they laid out their plans.\n\nAccording to a letter sent by Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro's office, the Texas Democrat will introduce a resolution Friday morning that, if passed by both the House and Senate, would terminate the emergency declaration.\n\nA copy of the one-page resolution was sent out by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi late Wednesday to others in the House, where she urged members to join in backing the move. She said the House \"will move swiftly to pass the bill\" and vowed to have it move quickly through committees so that Congress could vote on the measure.\n\n\"All Members take an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution,\" Pelosi said in her letter. \"The President’s decision to go outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process violates the Constitution and must be terminated.

But it faces a tough fight after it's passed to the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nMany Republicans have said they were uncomfortable with the president declaring a national emergency to get funding for a wall along the southern border but it's unclear whether they would vote for such an effort.\n\nTrump made the emergency declaration after Congress allocated $1.375 billion for a barrier along the southern border, far short of the $5.7 billion Trump had demanded. The fight over wall funding led to a 35-day government shutdown – the longest on record.\n\nWhite House officials have said the emergency declaration and other budget maneuvers would free up an additional $6.6 billion, which would build at least 234 miles of border wall.\n\nAlong with Congress moving to void the order, the move has also drawn as number of legal challenges in court.\n\nSixteen states already filed a lawsuit over Trump's emergency declaration, arguing it exceeds the power of the president and unconstitutionally redirects federal money that Congress had set aside for other purposes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/07/trump-national-emergency-wall-funding/2496357002/", "title": "President Trump could declare a national emergency.

According to the Congressional Research Service, there are hundreds of \"provisions of federal law delegating to the executive extraordinary authority in time of national emergency.\"\n\n\"Under the powers delegated by such statutes, the President may seize property, organize and control the means of production, seize commodities, assign military forces abroad, institute martial law, seize and control all transportation and communication, regulate the operation of private enterprise, restrict travel, and, in a variety of ways, control the lives of United States citizens,\" says a 2007 CRS report.\n\nCongress can terminate a declared emergency, but it requires a joint resolution – a high hurdle. House Democrats, now in power, would have to convince Senate Republicans, who still control their chamber, to join them in blocking Trump's move. Then they would have to get a signature from the president, the same person who declared the emergency in the first place, or override his veto.\n\n\"So the question on the border wall is: Is there any emergency power stashed somewhere in an already-existing law that could be stretched to include the movement of funds appropriated for one purpose to be used for another?\" Scheppele told USA TODAY.\n\nWhat kind of emergency would it be?\n\nThe president can declare an \"immigration emergency\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nAn immigration emergency is defined as an \"influx of aliens which either is of such magnitude or exhibits such other characteristics that effective administration of the immigration laws of the United States is beyond the existing capabilities\" of immigration authorities \"in the affected area or areas.\"\n\nOther factors that determine if an immigration emergency exists include \"the likelihood of continued growth in the magnitude of the influx,\" an \"apparent connection between the influx and increases in criminal activity, high \"demands on law enforcement agencies\" and \"other circumstances\" that are defined by the attorney general.\n\nUnder the law, the attorney general or head of a local government must submit a request to the president describing the immigration emergency and what is needed to address it. The president then determines if an emergency exists and informs the House and Senate Judiciary committees.\n\nAn Immigration Emergency Fund exists for that purpose, but the law only approves $20 million annually for the fund, far short of the $5.6 billion Trump is seeking.\n\nAnother option that could potentially secure a larger chunk of funding for a border barrier would be under laws regarding military spending, which say the secretary of defense can undertake construction projects during a national emergency without authorization. The law says those projects must be \"necessary to support such use of the armed forces.\"\n\nThe law also permits the Army’s civil works program to build structures necessary for the national defense after the president declares an emergency. The secretary of defense may also reprogram money that had been set aside for military construction projects.\n\nA third statute allows for the construction of emergency projects if the secretary of defense determines it \"is vital to the national security or to the protection of health, safety, or the quality of the environment,\" but that authority is capped at $50 million a year.\n\nWhat do Democratic lawmakers think?\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called Trump's invocation of his emergency powers \"really threatening talk\" that \"he doesn't have the power to execute.\"\n\n\"If Harry Truman couldn't nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this president doesn't have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion-dollar wall on the border,\" Schiff told CNN.\n\nBut Truman did seize the steel mills in 1952, only to be blocked by the Supreme Court. Another Democrat, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, said Trump did have the authority to declare the national emergency but, like Truman, he would face legal challenges.\n\n\"There is a provision in law that says the president can declare an emergency. It's been done a number of times,\" Smith told ABC's \"This Week\" host George Stephanopoulos. \"In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, where is the emergency?

Trump has demanded the final product include funding for his proposed border wall but has also said Republicans on the committee are \"wasting their time\" trying to negotiate with Democrats.\n\nTrump is debating how to handle wall funding while he is also planning a pair of high-profile meetings with foreign leaders. Trump told reporters he may meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next month after an expected summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The U.S. and China are working to head off an escalating trade war, and the president hosted a delegation of Chinese officials on Thursday.\n\n\"I’m thinking about it,” Trump said of the possible Xi meeting. “It could happen.”\n\nTrump dismissed questions about the widely reported location of his meeting with Kim – Da Nang, Vietnam. The president declined to confirm those reports.\n\nMore:Is Trump right that border security talks are doomed? A graveyard of past failures says likely yes\n\nIn one of his few public appearances this week, the president met in the Oval Office with officials from the Department of Homeland Security as well as advocates working on human trafficking. To make the case for his proposed border wall, Trump has often lamented what he has described as a crisis of human trafficking across the border.\n\n“People have no idea how bad it's become,” Trump said. “The case for building a wall is everything.\"\n\nHuman trafficking is problem at the border, but advocates have questioned some of the president’s more colorful descriptions of that issue – such as his assertion women are brought over the border bound with duct tape. The Human Trafficking Legal Center found a large number of trafficking victims were not entering the country illegally but rather had contracts to work as seasonal agricultural workers and domestic workers.\n\nThe president is set to depart the White House on Friday afternoon for his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, his first visit there since Thanksgiving.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/17/trump-says-hell-declare-opioid-crisis-national-emergency-heres-what-could-mean/733391001/", "title": "Trump's opioid emergency is now two months overdue", "text": "WASHINGTON — President Trump first promised to declare a national emergency to confront the epidemic 68 days ago. Since then, statistics show more than 6,000 Americans have died of opioid overdoses waiting for federal action.\n\nTrump now says he'll formally declare that emergency next week, a two-month delay that he said underscores the \"time-consuming work\" behind his administration's response to the crisis.\n\n\"We are going to be doing that next week,\" Trump said at a news conference Monday, 67 days after he first promised to sign the emergency declaration. \"That is a very, very big statement. It's a very important step. And to get to that step, a lot of work has to be done and it's time-consuming work.\"\n\nAn emergency declaration would be a powerful rhetorical tool in focusing national attention on an epidemic that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, claims 91 lives every day.\n\nBut the impact of an emergency wouldn't just be symbolic. It would give the Trump administration novel and untested powers: broad authority to waive patient privacy laws, divert funds and give immunity to medical professionals and first responders.\n\nWithout a formal proclamation, it's impossible to know which of these powers — some of which could be controversial — Trump intends to use.\n\nNeither Trump nor the White House would explain what's holding up the proclamation, though Trump suggested that he's wading through uncharted waters. \"And I want to get that absolutely right,\" he said Monday.\n\nHe's doing it without two key advisers: Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was fired last month for taking private jets at taxpayer expense — often traveling to opioid-related events. And Trump on Tuesday withdrew his nomination for \"drug czar\" after the Washington Post and 60 Minutes reported Rep. Tom Marino's role in pushing through legislation to make it difficult for the Drug Enforcement Administration to crack down on shipments of opioids from drug companies to black market dealers.\n\nMore:Trump's drug czar nominee withdraws after his role backing opioid industry exposed\n\nMore:Iraq war victims allege pharmaceutical companies' bribery led to U.S. troop deaths\n\n\"If you want to be cynical, it’s one thing to declare we are now in a state of emergency. Well, everyone seems to already know that and understand it. So the question is, what specific logjams are removed?\" said Mark Parrino, president of the American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence. \"As this epidemic goes on and claims more lives, that question takes on even greater weight.\"\n\nUnder federal law, the administration has special powers to combat disease when there's a public health emergency declared by the secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nThose emergencies are routine. Just since August, the secretary of Health and Human Services has declared 17 different public health emergencies to deal with the effects of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate, and for the California wildfires. But none for opioids.\n\nPresidents can put even more muscle behind those public health emergencies by declaring a state of national emergency, giving the president additional powers to waive Medicaid and Medicare regulations and patient privacy regulations.\n\nThat's what the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis recommended in July.\n\nThe chairman of that commission, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, said last week that it's \"not good\" Trump hasn't declared an emergency yet. “I think the problem is too big to say that if he had declared an emergency two months ago that it would make a significant difference in two months,” he said at a Trenton press conference. “But I would also say you can’t get those two months back.\"\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry has been publicly supportive of the commission. During the most recent meeting, drug company CEOs promoted their products and sought Food and Drug Administration and Medicaid reimbursement rates that would benefit their proposed opioid treatments and alternatives.\n\nThe commission will hold its final scheduled meeting Friday.\n\nThe White House says the administration is still working out the details of the emergency. \"Right now these actions are undergoing a legal review,\" said White House assistant press secretary Ninio Fetalvo.\n\nBut for those on the front lines of the opioid crisis, frustration is mounting.\n\n\"I think it’s very reasonable to assume that he's just gone on to other things,\" said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who has studied public health emergencies.\n\nTo be sure, a national emergency to address a crisis of addiction would be unprecedented. Only once before has a president used the National Emergencies Act to respond to a public health crisis. President Barack Obama did that in 2009 for an outbreak of the swine flu. That emergency quietly expired in 2010 when the pandemic turned out to be milder than anticipated.\n\nAn opioid emergency would raise new questions about how to adapt powers Congress designed for one purpose — infectious diseases and biological agents — to the slower-moving crisis of addiction, which has been two decades in the making.\n\nOne example: Patient privacy.\n\nKellyanne Conway, the White House counselor who has emerged as Trump's key adviser on the issue, has been struck by stories of parents who first learned their children had been treated for overdoses only after they've died.\n\n“We’re so sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Jones. We tried to save your son. In fact, we resuscitated him three or four times over the last six or eight months, but this time he was too far gone,” Conway said, recounting what she said was an all-too-typical story.\n\n\"And sometimes the privacy laws don’t allow parents of a 19-year-old, in fact, to be notified,\" she said.\n\nExperts disagree about whether that's the case, but concede there's enough confusion about the issue that many medical professionals err on the side of silence.\n\n\"It would be terrific for a declaration of national emergency to declare very clearly in this situation — where someone has overdosed — that health care professionals have every right under the law to communicate with the families,\" said Paul Samuels of the Legal Action Center, which advocates for the rights of drug addicts. \"That would be a major contribution.\"\n\nAn emergency would also allow the Trump administration to tap the Public Health Emergency Fund, a special pool set up by Congress to deal with unanticipated health crises.\n\nThat fund has been all but depleted following the Ebola and Zika emergencies of 2015 and 2016. While the Department of Health and Human Services has so far refused to give a public accounting of that fund, congressional aides say they've been told it has a balance of just $30,000.\n\nEven without new funds, an emergency declaration would allow the president to divert existing money. The federal government could tell states to redirect existing federal grant funds — and the employees paid with them — to the opioid emergency.\n\nEven more significantly, an emergency could allow HHS to waive Medicaid regulations, which currently prohibit reimbursement for residential treatment facilities with more than 16 beds. That waiver could also free up funds for addiction treatment in other institutions like prisons.\n\nAnd the Department of Health and Human Services could even pay off the student loans of health care workers who provide addiction treatment.\n\nBeyond those specific powers, addiction treatment advocates say presidential action could also help send a powerful signal that could help de-stigmatize the disease and focus national attention where it's needed most.\n\n\"This is a bully-pulpit issue. There are many people who voted for him along the Appalachian trail, which has been particularly hard hit by this,\" Parrino said. \"This president has a unique ability to reach out and — no matter what you say about his politics or the fights he picks with people — he has the ability to connect with a large group of the American people.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/13/coronavirus-bill-house-nears-approval-free-tests-paid-sick-leave/5039259002/", "title": "Coronavirus: Trump backs economic relief deal reached with ...", "text": "Corrections and clarifications: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that one Democrat did not vote in favor of the bill.\n\nWASHINGTON — The House overwhelmingly passed legislation to provide economic relief to Americans affected by coronavirus after President Donald Trump said Friday he would support the sweeping measure.\n\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act was adopted 363-40 with every Democrat and most Republicans voting in favor of the measure. The vote was conducted shortly after midnight Friday following two days of around-the-clock negotiations between Democratic leaders and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.\n\nThe bill now heads to the Senate for an expected vote Monday.\n\n“I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening. This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers,” Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump said he encouraged Republican and Democratic lawmakers to \"VOTE YES\" on the package.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an agreement earlier Friday, but Trump appeared to cast doubt on that measure during a Rose Garden press conference where he declared the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency.\n\nFor several hours White House aides declined to offer clear guidance on whether they agreed with Pelosi about the economic package. Trump’s remarks and the subsequent silence from the White House left the fate of the legislation unclear.

Trump blamed Democrats for opposing the idea, but it also drew a chilly response from a number of Senate Republicans.\n\nRepublicans won at least one concession: Small businesses with 50 employees or fewer would not be required to provide more than 14 days of paid sick leave if it \"would risk closing the business.\" The federal government would cover the cost if businesses that qualify for the exemption choose to provide this support to their employees.\n\n– John Fritze and Ledyard King\n\nTrump sought reboot with Rose Garden news conference\n\nAfter days of criticism of his handling of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump sought to regain his footing with his Rose Garden news conference laying out his most specific plans yet to fight the pandemic.\n\nHis declaration of a national emergency added momentum to Friday's rebound in the battered stock market.\n\nFlanked by senior public health and private industry officials, Trump ran through a other actions, such as waiving federal regulations to expand hospital capacity and suspending interest payments on federal student loans..\n\nTrump was seeking a reboot after his Wednesday prime-time address when he stumbled over his words and later had to correct misstatements. His Oval Office remarks led to a massive selloff on Wall Street.\n\n'This will pass.’ Trump seeks to regain footing as he declares coronavirus emergency\n\nFrom 'great' to 'blindsided':How Trump changed his coronavirus message amid fear, confusion in the White House\n\nIn the Rose Garden, Trump repeatedly cut off reporters when their questions turned to fact checking or following up on his claims. At one point, reporters questioned whether Trump felt any responsibility for an initial slow federal response after he removed White House officials charged with pandemic response, Trump said he did not, and quickly moved on to the next question.\n\n“I just think it’s a nasty question,” Trump said. “We’re doing a great job.”\n\nTrump was unapologetic about the test shortages and other problems with the response. And he took several swipes at his predecessor, President Barack Obama, while also criticizing Democrats on Capitol Hill.\n\n– John Fritze and Courtney Subramanian\n\nThird person who visited Trump's resort tests positive for coronavirus\n\nThe Brazilian Embassy identified a second official late Friday who tested positive with coronavirus and interacted with President Donald Trump.\n\nBrazil's Chargé d'Affaires Ambassador Nestor Forster sat Trump’s table and posed for multiple photos with the president last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\n“Following medical advice, Amb. Forster will extend his self-quarantine, which he had already placed himself into as a precautionary measure, for another two weeks,” the embassy said.\n\nThis makes Forster the third person who has tested positive that visited Trump's Florida resort.\n\nFabio Wajngarten, a senior adviser to Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, tested positive for the novel coronavirus five days after he was among a group of officials who met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAdditionally, Trump Victory, a super PAC that supports the president, sent an email to supporters about a donor who was at Mar-A-Lago on Sunday who tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nWhen asked if he would be tested for coronavirus by reporters after these potential exposures, Trump said he \"most likely\" will be tested, despite not having symptoms.\n\n– Savannah Behrmann\n\nMnuchin signals deal on economic package\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin appeared to signal Friday that the White House is on board with a coronavirus response legislation announced earlier by House Democrats, despite some pushback from President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We have an agreement that reflects what the president talked about in his speech the other night,\" Mnuchin told Fox Business Network.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who spent days negotiating with Mnuchin, announced an agreement had been reached on an economic package to help Americans cope with the impact of the coronavirus.\n\nStocks soar after wild week:In rebound, Dow up 1,900 points as Trump frees up aid to fight coronavirus\n\nResponse to Trump Oval Office address:Airport chaos, anxious lawmakers, market plunge\n\nBut at a news conference earlier Friday where Trump announced a national emergency over the virus, the president suggested he had concerns about the progress of the talks with Democrats, and White House aides have so far declined to say whether they agree with Pelosi's assessment that a deal has been reached.\n\n\"We just don't think they’re giving enough,\" Trump said in his Rose Garden news conference. \"We don't think the Democrats are giving enough.\"\n\n– John Fritze\n\nTrump announces cruise lines suspending operations\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced that several major cruise lines – Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and MSC – would suspend operations for 30 days beginning at midnight Friday at his request.\n\n“It is a great and important industry – it will be kept that way!” Trump said in a tweet.\n\nTrump’s request came after two companies – Princess Cruises and Viking Cruises – suspended operations Thursday for 60 days.\n\nPassengers of two Princess Cruises ships, Diamond Princess and Grand Princess, have been quarantined abroad. In the U.S., nearly 700 people contracted coronavirus after being quarantined on board the Diamond Princess and at least 21 people have tested positive after being on Grand Princess.\n\nThe leading trade group, Cruise Lines International Association, had proposed greater screening for passengers and to deny boarding for people at higher risk from the virus. But Vice President Mike Pence said during a news conference announcing federal efforts to corral the outbreak that more steps were expected from the industry.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump, lawmakers reach deal on coronavirus economic relief\n\nDemocratic congressional leaders and the Trump administration have reached a deal on an economic package to help Americans cope with the impact of the coronavirus, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who spent days negotiating it with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.\n\nThe legislation would ensure sick leave for affected workers and include money for testing for Americans, including the uninsured. Trump and lawmakers have been under pressure to ease fears over the spread of the deadly coronavirus, which has halted many parts of public life, forced the closure of schools and pummeled financial markets.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has declared a national emergency, is expected to sign off on the deal shortly. And a vote in the House on the Families First Coronavirus Response Act could come within hours.\n\nThe legislation would:\n\nProvide two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave.\n\nExtend unemployment insurance to furloughed workers.\n\nBeef up food assistance for needy families, including seniors, students and food banks.\n\nIncrease Medicaid funding for local, state, tribal and territorial governments and health systems, to help cover response to the emergency which has claimed dozens of lives and infected hundreds across the country.\n\n“This legislation is about testing, testing, testing,” Pelosi, D-CA, said in a news release announcing the deal. “To stop the spread of the virus, we have secured free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured. We cannot fight coronavirus effectively unless everyone in our country who needs to be tested can get their test free of charge.”\n\n– Ledyard King and Christal Hayes\n\nTrump: I 'most likely' will be tested for coronavirus\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he would most likely be tested for coronavirus, though he said he had no symptoms of infection and offered no timeline for being tested.\n\nSpeaking at a Rose Garden news conference, Trump was pressed about his interactions with officials who have tested positive, including an official from Brazil who met with Trump recently at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. At one point a reporter asked if Trump was being “selfish” for not taking a test and self-isolating himself. “I think I’ll do it anyway,” Trump responded. “We’re working on a schedule.”\n\n– John Fritze\n\nHelp for cruise companies and airlines\n\nPresident Trump said Friday he has waived all interest on federal student loans. He said the suspension would be in effect “until further notice.” Such a move could provide financial aid to workers experiencing reduced hours or layoffs.\n\nTrump also said that with oil historically inexpensive after a recent plunge in prices, he has ordered the Energy Department to buy “large quantities of crude oil” for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Such a move can help support prices for the beleaguered oil industry and ensure the nation has sufficient reserve stockpiles in the event of an international crisis. The strategic reserve has about 645 million barrels of oil.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude prices have fallen more than 30% the past 10 days on shrinking global demand.\n\nAnd Trump suggested the government could provide financial assistance to the ailing cruise line industry.\n\n“It’s an industry that’s very badly impacted because of what’s going on with the virus,” he said, adding that the administration would probably help the cruise industry and the airlines if they ask.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nTrump: 'I don't take responsibility at all' for testing shortages\n\nWhen asked if he is responsible for the delay in availability of coronavirus tests, President Donald Trump said: \"I don't take any responsibility at all.\"\n\n\"We were given a set of circumstances, given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time. It wasn't meant for this kind of an event, with the kind of numbers that we are talking about,\" Trump said.\n\n\"What we've done is redesign it very quickly,\" he added.\n\nThe president has repeatedly blamed the Obama administration for a rule that limited third-party laboratories from developing and running tests, but the rule was actually put in place under the Trump administration, according to an Associated Press fact check this month.\n\nNew coronavirus website:Trump announces that Google will launch site\n\nThe Trump administration reversed one of its own Food and Drug Administration policies that previously only authorized tests made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new regulation allows labs to develop coronavirus tests before the FDA reviews them.\n\nDraft FDA guidance considered during the Obama administration called for tighter regulation of lab tests, but that guidance, which didn't pertain to public health emergencies, never went into effect, according to the Associated Press.\n\n– Courtney Subramanian and John Fritze\n\nNo deal on economic relief package\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday there is no deal yet on an emergency package to respond to the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic and accused Democrats of reneging on negotiations.\n\n“We just don’t think they’re giving enough,” he said, but did not give specifics. “We thought we had something. All of a sudden, they didn’t agree to certain things they agreed to. … They’re not doing what’s right for the country.”\n\nTrump’s remarks in the Rose Garden came about an hour after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, announced the House would move forward with a vote Friday on a sweeping package to confront the coronavirus.\n\nThe bill would include free testing for all Americans, including those uninsured, as well as two weeks of paid sick leave for those who have to skip work due to the virus. It would also included expanded food assistance, such as seniors’ meals, student lunches and food banks.\n\nNational emergency:What does Trump's emergency declaration for coronavirus mean?\n\nPelosi has spoken numerous times with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in an effort to reach a deal. One of the sticking points has been on the paid sick leave provisions.\n\nDrew Hamill, Pelosi's spokesman, tweeted that the House speaker and Mnuchin had their latest conversation during the news conference.\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nStocks welcome Trump's emergency declaration\n\nStocks recovered Friday following a brutal week of selling after President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to free up about $50 billion in federal aid to fight the fast-spreading coronavirus. The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day up 1,985 points, or 9.4%, a day after plunging 2,352 points, for its worst loss since its nearly 23% drop on Oct. 19, 1987.\n\n– David Brinkerhoff\n\nTrump shakes hands with executives\n\nPresident Donald Trump shook hands with an array of company executive who were invited to join him at his Rose Garden news conference to discuss the coronavirus response – despite repeated advice from his own public health experts against such contact.\n\nOnly one company official, Bruce Greenstein of the home healthcare provider LHC Group, moved his hand away from Trump’s outstretched hand and offered an elbow instead.\n\n“I like that. That's good,\" Trump said a bit awkwardly after elbow-bumping Greenstein.\n\n'I’m not concerned at all':Trump says he's not worried as coronavirus arrives in DC area\n\nTrump himself may have been exposed to the virus; he had contact with Fabio Wajngarten, the communications secretary for Brazil's president, who has tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nWajngarten was in Florida last weekend at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, and he posted a photo of himself standing next to the American leader.\n\nTrump has said publicly that he's \"not concerned\" about the potential exposure, and the White House has said there's no reason for him to be tested.\n\n\"I don't have any of the symptoms,\" Trump said.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nAzar given broad authority to waive hospital regulations\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the emergency declaration would give broad authority for Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to waive provisions of laws and regulations to give doctors and hospital \"maximum flexibility to respond to the virus.\"\n\nUnder the declaration, Azar can:\n\nWaive laws to enable telehealth services\n\nAllow remote doctor visits and hospital check-ins\n\nWaive certain federal licensing requirements so doctors from other states can provide services\n\nWaive requirements limiting hospitals to 25 beds or a stay of 96 hours\n\nAllowing hospitals to bring additional physicians on board and obtain additional office space\n\nWaive rules that restrict hospital care of patients within the hospital itself\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump: 'This will pass'\n\nPresident Donald Trump, whose administration has been criticized heavily over a shortage of tests for coronavirus, promised to increase the number of tests but said administering them to everyone was not necessary.\n\n\"Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this,\" Trump said. \"Again, we don't want everybody taking this test. It's totally unnecessary. And this will pass. This will pass through and we're going to be stronger for it.\"\n\n– Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump’s emergency declaration will come with more than just money\n\nThe most significant element of President Donald Trump’s emergency declaration will be federal disaster aid. Trump said up to $50 billion would be made available. Democrats and the Federal Emergency Management Agency had earlier estimated the number to be closer to $40 billion.\n\nBut it’s not just money. Trump said his order would waive several key regulations. Among them:\n\nThe order would waive rules so that telehealth can be more easily accessed, providing care in ways that will not require patients to come into a doctor’s office.\n\nThe order would waive rules limiting the number of beds and length of stays in hospitals.\n\nThe the order would waive rules about which parts of a hospital can treat patients, a move designed to deal with capacity and space if a large number of patients show up seeking care.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nTrump announces drive-through testing\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced plans to partner with pharmaceutical and retail companies to set up drive-through test sites for coronavirus in an effort to catch up to a nationwide demand and deliver on the administration's promise for wider access to testing.\n\nHe met with company executives Friday to discuss expanding access to testing through drive-through testing.\n\n\"The goal is for individuals to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car,\" he said in a Rose Garden news conference.\n\nBy allowing people to remain in their car, health officials say it limits the chance for exposure. Trump said the administration is working with Google to create a web portal to direct people to those locations.\n\nThe administration has faced mounting pressure from lawmakers to increase testing access as the coronavirus pandemic continues to intensify, prompting travel restrictions, school closures, suspension of professional sports leagues and market turmoil. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, admitted to lawmakers on Capitol Hill Wednesday that limited access to testing was \"a failing.\"\n\nNew Rochelle, a New York City suburb, became the first on the East Coast to open a drive-through testing facility Friday after it was designated a coronavirus containment zone following a recent outbreak.\n\n– Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump announces emergency declaration\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared a national emergency Friday to free up billions of dollars to combat the coronavirus as he sought to persuade anxious Americans and battered financial markets that he was responding forcefully to the crisis.\n\n\"I am officially declaring a national emergency. Two very big words,\" Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden. As the outbreak has shuttered schools, sporting events and even Broadway, Trump has come under intense criticism for his handling of the pandemic, including an Oval Office address he delivered Wednesday that was marred by factual errors. Medical experts say there’s an acute shortage of coronavirus testing kits, the number of infections has soared and Wall Street suffered its worst day Thursday since the financial crash of 1987.\n\n”The action I’m taking will open access up to $50 billion for states in our shared fight against his disease,” Trump said, adding that he was ordering every state to open emergency operation centers.\n\n\"This will pass,\" Trump said of the outbreak. \"We’ll be even stronger for it We’ve learned a lot.”\n\nThe emergency declaration comes as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been negotiating with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill on legislation to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus. About an hour before the president delivered his remarks, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House would move forward with a vote Friday on a sweeping package to confront the coronavirus.\n\nThe bill would include free testing for all Americans, including those uninsured, as well as two weeks of paid sick leave who have to skip work due to the virus. It would also include expanded food assistance, such as seniors’ meals, student lunches and food banks.\n\n– John Fritze, Ledyard King and Nicholas Wu\n\nPelosi: House to vote on relief package\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would move forward with a vote Friday on a sweeping package to confront the coronavirus.\n\nThe bill would include free virus testing for all Americans, including the uninsured, as well as two weeks of paid sick leave for those who have to skip work due to the virus. It would also included expanded federal food assistance, such as seniors’ meals, student lunches and food banks.\n\n\"The three most important parts of this bill are: testing, testing, testing,” she said in her televised remarks at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nPelosi has been in constant communication with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who is leading negotiations for the Trump administration.\n\nHer remarks came amid reports that President Donald Trump is expected to declare a national emergency Friday over the coronavirus outbreak, a move that would enable federal officials to direct billions of dollars in federal disaster money to responders fighting the virus.\n\nThe pandemic has killed dozens in the U.S., canceled major sporting events, limited commercial travel, roiled stock markets and transformed everyday life around the globe.\n\n– Ledyard King and Nicholas Wu\n\nTrump to declare national emergency\n\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to declare a national emergency Friday over the coronavirus outbreak, a move that would enable federal officials to direct billions of dollars in disaster money to responders fighting the virus, according to a senior administration official.\n\nThe declaration would be among a series of steps the administration is taking to try to boost the confidence of the American public and the financial markets in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump, who is scheduled to hold a news conference at 3 p.m. EDT, has been heavily criticized for the administration's response, including problems rolling out test kits for the virus and an Oval Office speech he delivered Wednesday that exacerbated huge losses on Wall Street. Investors were shaken by misstatements in the speech and what many saw as the lack of a broader strategy to address the crisis.\n\nAt the 3 p.m. news conference, Trump is also expected to weigh in on a relief package negotiated between Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that would provide paid sick leave to workers, among other steps to blunt the impact on the economy of virus-related disruptions.\n\nThe national emergency is expected to be declared under the 1988 Stafford Act, which authorizes federal assistance to local governments, usually for natural disasters. The Stafford Act is one several laws in a president's extensive emergency powers toolkit. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency over the virus in late January. That step made it easier for states to redirect staff responding to the virus.\n\nThe nation's Disaster Relief Fund has a balance of about $42 billion, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nDebt relief, airline help under consideration, Mnuchin says\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said debt relief for student loans and help for the hard-hit airline industry are under consideration for the next coronavirus rescue package. Speaking to CNBC as a deal was imminent on a separate, near-term package that includes paid emergency leave, Mnuchin said President Donald Trump has no intention of closing financial markets.\n\nMnuchin also said:\n\nCongress and the administration have \"100 things on our list” for the next possible package, and added “The president wants a stimulus package.\"\n\nFinancial authorities are ready to provide liquidity to parts of the economy taking a hit from shutdowns.\n\nA “big rebound” in economic activity could come by the end of the year, drawing a contrast with the Great Recession that began after the 2008 market meltdown.\n\n\"This is not like financial crisis where people don't know when this will end. ...

John Bel Edwards will grant the delay.\n\nLouisiana is the only state that has announced it will delay its primaries due to coronavirus.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign released a statement in response to Louisiana’s primary delay, saying that “our elections can be conducted safely in consultation with public health officials.”\n\n“Voting is at the very heart of who we are as a democracy,” Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement. “If voters are feeling healthy, not exhibiting symptoms, and don’t believe they've been exposed to COVID-19, please vote on Tuesday.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nG-7 leaders will hold virtual summit to discuss coronavirus\n\nPresident Donald Trump and six other world leaders will hold a virtual summit Monday to coordinate a global response to the coronavirus, French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday.\n\nThe videoconference of G-7 leaders will focus on research efforts to find a vaccine, as well as an economic response to the crisis, which has rocked global markets and sparked fears of a recession.\n\nFollowing a call with Trump, “we agreed to organize an extraordinary Leaders Summit by video conference on Monday on Covid-19,” Macron announced on Twitter.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nTrump to hold press conference on coronavirus\n\nPresident Donald Trump will speak on the coronavirus on Friday, he announced on Twitter.\n\nTrump said he would hold a press conference at 3 p.m. EDT. It comes as the White House is negotiating with House Democrats on a bill intended to limit the economic impact of the virus, and as the administration is scrambling to increase the number of coronavirus tests available to the public.\n\nTrump has significantly ramped up the number of times he has taken questions in a press conference setting since the coronavirus spread to the U.S. He has twice appeared in the briefing room to take questions on his administration’s response. He appeared in the briefing room again earlier this week but did not take questions.\n\nThe president otherwise has a relatively light public schedule, though the White House official schedule rarely reflects the totality of the president’s activities. Other than the press conference, Trump is expected to meet with “industry executives” on the virus at 1:30 p.m. EDT.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nMnuchin: coronavirus response deal ‘very close’\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sounded a positive note Friday morning, saying a deal on a coronavirus response package with Congress was imminent.\n\n“We’re very close to getting this done,” he told CNBC.\n\nMnuchin has been the lead negotiator for the White House on the deal, speaking frequently with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., over the past 24 hours.\n\nPelosi said the deal, which is expected to provide free coronavirus testing, paid emergency leave and increased unemployment coverage, is expected to come to the House floor for a vote Friday.\n\nDespite Mnuchin’s optimism about a sweeping deal, he also echoed health officials’ warnings of a worsening situation.\n\n“People should understand the numbers (of infections) are going to go up before they go down,” he said\n\nMnuchin said after this deal is reached, he expects the administration will come back to Congress in the coming weeks for a package of economic stimulus measures (Trump has been pushing for a payroll tax cut) which he predicted would lift the country.\n\n“We will get through this and the economy will be stronger than ever when we get through this,” he said. “By the end of the year, we’re going to have a big rebound in economic activity.”\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nTrump knocks Fed, repeats call for payroll tax cuts\n\nPresident Donald Trump lashed out at Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell to lower rates after repeating his call for Congress to include a payroll tax cut in a sweeping, multibillion-dollar package in response to the growing coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks.\" Trump wrote Friday. \"Jay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic & physiological disadvantage. Should never have been this way. Also, STIMULATE!\"\n\nTrump also renewed calls for a payroll tax cut holiday on Friday as House Democrats and administration officials signaled they were close to reaching a deal.\n\n\"If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31,\" Trump tweeted. \"Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!\"\n\nDemocrats dismissed the proposal of payroll tax cuts, which are taken from workers' paychecks to fund Social Security and Medicare. The president has particularly failed to shore up support among Senate Republicans.\n\nHe first pitched the idea to Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill Monday and again proposed it during an Oval Office address to the nation Wednesday\n\n– Courtney Subramanian\n\nHouse may vote on coronavirus response Friday\n\nThe House appears close to approving a massive federal response to confront the intensifying coronavirus pandemic that has killed dozens across the U.S., roiled financial markets and disrupted the lives of millions of Americans.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi late Thursday said congressional leaders and the White House were close to finalizing a deal on a sweeping, multibillion-dollar package that would guarantee free testing for all Americans – including the uninsured – and expand worker protections such as sick leave and unemployment insurance.\n\nFinal details of the sweeping package could be unveiled by late Friday morning, with a vote by the full House possibly later in the day, Pelosi said.\n\nCoronavirus questions:You asked us tons of questions about the coronavirus. We're answering them.\n\n“Time is of the essence, and this bill must be passed and sent to the Senate,” she said in a statement issued late Thursday. “The House will then get to work on a third emergency response package that will take further effective action that protects the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.”\n\nAccording to a press release from Pelosi, the measure would:\n\nMandate free testing “for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured.\"\n\nSet aside up to 14 days of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave for workers affected by the coronavirus contamination.\n\nExpand unemployment benefits to workers sent home due to the crisis.\n\nEnsure availability of food assistance such as SNAP, student meals, seniors’ nutrition and food banks. Democrats were able to place a temporary hold on work requirements under SNAP during the public health crisis.\n\nProvide federal Medicaid funds to help states defray costs associated with the crisis.\n\nEven if it passes Friday and gets taken up by the Senate early next week, enacting all the measures will take time.\n\nMarch sadness:NCAA cancels men's and women's basketball tournament due to coronavirus concerns\n\nThe tremendous shortage of fully complete test kits, for example, means access remains a major hurdle even if the cost of the procedure is covered by private insurers or the government.\n\nStill, the deal would represent a major breakthrough and a shot of confidence intended to calm rattled markets and anxious Americans.\n\nPelosi, who had several conversations throughout Thursday with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, told reporters outside her office Thursday night that both sides have “resolved most of our differences” and the remaining issues can be settled in future bills.\n\nPelosi said she was particularly stunned by the sudden cratering of the financial markets, which have nosedived in recent weeks and deepened worries about a possible recession due to the rapidly spreading virus.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 entered a bear market for the first time since the financial crisis, and the Dow endured its biggest one-day percentage drop since the 1987 crash.\n\n“That was very shocking,” Pelosi said of the markets. “I'm not going to go into that because what we're trying to do is be a positive.\"\n\nPositive test:Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's wife, tests positive for coronavirus\n\nThe aggressive approach comes a day after Trump announced a suspension of all air travel from the European Union to the U.S. for 30 days, starting midnight Friday.\n\nThe bill is being considered a week after Congress passed an $8.3 billion package that includes more than $3 billion for research and the development of vaccines and $2.2 billion that will help in prevention, preparedness and response. It also allocates $1 billion for state and local response, about half of which would go to specific cities. Each state would receive no less than $4 million.\n\nTrump signed the bill last Friday.\n\nTed Cruz extends his self-quarantine\n\nPhoning into \"CBS This Morning\" from a self-imposed quarantine, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he would extend his self-quarantine after learning he came into contact with another individual who tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nCruz, who self-quarantined earlier this month after interacting with a person at the Conservative Political Action Conference who later tested positive, told CBS he would self-quarantine until March 17. The Texas Republican said he had \"no symptoms\" but had interacted with a \"second individual who has tested positive – a Spanish government official who came to my office in D.C.\"\n\n\"On March 3 I had a meeting in the conference room with him for about 20 minutes,\" Cruz said, noting he had not been tested for the virus because he had no symptoms.\n\nCruz and two other Republican lawmakers quarantined themselves after coming into contact with an infected individual at CPAC in National Harbor, Maryland.

That designation from Obama came in April 2009, before the H1N1 virus was declared a pandemic and at a time when there were only 20 cases in the U.S.\n\nFor the coronavirus, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency in January.\n\nA public health emergency is different – and less significant – than a national emergency. Obama declared a national emergency about six months into the swine flu outbreak. Trump has yet to declare a national emergency for coronavirus.\n\nTrump continued the attack on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a tweet early Friday morning.\n\n“For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it,” Trump claimed. “President Obama made changes that only complicated things further.”\n\nThe Trump administration has been under enormous pressure, including from governors and members of his own party, to speed up the distribution of coronavirus tests. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged Thursday that the testing system is “failing.”\n\nBut it’s not accurate that an Obama-era rule limited third-party laboratories from developing and running tests for the coronavirus during an emergency, according to an Associated Press fact check this month.\n\nThe Trump administration reversed a policy that its own Food and Drug Administration put in place, the Associated Press said. That new regulation allows labs to develop coronavirus tests before the agency reviews them. Previously, the FDA only authorized tests made by the CDC.\n\nDraft FDA guidance considered during the Obama administration called for tighter regulation of laboratory tests but that guidance, which did not pertain to public health emergencies, never went into effect, the Associated Press said.\n\n– John Fritze and Christal Hayes", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/26/exclusive-trump-declare-public-health-emergency-opioid-crisis-partial-measure-figh/796797001/", "title": "Opioids: Trump orders public health emergency on addiction epidemic", "text": "WASHINGTON — President Trump ordered his health secretary to declare the opioid crisis a public health emergency Thursday — but stopped short of declaring a more sweeping state of national emergency.\n\nIn an address from the White House, Trump tried to rally the nation to pay attention to a growing epidemic that claimed 64,000 American lives last year, and advocated for a sustained national effort to end to the addiction crisis.\n\n\"No part of our society – not young or old, rich or poor, urban or rural – has been spared this horrible plague,\" Trump said.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump, speaking at the White House before the president, said “drug addiction can take your friends, neighbors and families. No state has been spared.”\n\nTo respond to that crisis, Trump signed a presidential memorandum ordering Acting Secretary of Health and Human Services Eric Hargan to waive regulations and give states more flexibility in how they use federal funds, said four senior officials responsible for crafting the administration's new opioid policy. The officials previewed the action to USA TODAY on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak ahead of the president's announcement.\n\nTrump first promised to declare a national emergency to combat the crisis on Aug. 10, and repeated that pledge last week. Speaking to reporters on the south lawn of the White House Wednesday, Trump touted a \"big meeting\" on opioids, and said a national emergency \"gives us power to do things that you can't do right now.\"\n\nMore:FDA chief supports opioid prescription limits, regrets agency's prior inaction\n\nMore:Trump says he'll declare opioid crisis a national emergency. Here's what that could mean\n\nMore:As he chairs Trump's opioid commission, Christie champions his home-state drug companies\n\nBut there's a legal distinction between a public health emergency, which the secretary of Health can declare under the Public Health Services Act, and a presidential emergency under the Stafford Act or the National Emergencies Act.\n\nThe latter is what the president's own opioid commission recommended in July. Declaring a state of national emergency would give the president even more power to waive privacy laws and Medicaid regulations.\n\nJames Hodge, a law professor at Arizona State University, said a \"dual declaration\" — of emergencies by both the president and the Health secretary — would give the administration more tools to fight the epidemic, but that any emergency would be a welcome response to the crisis.\n\nTrump's decision to go with a more measured response, a public health emergency, demonstrates the complexity of an opioid crisis that continues to grow through an ever-evolving cycle of addiction, from prescription pain pills to illegal heroin to the lethal fentanyl.\n\nBut the legal powers Trump is invoking were designed for a short-term emergencies like disasters and infectious diseases.\n\nBy law, a public health emergency can only last for 90 days, but can be renewed any number of times. There are 13 localized public health emergencies already in effect for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate, and the California wildfires.\n\nThe opioid action would be the first public health emergency with a nationwide scope since a year-long emergency to prepare for the H1N1 influenza virus in 2009 and 2010.\n\nThursday's designation gives the administration specific powers to marshal federal, state and private resources. Those emergency powers would:\n\n► Allow patients to get medically-assisted treatment for opioid addiction through telemedicine. Current law generally requires in-person visits for doctors to prescribe controlled substances. But for people in rural areas like Appalachia — where the opioid crisis has taken a particularly heavy toll — qualified doctors can often be hours away.\n\n► Give federal and state governments more flexibility in hiring substance abuse specialists temporarily and shift federal grant programs for people with HIV/AIDS to get substance abuse treatment.\n\n\"I think our general feeling is, that's a good step, but it’s a temporary step, and it’s a transitional step,\" said Jim Blumenstock, chief of health security for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n\n► Make Dislocated Worker Grants available to people with opioid addiction through the Department of Labor. Those grants are usually available to people put out of work by a natural disaster, but a public health emergency could also make those grants available to people in treatment. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta told the opioid commission last week that pain and addiction sideline millions of American workers: Of men aged 25-54 not in workforce, 44% had taken a painkiller in the last day, according to the Council of Economic Advisers.\n\n► Tap the Public Health Emergency Fund, a special fund that gives HHS maximum flexibility in a health crisis.\n\nHowever, that fund has just $57,000 in it, said Bill Hall, a deputy assistant secretary of Health. The city of Middletown, Ohio could spend almost twice that this year on naloxone alone. Naloxone is a drug that can instantly reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.\n\nAdministration officials said the broader national emergency declaration was unnecessary because the government can clear some hurdles through lower-level action.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services expects to issue guidance soon emphasizing that health care providers can communicate with the families of overdose victims situations without running afoul of health privacy laws. HHS has also approved waivers to some regulations in four states, giving them the flexibility that a national emergency could have provided.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who chairs the president's opioid commission, said he wasn't concerned about the form the emergency took. \"Today he's doing what we asked of him,\" he said.\n\nChristie told USA TODAY that a public health emergency should put pressure on Congress to act.\n\n\"My view is that this action sends a clear signal from the president that he wants money appropriated into that fund,\" he said. \"And it gives Congress a place to go with that money to give the administration some flexibility to use it to be able to use it to deal with some of the most pressing parts of it.\"\n\nChristie's top priority: Getting naloxone into the hands of every first responder in the country. \"That will bend the curve back in terms of lost lives,\" he said.\n\nOne administration official said there was no specific funding request that would accompany the emergency, and House and Senate appropriations committees said they hadn't had any discussions with the administration on it.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/16/donald-trump-national-emergency-border-wall-fight/2876668002/", "title": "Donald Trump national emergency, border wall fight: What's next", "text": "WASHINGTON – After weeks of threatening to declare a national emergency for his controversial border wall, President Donald Trump finally did it.\n\nThe president signed a bipartisan spending bill to avert another government shutdown Friday. That bill includes $1.375 billion for his border wall, far short of the $5.7 billion he initially requested. The national emergency and other measures will free up $8 billion – far more than the $5.7 billion he initially demanded – to free up funding for 234 miles of bollard wall, the White House said.\n\nThe White House expects to pull the funds from a few places, including military construction cash, asset forfeiture funds at Department of Treasury and drug interdiction money at the Department of Defense.\n\nNow that the spending bill is signed and an emergency has been declared, here's what you can expect to happen next:\n\nLawsuits\n\nSoon after Trump signed an emergency declaration a slew of political groups started announcing plans to file lawsuits. One organization, the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen, filed a federal suit in the District of Columbia Friday evening arguing against the constitutionality of Trump's actions.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that Trump exceeded his powers by declaring an emergency and was a clear violation of the separation of powers.\n\n\"The president has no inherent authority to declare emergencies to override appropriations laws and other laws enacted by Congress; his emergency powers are defined and limited by statute,\" the lawsuit states. \"Because no national emergency exists with respect to immigration across the southern border, the President’s Declaration exceeds the limited authority delegated to the President.\"\n\nIn California, the governor and attorney general – both Democrats – held a news conference Friday in Sacramento also vowing to file a lawsuit to block Trump.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra said he’s coordinating with other attorneys general around the country to read through the emergency declaration and prepare a federal lawsuit. He said the president has not presented a convincing case that the southern border represents a crisis because crossings are at historic lows.\n\n“He has the power to declare a national emergency, but this is not 9-11, this is not the Iran hostage crisis of 1979,” Becerra said. “This is a president showing his disdain for the rule of law and our U.S. Constitution.”\n\nBecerra, like many others, also pointed out Trump's own remarks when he announced the order.\n\n\"President Trump got one thing right this morning about his declaration when he said, ‘I didn’t have to do this.’ He’s right, he didn’t have to do this. In fact, he can’t do this because the U.S. Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to direct dollars,\" Becerra said.\n\nExperts said Trump's emergency declaration will be a legal headache for the White House.\n\nMore:Trump's national emergency plan to build a border wall carries big risks, rewards\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the administration is \"very prepared\" for legal challenges. Trump seemed to mock the process during remarks at the White House, describing how his emergency order would inevitably face legal challenges, which his administration would fight all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country,\" Trump said. \"So I think that we will be very successful in court.\"\n\nGroups such as Protect Democracy and the Niskanen Center said Thursday, a day before the order was signed, that they were preparing lawsuits to challenge Trump's declaration. The groups said they would represent El Paso County in Texas along with the Border Network for Human Rights in a lawsuit against the administration.\n\nLitigation could go all the way to the Supreme Court, which has smacked down attempts by both Trump and President Barack Obama to go around Congress. How long that takes would depend on several factors, including what programs the White House might tap for funding, who has the right to sue and what court the suits are filed in.\n\nCongress taking action\n\nCongress also has its own options for taking on Trump's decision.\n\nThe Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee on Friday sent a six-page letter to the president announcing that they would investigate his use of executive power.\n\n\"The House Judiciary Committee is commending an immediate investigation into this matter, which raises both constitutional and statutory issues,\" the letter reads, asking that the president make Justice Department and White House officials, including Counsel Pat Cipollone, available for a \"hearing in the coming days.\"\n\nLawmakers have other choices of action as well. On Thursday, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he supported Congress taking up a resolution to halt the move and vowed to examine other legal methods.\n\n\"I will fully support the enactment of a joint resolution to terminate the president's emergency declaration, in accordance with the process described in the National Emergencies Act, and intend to pursue all other available legal options,\" Nadler said.\n\nNadler's call for a resolution in Congress points to a rarely used measure that could allow lawmakers to block the emergency declaration. For starters, the resolution – which any member can introduce – puts Republicans in the awkward position of having to vote on an issue that is broadly unpopular with voters.\n\nBut to actually rescind the emergency, the joint resolution would need a signature from the president – an unlikely result – or Congress would have to override his veto.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed to fight back against Trump's move but on Friday did not publicly lay out any specifics.\n\n\"The President's actions clearly violate the Congress’s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution,\" a joint statement from Pelosi and Schumer read. \"The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.\"\n\nPelosi and Schumer argued the national emergency order \"transcends partisan politics and goes to the core of the Founders’ conception for America, which commands Congress to limit an overreaching executive.\" They called on Republicans to join them in denouncing the order.\n\n\"The President’s emergency declaration, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers, inconsistent with our Founders’ vision,\" Pelosi and Schumer said. \"The President is not above the law. The Congress cannot let the President shred the Constitution.\"\n\nRepublican divisions\n\nIt isn't only Democrats who are wary about Trump's use of executive power.\n\nA number of Republicans have also raised concerns and voiced opposition to the maneuver, saying it allows for a bad precedent that could be used to go around Congress by presidents in years to come when they do not get their way.\n\nThe concerns highlighted a possible division within the Republican party, something that could potentially harm Trump in other battles on Capitol Hill, and in the upcoming 2020 election.\n\nOn Thursday, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she is concerned about use of the declaration to shift billions of dollars Congress has already appropriated.\n\nShe said it “strikes me as undermining the appropriations process, the will of Congress and of being of dubious constitutionality.”\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. also said he had concerns that Trump would be violating the Constitution and setting up a bad precedent.\n\n\"We have a crisis at our southern border, but no crisis justifies violating the Constitution,\" he said in a statement.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/15/donald-trump-national-emergency-border-wall-lawsuits/2882729002/", "title": "First lawsuits filed against President Donald Trump's national ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – At least two lawsuits have been filed in response to President Donald Trump on Friday declaring a national emergency to secure funding for a wall along the southern border with Mexico.\n\nThe filings are expected to be part of a flurry of legal challenges to the constitutionality of Trump's decision.\n\nThe national emergency and other measures will free up $8 billion – far more than the $5.7 billion he initially demanded – to free up funding for 234 miles of bollard wall, the White House said.\n\nBut within hours after Trump signed off on declaring an emergency, the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen filed a federal lawsuit late Friday in the District of Columbia. The suit also includes three Texas landowners who are located along the southern border, who were told their property would be seized for a border wall if money was allocated to the project this year.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that Trump exceeded his powers by declaring an emergency and was a clear violation of the separation of powers.\n\n\"The president has no inherent authority to declare emergencies to override appropriations laws and other laws enacted by Congress; his emergency powers are defined and limited by statute,\" the lawsuit states. \"Because no national emergency exists with respect to immigration across the southern border, the President’s Declaration exceeds the limited authority delegated to the President.\"\n\nAnother federal lawsuit was filed in D.C. by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a prominent government watchdog group, but the litigation targets the Justice Department and revolves around a Freedom of Information Act request regarding the emergency order.\n\nThe organization contends that Trump's administration failed to show the legal authority of his national declaration by refusing to cough over documents requested that included communications, including legal opinions, from the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense over whether Trump had the authority to declare an emergency to build a wall.\n\n\"Americans deserve to know the true basis for President Trump’s unprecedented decision to enact emergency powers to pay for a border wall,\" CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement. \"We’re suing because the government has so far failed to produce the requested documents or provide an explanation for their delay.\"\n\nBut those two suits are just the beginning. A barrage of organizations and officials have already pledged to fight this in court.\n\nPolitical organizations and even the state of California were lining up challenges they intend to file in court to challenge Trump, something the president said he was prepared for. Trump said he expects the legal battle to make its way through the courts and end up at the Supreme Court, where he said he hopes his administration will get a \"fair shake.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union said on Friday that it planned to file a lawsuit early next week challenging Trump's use of his executive powers to go around Congress. The organization, which has challenged the Trump administration on many legal fronts over the last two years, argued Trump's order violates the Consitution.\n\nThe organization said no other president has attempted to use emergency powers to fund a project and pointed to remarks Trump made from the White House in announcing the order, where he said of his emergency declaration: \"I didn't need to do this. But I'd rather do it much faster.\"\n\nMore:Read President Trump's national emergency order to fund a border wall\n\nRelated:'I use many stats.'

Gavin Newsom said he’s been trying to work with federal agencies to combat the growing threat of drugs crossing into California. But he said a border wall is not the solution since most of those drugs enter through ports of entry and construction of a wall would take away funding from the very law enforcement agencies that have been successfully working to combat drug trafficking.\n\nNewsom called Trump’s wall a “vanity project,” a “monument to stupidity” and a blatant political ploy that he engineered after being “embarrassed” by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the recent government shutdown.\n\n“I don’t want to be a sparring partner with President Trump, we want to be a working partner, but he makes it all but impossible when he plays these games and manufactures a crisis and creates the conditions where we have no other choice but to sue the administration,” Newsom said. “Donald Trump, we’ll see you in court.”\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra said he’s coordinating with other attorneys general around the country to read through the emergency declaration and prepare a federal lawsuit.

More importantly, its streaming business has been costly. It lost $1.5 billion in the quarter, compared to a loss of $630 million in last year’s fourth quarter.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was $20.1 billion, up 9% from last year. Analysts, however, were expecting over $21 billion. Profit was $162 million, which was up 1% compared to last year.\n\nThe results sent Disney’s stock down roughly 10% in after-hours trading.\n\n“The rapid growth of Disney+ in just three years since launch is a direct result of our strategic decision to invest heavily in creating incredible content and rolling out the service internationally,” Bob Chapek, Disney’s CEO, said in a letter to investors on Tuesday. “We expect our [direct to consumer] operating losses to narrow going forward.”\n\nChapek added that the streaming unit will still “achieve profitability in fiscal 2024.” However, he added an important note of caution to that promise by saying “assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the economic climate.”\n\n“By realigning our costs and realizing the benefits of price increases and our Disney+ ad-supported tier coming December 8, we believe we will be on the path to achieve a profitable streaming business that will drive continued growth and generate shareholder value long into the future,” he said.\n\nDisney’s earnings come at an inflection point for how investors measure success in the streaming world.\n\nFor many years, Wall Street’s focus was on how much and how quickly a streaming service could grow. That’s changed this year as services like Netflix received more scrutiny when it comes to profitability.\n\nDisney appears to be under the same microscope.\n\nGrowth in its streaming unit was solid this quarter, with the company totaling more than 235 million subscribers across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. Even so, its stock sank on Tuesday evening due to the extent of those losses.\n\nUltimately, the costs associated with Disney’s streaming endeavors were behind the company’s decision to increase its prices earlier this year. It’s also introducing a new ad-supported subscription tier to offset those losses.\n\nThe Disney+ premium tier, which comes without commercials, jumped by $3 to $10.99 per month, the company announced in August. That’s the largest price increase for the platform since its November 2019 debut.\n\nIts new ad plan will debut in the United States on December 8 at a cost of $7.99 a month. That price point is what consumers were paying for Disney+ without the ads.\n\nElsewhere in Disney’s media kingdom, the company’s parks, experiences and products division reported revenue of $7.4 billion — a 36% boost from last year.\n\nThat’s impressive considering that coronavirus restrictions have hit Shanghai Disneyland and Disney World in Florida briefly closed due to Hurricane Ian in September.\n\nWhen it comes to its movies, Disney has a lot to look forward to at the box office.

That’s a growth of only 2.5 million, which is less than what analysts were expecting.\n\nNetflix’s fourth quarter profit was $607 million, up from $542 million in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue jumped 16%, to $7.7 billion.\n\nThe company said in its letter to investors that competition from streaming rivals “may be affecting our marginal growth some.” However, it added, “we continue to grow in every country and region in which these new streaming alternatives have launched.”\n\n“This reinforces our view that the greatest opportunity in entertainment is the transition from linear to streaming,” the company said.\n\nNetflix pointed out that while “retention and engagement remain healthy,” its growth has not “yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels.”\n\nThe company attributed this to “several factors, including the ongoing Covid overhang and macro-economic hardship in several parts of the world.”\n\nReed Hastings, Netflix’s CEO, explained on the post-earnings call that there were myriad reasons for the company’s low guidance. He mentioned increased competition as a cause, but noted that rivals like Amazon and Hulu have been around for many years.\n\nAnd he conveyed confidence in the future of streaming, as well as Netflix’s large market size and steady execution. “For now, we’re staying calm,” Hastings said.\n\nThe streaming giant’s waning growth is a big reason why the company announced on Friday that it would raise prices in the United States and Canada, two of its biggest markets. The US subscription price of Netflix’s standard plan rose $1.50 to $15.49. The basic plan went up $1 to $9.99 and the premium plan increased $2 to $19.99\n\nGiven competition from the likes of Disney+ and HBO Max, which is a unit of CNN parent company’s WarnerMedia, Netflix is trying to offset its slower growth with higher subscription prices.\n\nOne bright spot for the streamer was in the US and Canada, where subscriptions increased by 1.2 million in the fourth quarter – a sizable jump from the roughly 70,000 subscribers in added in the prior quarter.\n\nNetflix’s massive slide Thursday also hit other streaming companies.

That is the highest price since September 2012 and 11 cents higher than Thursday.\n\nGas prices have soared 18 cents since Wednesday and 29 cents since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine eight days ago. Each of those increases marks the largest price hikes since Hurricane Katrina slammed into the US Gulf Coast in 2005, devastating the nation’s oil and gas industry, according to the Oil Price Information Service, which collects data from 130,000 gas stations nationwide for AAA’s price averages.\n\nWith prices rising so rapidly, a national average of $4 a gallon, as well as the record $4.11 set in 2008, will probably be reached soon.\n\n“This is not the end of it. We’re already up another 14 cents on wholesale gas prices this morning,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS. He said the wholesale gas price increases are likely to be passed onto consumers in short order.\n\n“It’s absolutely out of control,” he said.\n\nThe average price a year ago was $2.75 a gallon, as prices were still recovering from the plunge that occurred early in the pandemic. Stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns slashed demand for gasoline.\n\nThe average household uses about 90 gallons a month, said Kloza, so a $1.09 increase in gas prices costs that household about $98 a month, or just less than $1,200 over the course of a year.\n\nKloza said he could see the average price rising to a new record of between $4.25 to $4.50 a gallon. He said the rapid rise in the price of gas is making a particularly strong impression on the public, compared to a slow but steady increase in prices.\n\n“When you get increases this quick, and this dramatic, you really scald the public,” he said.\n\nCalifornia’s statewide average jumped 13 cents overnight to $5.07 a gallon, making it the first state ever to have a average price above $5 a gallon.\n\nThere are now nine states – California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Illinois, New York and Pennsylvania, where the average price is already over $4 a gallon, with New York and Pennsylvania crossing the $4 mark with the latest reading.\n\nTwo more states – Arizona and Connecticut, as well as Washington, DC, are only pennies away from that $4 average.\n\nThe average price of a gallon of diesel is now $4.26 a gallon. It hit $4 this past weekend. While relatively few US passenger cars use diesel, virtually all large trucks depend on it. And most trucking companies have a schedule of fuel surcharges that are based on average prices, meaning that the cost of transporting almost all goods is increasing for businesses, a cost increase that is also likely to be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nThe sanctions placed on Russia’s economy following its invasion of Ukraine have so far exempted Russian oil exports.

Pandemic lockdowns exacerbated the urgency.\n\nNow, that war to win over subscribers at any cost is over.\n\nDisney (DIS) is hiking prices after losing a ton of money on its various streaming services. Netflix recently jacked up prices and is cracking down on password sharing. Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN’s parent company, is scrapping films and series left and right and reversing its controversial everything-under-one-streaming-roof strategy. All three services are expanding their ad-supported offerings.\n\nStreaming itself isn’t going anywhere — it’s the present and future of Hollywood — but the spend now, ask questions later days look to be coming to an end as these services mature and media companies cleave to what makes money.\n\n“The streaming wars are over because subscriber growth has come to a halt,” Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at MoffettNathanson, told CNN Business. “You’re fighting a war in a land that has no more resources in it.”\n\nDisney announced Thursday that Disney+ added 14.4 million subscribers in the third quarter, exceeding expectations. The company’s other big news was that it would be raising the price of its ad-free service by $3 per month after it lost more than $1 billion in the quarter on streaming.\n\nDespite Disney+’s growth in the third quarter, the company announced it was revising its long-term forecasts for the platform. Disney is just one of many streaming providers that have revised their strategic plans lately.\n\nDavid Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, has canceled multiple big budget projects for HBO Max, while also reiterating that he’s not trying to win the streaming “spending war.” Zaslav’s strategy is the opposite of the approach taken by his predecessor Jason Kilar, whose focus was to put as much content as possible on HBO Max, no matter the consequences.\n\nNetflix’s growth has stalled after it lost subscribers two quarters in a row. Its stock has fallen roughly 60% so far this year and, in a bid to course correct, the platform is transforming itself from a streaming revolutionary to a new age legacy media company. Next year it’s debuting a lower priced, ad-supported option, something it said it would never do, and clamping down on password sharing, something it previously said helped it grow.\n\n“When the streaming wars officially kicked off in late 2019, early 2020, the major services outlined their five year goals,” Matthew Ball, CEO of Epyllion, an investment and advisory firm, and former Amazon Studios executive, told CNN Business. “We’re halfway there now and thus executives must confront whether their targets are achievable or even desirable, and this is leading to many strategy changes — as it should.”\n\nSo streaming is evolving, but if the streaming wars phase is coming to an end what’s next?\n\nThe Rumble of the Bundles\n\nDisney+ gained subscribers, but also raised prices. Lucasfilm Ltd. & ™/Disney+\n\nNathanson believes that the next phrase of the streaming revolution will be one of consolidation and bundling.\n\n“Services can get together to form new services or do what Disney is trying to do and bundle the heck out of two or three other services,” he said. “As we saw in pay TV, bundles work. You have your broadband, your phone and your video with one place and that worked for awhile.”\n\nThis is why it’s no coincidence that even though Disney raised prices across many of its tiers, it didn’t touch its premium Disney bundle, which consists of Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ and remains $19.99.\n\nThis move appears to be Disney’s way of pushing consumers to sign up for its entire slate of services rather than just one.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is also going down the consolidation path. The company announced last week that the long-awaited merger of its services, HBO Max and Discovery+, will debut in the US next summer.\n\nSo if the first phase of the streaming revolution was the “Streaming Wars” the next phase could be dubbed the “Rumble of the Bundles.”\n\nAs for Ball, he believes big media companies will do what they’ve always done: “operate in multiple different media categories.”\n\n“For years, Hollywood has been primarily focused on streaming video, but they’re now shifting elsewhere,” he said. “More gaming, sometimes blockchain/NFT, experiential exhibits, etc.”\n\nThe streaming wars are dead. Long live streaming\n\nNetflix is maturing, and so is the rest of streaming. Courtesy of Netflix\n\nWith streaming transforming into something new, consumers are in for a shock to the system.\n\nStreaming trained millions of viewers around the world to expect a lot of ad-free content for an inexpensive price. But that expectation was unsustainable, according to Nathanson.\n\n“Wall Street just paid people for subscribers, and because it paid people for subscribers, companies did not care about the economics,” he said. “They were willing to do whatever they could to chase subscribers.”\n\nIn other words, the grow-at-any-cost strategy could never last, and now we’re at a point where companies and Wall Street are looking at balances sheets and focusing on profitability and revenue as much as scale.\n\nAnd the truth is that even though the streaming wars are ending — and consumers are paying the price — there’s really no place else for any of them to go.\n\nStreaming is here to stay. It’s the focus of Hollywood and how millions watch TV shows and films. That’s not changing even if the dynamics and strategies of the businesses behind them are.\n\n“Video remains the most popular leisure activity in the world,” Ball said. “Streaming may change, but consumers will adapt. They love video too much.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/24/netflix-price-raise-for-subscribers/40350651/", "title": "3 Reasons Netflix Won't Raise Prices Again in 2020 | The Motley Fool", "text": "Adam Levy\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nNetflix announced four price increases for its service within the 58 months from April 2014 to January 2019.\n\nCombined with continued subscriber growth, the price increases have led to phenomenal revenue growth for the streaming leader. And Netflix has dutifully taken that revenue and reinvested it in more and more content for its audience. It's on track to invest $15 billion in cash on content this year.\n\nManagement says it'll ask for higher prices at some point in the future, but pushing another increase in 2020 seems unlikely.\n\nHere are three reasons why Netflix won't raise its prices again next year.\n\n1. It front-loaded the most recent price increase\n\nThe price hike Netflix announced at the start of the year was its biggest ever. While it had been asking for an extra dollar per month for subscribers of its most popular plan in the U.S. with every price change, it increased the price by $2 per month at the start of the year.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhat's more, the most recent price increase made it the first time any Netflix streaming subscription wasn't available for $8 per month. The lowest-priced plan increased to $9 per month this year.\n\nThe higher prices have translated into strong revenue growth despite Netflix's subscriber growth slowdown. Average revenue per user increased 22% year over year last quarter, and was up 16.5% in the U.S. Combined with subscriber growth, total revenue increased 31% year over year, and management expects another 30% increase in the fourth quarter. That's faster growth than the growth in cash spent on content, and importantly led to a very profitable quarter for Netflix over the past three months.\n\nThe current pricing ought to support Netflix's increased content spending in 2020 without the need to ask subscribers for more.\n\nMark Zuckerberg appeare before Congress:Here's why\n\n2. Retention challenged by current pricing\n\nNetflix's management finally admitted to something that was obvious in its second-quarter earnings report: The new pricing has increased subscriber churn.\n\nManagement says the percentage difference in the U.S. is minimal – maybe 0.1% – but small changes in churn can have a big impact given a subscriber base of 60 million. Indeed, an increase of 0.1% in monthly subscriber churn translates into an additional 180,000 subscribers leaving Netflix in the third quarter. Netflix notably fell short of its third-quarter U.S. net add forecast by 280,000 subscribers.\n\n\"There's a little more [price] sensitivity. We're starting to see a little touch of that,\" CEO Reed Hastings said on the company's earnings call. That comment indicates Netflix might have to take a breather on price increases as consumers adjusted to its current pricing.\n\nThey're not avocados, they're 'green gold,':Hyperviolent drug cartels have sights set on them\n\n3. New competitors with low price points\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge facing Netflix pricing in 2020 is the emergence of several new competitors, most with lower prices. Apple and Disney will debut their streaming video services next month priced at $4.99 and $6.99 per month, respectively.\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal is expected to launch Peacock at a price point below Netflix's and also offer a free ad-supported version of the service to its cable subscribers. AT&T's WarnerMedia will launch HBO Max early next year, but its price will likely be comparable with Netflix's high-end subscription.\n\nConsumers only have so much they can spend on discretionary purchases like streaming entertainment. Management admitted the new streaming options may be a \"modest headwind to our near-term growth\" in its letter to shareholders. That's not to say the pricing of competitors will determine Netflix's pricing. \"I think the pricing of our competitors, we don't feel is (a) real significant factor in determining what we can charge for our service,\" product chief Greg Peters said on the earnings call.\n\nHe notes that every streaming service will offer a differentiated slate of content, so their value shouldn't be determined by relative pricing. But if consumers are offered enough content to satiate their streaming appetite from competitors at a lower price point than Netflix, it'll be a lot harder for the company to raise prices. It's yet to be determined whether that'll be the case, and Netflix argues it's more likely new competition will steal engagement and spending from linear television than incumbent on-demand services.\n\nListening to subscribers\n\nNetflix isn't considering an upper bound on its pricing. Peters said he's happy to \"let our subscribers sort of tell us as we add more value along where that right price should be. We're really more focused on listening to subscribers and sort of walking that path with them.\"\n\nRight now subscribers are telling Netflix it needs to let off the gas on the price increases. Higher churn rates and strong interest in forthcoming competition shows Netflix is nearing the upper limit of its pricing power for right now. This year's price hike should be enough to hold it over through 2020, even with further increases in content spending.\n\nAdam Levy owns shares of Apple and Walt Disney.

For example, a search for the question “Was the 2020 election stolen?” yielded six videos that contained false claims in the first 20 results, NewsGuard found.\n\nNewsGuard researchers also found that TikTok’s search engine “is consistently feeding millions of young users health misinformation, including some claims that could be dangerous to users’ health.” For instance, a search for “does mugwort induce abortion” receives over a dozen results that advocate for unproven herbal abortion methods.\n\nTikTok recently began removing abortion-related videos that violate its policy against medical misinformation, including those that share potentially dangerous advice about how to self-induce an abortion.\n\nIn response to the NewsGuard report, a TikTok spokesperson told CNN that its community guidelines “make clear that we do not allow harmful misinformation, including medical misinformation, and we will remove it from the platform. We partner with credible voices to elevate authoritative content on topics related to public health, and partner with independent fact-checkers who help us to assess the accuracy of content.”\n\nTikTok ties to China under scrutiny\n\nTikTok removed more than 102 million videos in early 2022 for violating its guidelines, according to its Community Guidelines Enforcement Report. But less than 1% of those videos were removed for violating the company’s “integrity and authenticity” guidelines, which include misinformation, according to NewsGuard’s review.\n\nNewsGuard’s report was released amid bipartisan concerns in Washington about the possibility that US user data could find its way to the Chinese government and be used to undermine US interests due to a national security law in that country that compels companies located there to cooperate with data requests.\n\nUS officials have expressed fears that China could use Americans’ personal information to identify useful potential agents or intelligence targets, or to inform future mis- or disinformation campaigns.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday, TikTok Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas declined to commit to cut off flows of US user data to China, instead promising that the outcome of its negotiations with the US government “will satisfy all national security concerns.”\n\nTikTok does not operate in China, Pappas said, though it does have an office in China. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, whose founder is Chinese and has offices in China.\n\n“I was surprised that TikTok is so much worse even than Google and worse, as a general matter as a platform, than Facebook or Twitter when it comes to this stuff,” Steven Brill, founder of NewsGuard, told CNN.\n\nBrill said the report’s findings are especially concerning due to the company’s ties to China and how easily children can access the app’s content.\n\n“We should take this as a warning. If I had kids of TikTok age, I would certainly want to know what they’re using as a search engine,” Brill said. “I’d be upset enough if they were relying too much on Google and coming up with reports in school that were based on what they were reading on Wikipedia.

Well, at that time, the average cost of gas was around 10 cents a gallon. So adding a cent was a big deal, especially for drivers strapped for cash during the Great Depression. Instead of rounding up, which would have equated to a 10% increase, gas stations added the fraction of a cent instead.\n\nBy the 1950s, as the interstate highway system developed and gas stations began advertising their prices on big boards, most stations had moved to ending prices in 9/10 of cent, rather than a smaller fraction. This was a way to maximize sales, said Jacobson.\n\nThey’re “squeezing the buck as far as they can,” he said.\n\nSetting prices ending in 99 cents, known as “just-below pricing,” is a common marketing tool used to make consumers feel like they’re getting a deal, said Robert Schindler, a professor of marketing at the Rutgers School of Business-Camden who researches retail prices and how shoppers process numbers.\n\n“To consumers, a price such as 19.9 cents feels substantially lower than the price of 20 cents,” Schindler said.\n\nGas station owners now have computer programs that can help them set prices, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks gas prices at 130,000 stations nationwide.\n\nMany station owners would prefer their prices to be just a tenth of a cent below an even dollar amount, instead 9/10 of a cent above.\n\n“A lot of the small station owners will tell you they pick a price by feel,” Kloza said. “They’ll tell you it makes a big difference if it’s $4.999 or $5.009. Drivers don’t want to see that $5.”\n\nAlthough AAA’s national average price is now above $5 a gallon for the first time on record, the most common price for a gallon of regular gas is still at $4.999, according to OPIS data.\n\nThere have been occasional attempts to end fractional pricing for gas.\n\nIn 1985, Iowa outlawed the practice. “We don’t have a one-tenth of a coin,” an Iowa state senator reportedly said at the time. “It just bugged me for years.” In 1989, however, the state repealed the law and most stations returned to fractional pricing.\n\nIn 2006, Jim Davis, a gas station owner in Palo Alto, California, dropped the fraction of a penny and rounded his prices down. He said it cost him around $23 a day.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/business/nightcap-ethereum-merge-crypto/index.html", "title": "What you need to know about the ethereum 'merge' | CNN Business", "text": "This story is part of CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter.

Bitcoin, by far the largest token, has fallen roughly 70% from its high nearly a year ago. Ditto the second-largest coin, ether, which runs on the ethereum blockchain.\n\nBut for months, the crypto faithful have been buzzing about a complex ethereum network software upgrade known as the “merge.”\n\nIn short, the merge would put the core infrastructure of ethereum on a more environmentally sustainable path, reducing its carbon footprint by 99%, according to the nonprofit behind the network. That’s the simple version, anyway — actually pulling it off took years of research and testing, and it wasn’t clear what would happen because, like so much in crypto-land, nothing like it had ever been done before.\n\nSo far, though, the merge appears to have been completed without a hitch.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nWhen you hear critics slamming crypto for sucking up as much energy as all of Argentina, say, or comparing bitcoin’s energy footprint to that of every refrigerator in America combined, they’re talking about the global community of computers required to verify transactions under the “proof-of-work” protocol.\n\nUntil now, both ethereum and bitcoin were running on proof-of-work, which requires high-powered computers to verify transactions and “mine” new coins across a decentralized global computer network.\n\n(Ugh, I realize that still might sound like sci-fi, but the longer explanation would seriously put everyone to sleep. Let me just boil it down to this: proof-of-work = bad for the environment and extremely bad for crypto industry PR).\n\nThe long-awaited merge moves ethereum onto a more energy-efficient “proof-of-stake” mechanism for validating transactions.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nBarring any snags with the merge, the ethereum network, which houses the entire community of NFTs (non-fungible tokens), should function just as it had before, but using radically less electricity and, supporters say, making the network more secure.\n\nWill bitcoin follow suit?\n\nIt’s not likely. Within the world of crypto, there are deep philosophical rifts over the utility of the underlying technology.\n\n“Ethereum and bitcoin have quite different cultures, frankly,” says Laura Shin, host of the “Unchained” podcast. Even though it’s technically possible for bitcoin to alter its infrastructure, as ethereum just demonstrated, “bitcoiners view proof-of-work as a superior way of securing the network.”\n\n(For more on the merge, watch our interview with Shin on the CNN Business Nightcap show.)\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: 6%\n\nOuch.\n\nMortgage rates just passed the 6% mark, hitting their highest level since 2008. (In other words, the last time mortgage rates were this high, the US was deep in a recession and financial crisis.)\n\nBorrowing costs have shot up in response to the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes, aimed at cooling inflation that’s been stubbornly hovering around 40-year-highs for months.\n\nIt’s an especially painful time for prospective buyers, as home prices remain elevated, inventory is low, and the costs of day to day living make it hard to save for a down payment.\n\nHOLD UP\n\nThe freight rail crisis is averted — at least for now.\n\nUnions and management negotiated late into the night, finally striking a tentative deal to avoid a work stoppage around 2:30 am Eastern, capping some 20 hours of talks that as recently as yesterday appeared to be deadlocked.\n\nJust to underscore the seriousness of the potential strike, President Joe Biden personally called negotiators Wednesday night, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nUnions representing tens of thousands of conductors and engineers threatened to walk off the job at the end of this week if they couldn’t secure some frankly pretty basic work-life balance guarantees from their employers. The workers who operate America’s freight trains were at their breaking point, often working 14 days in a row, with no sick days (paid or unpaid) and constant fear of termination if they miss work for medical reasons.\n\nA strike would have been economically devastating, hurting consumers, businesses and farmers for America’s battered supply chains, potentially leading to shortages of gas, food and consumer goods, and forcing commuter rails to suspend service.\n\nHere’s what we know so far about the deal:\n\nUnion members get an immediate 14% raise, back pay and bonuses. In total, it amounts to an average of $11,000 per worker.\n\nThe major sticking points around scheduling appeared to go in the unions’ favor. Per Biden’s statement: “These rail workers will get better pay, improved working conditions, and peace of mind around their health care costs — all hard-earned.”\n\nThe tentative agreement will exempt “time off for certain medical events from carrier attendance policies,” two of the unions said in a joint statement.\n\nWorkers will, for the first time ever, be able to take time off for medical care, according to the unions.\n\nBut medical time off won’t be paid. And it’s only two days a year. After that allotment is used up, taking time off will result in penalties under a points-based system that can ultimately lead to termination.\n\nDon’t rule out a strike yet…\n\nThe agreement still needs to be ratified by rank-and-file union members, many of whom have balked at the idea of concessions. The unions have agreed not to strike while votes are being tallied, which means the negotiators have bought themselves a couple of weeks.\n\nA unit of the Machinists union that has 5,000 members already voted to reject the Thursday’s deal, though it will try to seek a new deal by the end of the month.\n\nAnd, as my colleague Chris Isidore explains, there have been several recent high-profile examples of angry union members voting no on proposed resolutions.\n\nA year ago, about 10,000 workers at John Deere went on strike after rejecting a lucrative tentative agreement. Similarly, workers at Kellogg continued to strike in December after negotiators thought they’d reached a settlement.\n\nEnjoying Nightcap?

In the northernmost section of the reef, which had been considered the most \"pristine,\" some 67% of the coral died.\n\nThe good news, scientists said, was that central and southern sections of the reef fared far better, with \"only\" 6% and 1% of the coral dead, respectively.\n\nCoral reefs result from the work of little polyps, creatures only a few millimeters long, budded on top of one another. Over centuries, the shells of these creatures combine to form the exotic shapes of coral reefs. Tiny differences in the anatomy of each polyp species affect the shape of their shells and produce the exotic shapes of each reef.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe vibrant colors that draw thousands of tourists to the Great Barrier Reef each year come from algae that live in the corals tissue. When water temperatures become too high, coral becomes stressed and expels the algae, which leave the coral a bleached white color.\n\nMass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up.\n\nBesides their beauty, reefs shelter land from storms, and are also a habitat for myriads of species.\n\n\"Coral reefs are therefore the most biologically diverse ecosystems of the planet, and provide a number of ecosystem services that hundreds of millions of people rely on,\" said Greg Torda, also of the Centre, in an e-mail to USA TODAY.\n\n\"These include provisioning (fishing, other types of harvesting, for pharmaceuticals, for example), coastal protection, aesthetic and cultural values – to name a few. If corals are lost, so are all the services they provide to humans; and so are all the species that directly or indirectly rely on them.\"\n\nTourism on the Great Barrier Reef employs 70,000 people, and generates $5 billion (Australian) in income each year, the Centre said in a statement.\n\nThe good news is that much of the coral survived this bleaching event. But looking to the future, mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef will likely be an annual phenomenon within a decade, Torda said.\n\nIf all the coral died on the reef, “it would be among the largest mass extinction events in history,” said Torda.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/04/22/florida-aquarium-breeds-ridged-cactus-coral-help-save-coral-reefs/3003867001/", "title": "Florida Aquarium breeds ridged cactus coral, may help save coral ...", "text": "A species of coral reef has been bred in human care for the first time, a breakthrough that scientists in Florida say may help slow the decline of coral reef die-off.\n\nThe ridged cactus coral – part of the world's third-largest coral barrier reef system in Florida, or \"America's Great Barrier Reef\" – reproduced for the first known time in a lab setting at the Florida Aquarium in Tampa.\n\nThe species is one of many corals facing widespread destruction off Florida and in the Caribbean due to disease, said senior coral scientist at the aquarium Keri O'Neil.\n\nO'Neil said the hope is that the coral reproduced at the aquarium can one day be reintroduced into the ocean and reproduce to help stave off extinction.\n\nIn preserving coral reefs, maintaining a diversity of species is important, O'Neil said.\n\n\"What makes a coral reef unique – all of these different species have slightly different shapes and growth forms and that what makes the coral reef so complex,\" she said.\n\nThe research is part of a larger project in partnership with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\n\nCorals at increased risk due to the disease outbreak – known as stony coral tissue loss disease – have been taken out of the wild and brought to accredited aquariums primarily to protect them.\n\nIt has also given researchers the chance to study corals and their reproduction that they otherwise know little about.\n\nLast August, researchers at the aquarium were able to get Atlantic Ocean coral to reproduce in human care, also a world first.\n\nWith the ridged cactus coral, O'Neil said a lot is unknown. She and her team were unsure when exactly it would reproduce and what the offspring would look like. They knew the larvae would likely be released overnight so they designed collectors to catch them they could check each morning.\n\nWhen O'Neil saw the first one, she said she wasn't even sure it was a larva.\n\n\"I saw these sort of eggplant shaped things that were just very slowly moving but changing shapes,\" she recalled, thinking, \" 'Wait, that moves like a coral larva.' \"\n\n\"I feel silly working with coral for 20 years and being unsure,\" she added. \"But it was that new of a thing. You don't get those moments very often.\"\n\nO'Neil also noticed a pore that would become the mouth of the coral after it settled. It's those mouths that the larvae come out of when they're born – a process the aquarium captured on video, O'Neil said.\n\n\"It's probably quite a stressful process to pop these little babies out of your mouth,\" she said.\n\nSince the first larva was collected a few weeks ago, O'Neil said they've counted at least 350 larvae, 36 of which have successfully settled and developed into a little coral polyp, the individual coral organism of which many can create a reef.\n\n\"To me the most exciting part of the work that they're doing is the fact that they're being successful with these corals,\" said Pamela Muller, a professor of geological oceanography at the University of South Florida who studies coral reefs.\n\nAlthough not the most common or the most important species in terms of building coral reefs, the ridged cactus coral can play a role in making reefs resistant to waves, Muller said. The research may also help scientists better understand sexual reproduction among corals in general which can be applied to other species.\n\n\"They're learning all the time about things that will help them be successful with major reef builders,\" Muller added.\n\nThe team is still collecting offspring, even amid the coronavirus pandemic, and they're not sure when the reproduction will stop, O'Neil said. They've limited the number of people in their labs at a given time, so they're relying on video calls to share updates.\n\n\"We're trying to share our joy digitally,\" O'Neil said.\n\nGiven the larvae's large size, O'Neil is hopeful they will survive when introduced to a reef restoration or coral nursery sites.\n\n\"Our resolve to save Florida’s endangered coral reefs continues, and this historic breakthrough by our coral experts, our second in eight months, provides additional hope for the future of all coral reefs in our backyard and around the globe,\" Roger Germann, the aquarium's president and CEO, said in a statement.\n\nFor any species to survive such a massive threat like the disease outbreak corals face, evolution and adaption are needed, O'Neil said. And that can't happen without new combinations of genes and sexual reproduction for corals.\n\n\"Every time I see a new species reproduce, I have a ... renewed energy and hope that what we are doing can actually save corals from extinction,\" O'Neil said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/28/world/un-great-barrier-reef-coral-climate/index.html", "title": "Great Barrier Reef should be placed on the 'in danger' list, UN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef should be added to the list of world heritage sites that are “in danger”, a team of scientists concluded after conducting a mission to the world’s largest coral reef system.\n\nIn a new UN-backed report released on Monday, the scientists said that the reef is facing major threats due to the climate crisis and that action to save it needs to be taken “with upmost urgency.”\n\n“The mission team concludes that the property is faced with major threats that could have deleterious effects on its inherent characteristics, and therefore meets the criteria for inscription on the list of World Heritage in danger,” the report said.\n\nThe 10-day monitoring mission by UNESCO scientists in March came months after the World Heritage Committee made an initial recommendation to list Australia’s Great Barrier Reef as “in danger” due to the accelerating impacts of human-caused climate change.\n\nAt the time, the agency called on Australia to “urgently” address the worsening threats of the climate crisis, but received immediate pushback from the Australian government under former Prime Minister Scott Morrison.\n\nThe long-anticipated final mission report lays out key steps that the scientists say need to be taken urgently, though the report itself was published after a six-month delay. Originally scheduled to be released in May before UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee meeting in Russia, the report was postponed due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nThe recommendations include slashing greenhouse gas emissions, reassessing proposed projects and credit schemes, and scaling up financial resources to ultimately protect the reefs.\n\nAustralia’s environment minister Tanya Plibersek argued in a press conference Tuesday that the UNESCO report unfairly puts the spotlight on the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n“Yes, climate change is a risk to ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef but that means it’s a risk to every reef globally,” Plibersek said. “There is no need to single the Great Barrier Reef out in this way.”\n\nJumbo Aerial Photography/Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority/AP\n\nSpanning nearly 133,000 square miles and home to more than 1,500 species of fish and over 400 species of hard corals, the Great Barrier Reef is an extremely critical marine ecosystem on the Earth.\n\nIt also contributes $4.8 billion annually to Australia’s economy and supports 64,000 jobs in tourism, fishing and research, according to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.\n\nBut as the planet continues to warm, because of the growing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the reef’s long-term survival has come into question. Warming oceans and acidification caused by the climate crisis have led to widespread coral bleaching. Last year, scientists found the global extent of living coral has declined by half since 1950 due to climate change, overfishing and pollution.\n\nThe outlook is similarly grim, with scientists predicting that about 70% to 90% of all living coral around the world will disappear in the next 20 years. The Great Barrier Reef, in particular, has suffered many devastating mass bleaching events since 2015, caused by extremely warm ocean temperatures brought by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas.\n\nDuring the UNESCO monitoring missions, reef managers found that the Great Barrier Reef is suffering its sixth mass bleaching event due to heat stress caused by climate change. Aerial surveys of around 750 reefs show widespread bleaching across the reef, with the most severe bleaching observed in northern and central areas.\n\nBleaching happens when stressed coral is deprived of its food source. With worsening conditions, the corals can starve and die, turning white as its carbonate skeleton is exposed.\n\n“Even the most robust corals require nearly a decade to recover,” Jodie Rummer, associate professor of Marine Biology at James Cook University in Townsville, previously told CNN. “So we’re really losing that window of recovery. We’re getting back-to-back bleaching events, back-to-back heat waves. And, and the corals just aren’t adapting to these new conditions.”\n\nWeeks before the mission, global scientists with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released an alarming report concluding that with every extreme warming event, the planet’s vital ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef are being pushed more toward tipping points beyond which irreversible changes can happen.\n\nAs researchers on the mission assessed the dire state of one of the world’s seven natural wonders, they witnessed how the climate crisis has drastically changed the coral reef system.\n\nFollowing publication of the report, Professor Lesley Hughes from the Climate Council, said limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius along with “deep and rapid emissions cuts this decade” are necessary to give the reef “a fighting chance.”\n\nA decision on whether the reef should be officially labeled as “in danger” will be made by the World Heritage Committee next year, once UNESCO compiles a more thorough report that will include responses from the Australian federal and state governments.", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez Tara Subramaniam", "Rachel Ramirez", "Tara Subramaniam"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/asia/china-navy-aircraft-carrier-analysis-intl-hnk-ml-dst/index.html", "title": "China's new aircraft carrier: Never mind the Fujian, these are the ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nChina made a big statement about its naval ambitions with the recent launch of its third and most advanced aircraft carrier.\n\nThe Fujian – by far China’s biggest, most modern and most powerful aircraft carrier to date – is the 80,000-ton jewel in the crown of a military expansion that has seen Beijing grow its navy into the world’s largest.\n\nIts new combat systems – such as an electromagnetic catapult-assisted launch system – show China is fast catching up with the United States, experts say, and will give it the ability to launch more aircraft, more quickly, and with more ammunition.\n\nThat should be enough to give any would-be opponent pause for thought, especially given China’s increasing aggression in its territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea, a host of Southeast Asian nations in the South China Sea, and its repeated harassment of the self-governed island of Taiwan – where it has pointedly refused to rule out an invasion.\n\nChina's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, at Jiangnan Shipyard on June 17. Li Tang/VCG/Getty Images\n\nStill, while the launch of the Fujian amid much fanfare was clearly meant as a message to Beijing’s rivals, analysts caution against swallowing too much of the hype just yet.\n\nFirstly, the Fujian likely won’t be operational for another three to four years, said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center. And even when it is operational, its size will make it an obvious target – any enemy will be keenly aware that sinking such an iconic vessel would be as much of a morale blow as a military disaster for China.\n\nThe launch ceremony for China's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, at Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, on June 17. Li Tang/VCG/Getty Images\n\nThen there is the simple fact that, impressive as they seem, aircraft carriers aren’t necessarily best suited to what experts see as the most plausible conflict scenarios in the near future – including clashes in the East and South China Seas and an invasion of Taiwan.\n\nEssentially, experts say, the Fujian might be China’s biggest ship, but it’s probably not the biggest problem on the minds of US naval commanders right now.\n\nHere are four types of ship at China’s disposal that arguably pose a far greater threat to US naval dominance.\n\nChina's type 055 guided-missile destroyer Nanchang in the Western Pacific on October 19, 2021. Sun Zifa/China News Service/Getty Images\n\nType 055 destroyer\n\nLaunched in 2017, these 13,000-ton stealth guided-missile destroyers are considered by many to be the most powerful surface combatants in the world.\n\nThe Type 055, big enough to be considered a cruiser by NATO standards, is equipped with 112 vertical launch tubes that can used to fire everything from anti-ship missiles to long-range land-attack missiles.\n\n“This ship in particular has a sophisticated design, stealth features, radars, and a large missile inventory. It is larger and more powerful than most US, Japanese, and South Korean destroyers,” RAND Corp. senior analyst Timothy Heath told CNN in 2018, when Beijing launched two of the warships in a single day – a testament to China’s impressive shipbuilding capabilities.\n\nA US Congressional Research Service report in March said at least 10 Type 055s are thought to have been launched or are under construction.\n\nThe deployment of the Lhasa, the second of Beijing’s five active Type 055s, to the Sea of Japan for drills amid growing tensions over Taiwan, was championed by China’s state-run Global Times tabloid last week.\n\n“The ship has achieved full operational capability and demonstrated its capabilities in deterring possible foreign military interference in the Taiwan Strait at a time when the US and Japan have been repeatedly provoking China over the Taiwan question,” the Global Times reported.\n\nThe potency of the Type 055 was underlined in footage that emerged on social media in April. It showed one launching what naval analyst H I Sutton said was a hypersonic YJ-21 anti-ship ballistic missile – a weapon often referred to as a “carrier killer.”\n\nGlobal Times played down the footage, describing the missiles as part of the country’s defensive strategy.\n\n“If the US does not make military provocations against China, including over the Taiwan question, it does not need to worry about the missiles,” it said.\n\nChina's Liaoning aircraft carrier is accompanied by navy frigates and submarines during an exercise in the South China Sea. Li Gang/AP\n\nType 039 submarine\n\nThese Yuan-class submarines are almost silent diesel-electric-powered boats with capabilities that could prove tough for US military planners to deal with.\n\nBeijing has built 17 of the Type 39A/B subs, with plans to increase that total to 25 in the next three years, according to the US Defense Department’s 2021 report to Congress on China’s military power.\n\n“The Type 039 SSs provide formidable ‘defense in depth’” in waters close to China, “and they appear to be developing some capability to engage” US forces farther out to sea, Schuster said.\n\nThe subs are equipped with air independent propulsion (AIP), which means they do not need to surface as frequently to get the air required for diesel combustion, which can then power their batteries.\n\n“When operating on batteries, AIP-equipped submarines are almost silent, with the only noise coming from the shaft bearings, propeller, and flow around the hull,” US Navy officers Michael Walker and Austin Krusz wrote in a 2018 report for the US Naval Institute’s Proceedings magazine.\n\nChina is pushing to launch more of the super-quiet subs, which are armed with anti-ship cruise missiles, the Defense Department report said.\n\nOne potent method of attack used by the Type 039 is to fire a “wake-homing” torpedo across the stern, or back, of a target vessel. The torpedo then follows in the wake of the target ship before exploding near its propulsion and steering systems.\n\nBecause surface ships detect submarines and torpedoes by sound waves, wake-homing torpedoes are particularly tough to defend against.\n\nThe advances in Chinese submarines come just as the US Navy is experiencing trouble with its anti-submarine capabilities.\n\nChief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday told Congress last month that the service wants to scrap nine of its littoral combat ships, some of the newest ships in the US fleet, because their anti-submarine systems “did not work out technically.”\n\nA merchant ferry at Yantai Port in Shandong province of China. Tang Ke/VCG/Getty Images\n\nMerchant ferries\n\nMerchant ferries might not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think about deadly naval capabilities – but therein lies their power.\n\nTo invade Taiwan, China would likely need to transport an invading force of hundreds of thousands of men – some analysts have suggested more than a million would be needed.\n\nVarious analysts – and US government reports – have concluded the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) naval fleet is not up to that task.\n\nBut what China does have is a massive fleet of civilian ferries that could be swiftly converted for military use – and according to some, may even have been designed for just that possibility.\n\n“China’s biggest ferry shipbuilder stated publicly in 2015 that one of its largest roll-on/roll-off ferries was built for dual military and civilian purposes, and one of China’s largest ferry operators has been similarly described as having a dual civil-military development philosophy,” Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine commander now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, wrote in a 2021 essay for War on the Rocks.\n\nHe added that civilian ferry companies operating in the Yellow and South China Seas have already been organized into PLA auxiliary units.\n\nCrunching the numbers, said Shugart, was staggering. He estimated that using civilian ships would give China an extra 1.1 million displacement tonnes. That figure is more than three times the displacement tonnage of all of China’s amphibious assault ships put together. And if China tapped Hong Kong’s roll-on/roll-off vehicle carriers it could gain an extra 370,000 tonnes of sealift, according to Shugart.\n\nIs that enough to take Taiwan by force?\n\nThat is hard to know. But Shugart said it did answer one question.\n\n“How many transport (ships) does the Chinese military have? Very probably, more than you might think.”\n\nChinese vessels moored at Whitsun Reef in the South China Sea in 2021. AP\n\nMaritime militia\n\nFerries aren’t the only supposedly civilian vessels military planners have on their radars.\n\nExperts also accuse China of creating a maritime militia, made up of more than a hundred vessels supposedly engaged in commercial fishing, to enforce its wishes in disputed seas.\n\nThe militia – which Beijing denies even exists – is made up of at least 122 vessels and likely as many as 174, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBut the actual number could be even greater. Various experts suspected the militia’s involvement when more than 200 Chinese fishing boats crowded the waters around Whitsun Reef in the South China Sea in early 2021. The reef is claimed by both China and the Philippines, which described the presence of the boats as a “clear provocative action.”\n\n“The People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia don’t fish,” Schuster told CNN last year. “They have automatic weapons aboard and reinforced hulls, making them very dangerous at close range. Also, they have a top speed of around 18-22 knots, making them faster than 90% of the world’s fishing boats.”\n\nThe militia has two main parts: professional militia boats and actual fishing boats employed by the Chinese military under a subsidy scheme, according to a November report from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nThe professionals lead such activities as harassing foreign drilling ships or blocking foreign fishing boats, and the subsidized fishers bring pressure in numbers, the CSIS report said.\n\nAnd with the world’s largest fishing fleet, China has plenty of reserves to call on.\n\nAbout that carrier again\n\nStill, none of this is to say that the launch of the Fujian is not a significant moment.\n\nAs in the US, aircraft carriers will in time become the centerpiece of the PLA’s navy – and a symbol of what the modern Chinese military is capable of, Schuster said.\n\n“Fujian’s launch should be viewed for what it portends rather than its limited immediate impact,” Schuster said.\n\n“China has now launched three carriers and brought two into full operational status during a period where the US Navy has struggled to bring one new unit to full operational status,” he said.\n\nSchuster was referring to the USS Gerald Ford, a supercarrier that has been plagued by problems since its commissioning in 2017 (by which time it was already three years late).\n\nThe supercarrier is yet to make its first operational deployment, though that is expected this fall.\n\nMeanwhile, China forges ahead.\n\n“They are building their navy at a faster rate than the US and all of its allies,” Schuster said.\n\n“Imperfect, but a good foundation.”", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2013/08/20/biggest-national-parks-wilderness-reserves/2671233/", "title": "World's biggest, baddest national parks", "text": "Megan Taylor Morrison\n\nTheActiveTimes.com\n\nWhat do you imagine when you hear the word \"wilderness?\" Odds are your vision involves pristine rivers and lakes, untouched swaths of land and the possibility to go for weeks or months on end without seeing another living soul (but plenty of wildlife, of course).\n\nWhile there are numerous incredible protected areas around the globe, size matters when it comes to getting away from it all. This is why we decided to take a look at the biggest, baddest national parks on the planet. These are the places where you can truly escape and travel for hundreds -- or thousands -- of miles through backcountry ranging from African savanna to alpine meadows.\n\nOf course, when speaking of these huge protected areas, using the word \"national park\" is a bit misleading. While some -- such as the only American destination to make the list -- fall under this category, others are called \"reserves\" or \"conservation areas,\" among other titles. The diversity continues from there. While the entirety of some wilderness areas falls in one country, others span several to create massive, trans-boundary escapes. To further differentiate, some protected areas are marine parks, while others are some of the most arid regions of the world. Still, they all have one thing in common: They preserve the idea of wilderness better than any other spot on the planet simply based on their sheer size. Nowhere else on Earth can you wander so far without the sights or sound of civilization.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that, in recent years, some protected areas have been expanding thanks to the work of International Peace Parks in North America, Europe and Asia, as well as efforts by Transfrontier Conservation Areas in southern Africa.\n\nExpanding the wilderness across country borders has numerous positive impacts. For instance, large mammal herds can migrate over their historic territory regardless of political borders and governments can boost eco-tourism by allowing visitors to cross areas covering several countries without legal concerns.\n\nWhile none of the Transfrontier Parks made this list, Peace Parks include the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park and the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. Odds are, the world's largest parks will shift over the next several decades as these organizations begin to play a greater role in conservation.\n\n1. Northeast Greenland National Park, Greenland\n\nSize: 927,000 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 1974\n\nWhen Denmark decided to establish a wilderness area in its protectorate Greenland, the country did it once and did it right. The only national park on the world's largest island is bigger than all but 30 countries. Forty percent of the world's musk ox population, as well as polar bears, walrus, arctic fox, snowy owls and numerous other species call this place home. If you want to visit, make sure to plan your trip and pack carefully. This area stays in near-darkness for four months out of the year and summer temperatures are rarely above 40 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n2. Chagos Marine Protected Area, British Indian Ocean Territory\n\nSize: 640,000 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 2010\n\nThis marine reserve, located in the central Indian Ocean, is twice the size of the UK and protects the world's largest coral atoll and one of the most pristine reefs in the world. Thanks to a generous donation from the Bertarelli Foundation (funded by Italian-born Swiss billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli), the policing of this no-take protected area will be funded through 2015. The Chagos Archipelago comprises 55 tiny islands home to 20 species of coral, 784 different species of fish, green and Hawksbill turtles, 18 species of birds, and the world's largest terrestrial arthropod: the coconut crab.\n\n3. Phoenix Islands Protected Area, Kiribati\n\nSize: 408,250 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 2008\n\nAlthough this protected area is roughly the size of California, its total land area is just 9.7 square miles. PIPA includes all eight atolls and low reef islands of the Kiribati section of the Phoenix Islands, and its abundance of extinct underwater volcanoes provide a variety of marine habitats. Conservation International named the Phoenix Islands as a Key Biodiversity Area and five of the eight islands were named Important Bird Areas by Birdlife International. This area is home to what is believed to be the the largest concentrations of some species in the world, including the vulnerable white-throated (Polynesian) storm-petrel, lesser frigatebird and blue noddy.\n\n4. Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, Hawaii and the Midway Atoll\n\nSize: 360,000 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 2006\n\nPapahanaumokuakea became the first mixed UNESCO World Heritage Site when it made the list on July 30, 2010. The unique nomination recognized the area's significant biological and cultural importance. Indigenous Hawaiians navigated these waters for thousands of years and modern Hawaiians still travel through the area in traditional double-hulled sailing canoes for navigational training. In addition, Papahanaumokuakea is a nesting and foraging ground for 14 million seabirds and one of the last predator-dominated coral reef ecosystems on Earth with an abundance of sharks and jacks.\n\nThis protected area includes ten islands and atolls in the northwest main Hawaiian Archipelago and includes the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, Battle of Midway National Memorial, Hawaii State Seabird Sanctuary at Kure Atoll and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands State Marine Refuge.\n\n5. Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia\n\nSize: 345,400 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 1975\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef (and largest living structure) on the planet, and was elected a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1981. The marine park includes 3,000 coral reefs, 600 continental islands, 300 coral cays and approximately 150 inshore mangrove islands. Home to 1,500 species of fish, 4,000 types of mollusk and endangered species including the dugong and the large green turtle, this area is of significant scientific interest and biological importance.\n\n6. Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe\n\nSize: 287,132 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 2010\n\nThis extensive network of parks (also called KAZA) provides vital transfrontier wildlife corridors for species such as lion, zebra, wildebeest and Africa's largest contigous elephant populations. KAZA includes 17 different game and national parks including Victoria Falls National Park (pictured) and Zambezi National Park.\n\n7. Galápagos Marine Reserve, Ecuador\n\nSize: 133,000 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 1986\n\nWhen Charles Darwin first visited the Galápagos in 1835, he was struck by how much species varied from island to island. In fact, his observations of the different iguanas, tortoises and -- in particular -- finches during his initial five-week visit inspired his theory of evolution. Found at the confluence of three ocean currents, the Galápagos has a unique mix of marine species, such as sharks and rays. In addition, the unique altitude, orientation and extreme isolation of the islands led to the evolution of an unusual array of terrestrial wildlife. The Galápagos boasts many different reptiles including lizards, geckos and 11 subspecies of giant tortoises. With the exception of two marine tortoises, these reptiles are all endemic. Notable birds include a vast array of Darwin's finches, the Galápagos flightless cormorant, Galápagos penguin and lava gull.\n\n8. Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe\n\nSize: 99,800 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 2002\n\nGreat Limpopo Transfrontier Park covers regions of Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe, creating a transborder wilderness including some of the most established wildlife areas in Southern Africa such as Kruger National Park and Limpopo National Park.

He called the results \"quite shocking.\"\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest reef, and is made up of over 2,900 individual reefs on 900 islands in the Pacific Ocean off of Queensland, Australia. It extends for some 1,400 miles.\n\nSo far, the Great Barrier Reef has experienced four mass bleaching events due\n\nto global warming, in 1998, 2002, and back-to-back in 2016 and 2017.\n\nWarmer, more acidic ocean water is the cause of the bleaching, Pieter Tans, chief greenhouse gas scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said last year. The bleaching occurs when algae that live inside and nourish coral, which provides their brilliant colors, wither from the warming waters and die, leaving behind white coral skeletons.\n\nCoral reefs:At severe risk as world's oceans become more acidic\n\n\"Coral bleaching is a stress response caused by exposure of coral reefs to elevated ocean temperatures,\" study co-author Andrew Baird, also of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said last year. \"When bleaching is severe and prolonged, many of the corals die.\"\n\nThe study released Wednesday \"shows that reef resilience is now severely compromised by global warming,\" Baird said.\n\nBleaching has affected almost every coral reef on the planet, and scientists predict that the gap between pairs of coral bleaching events will continue to shrink as global warming intensifies.\n\nMore:Coral reefs save billions of dollars worldwide by preventing floods\n\nA 2018 study found that in the early 20th century, there was an average of two marine heat waves per year globally, but now there are three or four, the CBC said.\n\n“This means a marine ecosystem that used to experience 30 days of extreme heat per year in the early 20th century is now experiencing 45 marine heatwave days per year,” Eric Oliver of Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia reported last year.\n\nWednesday's study was published in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/state/2024/01/23/coral-reef-florida-largest-ever-discovered/72309301007/", "title": "Giant coral reef off Florida is world's largest, bigger than Vermont", "text": "Three-quarters of the world's oceans are still unmapped with much detail. But as our technology improves, researchers can see more and more of what's hidden beneath the inky depths.\n\nSuch as, say, the world's biggest deep-sea coral reef sitting off the coast of Florida.\n\n\"It's essentially the largest deep-sea coral mound region in the world that's been documented so far,\" Derek Sowers, the Mapping Operations Manager for the Ocean Exploration Trust and lead author of the study, told USA TODAY. \"It's just this amazing, huge ecosystem, sprawling across an area about three times the size of Yellowstone National Park.\"\n\nA paper published by the scientific journal, Geomatics, details efforts over the last few years by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its partners to explore the Blake Plateau.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nHow big is the newly discovered deep-sea coral reef?\n\nThe reef stretches from Miami to Charleston, South Carolina, about 100 miles off the southeast U.S. coastline. It is about 310.69 miles long and reaches up 68.35 miles wide at points, NOAA said, taking up about 6.4 million acres. The nearly continuous coral mound has a core area of high-density mounds up to 158 miles long and 26 miles wide.\n\nIn comparison, the state of Vermont is 6.1 million acres, according to the U.S. Forestry Service.\n\nThe coral mounds extend across much of the Blake Plateau, an area between the North American continental shelf and the deep ocean basin along the southeastern U.S. up to North Carolina.\n\nWhy didn't we know there was a massive coral reef off the coast of Florida?\n\nThe reef is also 100 miles out, at depths ranging from 65 feet down to 3,280 feet. Scientists have known since the 1960s that there was some coral in that area of the Atlantic Ocean but they had no idea how much since it was impossible to dive that far down.\n\n\"About 75% of the world's oceans are still unmapped in high resolution, and about 50% of the U.S. waters are currently unmapped,\" said Sowers.\n\nHow did researchers find the new coral reef?\n\nOur technology got better.\n\nAn area nearly the size of Florida was mapped with 31 multi-beam sonars to make 3D images of the seafloor of the Blake Plateau, according to NOAA.\n\n\"The multi-beam sonars are mounted on research ships,\" Derek Sowers, the Mapping Operations Manager for the Ocean Exploration Trust and lead author of the study, told USA TODAY. \"That's how we can map this type of habitat.\"\n\nWith the maps as a guide, a submersible with manned or remotely operated subs could be sent down to send live video feeds back up.\n\n\"This strategic multiyear and multi-agency effort to systematically map and characterize the stunning coral ecosystem right on the doorstep of the U.S. East Coast is a perfect example of what we can accomplish when we pool resources and focus on exploring the approximately 50% of U.S. marine waters that are still unmapped,\" Sowers said.\n\nWhat did scientists find in the new deep-sea coral reef?\n\nThe mound region is made up of cold-water coral mounds, which are corals \"shaped like bumps or pinnacles on the seafloor and can range in height from about ten feet to hundreds of feet tall, but average about 65 feet tall on the Blake Plateau,\" said Sowers in an email. \"They are formed over long time periods out of the skeletal material of cold-water 'stony corals' and also sediments that are trapped by the coral rubble material.\"\n\nAccording to NOAA, the largest area of the reef, which has been nicknamed \"Million Mounds\" by scientists, is mainly made up of stony coral or Desmophyllum pertusum. The cold-water species is mainly found in the ocean at 656 to 3,280 feet deep and survives by filter-feeding biological particles.\n\nHow is this coral reef different from Florida's Coral Reef?\n\nFlorida's Coral Reef, the only coral reef system in the continental United States and the third-largest barrier reef ecosystem in the world, is a shallow-water reef. This deep-sea one is biologically different, Sowers said, because the corals are out of reach of sunlight and in water that's on average 39 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\"They don't rely on photosynthesis because they're actually living in the dark,\" said Sowers. \"But they do rely on filter-feeding particles that are coming down through the water column, and they capture those particles and bring them in.\"\n\nBecause it's farther down, deep-sea reefs don't have the same problem with coral bleaching, coral that turns white from stress from environmental changes such as climate change and recent record-high temperatures, leaving them susceptible to disease or starvation.\n\nHappy Coral Reef Awareness Week!What you need to know about Florida’s Coral Reef\n\nDeep-water reefs do still face dangers from climate change, however. \"Climate change and the changing water temperatures and acidity of the ocean can also impact these reefs and is something that we need to try to manage in the future so we can keep these ecosystems functioning,\" said Sowers.\n\nDeep-sea corals are still poorly understood, NOAA said, but studying them can provide insight into their health and resiliency which can help scientists predict \"the impacts of human activities on coral communities\" and help with \"developing solid plans for their protection.\"\n\nWhy are coral reefs important?\n\nCoral reefs are both beautiful and utterly vital to the ocean ecosystem and the local environment. They provide homes, food and breeding sites for millions of marine plants and animals, including the fish we eat. They offer important resources we've used to fight cancer, pain and inflammation. They help protect shorelines from extreme weather, erosion and flooding, and they provide income through fishing and tourism for millions of people, supporting over $6.3 billion in tourism revenue, according to Darren Soto, D-Kissimmee.\n\nCoral reefs cover only a tiny area of the ocean floor — about 1% of the total marine habitat — but, like bustling cities, they provide homes and life to a wide variety of life.\n\n\"Coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse and valuable ecosystems on Earth,\" according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. \"An estimated 25 percent of all marine life, including over 4,000 species of fish, are dependent on coral reefs at some point in their life cycle. An estimated 1 billion people worldwide benefit from the many ecosystem services coral reefs provide including food, coastal protection, and income from tourism and fisheries.\"\n\nAnd reefs help protect the coast, the first line of defense for a state that gets slammed with hurricanes and tropical storms every year. \"Florida’s Coral Reef provides more than $355 million per year in flood protection benefits to buildings,\" the FDEP said on the floridascoralreef.org website, \"and protects nearly $320 million in annual economic activity.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/11/14/coral-colony-solomon-islands-video/76302319007/", "title": "Scientists discover world's largest coral colony: Watch as divers ...", "text": "National Geographic scientists recently discovered the world's largest coral colony in the southwest Pacific Ocean, deemed the \"mega\" coral.\n\nThe National Geographic Society's Pristine Seas team discovered the 112-foot wide, 105-foot long and 18-foot high colony during an October expedition in the Solomon Islands, an archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean. The colony is bigger than a blue whale, the world's largest animal.\n\nLocated 42 feet under water, the coral colony is visible from space, but until the recent discovery, scientists thought it may be the remnants of shipwreck. That was until Pristine Seas underwater cinematographer Manu San Félix dove down to take a closer look.\n\n\"Finding this mega coral is like discovering the tallest tree on earth,\" Enric Sala, Pristine Seas founder, told National Geographic. \"This discovery rekindles our sense of awe and wonder about the ocean.\"\n\nScientists believe the coral colony is around 300 years old, but it could be older.\n\nPrior to this discovery, the \"Big Momma\" coral head near American Samoa was thought to be the world's largest coral colony. Big Momma is more than 500 years old and nearly 20 feet high, according to the National Marine Sanctuaries.\n\nWhat is a coral colony?\n\nA coral colony is a group of coral polyps — small, soft invertebrate — that live and grow together. The \"mega\" colony is made up of nearly one billion polyps, according to National Geographic. Corals are animals related to jellyfish and sea anemones.\n\nThe mega colony is a part of the Pavona clavus species. This species is often referred to as shoulder blade coral because its columns look like shoulders.\n\nA coral colony should not to be confused with a coral reef, which is a collection of coral colonies.\n\nWhat does the 'mega' coral colony look like?\n\nThe newly-discovered coral colony, according to National Geographic, is mostly brown with hints of bright yellows, blues and reds.\n\nTypically, coral colonies like this one are dome-shaped, similar to an ice cream scoop, Molly Timmers, the expedition's lead scientist, said. But this one is flat and sprawling.\n\nThe colony is home to juvenile reef fish, crabs and other reef invertebrates, according to National Geographic.\n\n“Coral reefs are like bustling underwater cities, supporting a quarter of all marine life on our planet,\" Ronnie Posala, Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources officer, said in a news release. \"What many people don’t realize is that corals, though appearing as simple rocks, are actually living creatures that build these incredible habitats. They also act as the first line of defense for coastal communities, buffering against powerful waves and storms.”\n\nA concern for the colony's future\n\nDespite the newfound excitement, scientists are concerned for the colony's future.\n\nGlobal warming, overfishing, pollution, urban and agricultural development and ocean acidification are just a few of the factors harming coral colonies around the world, according to National Geographic.\n\nOcean acidification is when the ocean's pH level decreases due to absorbed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Corals use calcium carbonate from the water to create their skeleton, so when the water becomes more acidic, this process is made more difficult.\n\nWhen corals are under stress by favors such as these, they bleach — corals expel algae that live in their tissues, causing them to turn white. According to the Office for Coastal Management, more than 75% of the world's corals were bleached during the largest global bleaching event recorded, between 2014-2017.\n\nThough the newly-discovered colony appears healthy, its surroundings are not.\n\nWhen the Pristine Seas expedition team surveyed the area around the \"mega\" colony, they mostly found corals that had died off, according to National Geographic.\n\nHowever, a high reproductive rate is in the colony's favor. Polyps that form on coral colonies come from larvae that settle on the seafloor and multiple, which is how corals reproduce.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

The report’s authors say these impacts are happening much faster and are more disruptive and widespread than scientists expected 20 years ago.\n\nThe authors point to enormous inequities in the climate crisis, finding that those who contribute the least to the problem are the worst affected, and warn of irreversible impacts if the world exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming.\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres called the report “an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership,” and he warned that “delay means death.”\n\n“The facts are undeniable. This abdication of leadership is criminal,” Guterres said in a statement. “The world’s biggest polluters are guilty of arson of our only home.”\n\nHe also said that “current events” showed the world was too reliant of fossil fuels, calling them “a dead end,” in an apparent reference to the Ukraine conflict and energy crisis.\n\nHere are the report’s key takeaways:\n\nWarming beyond 1.5 degrees could have irreversible consequences\n\nBleaching of the coral reefs around French Polynesia in 2019. Alexis Rosenfeld/Getty Images\n\nScientists have warned for decades warming needs to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.\n\nMonday’s report, from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), showed if that limit is breached, some changes will be irreversible for hundreds — if not thousands — of years. And some changes may be permanent, even if the planet cools back down.\n\nThe world is already 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than before industrialization, according to the IPCC’s estimate, which is considered conservative. We are now rapidly barreling toward 1.5 degrees.\n\nWith every extreme event, ecosystems are being pushed more toward so-called tipping points beyond which irreversible changes can happen, according to the report.\n\nAt warming of 2 degrees, for example, as many as 18% of all land species will be at high risk of extinction, according to the report. At 4 degrees, 50% of species are threatened.\n\n“There are many challenges already with 1.5 degrees for several systems that we know about,” said Hans-Otto Pörtner, a co-chair on the report and a scientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research.\n\n“Clearly for coral reefs, we must say that in many locations, they are already beyond tipping points. They are on the downslide.”\n\nA man works in the Swiss Alps at the Rhone Glacier in October 2021, which is partially covered with insulating foam to prevent it from melting due to global warming. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHighly vulnerable ecosystems in the Arctic, mountains and on the coasts are at the greatest risk to these changes, the authors say. Ice sheet and glacier melt will cause accelerated sea level rise, irreversible for centuries.\n\nForests, peatlands and permafrost — places where greenhouse gas is naturally stored — risk being pushed into a situation where they are emitting those gases into the atmosphere, causing even more warming.\n\nWe’re running out of ways to adapt\n\n“Adaptation” is finding ways to live with the change — like putting up walls to ward off sea level rise or implementing new building codes to ensure homes can withstand more extreme weather.\n\nScientists note some of our adaptations have blunted the impact of the climate crisis so far, but they are not adequate in the long-term. Our options to adapt will become even more limited at 1.5 degrees.\n\nA flood defense wall being constructed on the east side of Manhattan in New York City on December 11, 2021. Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd although the natural world has adapted to changing climates over millions of years, the pace of human-caused global warming is pushing many of the planet’s most critical systems — like rainforests, coral reefs and the Arctic — to the brink. More extreme weather doesn’t just affect humans, it is causing mass die-offs in plants and animals.\n\nPopulation growth and development, which has not been carried out with long-term adaptation in mind, are also luring people into harm’s way. As many as 3.6 billion people live in places already highly vulnerable to climate hazards, some of which will increase beyond the ability to adapt once the planet hits the 1.5-degree mark.\n\nA lot of the world’s resources, particularly international finance, goes toward reducing greenhouse emissions, which is known as mitigation. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, last year, developing nations complained that the rich world was failing to help adequately fund adaptation in their countries.\n\n“We have seen that the vast majority of climate finance goes towards mitigation rather than adaptation,” said Adelle Thomas, an author on the report and a climate scientist at the University of the Bahamas. “So although adaptation is taking place, there is not enough funding, and it is not a high priority, which are then leading to these limits.”\n\nUp to 3 billion people will experience ‘chronic water scarcity’\n\nResidents fill water containers during a shortage in Nairobi, Kenya, in January. Donwilson Odhiambo/SOPA/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nAround half of the world’s population experiences severe water scarcity each year in part due to climate-related factors, the report showed. Water will become even more scarce at higher global temperatures.\n\nAt 2 degrees of warming — which scientists predict the planet will reach by midcentury — as many as three billion people around the world will experience “chronic water scarcity,” according to the report. It increases to four billion people at 4 degrees.\n\nWater shortages will put enormous pressure on food production and increase the world’s already dire food-security challenges.\n\nA water crisis is already brewing in the Western United States. Multiyear drought has drained reservoirs and triggered unprecedented water cuts for the region. Lake Mead, the country’s largest reservoir, plunged to record lows in recent months, threatening water supply for tens of millions of people.\n\nDead almond trees lie in an open field after they were removed by a farmer because of a lack of water to irrigate them, in Huron, California, in July 2021. The authors say drought has put a hard limit on adaptation for almond growing. Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMost of the Middle East is experiencing high levels of water stress, expected to worsen the more the Earth warms, raising questions over how long those parts of the region will remain inhabitable. Vast swaths of Africa have also struggled in recent years with prolonged drought.\n\nThe report focuses on the interconnectedness between the Earth’s ecosystems and humans, including how the climate crisis is altering water resources.\n\n“What we really wanted to show is that ecosystems and all sectors of human society and human well-being fundamentally depends on water,” Tabea Lissner, a scientist at Climate Analytics and an author on the report, told CNN. “And it’s not just the water resource itself that plays an important role in water security, but also what form and in what quality we can access it, and really showing how many different ways climate change really affects humans and ecosystems through various channels.”\n\nThe people who are least responsible are the most affected\n\nFlooding in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum on September 7, 2021.

It is about 310.69 miles long and 68.35 miles wide.\n\nScientists have known there was some coral in that area off the Atlantic since the 1960s, but did not know the extent of it.

The species, Desmophyllum pertusum, is mainly found in the ocean at 656 to 3,280 feet deep. At those depths, water is 39 F on average.\n\nSowers said the cold-water corals in deep-sea reefs are biologically different from shallow-water reefs like the Great Barrier Reef, which stretches along the northeast coast of Australia.\n\nAccording to the scientist, this is because the corals are so deep in the water that they are out of reach of sunlight.\n\n\"They don't rely on photosynthesis because they're actually living in the dark,\" said Sowers. \"But they do rely on filter-feeding particles that are coming down through the water column, and they capture those particles and bring them in.\"\n\nShallow-water reefs face coral bleaching. This is caused when the different types of algae that live inside the corals are ejected because the water is 2 degrees warmer for 10 days or more. The phenomena is due to climate change and record-high temperatures, reports USA TODAY.\n\nDeep-water reefs don't face these kinds of issues because they rely on filter-feeding, but are still affected by the changing waters.\n\n\"Climate change and the changing water temperatures and acidity of the ocean can also impact these reefs and is something that we need to try to manage in the future so we can keep these ecosystems functioning,\" said Sowers", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/19"}]}

Other climbers said that Mallory's ability to tackle difficult routes and use his \"catlike\" climbing skills were unmatched, Britannica said.\n\nPutting his mountain adventures on the back burner, Mallory was deployed to France to serve in World War I. After the war, Mallory turned to teaching, but climbing never left his mind. Mallory joined the Alpine Club and became one of the lead climbers as the group prepared for their first trip to Mount Everest in 1921, the encyclopedia said.\n\nThe date when Mallory began his third and final attempt to scale Everest is unclear, but he signed a \"Mount Everest Expedition Agreement\" on Feb. 13, 1924.\n\nThe final letter to his wife was dated a little more than three months later, on May 27, 1924.\n\nIt would be another 75 years before Mallory's body was discovered on Mount Everest, on May 4, 1999, the BBC News reported.\n\nMallory's body was identified by his name tag that was still on him.

Went to Oklahoma Christian University. Attends Memorial Road Church of Christ.\n\nBut as a kid, she had a fascination with climbing mountains. Was it because she was from Oklahoma? Or despite it? She’s not really sure, but as a teenager, she read every book and watched every movie about mountain climbing. “Into Thin Air.” “Touching the Void.”\n\nBut even as she got older, she never actually climbed any mountains. Going to college, getting married and starting a family took precedence.\n\nThen while Valari and husband, Greg, were on a mission trip in Honduras, a friend mentioned he was going to climb Mount Rainier.\n\nMount Everest this year:Nepal expecting hundreds of mountaineers as spring climbing season begins on Everest\n\n“Oh, my gosh,” she told him. “I want to do that.”\n\nEven though she was in her 40s, her childhood fascination had been rekindled, and four or five months later, Valari, Greg and six others headed to Washington.\n\n“And it was absolutely the most hilarious thing, in hindsight, I ever did,” Valari said. “We were so unprepared. We had absolutely no idea what we were doing.”\n\nThe group didn’t make the summit. Knowing what she knows now, Valari says there was never any way they’d have made it. They didn’t know enough about being in the backcountry or moving in cold weather or handling higher elevations.\n\n“By the grace of God,” Valari said, “we’re all alive.”\n\nGreg said, “It was miserable. I wanted to quit right then, but she just kept going.”\n\nValari realized her fascination was a passion.\n\nGreg wasn’t completely shocked by his wife’s new interest. They’d gone scuba diving when they were younger, and her fearlessness was evident. She would go deeper than most divers were comfortable.\n\nGoing high into the mountains took the same kind of fearlessness, but Valari started climbing all over the world. In a sport dominated by men and climbers who were often half her age, she went after some of the most grueling peaks on the planet, including Cho Oyu in the Himalayas, Aconcagua in Argentina and Denali in Alaska.\n\n“She’s amazing,” Jess said.\n\nIn 2013, Valari and Greg went to Nepal. Valari wanted to climb Mount Everest.\n\n“It’s tough up there,” said Greg, who planned to go to Everest Base Camp, then stay put while Valari attempted to summit. “You’ve got to be fearless. The exposure. Crossing those wobbly ladders across bottomless crevasses. I just couldn’t do it.\n\n“When I was at base camp watching Valari just practice over crevasses you could see the bottom of, which is 30 feet down, I couldn’t watch. It just made me so nervous to even think about anybody doing that.”\n\nBut Valari did it, though she never made the summit — oldest daughter, Colby, had an unexpected turn after a cancer diagnosis, and Valari and Greg knew they had to come home and be with her.\n\nValari was in her 50s at the time, and it seemed unlikely she’d ever have another chance at Everest. She never expected to try it again.\n\nAnd she absolutely didn’t think it would be with Jess.\n\nHow cancer changed her perspective on life, climbing\n\nJess Wedel left Oklahoma and thought she’d never be back.\n\nAfter she graduated from Edmond Memorial High School, she moved away. Went to college in Texas. Lived in Colorado, then in Wyoming.\n\nShe wanted some adventure.\n\nWithin reason, though.\n\nWhile she was living in Wyoming, Valari came for a visit. She decided to do some climbing while she was there, and Jess decided to tag along.\n\n“And I did not love it,” Jess said, laughing.\n\nActually, she hated it. She was scared of the heights and afraid of the dangers. She was miserable, and she let everyone know it. Climbing at the back of a rope team, Jess was screaming and cursing.\n\n“She’d never heard me say a cuss word before,” Jess said of her mom.\n\nValari kept looking back at her.\n\n“What’s going on?” Valari would ask.\n\n“What are we doing?’ Jess would reply. “Why are people doing this?”\n\nThey laugh about it now, but at the time, Valari suspected Jess was focused on fear.\n\n“For her in the beginning, I think it was … the potential, ‘If I fall, I’m going to take everybody with me,’” Valari said.\n\nMore from Deer Creek:'They’re a family': Deer Creek honors late alum & Special Olympian with basketball tournament\n\nIt’s a very real concern, but over time, Jess became less fearful.\n\n“She started to trust herself — ‘Oh, wait, I know what I’m doing.

Why was I afraid?’”\n\nThe Wedels, though, would soon have a scare that had nothing to do with climbing.\n\nJess, who moved back to Oklahoma in 2014, was undergoing some tests after an annual checkup. An ultrasound revealed a mass near her ovaries. It was so large — “I actually saw it on the screen and was like, ‘Oh, no, this is not good,’” she said — doctors initially thought it was too big to be cancerous.\n\nPerhaps the mass was a cyst. Even if it was a tumor, it was likely benign because she was only in her 20s.\n\nIt was neither a cyst nor benign.\n\nJess had ovarian cancer, and a rare form of it to boot. She had two major surgeries in early 2016, the first to cut out the mass, the second to remove her ovaries and uterus. Then, she underwent 18 weeks of chemotherapy.\n\n“You’re beginning to process death,” Jess said. “You know everyone dies, but my life could be over.”\n\nShe clung to every shred of good news. Her second surgery revealing the cancer hadn’t spread. Her body showing signs of recovery, even though they might be small, throughout chemo. It gave her hope.\n\nThoughts of death gave way to something different.\n\nRead more:She battled cancer. Now she raises money for research while helping people eat healthier\n\n“I can survive this,” she started to think.\n\nOn Dec. 13, 2016, her doctor at MD Anderson in Houston proclaimed her cancer free. Jess was elated. Relieved. Excited.\n\nBut she was changed, too.\n\n“I have the freedom now to create whatever life I want,” she said. “I always had that freedom, but it felt more real. This is all you have, so if you don’t want to own a house and work your 9 to 5, then don’t do that.\n\n“I from then on sort of took small steps to do things that felt good for me — and that included climbing mountains.”\n\n'Cancer is not gonna tell me what to do'\n\nIf Valari and Jess Wedel were climbing mountains, they were climbing together.\n\nThey went to Mount Rainier. Then came a trip to climb in the Grand Canyon. Then a return to Rainier.\n\nValari saw a change in her daughter. Even though she suspects climbing experience was part of the reason why, Valari believes the biggest change in Jess was because of her cancer experience.\n\n“She wanted to not let cancer define her,” Valari said.\n\nJess’s attitude?\n\n“Cancer is not gonna tell me what to do.”\n\nAnd so they climbed. And climbed. And climbed.\n\nIt became common for Valari and Jess to head to Will Rogers World Airport, hop on a plane and make a long weekend of climbing. While they have always been close, they found a deeper connection when they were climbing.\n\n“It’s easy being on a mountain with her,” Jess said. “We’re both sort of our best selves.”\n\nValari said, “That time together on the mountain, all other things are gone. When you’re on the mountain, it’s a lot about survival, taking care of each other and being together.”\n\nYes, it’s an expensive hobby; Valari is a retired nurse and Greg is a certified public accountant while Jess is director of grants and programs at Presbyterian Health Foundation. It can be a grueling endeavor, too; Jess has asthma and Valari is now in her 60s.\n\nDoesn’t matter.\n\n“I’m not missing a moment with her,” Valari said. “She wants to climb with me, we’re going, no questions asked.”\n\nBut climbing Mount Everest?\n\nThat was actually Valari’s idea.\n\nA couple of years ago, a friend of the family had a recurrence of her own cancer. It hit everyone hard, but the news sparked something in Valari, too. A feeling that life is too short. A sense that she needed to try to climb Everest again.\n\nMore in climbing:'Cancer climber' inspires with Seven Summits, two poles, one Ironman Triathlon — all on one lung\n\nShe texted Jess.\n\n“I think we should climb an 8,000-meter peak,” Valari wrote.\n\n“Mom, you could just say that you think we should go to Everest,” Jess replied.\n\nBy the end of 2019, Valari and Jess had committed to make the trip. They found a guiding company. They secured their spots.\n\nThey spent the first couple months of 2020 preparing and training. Because they were regularly climbing, they weren’t out of shape, but climbing Mount Everest requires a higher level of fitness. They got permission to use the stairwell inside the Valliance Bank Tower, the mirrored 22-story building across from Penn Square Mall, and they started spending anywhere from one to three hours a day climbing the stairs.\n\nThen came COVID.\n\nOn March 11, 2020, China canceled all climbing permits for the north side of Mount Everest, which is in Chinese-controlled Tibet. A day later, Nepal did the same for the south side, which it controls.\n\nValari and Jess were devastated. All that training. All that planning. For nothing. But as the spring wore on and the magnitude of the pandemic became clear, they knew canceling the Everest climbing season was the right decision.\n\nStill, when the team that they’d signed on with offered spots to them for 2021, they didn’t hesitate.\n\nThey still wanted to climb Everest.\n\nMount Everest reopens:Nepal reopens to climbers and trekkers who missed prior trips due to COVID-19 pandemic\n\nWhere are they now? Oklahoma climbers heading to Everest\n\nValari and Jess Wedel left Oklahoma for Nepal on March 28.\n\nThey probably won’t even attempt to summit Everest until at least May 1. The weather has to be good — or at least with clear skies and winds under 50 mph — and that window for summiting usually doesn’t open until the first week of May at the earliest.\n\nBut the trip is long, too, because of dangers on and off the mountain.\n\nWith the pandemic still raging, Valari and Jess had to quarantine for several days after arriving in Kathmandu. They were tested. They were monitored. Only after they cleared COVID quarantine were they able to fly to Lukla, which is at the bottom of the Khumbu Valley.\n\nThat’s where they started a nearly two-week trek to Everest Base Camp.\n\n(Don’t let its name fool you — Base Camp sits at an elevation of 17,400 feet, which is about 3,000 feet higher than Mount Whitney, the tallest mountain in the continental United States.)\n\n“We could hike that in about three or four days probably,” Valari said of the journey from Lukla to Base Camp, “but we’re climatizing.”\n\nClimbers have to get used to the higher altitudes and the thinner air that contains less oxygen, and the best way to do that is gradually.\n\nOn April 7, Valari and Jess began the first of what their guide company calls rotations. Each one lasts several days with the climbers going higher each day, then returning to lower elevations to sleep. They are exposed to increasingly higher elevations, then recovering at night with more oxygen-rich air.\n\nAfter each rotation, they will have between three and five days of recovery.\n\nValari and Jess trained for all this for months. Evenings and weekends were again spent inside the Valliance Bank Tower, wearing weighted packs, going slowly, mimicking the hours and hours of slow movement it will take to climb Everest.\n\nThey were also trying to train their brains.\n\nVisiting Mount Everest:Climb Everest from the comfort of your home\n\n“This is mentally preparing us,” Jess told Valari at one point. “If we can keep walking in these stupid stairs for this many hours, we’re building mental toughness.”\n\nValari said, “You really have to know how to get your head in the zone and push your body, and if you can’t do that, then it doesn't matter how great of shape you’re in. You won’t make it.”\n\nThe truth is, there are no guarantees Valari and Jess will make it to the top. Lots of climbers get sick because of the altitude and can’t go on. Others get hurt because dangers lurk all over the mountain. And yes, a few die every year.\n\nBut Valari and Jess aren’t thinking about what might be lost. They choose to focus instead on what they will gain from this experience, no matter the outcome.\n\n“People that climb mountains are often summit driving,” Jess said. “But if that’s the only thing you’re thinking about, then it loses all the meaning.”\n\nValari and Jess Wedel are thinking about the journey — not just on the mountain but in life.\n\nBeating cancer was the toughest thing they’ve ever done. They think of the battle as a team effort, by the way, something they did that together. They walked side by side. They scaled those heights together.\n\nNow, they plan to do the same on Mount Everest.\n\n“It’s hard for me to imagine doing it without her,” Jess said. “My dream of Everest is to climb it with her.”\n\nJenni Carlson: Jenni can be reached at 405-475-4125 or jcarlson@oklahoman.com.

The path definitely hasn’t been easy, but you have persevered. Hoping that these moments are unforgettable. Love you both!”\n\nRobert and Traci Boker, Valari’s brother and sister-in-law and Jess’s uncle and aunt:\n\n“We are so excited and happy for you guys ‘living the dream’ of climbing Everest. We are praying for you to have an amazing and safe adventure. You’ve made it through the hardest part -- training and sacrificing every day. Now it’s time to enjoy it and celebrate every day you are out there. Hope you have an amazing trip!”\n\nDan Waugh, church friend who has climbed with Valari:\n\n“I like the simple message Valari always told us when we started to climb. She would hold out the back of her hands -- there, written on her hands would be HOLD on one hand’s knuckles and FAST on the other hand -- and simply say ... ‘Hold fast to the belief you can. Hold fast to safety. Hold fast to the moment with friends.’”\n\nRobin Waugh, church friend who has climbed with Valari:\n\n“‘You can slow down, but no stopping’ is advice from Valari. I could hear that voice in my head when it got tough. If anybody can do that mountain, Valari and Jessie can!”\n\nMark Brewer, church friend who has climbed with Valari:\n\n“These two are amazing technical climbers who have climbed all over the world, and this is their time to tackle Everest.

In 2018, he became the first person to make the summit 22 times, and he completed his 25th journey exactly one year before his 26th trip.\n\nHis father was among the first Sherpa guides, and Rita followed in his footsteps.

Mostly made up of Nepalese people, they are pivotal in helping climbers from across the world reach the top of the mountain.\n\nThe milestone was reached as May is typically the busiest month for people to climb the mountain, as weather conditions are usually the most tolerable. Reuters reported Nepal issued 316 permits to climb the mountain during the peak season, less than the record 408 issued last year.\n\nThough Mount Everest has been successfully climbed over 10,000 times, it still is one of the most dangerous treks in the world — over 300 people have died attempting the climb.

Bad weather might get in the way. Ditto for avalanche concerns, equipment malfunctions and about a thousand other things.\n\nSo, when they thought about their journey this spring, they knew it might not end at the top of the world.\n\nBut they never thought much about it not ending together.\n\nEarlier this week, Valari, 61, had to be medi-flighted off the mountain. She has asthma and had been struggling with low oxygen-saturation levels at the high altitudes. She made the decision to turn around, return to camp and end her Everest journey.\n\nShe also left her daughter behind.\n\n“My heart is broken,” Jess said on her Facebook page after Valari boarded a helicopter. “I am a puddle of snot and tears and slobber.”\n\nThe Wedels were attempting to be the first American mother-daughter team to summit Everest, but losing out on the chance at history wasn’t the cause of their heartbreak.\n\nLosing out on time with each other was.\n\nValari and Jess have become inseparable climbing companions. For the better part of five years, they’ve gone climbing all over the world, sometimes hopping flights on short notice and doing a climb during a long weekend.\n\nMom, daughter bond over mountain climbing\n\nWhile Valari has loved mountain climbing for nearly two decades, Jess only came to embrace it after beating a rare form of ovarian cancer in 2016. Climbing became a way for her to embrace the new lease on life she’d been given.\n\nBut it was her mom who opened that door.\n\n“I cannot thank you enough for how you taught me to find joy in giving a great effort,” Jess wrote to her mom the other day, “and opening up a world that allowed me to grow and heal.”\n\nAnd so after they had conquered many of the bigger peaks in North and South America and turned their attention toward the biggest of them all — Everest at 29,032 feet — there was no doubt they’d do it together.\n\nBefore they left Oklahoma for Nepal in late March, Valari told me she figured there’d come a point during the climbing when she would stay behind and Jess would go on. Valari, 61, knew her age and her asthma would likely keep her from summiting Everest.\n\n“Maybe I can make a run up to one of the higher camps,” she said. “But I’m just going to be sitting there watching her fly along.\n\n“She’s just amazing.”\n\nReached by text in Kathmandu, Valari told me she is feeling much better and is hoping to catch a flight out of Nepal as soon as pandemic-related restrictions allow it. She knows she made the right decision to leave the mountain, but that doesn’t mean it was easy.\n\n'It's the gift of time'\n\n“It was hard to leave her,” Valari said, “but we both were so grateful to be able to share most of the journey together.”\n\nAnd what a journey it was.\n\nThey spent more than a month in the Himalayas, first hiking up the Khumbu Valley into Everest Base Camp, then making multiple rotations up and down the mountains to get acclimated to the higher altitude. They reveled in seeing ice falls and rocky ridges, tea houses and yak herds. They hunkered down for nearly two days as winds roared and snow caused a white out. They even did a Zoom interview with the CBS Evening News from their tent at Everest Base Camp.\n\nThose moments will last forever.\n\nThat’s what they’re both remembering even in their disappointment.\n\n“This experience isn’t standing at the summit together,” Jess wrote. “It’s the hours training, the checking in, the days we woke up at teahouses to see our breath. It’s the way we are both in awe of yaks.\n\n“It’s the hugs we share after a long day on the trail, the ‘I love you’s she whispered across our tent, the comforting solidarity we felt together.\n\n“It is the gift of time.”\n\nLosing that time together is what pains them most. Sure, having moments together at the top of Mount Everest would have been amazing — several climbers using the climbing company Jess is with summited Wednesday, so if the calm winds and clear skies hold, her group could make an attempt yet this week — but it’s all the little moments Valari and Jess Wedel will miss most.\n\n“We know happiness and sadness aren’t mutually exclusive,” Jess wrote. “We know it isn’t about the end. It’s about where we are right now and what we’ve done with the time we’ve had.\n\n“We will find our way; we always do.”\n\nSo, even though this journey didn’t end the way Valari and Jess Wedel had dreamed, they are adapting just as they always have. They adapted a few years ago when Jess got cancer. They adapted on Everest as Valari dealt with asthma.\n\nNow, they’re adapting to being apart.\n\nJess already knows what she is going to do without Valari.\n\n“I will carry her with me every step,” Jess wrote. “Her spirit, her heart, her dream.”\n\nJenni Carlson: Jenni can be reached at 405-475-4125 or jcarlson@oklahoman.com.

Washington hung around for a majority of the game before the Wolverines pulled away in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe ground game led the way for the Wolverines offense, with the two-headed monster of Donovan Edwards and Blake Corum paving the way with all touchdowns for the offense. Corum ran the ball 21 times for 134 yards and two touchdowns, while Edwards had 104 yards on six rushes and two touchdowns. J.J.

That will be the question on the minds of many throughout college football and the NFL as the Michigan coach weighs his options after winning the national championship with the Wolverines on Monday night. The allure of a potential return to the professional ranks is evident for a coach who has interviewed with teams in each of the last two years. With that in mind, here's our ranking of all five NFL franchises with a coaching vacancy, based on their potential fit for Harbaugh. — MIchael Middlehurst-Schwartz\n\nMichigan vs. Washington highlights\n\nMichigan won its first national football title since 1997, defeating Washington behind 303 yards rushing and a defensive effort that held Heisman Trophy runner-up Michael Penix Jr. to just one touchdown pass.\n\nJim Harbaugh has his Michigan title. So is this goodbye?\n\nMaybe no national champion in the playoff era so firmly embodied the ethos of its head coach quite like the Wolverines, who shrugged off and embraced criticism in equal measure during this incredibly tumultuous season. But all eyes are on Harbaugh and his immediate future. He hired a new agent, Don Yee, who specializes in NFL contracts. He's again interviewed for NFL openings. Harbaugh's name has come up in connection with the Los Angeles Chargers, among other teams.\n\nTo ignore the itch and come back to Michigan will come with the increasingly likely chance that Harbaugh faces more penalties for NCAA violations that have occurred under his watch. After missing six games due to suspension during the regular season, he could be sidelined again next year. Is that what he wants? Has winning a national championship satisfied what he wanted to achieve at Michigan, freeing him up to join his brother in the NFL?\n\n\"That'll check the biggest box,\" Harbaugh said of the title. Should he leave, Harbaugh will pass on a program that views itself as bigger than one coach or player — the sort of deep self-confidence that might have flowered during Harbaugh's absence.

Where will the Michigan Wolverines land in the USA TODAY Sports way-too-early Top 25 given the uncertainty over whether Jim Harbaugh returns for another year? Can the Huskies make another title run as members of the Big Ten? It’s a way-too-early list that’s heavy on the Big Ten and SEC. Those two powerhouse leagues make up the entire top five, nine of the top 10 and 15 of the 25 teams overall. Here’s our guess for how things will look at the end of next season.\n\nOdds for the 2024-25 championship\n\nBetting odds, according to BetMGM, to win the 2024-25 College Football Playoff national championship:\n\nGeorgia +350\n\nAlabama +550\n\nOhio State +800\n\nMichigan +900\n\nTexas +900\n\nOregon +1000\n\nMichigan deserved this title. But the silly and unnecessary scandals won't be forgotten.\n\nOn the field, the Michigan Wolverines left no doubt. So why, after it was all over, did Jim Harbaugh come into a press conference and feel compelled to say the following words: “We’re innocent.” I’m not here to tell you that Michigan’s long-awaited national title — its first outright championship since the Korean War — is tainted. The way Michigan closed out this season, beating the best college football had to offer this year under multiple clouds of uncertainty off the field, cannot be questioned. The best team won — and in the most important games, did so fair and square. But the Wolverines made it easy to be cynical about what should have been a great college football story. Read Dan Wolken's full column here.\n\nJim Harbaugh bonus for winning national championship? A cool $1 million\n\nMichigan's Jim Harbaugh led college football coach bonus totals this season with $3 million — by far the largest single-season haul since USA TODAY Sports began tracking these amounts in 2019. He picked up $1 million for the Wolverines’ win in Monday night’s CFP title game after getting $500,000 for the team playing in the Big Ten Conference championship game, $1 million for winning the Big Ten title and $500,000 for being selected to play in the CFP semifinals.\n\nThis set of bonuses was introduced into Harbaugh’s contract with Michigan after the 2020 season, when he took a roughly 50% cut in his basic annual pay from the school to $4 million after the Wolverines had gone 9-4 in 2019 and 2-4 in the pandemic-affected 2020 season.\n\nHarbaugh claimed $2.225 million in 2021, although he redirected about $1.5 million of his bonus money to members of the Michigan athletics department who had taken pandemic-related pay cuts during an 11-month stretch of 2020 and 2021 and had remained on the payroll. He picked up $2.2 million last season. Read Steve Berkowitz's full story here.\n\nNational title puts Michigan at No. 1 in college football's final NCAA Re-Rank 1-133\n\nMichigan ends the year No. 1 in the USA TODAY Sports NCAA Re-Rank 1-133 after beating Washington 34-13 for the program’s first unshared national championship since 1948. Washington comes in at No. 2, followed No. 3 Georgia, No. 4 Texas and No. 5 Alabama. Michigan was ranked No. 2 in the preseason 1-133 behind Georgia. The Huskies were ranked No. 21. The same preseason re-rank had Pittsburgh at No. 25, so it’s obviously not an exact science. See Paul Myerberg's full Re-Rank here.\n\nWhich was the best national championship team of the CFP era? We ranked all 10.\n\nThe four-team College Football Playoff period featured its share of controversy, from the inclusion of Ohio State in the debut field in 2014 to this year's exclusion of unbeaten Florida State. But by nearly every metric, the playoff has been a resounding success and one of the great advancements in the history of the sport.\n\nOn the field, the past decade has been defined by SEC dominance. Monday night marked the first time since 2014 that no SEC team had at least played for the national title. The conference won six during the four-team playoff: Alabama in 2015, 2017 and 2020, LSU in 2019, and Georgia in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThis era also saw the dramatic rise of Clemson, which unseated the Crimson Tide in 2016 and 2018. The 2018 team was the first in more than a century to go 15-0. The 12-team format will take the title race in a new and unpredictable direction. In one last look back at the past 10 years, here's how the champs of the four-team era rank among their peers.\n\nJ.J. McCarthy-Tom Brady comparisons\n\nJim Harbaugh is so full of hyperbole on a regular basis that he will sometimes say outlandish things that go largely unnoticed. But it should probably be a little bit more of a conversation piece when Michigan’s coach (who was also a great Michigan quarterback) puts current Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy in the same sentence as a former Michigan quarterback who happens to be the most accomplished football player of all-time.\n\nAnd the crazy part is he might be right – at least in the way Harbaugh is framing the argument. Though his passing statistics are rarely spectacular and may not resonate 30 years from now when people look back at this Michigan team without the proper context, McCarthy may well be at the top of the list if the Wolverines beat Washington on Monday to win the school’s first national title since 1997. Read Dan Wolken’s full column here.\n\nBlake Corum draft projection: Is he going to the NFL draft?\n\nEntering the 2023 season, Pro Football Focused projected Michigan running back Blake Corum as the second-best running back in the 2024 NFL draft.\n\nWhat Jim Harbaugh said after the CFP national championship game\n\nHow will Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh celebrate his team’s national championship? With a tattoo of course.\n\nEarlier in the season, Harbaugh had said he doesn’t have any tattoos, but would get one if his team went undefeated. Now that mission has been accomplished, he is standing by his word.\n\n\"I did say that to our players,\" Harbaugh told reporters after the game. \"I said if we go 15-0, I'm getting a tattoo. It's 15-0. I'm going to put it on my shoulder. I don't know if it's my left or right yet. I'm a right-handed quarterback, I'll probably get it on my right, and then an M too. An M that's maize and blue M.\"\n\nEven during the celebration, Harbaugh was asked about if he’d one day want to celebrate a Super Bowl victory. He didn’t want to think about it as there are rumors of him departing for the NFL after this season.\n\n\"I just want to enjoy this. I hope you give me that,\" he said. \"Can a guy have that? Does it always have to be what's next, what's the future?\"\n\nThe head coach was also asked about overcoming all the off-the-field issues that surrounded the team. Despite two suspensions, Harbaugh still claims his innocence.\n\n\"The off-the-field issues, we're innocent and we stood strong and tall because we knew we were innocent, and I'd like to point that out,\" Harbaugh said. \"And these guys are innocent. And overcome that, it wasn't that hard because we knew we were innocent.\" — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWhat Michael Penix Jr. said after the CFP national championship game\n\nA battered and bruised Michael Penix Jr. spoke postgame following Washington’s loss to Michigan in the College Football Playoff national championship game.\n\n\"I had ups and downs, but I’m thankful for it all. To meet Coach (Kalen) DeBoer at Indiana and for him to lead me here. To be playing in the biggest game in college football. We didn’t come out how I wanted it to but each and every player knows that they gave it their all. It wasn’t enough today,\" Penix said. \"Blessed to be here. Blessed to be on this team and these guys will be my brothers forever.\"\n\nThe Heisman Trophy runner-up and senior QB will be on his way to the NFL following Monday’s defeat. He’s rated as a top-five quarterback prospect on many NFL draft boards. — Tyler Dragon\n\nMichigan national championship gear, commemorative book\n\nMichigan's national championship gear is available for purchase at https://shop.collegefootballplayoff.com.

To do it with a trophy in his hand, on the night the entire country is paying attention, would be arguably the most significant stance for athletes’ rights ever taken by a prominent coach.\n\n“People come to watch the players,” Harbaugh said Saturday. “They really don't come to watch the coaches. They don't come watch the administrators. They come to watch the players. And in a world where the revenue is ever growing, the student-athletes being able to participate in that ever-growing revenue, who could argue against them?”\n\nEven now, in an era of players being able to profit off name, image and likeness, arguing for schools and the NCAA to share revenue with athletes is a bold step for a college coach. Few have had the foresight, desire or guts to do it.\n\nBut if Harbaugh believes that sincerely and isn’t merely using it as media chum to distract from his multiple imbroglios with NCAA rules, then he needs to do it by staying at Michigan and fighting the fight. It’s easy to talk. It’s a lot easier when you have one foot out the door waiting for an offer from the NFL.

The defensive back nabbed an interception off Michael Penix Jr. on the first play from scrimmage in the second half. The Wolverines picked off the Heisman Trophy finalist twice in the victory. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nJack Harbaugh shouts signature rally cry after Michigan's national championship\n\nJim Harbaugh couldn’t celebrate the national title win without his dad, former coach Jack Harbaugh. As the team was on the podium to claim the championship trophy, Jim Harbaugh had his dad take the mic and do his rally cry. \"Who has it better than us?\" Harbaugh said. \"Nobody!\" he, the crowd and team yelled back. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nBlake Corum named offensive player of national championship\n\nRunning back Blake Corum set the tone before kickoff that he was ready to take the reins by showing up in a cowboy-inspired outfit. The senior was named the offensive player of the national championship after finishing with 21 carries for 134 yards and two touchdowns. Corum missed the end of last season with a knee injury and was named a 2023 Comeback Player of the Year. \"This is everything I imagined,\" Corum said on the stage after beating the Washington Huskies for the title. \"… We said we had unfinished business, so I’ll leave you all with this: The business is finished!\" — Victoria Hernandez\n\nMichigan scores: Blake Corum 1-yard touchdown run\n\nWashington was given a second chance to attempt a fourth-and-13 after a chaotic play that landed incomplete and featured two offsetting penalties. Instead of converting, Michael Penix Jr. threw an interception to Michigan's Mike Sainristil, who ran it back 81 yards to the Washington 8-yard-line. Michigan handed the ball to Blake Corum, who pounded for 7 yards and then a 1-yard score to essentially finish off the Huskies. The Wolverines are up 34-13 with 3:37 on the clock. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nMichigan scores: Blake Corum 12-yard touchdown run\n\nThe Wolverines have scored their first touchdown since the first quarter. It only took Michigan five plays to go 71 yards for the score. Michigan’s touchdown drive was highlighted by a 41-yard catch and run by tight end Colston Loveland that put the team on Washington’s 30-yard line. A few plays later, running back Blake Corum broke a tackle and scampered for a 12-yard rushing touchdown to give the Wolverines a 27-13 lead with 7:09 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nMichigan has dominated Washington on the ground. The Wolverines have produced 296 rushing yards on 33 carries. Corum has a game-high 125 rushing yards. — Tyler Dragon\n\nWashington punts after 32-yard catch called back\n\nMichael Penix Jr. seemed to have redemption for overthrowing Rome Odunze in the first half when he connected with the star receiver for a 32-yard play in the fourth quarter. But the play was called back when offensive lineman Roger Rosengarten was penalized for holding. Facing second-and-20, the quarterback threw two short passes, but couldn’t move the chains and Washington punted the ball away. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nEnd of third quarter: Michigan 20, Washington 13\n\nIt’ll be a one-score game heading into the final quarter of the national championship game, with Michigan leading 20-13 with 15 minutes left to go. Both sides added a field goal in the third quarter, but it wasn’t a mostly dominant effort defensively on both sides. After both teams combined for 450 yards in the first half, both sides only got 130 yards in the third quarter.\n\nWashington will begin the fourth quarter with the ball, getting another chance to cut the deficit or tie the game. The Huskies have only headed into the fourth quarter losing once this season, when they completed a comeback to beat Arizona State in October. Michigan continues to do most of its damage rushing the ball with 273 of its 360 yards coming on the ground. Both Donovan Edwards (104 yards) and Blake Corum (103 yards) have eclipsed the century mark on the ground. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWashington, Michigan trade punts\n\nBoth teams' defenses are stepping, forcing the offenses to get off the field quickly in the middle of the third quarter. After Washington added a field goal, Michigan went three-and-out and punted the ball back to the Huskies. They couldn’t do much either, picking up one first down before punting it to Michigan. The Wolverines get the ball at their own 7-yard line with just over five minutes left in the third quarter. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWho are the national championship game referees?\n\nIt’s an ACC crew officiating the national championship game, headed by Marcus Woods. Here is the full crew:\n\nReferee: Marcus Woods\n\nMarcus Woods Umpire: Danny Worrell\n\nDanny Worrell Head linesman: Troy Gray\n\nTroy Gray Line judge: Deon Lawrence\n\nDeon Lawrence Field judge: Wayne Rundell\n\nWayne Rundell Side judge: Michael McCarthy\n\nMichael McCarthy Back judge: Michael Griffith\n\nMichael Griffith Center judge: Larry Saunders\n\nLarry Saunders Alternate: Michael Roche\n\nMichael Roche Replay official: Mark McAnaney\n\nMark McAnaney Communicator: Jeff Roberson\n\n— Jordan Mendoza\n\nWashington scores: Grady Gross 45-yard field goal\n\nIt’s back to a one-score game in Houston after Grady Gross drilled a 45-yard field goal for Washington to make it a 20-13 Michigan lead. Michael Penix Jr. was able to get back on the field after he appeared to be injured on the previous offensive drive. Two passes were able to get the Huskies to midfield and they were aided by an unnecessary roughness penalty by Makari Paige to get into Michigan territory. The Huskies were unable to pick up another first down and opted to kick a field goal. Gross is now 2-for-2 on field goals on the night. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMichigan scores: James Turner 38-yard field goal\n\nMichigan had to settle for a field goal after forcing a turnover. The Wolverines took possession at Washington’s 32-yard line, but a couple penalties cost them a golden opportunity to go up by two touchdowns. Michigan had to settle for a 38-yard field goal by kicker James Turner to push their advantage to 20-10 with 11:55 left in the third quarter. Turner has made both his field goal attempts in the game. — Tyler Dragon\n\nDo the Michigan Wolverines have a mascot?\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines do not have a mascot. Nissan’s Heisman House commercial starring former Michigan star cornerback/wide receiver and Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson makes fun of the fact that the college football powerhouse does not, in fact, have a real life wolverine with them on game days. In fact, the Wolverine State barely has any of the fluffy, and not so friendly, animals at all. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nMichigan interception against Michael Penix to start second half\n\nWashington had a chance to tie the game out of halftime, but its momentum was taken out with Michigan’s Will Johnson picking off Michael Penix Jr. On the second play out of halftime, Penix looked to get the ball to Tybo Rogers, but the ball came out awkwardly, and Johnson was able to tip it and catch it before he hit the ground. Not only was it an interception, but Penix appeared to be injured after one of his offensive lineman stepped on his ankle. He was getting looked at on the sideline as the Michigan offense got on the field. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNew CFP format in 2024\n\nThe College Football Playoff will expand to 12 teams during the 2024 season. Under the 12-team system, the field will be composed of the six conference champions ranked highest by the selection committee and the six highest-ranked non-conference champions. The 12-team format will allow access for at least one team from the Group of Five.\n\nAccording to the playoff, the first round of the 2024 bracket will occur during the week ending Dec. 21, at \"either the home field of the higher-seeded team or at another site designated by the higher-seeded institution.\" These games would pit seeds No. 12 and No. 5, No. 11 and No. 6, No. 10 and No. 7, and No. 9 and No. 8.\n\nThe top four highest-rated conference champions would have an open date and not play until the quarterfinals. For 2024 and 2025, the four quarterfinal and two semifinal games will be played at rotating bowl sites. In 2024, the quarterfinals will be the Fiesta, Peach, Rose and Sugar bowls, with the semifinals at the Cotton Bowl and Orange Bowl. In 2025, the Cotton, Orange, Rose and Sugar will host the quarterfinals and the Fiesta Bowl and Peach Bowl will host the semifinals. The national championship games will be held on Jan. 20, 2025, in Atlanta, and Jan. 19, 2026, in Miami. — Paul Myerberg\n\nRome Odunze pronunciation\n\nWashington receiver Rome Odunze pronounces his name “ROAM oh-DUNE-zay.” — Ryan Ford, Detroit Free Press\n\nHalftime: Michigan 17, Washington 10\n\nIt was a first quarter dominated by Michigan, but Washington is still alive after getting a touchdown right before halftime to make it a one-score game.\n\nAfter Michigan jumped out to a 14-3 lead, the Wolverines were stopped in the red zone in the opening minutes of the second quarter and opted to take the three points. Washington’s offense still struggled to move the ball, including a missed wide-open catch on a fourth down, but the defense prevented Michigan from adding more points.\n\nWashington finally put together its best drive of the night in the final minutes, capping it with Michael Penix Jr. finding Jalen McMillan on fourth-and-goal for its first touchdown of the game.\n\nMichigan had 229 yards in the first quarter, but only picked up 61 yards after that. The Wolverines are still outgaining the Huskies 290-161, with 209 of those yards coming on the ground.\n\nLeading the way for Michigan is Donovan Edwards, who scored two touchdowns on his first two carries, finishing the first half with 93 yards on three carries. Blake Corum has also helped with 84 yards on eight carries.\n\nIt had been a mostly difficult first half for the Heisman Trophy runner-up, but Penix is 13 for 21 with 128 yards and a scoring toss.\n\nWashington has trailed at halftime twice this season – against Arizona State and Utah, but those were eventual wins. The Huskies will get a chance to tie the game to open the third quarter, something head coach Kalen DeBoer likes.\n\n\"We get the ball to start the third quarter. Great spot,\" he told ESPN before heading into the locker room. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMichael Penix stats at halftime\n\nWashington QB Michael Penix is 13-of-21 passing for 128 yards and one touchdown pass after one half of action.\n\nWashington score: Jalen McMillan 3-yard touchdown catch from Michael Penix\n\nMichigan might end up regretting going for it on fourth down.\n\nAfter Michigan turned it over on downs, Washington marched down the field on a 11-play, 61-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown. Washington’s touchdown, ironically, came on fourth down.\n\nWashington needed four plays inside the 10-yard line to reach paydirt. The Huskies scored on fourth down when Michael Penix passed to running back Jalen McMillan for a 3-yard touchdown. Washington’s TD cut its deficit to 17-10 with under a minute remaining in the first half.\n\nPenix completed four passes during Washington’s touchdown drive. The Heisman Trophy runner-up has 128 passing yards and one touchdown in the first half.\n\nWashington gets the football to begin the third quarter. — Tyler Dragon\n\nJim Harbaugh surprised by brother, John Harbaugh, on sidelines\n\nIt’s typically not a good idea to bother the head coach in the national championship game.\n\nUnless you are the older brother.\n\nJohn Harbaugh snuck up on Jim Harbaugh on the sidelines to greet him, as the Ravens head coach was able to make it to Houston to see his brother coach in his first national championship game. The two embraced before the elder Harbaugh brother let his younger sibling get back to coaching. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nHalftime show national championship\n\nThere will be a halftime show for the College Football Playoff national championship.\n\nUnlike other major sporting events such as the Super Bowl or NBA All-Star game, this halftime show will not feature a chart-topping artist. Instead, the Michigan Marching Band and the University of Washington Husky Marching Band will entertain fans at Houston's NRG Stadium while their football teams debrief in the locker room.\n\nFans at home can watch the halftime show on the ESPN app via the All-22 view. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nMichigan fails fourth-down conversion\n\nThe Washington defense is hanging on, preventing Michigan from converting a fourth-down play to give its offense great field position.\n\nMichigan got into Huskies territory and faced a fourth-and-3 at the Washington 38-yard line. Wolverines coach Jim Harbaugh initially sent his punting unit out, but took a timeout to send the offense back out instead.\n\nQuarterback J.J. McCarthy looked to Roman Wilson to pick up the first down, but Edefuan Ulofoshio played great coverage and broke up the pass to give Washington the ball back. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWhat does FBS stand for in college football?\n\nFBS stands for Football Bowl Subdivision, which is the highest level of college football in the country. Previously called Division I-A, FBS includes 10 conferences and 133 programs.\n\nMichigan goes three-and-out\n\nMichigan got its best field position of the day, but couldn’t capitalize on the Washington turnover-on-downs.\n\nThe Wolverines started at their own 47-yard line but couldn’t gain a yard on the drive. Blake Corum was stuffed on the opening play and J.J. McCarthy couldn’t connect with Colston Loveland or Cornelius Johnson on the following plays, a big stop for a Huskies defense that was gashed in the opening quarter.\n\nThe ensuing punt went into the end zone, so Washington will start at the 20-yard line in an attempt to cut the deficit. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMichael Penix overthrows Rome Odunze on fourth down\n\nKalen DeBoer’s first big decision backfired.\n\nDeBoer and Washington elected to go for it on fourth-and-7 from Michigan’s 47-yard line. Michael Penix took the snap in shotgun formation and fired the football over the head of a wide open Rome Odunze.\n\nMichigan took over possession of the football at their own 47-yard line as a result.\n\nWashington did convert two first downs during the drive, but two penalties hurt the team. — Tyler Dragon\n\nMichigan score: James Turner 31-yard field goal\n\nThe Michigan offense is rolling, but a defensive stop from Washington kept the Wolverines out of the end zone.\n\nBlake Corum got the drive started with a 59-yard run on the opening play of the drive, but the Washington defense held its ground for the first time of the game, preventing the Wolverines from picking up another first down.\n\nKicker James Turner came in for a 31-yard field goal, and snuck it in through the upright to make it a 17-3 game. This is now the largest deficit Washington has faced this season, and it’ll need to match history to win this game. The largest deficit to be overcome in a CFP national championship is 14 points, done by Clemson in 2017. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nCFP national championship tickets\n\nThe cheapest ticket listed on TicketIQ on Thursday afternoon was about $1,200 while the most expensive was listed at more than $21,000, a seat near the 50-yard line. As of Monday afternoon, the cheapest ticket listed by TicketIQ was more than $3,000 and the most expensive was more than $67,000.\n\nEnd of first quarter: Michigan 14, Washington 3\n\nIt’s been all Michigan in the first quarter of the national championship game.\n\nThe Wolverines lead 14-3 and are threatening another score after the first 15 minutes of the game in which Michigan displayed its power over Washington.\n\nMichigan had two touchdown runs from Donovan Edwards on its first two drives, while Washington had a field goal on its first and punted on its second.\n\nThe running game has done a majority of the damage for the Wolverines, picking up 174 rushing yards in the opening frame. In total, Michigan has 229 yards while Washington has 74.\n\nOn the final play of the first quarter, Michigan’s Blake Corum broke free for a 59-yard run to set his team up at the Washington 20-yard line at the start of the second quarter. It was one of several big plays from Michigan, as they picked up four plays of at least 30 yards in the first quarter. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWashington punts on second drive\n\nThe Huskies failed to answer Michigan’s second touchdown.\n\nMichael Penix and Washington went three-and-out in their second series and were forced to punt the football back to Michigan down 14-3 late in the first quarter. — Tyler Dragon\n\nMichigan score: Donovan Edwards 46-yard touchdown run\n\nTwo touches, two touchdowns.\n\nDonovan Edwards is turning into a Michigan legend, as the running back had another big run for his second touchdown of the first quarter.\n\nThe junior running back found an open hole on the fourth play of Michigan’s drive and outran the Washington defenders to give the Wolverines a 14-3 lead with two minutes left in the first quarter. The quick four play, 88-yard drive was aided when J.J. McCarthy showcased his arm by finding Roman Wilson on a 37-yard pass on the second play.\n\nEdwards already has 87 yards and two touchdowns on his two carries. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWashington score: Grady Gross 25-yard field goal\n\nWashington’s 14-play opening drive stalled in the red zone.\n\nOn third-and-goal, Michal Penix’s pass to Rome Odunze sailed over the wide receiver’s head. The Huskies had to settle for a short 25-yard field goal by kicker Grady Gross that snuck between the uprights.\n\nThe Huskies trail 7-3 with under four minutes remaining in the first quarter.\n\nWashington faced some early adversity during their first possession. Starting running back Dillon Johnson reaggravated his foot injury during the series but he was able to check back into the game. — Tyler Dragon\n\nDillon Johnson injured, returns\n\nLeading up to the national championship game, all eyes were on whether Washington running back Dillon Johnson would be able to play, and if how healthy he is.\n\nBut one play in and Johnson is already in pain.\n\nOn the first offensive play for the Huskies, Johnson took the handoff for six yards when a Michigan defender fell on his left foot as he got tackled. Johnson gingerly walked to the sideline, pointing at his left ankle. He went into the injury tent looking to be in discomfort.\n\nBut the junior running back would return eight plays later, and even was the lead blocker on the play after his return. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWhat are the stickers on Michigan football helmets?\n\nJim Harbaugh brought back helmet stickers when he arrived at Michigan in 2015 and awards them for various achievements, on-field and off-field. For the 2023 season, Harbaugh introduced a new sticker, according to Michigan Live, this one bearing the acronym EUTM. It stands for “enthusiasm unknown to mankind,” Michigan Live reported.\n\nCFP national anthem singer: Fantasia Barrino\n\nIt was previously announced that Grammy-award winner Fantasia Barrino will perform the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" prior to kickoff of the College Football Playoff national championship.\n\nFantasia burst onto the scene as the third winner of the famed reality TV show \"American Idol.\" She won at just 19 years old, beating out several other soon-to-be stars including Jennifer Hudson.\n\nMost recently, Fantasia was nominated at the Golden Globes for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for her role as Celie Johnson in The Color Purple.\n\nFantasia had previously worked on Broadway as the lead in the The Color Purple between April 10, 2007 and January 6, 2008. — Jon Hoefling\n\nDonovan Edwards stats\n\nMichigan's backup running back is junior Donovan Edwards.\n\nEdwards has only rushed for more than 50 yards in one game this year (52 against Penn State), and has accumulated 393 yards and three touchdowns on the ground, while catching 30 passes for 249 yards in the passing game.\n\nMichigan score: Donovan Edwards 41-yard touchdown run\n\nMichigan has made it a habit of being physically dominating this season, and it displayed the power on the opening drive with a touchdown.\n\nThe Wolverines had no issues getting into Washington territory, but took a sack on a first down play that sent them back to the 41-yard line. On the very next play, Donovan Edwards bounced off Washington defenders and found an open lane to his left, breaking free for a 41-yard touchdown run to get the scoring started.\n\nIt was an eight play, 84-yard drive that saw Michigan pick up 66 of those yards on the ground. Now Michael Penix Jr. and company will get their chance to respond.\n\nIt was Edwards' first touchdown since the Nov. 11 matchup against Penn State. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nHas Michigan ever won a national championship?\n\nYes. It's been nearly 25 years since Michigan last claimed a national championship, last winning one in 1997. Michigan also won most of its national championship before the poll era, which began in 1936. Here’s everything you could want to know about Michigan’s championship history. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nHas Washington ever won a national championship?\n\nThe Huskies have two (1960 and 1991), but it kind of depends who you ask. In 1960, after beating Minnesota 17-7 in the Rose Bowl and finishing with a record of 10-1, Washington was named the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation. When the Helms Foundation eventually dissolved in 1969, much of its archives went to the Amateur Athletic Union. Want to know something even weirder about the 1960 national championship? The Huskies didn’t claim it until 2007 — and that’s when they had a trophy made for it. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nLast time Washington won a national championship?\n\nBehind legendary coach Don James, and following Washington's 34-14 thumping of Michigan in the 1991 Rose Bowl, the coaches poll (at the time administered jointly by USA TODAY and CNN) named the Huskies national champs. The Associated Press poll, on the other hand, selected the Miami Hurricanes as the No. 1 team, with the Huskies coming in at No. 2. Miami had also finished 12-0 that season, ending with a 22-0 win over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. Because of this, Miami also claims the 1991 national championship. Some consider the 1991 Washington team one of the best college football squads of all time. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nLast time Michigan won a national championship?\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since Michigan last claimed a national championship, last winning one in 1997. Michigan also won most of its national championship before the poll era, which began in 1936. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nCoin toss for national championship game\n\nWashington called tails and won the toss. The Huskies deferred.\n\nThe Huskies' captains were Michael Penix Jr., Rome Udunze, Edefuan Ulofoshio, with former standout defensive end Steve Emtman as a special captain. Emtman played at Washington from 1988-91 and was drafted No. 1 in the 1992 NFL draft by the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nMichigan's captains were Zak Zinter, Blake Corum, Kris Jenkins, Trevor Keegan and Mike Sainristil.

He is the 14th live mascot for Washington and resides in Sammamish, Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, Michigan doesn’t have a live mascot, as it might be tough to have an actual wolverine on the sidelines. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWashington Huskies 2022 record\n\nWashington went 11-2 last season, its only two losses coming on the road against Pac-12 foes, UCLA and Arizona State.\n\nThe Huskies won their bowl game, the Alamo Bowl, which, ironically came against Texas, which Washington beat in this year's CFP semifinal.\n\nMichigan national championships\n\nAccording to the NCAA, the Wolverines have titles in: 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1918, 1923, 1933, 1948, 1997.

Read Paul Myerberg on how the Huskies' offense matches up against Michigan.\n\nDillon Johnson injury: Is he playing tonight?\n\nWashington running back Dillon Johnson is expected to play tonight against Michigan, the team has said. Johnson went down in the College Football Playoff semifinal against Texas, nagging lower leg injuries leading him to being carted off the field. ESPN's Molly McGrath reported Monday afternoon that Johnson is dealing with right foot and left knee injuries.\n\n\"This is just something he's been working through for a couple months now and just played through it,\" Washington head coach Kalen DeBoer said last Wednesday. \"There's nothing as far as above and beyond what's happened in the past. Just kind of throughout the game, he'd reaggravate it and shake it off and go back out there and play.\"\n\nJohnson was seen on the sideline before the game playing catch with quarterback transfer Will Rogers.\n\nBlake Corum outfit: Michigan RB arrives in Texas style outfit\n\nEverything is bigger in Texas, including Blake Corum’s outfit.\n\nThe Michigan running back arrived at NRG Stadium sporting a classic Texas look, wearing a big black cowboy hat, white shirt, jeans and a massive belt buckle. As if the belt buckle wasn’t enough, Corum is also iced-up with a custom “BC2” chain on his neck.\n\nDo wolverines live in Michigan?\n\nWolverines are actually extremely rare in the state of Michigan. When a female wolverine was spotted in Michigan's Thumb-region (Huron County) in 2004, it was the first confirmed appearance in the state in more than 200 years.\n\nThe wolverine reportedly died sometime in late 2009 or early 2010. It was stuffed and has been on display at the Saginaw Bay Visitor Center in the Bay City State Recreation Area.\n\nMichigan vs. Washington uniforms: What uniforms will Michigan, Washington wear in CFP national championship?\n\nIt will be a contrast in colors for the national championship game with both teams going for all-color looks in Houston.\n\nAs the home team, Michigan will wear its \"big game blue\" uniforms – traditional blue and maize helmet with blue jersey and pants. The Wolverines have worn the uniform combination three times this season, all wins against Bowling Green, Indiana and Ohio State.\n\nWashington will go for an all-white uniform set, with white jersey and pants combining with the classic gold helmets. The combination has been worn twice in wins at Michigan State and at Oregon State. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nCFP championship weather\n\nWeather won't be a factor at NRG Stadium on Monday, but it could still have an effect on the College Football Playoff championship game.\n\nHouston is part of a swath of Texas and Louisiana that is under a tornado watch until 10 p.m. ET as parts of the Gulf of Mexico are hit by extreme weather. As a result, Houston's Office of Emergency Management has advised fans to get to the stadium and indoors early so as to avoid the worst of the inclement weather.\n\nBeyond the ongoing tornado watch, high winds are also expected to be a more pressing issue.\n\nNRG Stadium is an indoor stadium and neither the Houston OEM nor National Weather Service has given no indication of an imminent postponement. Things could change if weather poses a threat to fan safety. — Kevin Skiver, USA TODAY Network\n\nCollege Football Playoff semifinals\n\nRoman Wilson stats\n\nThe 6-foot Michigan senior has 735 yards and 12 touchdowns on 45 catches this season. For his career, Wilson has played in 45 games and caught 104 passes for 1,653 yards and 20 TDs. Read Tony Garcia’s feature on Wilson and other seniors for the Detroit Free Press here.\n\nJ.J.

He’s also rushed for 601 yards and 10 TDs on 157 carries. In 2023 alone, McCarthy went 230-of-314 passing for 2,851 yards (203.6 yards per game), 22 touchdowns and four interceptions. He also rushed for 171 yards and three scores on 60 carries. Read Dan Wolken on why Jim Harbaugh calling J.J. McCarthy the greatest Michigan QB isn't nuts.\n\nBlake Corum stats, average rushing yards\n\nThe 5-foot-8, 213-pound senior running back has rushed for 3,603 rushing yards and 56 touchdowns in his four-year career at Michigan. In 2023 alone, he carried the ball 237 times for 1,111 yards (4.69 yards per carry, 79.36 yards per game) and 25 touchdowns.\n\nRome Odunze stats, height\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 215-pound Washington senior has caught 209 passes for 3,185 yards and 24 touchdowns in four seasons with the Huskies. In 2023 alone, he recorded 87 catches for 1,553 yards and 13 touchdowns.\n\nWill Jim Harbaugh leave Michigan for the NFL?\n\nAfter the win over Alabama in the Rose Bowl, a reporter asked Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh the big question: “There's a lot of interest in your future; I wonder if you can tell me what the chances are that the championship game might be your last one at Michigan?” Harbaugh danced away from it: “My future consists of a happy flight back to Ann Arbor, Michigan. Can't wait.\"\n\nSo, while Harbaugh isn’t talking, there is plenty of noise about his return to the NFL. So, the drum beat is there; and if this is Harbaugh’s last game, what will his legacy be at Michigan? Harbaugh has not just brought Michigan back. He has elevated the Wolverines to a new level. The Wolverines are 39-3 in the last three years. This team will finish in the top three for the third year in a row — the greatest stretch in school history. — Jeff Seidel, Detroit Free Press\n\nJim Harbaugh salary 2023: How much does he make at Michigan?\n\nJim Harbaugh's total pay for the 2023 season is $8,254,600. He has a maximum bonus amount of $3.275 million. His total earnings since going to Michigan in 2015 are $66,456,280, according to USA TODAY Sports’ database of college football coaching salaries.\n\nMichael Penix Jr. injury history\n\nOne season-ending injury is disappointing; two is heartbreaking. Incredibly, Michael Penix Jr. had to overcome four in as many years with the Indiana Hoosiers, the final two coming just as his college career seemed to be taking flight. Penix tore his ACL three games into his true freshman season in 2018, with the injury coming as he was splitting time with starter Peyton Ramsey in a close loss to Penn State. He injured his non-throwing shoulder nine games into the 2019 season, with Indiana sitting at 7-2, matching the Hoosiers' highest win total since 2007.\n\nHe put himself on the map during the COVID-19 season, tossing 14 touchdowns through five games before suffering another ACL tear in a win against Maryland. And he suffered another shoulder injury five games into the 2021 season, which saw Penix and Indiana struggle through a winless finish in Big Ten play.\n\n\"Yeah, man, those times were tough, but it just showed that I can get through anything. I can persevere and push through any hardship that comes my way,\" said Penix. \"But I'm just super blessed to be in this position now. I wouldn't change anything I've been through for anything. I feel like it's shaped me into the player and the person that I am today.\" Read Paul Myerberg's full feature on Penix here.\n\nMichigan vs. Washington national title game marks the end of college football as we know it\n\nIf Michigan wins its first outright national title since Harry Truman was president, it will be a massive perception-changer in the Midwest. But what does any of that really mean when college football is no longer a sport where regionality matters? What's the fun of comparing one conference to another when we now know the real argument is about which one makes the most money from its television contracts?\n\nSure, they’ll continue to keep score, but the most important game — the SEC vs. Big Ten — is going to continue until they finish consuming whatever parts they want from the rest of college sports. A few years ago, fans from both leagues could get into any SEC-Big Ten matchup because it was a clash of styles and ideologies. Now it’s a fight for TV windows and the scraps of other leagues that might collapse in the near future (looking at you, ACC). That’s not nearly as charming.\n\nBut on Monday, before college football goes completely corporate, we’re going to get a national champion that truly represents a conference and a region of the country. Sadly, it's the last time that will mean anything. Read Dan Wolken’s full column here.\n\nJim Harbaugh Michigan contract\n\nMichigan head coach Jim Harbaugh has reportedly had a contract extension in front of him that will make him one of the highest-paid figures in the sport. There have also been reports lately that he isn’t on board with all of the provisions in the deal, including one that would prevent him from engaging with NFL teams for at least the next year. There are also, perhaps, some contentious issues surrounding Michigan’s ability to get out of the contract if there are more significant NCAA violations found. — Dan Wolken\n\nJim Harbaugh NFL coaching career\n\nJim Harbaugh started his coaching career as an assistant coach at Western Kentucky in 1994 under his father. He was still playing in the NFL at the time, but held both jobs through the 2001 season. He then made the leap to full-time coaching in 2002, becoming the quarterbacks coach with the Oakland Raiders, a role he held for two seasons, which included a Super Bowl victory. He headed to Southern California to become the head coach of the University of San Diego, where he spent three seasons (2004-06), before helming Stanford (2007-10) and the San Francisco 49ers (2011-14). He has been at Michigan since 2015. Read Dan Wolken's column on what Harbaugh brings to college football.\n\nMichigan vs. Washington preview\n\nThe biggest factor in deciding the national championship may come down to this: Which team can dictate the flow of action on offense? Michigan will be hard to beat if running the ball effectively on first down and putting together the sort of sustained drives that would wear down the Huskies' defense. If able to get up and down the field by sharing the wealth among three of four receivers, Washington could give Michigan nightmarish flashbacks to the humbling loss to the Horned Frogs.\n\n\"Yeah, I think the aggressiveness is just who we are,\" Washington coach Kalen DeBoer said.\n\nDon't look for either team to shrink from the challenge. If ever in doubt in the first place, Michigan's physical and mental toughness has been solidified by the overtime win against the Crimson Tide. Washington's fortitude has been on display all throughout a season defined by narrow, single-possession wins. Which team blinks? Read Paul Myerberg’s full preview here.\n\nMichael Penix Jr. and what Washington teammates, Michigan rivals say about him\n\nIt's since leaving Indiana for Washington that quarterback Michael Penix Jr. has entered a new stratosphere, etching his place among the most successful quarterbacks of the decade with two seasons that stack up against the best in Pac-12 history.\n\n“He's different,\" said Washington running back Dillon Johnson.\n\nHe's \"the reason we're in the spot that we're in,\" said offensive lineman Julius Buelow.\n\n“He's that guy,\" wide receiver Rome Odunze said.\n\nPenix is special: In his production, in his unorthodox throwing motion, in his place in this record-setting offense and most of all in the way he's overcome injury, the Huskies' senior quarterback has built a name for himself that will outlast Monday night, when Washington meets Michigan in the College Football Playoff national championship game.\n\n\"He's got the 'it' factor,\" Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said. \"He's just got it.” Read Paul Myerberg’s full feature here.\n\nMichael Penix Jr. draft projection\n\nWashington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. is a case study in perseverance after suffering season-ending injuries in each of his four years at Indiana. He's remained healthy since joining the Huskies in 2022 and made a serious run at this year's Heisman Trophy before finishing second to LSU's Jayden Daniels. Injury concerns could lead Penix to drop a bit come April's NFL draft, but he shouldn't fall far. — Paul Myerberg\n\nIs Michael Penix Jr. left-handed?\n\nYes, Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. is left-handed. Read Paul Myerberg's full feature on Penix here.\n\nJ.J. McCarthy draft projection\n\nMichigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy might be a first-round pick this spring but would be in contention to be the first quarterback off the board if he delays that draft decision another year, so the true junior will have a difficult decision to make after the national championship. He's agile, careful with the football and perhaps a little constrained by the Wolverines' offensive scheme, so McCarthy's best ball could ahead of him. — Paul Myerberg\n\nHow old is J.J. McCarthy?\n\nJ.J. McCarthy turns 21 on Jan. 20, 2024. Read Paul Myerberg on the greatest Michigan QBs ever and if McCarthy tops the list.\n\nHow will Michigan's defense fare against Michael Penix Jr.?\n\nThe Wolverines haven't faced a quarterback anywhere close to Washington QB Michael Penix Jr. The closest analog might be Maryland's Taulia Tagovailoa, who threw for 247 yards and completed 67.7% of his attempts on Nov. 18 but was undone by two interceptions in Michigan's 31-24 win. Penix is in a different class. On the biggest stage of his career, he showed why he might be the best quarterback in college football − and why Washington is poised to ride his arm to a national title. \"Man, the job's not finished,\" Penix said. \"I feel like it's definitely going to take more. I'm going to push myself to get this team more next week. And, man, we're just super excited for the opportunity for sure.\" Read Paul Myerberg's full story here.\n\nJ.J. McCarthy scouting report\n\nA good bit of faith is required in this projection — J.J. McCarthy going 13th to the Oakland Raiders. The Michigan quarterbak is hardly a finished product as a potential early first-round prospect – and he hasn't even declared his intentions for next year yet. But his athleticism and arm strength will position him to be selected far earlier than some might expect based off his production. After the failed Jimmy Garoppolo move, it's time for the Raiders to make a substantial investment in a young quarterback to develop for the long term. — Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz, in his latest NFL mock draft\n\nMichigan vs. Washington all-time record, history\n\nThe Wolverines and Huskies have played 13 times since 1953. Michigan holds the edge, 8-5.\n\nKalen DeBoer salary\n\nKalen DeBoer is in his second season with Washington and earned $4.2 million in 2023 with a max bonus of $1.25 million, according to USA TODAY Sports’ database of college football coaching salaries. In 2022, he earned $3,100,008 with a max bonus of $1.175 million.\n\nWashington vs. Michigan last game\n\nThe Huskies and Wolverines last played in on Sept. 11, 2021.

Ohio State, meanwhile, would claim its ninth title all-time.\n\nREQURIED READING:College Football Playoff title game matches Ohio State, Notre Dame: Three keys to game\n\nHowever, there is no universal consensus among college football programs and the NCAA on national championship titles, as there are claimed and unclaimed championship titles. The Associated Press began the modern era of college football in 1936, when it tabbed Minnesota as its first national champion. The UPI, precursor to the Coaches Poll, awarded its first title to Oklahoma in 1950.\n\nCollege football did not have its first official championship game until the 1998 season, when Tennessee beat Florida State in the 1999 BCS championship game — and still the sport saw a split national championship in 2003, when Nick Saban-led LSU won the Coaches Poll national championship by way of winning the BCS championship game. USC, meanwhile, was awarded the AP title. The highest division of the sport didn't see a playoff until 16 years later, with the advent of the CFP.\n\nWith that said, ahead of Monday's CFP championship game here's what you need to know on who has the most claimed national championships in college football and more:\n\nPODCAST:Ohio State, Notre Dame play in CFP national title game. College Football Fix discusses\n\nWhich college football team has most national championships?\n\nAmong Division I FBS teams, Alabama holds the record for most claimed national championship titles: 18.\n\nThe Crimson Tide won its first national championship in 1925 under Wallace Wade in the Rose Bowl against Washington, and repeated the year after. Alabama would win 12 combined national championship games under Paul \"Bear\" Bryant (1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978 and 1979) and Nick Saban (2009, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2020).\n\nHowever, if you were to include NCAA-recognized titles, Yale, an Ivy League school that plays in the FCS, would claim the most national championship titles in college football, at 18 (compared to Alabama's 16).\n\nMost college football national championships\n\nWhen Notre Dame and Ohio State meet in Monday's CFP national championship game, they will represent the programs with the third- and sixth-most claimed national championships, respectively.\n\nThe Irish will play for their first national championship trophy since 1988, while the Buckeyes will play for their first since 2014 — the first year of the College Football Playoff.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the current Division I FBS teams with the most claimed national titles:\n\nSeasons listed in parentheses\n\n1.

It's the first Rose Bowl for U-M in 15 years.\n\nWashington-Texas will be in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans.\n\nThe mission to return to the CFP began when Jim Harbaugh was suspended for three games, twice, to begin and end the regular season.\n\nThe first suspension was handed down by the university in relation to a series of Level II recruiting violations levied against the program by the NCAA as well as one Level I violation that said Harbaugh himself misled NCAA investigators.\n\nThen, Harbaugh missed three games last month — the team's first top 10 road game of the year Penn State, the program's 1,000th victory at Maryland and the team's third consecutive victory, 30-24, over Ohio State to clinch the Big Ten East — when Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti was the one to lay down the hammer.\n\nSHAWN WINDSOR:Michigan earned confetti with Big Ten title. But questions remain for biggest stage\n\nFormer staffer Connor Stalions, who has since resigned, was at the center of the college football landscape this season for his alleged sign stealing plot. Evidence suggests it lasted more than three years and extended to more than 30 different games, where Stalions would have accomplices record the sidelines of future Michigan opponents and he would then time it up with the plays that happened in the game and de-code opponents signals.\n\nThough Harbaugh was not shown to have any connection to the scheme, Petitti determined as the representative of the team, he had violated the league's sportsmanship policy. Michigan had said the program was going to fight the ruling in court and even had a hearing set, but 24 hours before it was scheduled, attorneys who represented Harbaugh and the U-M Board of Regents accepted the punishment, sidelining Harbaugh until the postseason.\n\nThat moment came Saturday night. Though there was a chance for a real moment, normally the commissioner delivers the championship trophy to the head coach of the winning team, Harbaugh instead passed on the opportunity for the interaction and had captain and recently injured Zak Zinter (broken tibia and fibula) accept it on behalf of the team.\n\nIt's the second time in program history Michigan has won 13 games in a year and makes the Wolverines just the fifth program in the history of college football to begin 13-0 in consecutive seasons.\n\nJ.J. McCarthy completed 74.2% of his passes (213 of 287) for 2,630 yards, 19 touchdowns and four interceptions as he was named Big Ten Quarterback of the Year, Blake Corum ran 218 times for 1,018 yards (4.7 yards per attempt) and set a program record with 24 touchdowns and Roman Wilson's 11 receiving touchdowns are the most by a pass catcher since Mario Manningham (12, 2007).\n\nBut mostly, the defense was something fierce and production came from all over the field.\n\nU-M finished No. 1 in scoring defense (10.25 points pre game) and defensive touchdowns allowed (five), No. 2 in total defense (246.8 yards per game) and first downs allowed (13.2 per game) and No. 3 in turnover margin (21 takeaways forced, eight turnovers).\n\nThree defensive backs scored touchdowns this season: Mike Sainristil led the unit with five interceptions and two touchdowns — he forced two fumbles in Saturday's game vs. Iowa on top of that — Will Johnson had three picks (one touchdown) and Keon Sabb had two picks (one touchdown).\n\nMICHIGAN FOOTBALL GRADES:Defense is perfect with shutout of Iowa in Big Ten championship\n\nA trio of edge rushers Jaylen Harrell (6½), Josaiah Stewart (4½) and Derrick Moore (four) led the way in sacks and the linebacker trio of Junior Colson (79 tackles), Michael Barrett (52 tackles) and Ernest Hausmann (45 tackles) led the way in tackles. Barrett also forced a team-high three fumbles and recovered two.\n\nMichigan had 28 players — 11 on offense, 14 on defense, three on special teams — earn all-league honors.\n\nTwice U-M has come this far and come up short, losing the 2021 Orange Bowl, 34-11, to Georgia and the 2022 Fiesta Bowl, 51-45, to TCU.\n\nContact Tony Garcia: apgarcia@freepress.com.

Now, the Wolverines will look to make program history and win their first national championship game.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Michigan's national championship history.\n\nHow many national championships does Michigan have?\n\nHeading into this season, the NCAA officially recognized nine national championships for Michigan football, tied for sixth-most in the NCAA along with USC. However, the University of Michigan claims a total of 11 national championships.\n\nAccording to the NCAA, the Wolverines have titles in 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1918, 1923, 1933, 1948 and 1997. Michigan also claims titles in 1932 and 1947, the latter of which saw the Wolverines win the Rose Bowl as part of a 10-0 season.\n\nWith Monday's 34-13 victory against Washington, though, the Wolverines were able to claim their first outright national championship since 1948, giving them 10 national titles. Their 10th ring breaks a tie with USC and vaults Michigan into fifth place among college football programs in all-time championships.\n\nPrior to this season, Michigan had yet to win or participate in a national championship since the College Football Playoff committee was introduced in 2014.\n\nWhen was Michigan football's last national championship?\n\nBefore its win against Washington, Michigan hadn't secured a national championship for almost 25 years, with its last victory dating back to 1997. That season saw the Wolverines go 12-0 in coach Lloyd Carr's third season, with wins over the following ranked opponents:\n\nNo. 8 Colorado\n\nNo. 15 Iowa\n\nNo. 15 Michigan State\n\nNo. 2 Penn State\n\nNo. 23 Wisconsin\n\nNo. 4 Ohio State\n\nNo. 8 Washington State\n\nDespite the impressive season by the Wolverines, which included a Heisman Trophy for defensive back Charles Woodson Jr., Michigan did not win the outright title: Though they finished ranked No. 1 in the AP Top 25, they finished No. 2 in the Coaches Poll behind Tom Osborne's undefeated Nebraska team, which likewise finished No. 2 in the AP poll.\n\nThe majority of Michigan's national championships were earned prior to the commencement of the Associated Press Poll era in 1936, which generally considered the first season of the modern college football era. Because Michigan's most recent title was in 1997, it has never had a chance to participate in a national championship game, as the first season of the BCS wasn't until a year later.\n\nREQUIRED READING:Michigan football's J.J. McCarthy on sign-stealing: '(The players) did things the right way'\n\nMichigan national championship history\n\nMichigan boasts a rich history of championships, as it started competing in collegiate football back in 1879. The NCAA has recognized nine of Michigan's national championships, while the university claims the 1932 and 1947 national titles as well.\n\nHere's a list of Michigan's national championships, along with their corresponding record and the major selectors of that specific year:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2024/01/04/michigan-football-national-championships-history-what-to-know/72109050007/", "title": "How many national championships has Michigan won? Wolverines ...", "text": "Editor’s note: For the latest updates and highlights from Michigan vs. Washington in the national championship game, follow USA TODAY Sports’ live coverage.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines are one of the most historic — and successful — college football teams in the country, but they'll be achieving a program first when they play in the national championship game.\n\nAfter defeating the Alabama Crimson Tide in the Rose Bowl, the Wolverines will face the Washington Huskies in Houston on Monday in the College Football Playoff national championship game.\n\nMichigan already made college football history earlier this season when it became the first program to win 1,000 games. The Wolverines are no strangers when it comes to having national championship history, ranking in the top 10 for most titles.\n\nBut the matchup against the Huskies will give the Wolverines a chance to do something it has never done before: win a national championship game. That may sound confusing, but a look back at the history of Michigan's 144-year history shows how the program can achieve a first on Monday.\n\nWASHINGTON: Have the Huskies ever won a national championship in football?\n\nHere's everything to know about Michigan's national championship history:\n\nHow many national titles has Michigan won?\n\nIt depends on who you asked.\n\nSince starting play in 1879, Michigan has nine national championships, according to the NCAA, tied for sixth most in the NCAA along with Southern California.\n\nHowever, Michigan says it has won 11 national championship games.\n\nWhen was Michigan's last national title?\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since Michigan last claimed a national championship, last winning one in 1997. Michigan also won most of its national championship before the poll era, which began in 1936.\n\nAccording to the NCAA, the Wolverines have titles in: 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1918, 1923, 1933, 1948, 1997. Michigan says it also has won titles in 1932 and 1947.\n\nMichigan national championship game history\n\nTechnically, the Wolverines have never won a national championship game, so Monday's game could be the first time it ever wins one.\n\nThe reasoning for that is Michigan's last national championship came in 1997, one year before the BCS was created. National championship games were formed with the creation of the BCS, but before then, national championships were decided by polls typically by the coaches’ poll, administered solely or jointly by USA TODAY since 1991, or the Associated Press (AP) poll.\n\nSo in short, Michigan's nine, or 11, national championships come from ones it claimed. Here's how the school determined \"won\" its championships.\n\n1901: Billingsley, Helms, Houlgate and National Championship Foundation.\n\n1902: Billingsley, Helms, Houlgate, National Championship Foundation and Parke Davis.\n\n1903: Billingsley and National Championship Foundation.\n\n1904: Billingsley and National Championship Foundation.\n\n1918: Billingsley and National Championship Foundation.\n\n1923: Billingsley and National Championship Foundation.\n\n1932: Dickinson and Parke Davis.\n\n1933: Billingsley, Boand, College Football Research Association, Dickinson, Helms, Houlgate, Football Research, National Championship Foundation and Parke Davis.\n\n1947: Associated Press, Berryman, Billingsley, Boand, DeVold, Dunkel, Football Research, Helms, Houlgate, Litkenhous and National Championship Foundation.\n\n1948: Associated Press, Berryman, Billingsley, Boand, DeVold, Dunkel, Football Research, Helms, Houlgate, Litkenhous, National Championship Foundation and Williamson.\n\n1997: Associated Press, National Football Foundation and Football Writer's Association.\n\nHere's a quick look at those Michigan national championship teams:\n\nMichigan 1901 national championship team\n\nLed by Fielding Yost, Michigan won its first title after finishing 11-0. That season, Michigan didn't allow a single point, outscoring opponents 550-0. The most eye-opening result came against Buffalo, when it won 128-0. That year was also Michigan's first bowl game in school history, beating Stanford 49-0 in the first Rose Bowl.\n\nMichigan 1902 national championship team\n\nMichigan had another undefeated season with an 11-0 record. Michigan allowed points this season, but still outscored opponents by a whopping 644-12 with nine shutouts. That season, Michigan beat Michigan Agriculture, 119-0.\n\nMichigan 1903 national championship team\n\nThe third-straight title came with a tie, finishing the season 11-0-1. The tie came from a 6-6 result at Minnesota. Michigan would shutout every other opponent that season, outscoring teams 565-6.\n\nMichigan 1904 national championship team\n\nThe fourth-straight title came after a 10-0 season, with eight games resulting in shutouts. That season, Michigan beat West Virginia 130-0.\n\nMichigan 1918 national championship team\n\nMichigan won another national title during the end of World War I, finishing a shortened season at 5-0. Four of those games were shutouts, outscoring opponents 96-6.\n\nMichigan 1923 national championship team\n\nMichigan won another title in Yost's final season as head coach, sending him off with a sixth national championship after an 8-0 season.\n\nMichigan 1932 national championship team\n\nHarry Kipke won his first national championship as Michigan's head coach following an 8-0 season. On this team was backup center Gerald Ford, who would become the 38th president of the United States.\n\nMichigan 1933 national championship team\n\nKipke led his team to back-to-back national championships after finishing the season 7-0-1. The tie that season came in a scoreless game against Minnesota. Ford was also on this national championship team.\n\nMichigan 1947 national championship team\n\nThis is Michigan's first claimed national championship in the poll era. Led by head coach Herbert \"Fritz\" Crisler, Michigan went 10-0 and capped off the season with a 49-0 win over Southern California in the Rose Bowl, the Wolverines' second ever bowl game. This season was significant as Michigan finished No. 1 in the AP Poll in the first ever post-bowl game rankings.\n\nMichigan 1948 national championship team\n\nThe Wolverines achieved back-to-back undefeated season's in Bennie Oosterbaan's first season as head coach, going 9-0 that season. The national title was claimed without a Rose Bowl appearance, because back then teams were prohibited from playing in more than one Rose Bowl Game in a three-year span.\n\nMichigan 1997 national championship team\n\nMichigan snapped its longest national championship drought in 1997 when Lloyd Carr's team went 12-0. Led by Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson, the Wolverines would win the Rose Bowl against Washington State, 21-16, in the final season before the invention of the BCS.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/university-michigan/wolverines/2023/12/02/michigan-football-game-recap-big-ten-title-iowa-third-straight/71781153007/", "title": "Michigan football wins third straight Big Ten title, 26-0 over Iowa", "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — The game seemed a formality from the beginning. At no point was there any doubt.\n\nWhen Michigan football's Semaj Morgan set a Big Ten record with an 87-yard punt return late in the first quarter and Blake Corum was in the end zone two plays later, Lucas Oil Stadium felt more like Ann Arbor South than the league's centrally located indoor stadium.\n\nBut the reality really set in early in the third quarter when a review determined Mike Sainristil had forced his second fumble of the game, and Michigan's offense was again set up with first-and-goal.\n\nCorum plowed his way into the end zone once more — the 55th time in his career to tie Anthony Thomas for the Michigan program record — as U-M suffocated Iowa, 26-0, to win the 2023 Big Ten championship on Saturday.\n\n\"I've been trying to grasp it because I'vee been watching on TV the last two years and I'm finally in it, so it feels real to me,\" Morgan said. \"I've been telling people my whole college journey these, just this whole 10 months, 11 months, it feels like a dream to me.\n\n\"The team I'm on, the coaches I'm around, everybody that supports us. Feels like a dream, like a movie.\"\n\nIt's the first time in 144 seasons of Michigan football that the Wolverines have won three consecutive outright Big Ten titles.\n\nBOOK IT:Celebrate Michigan football's historic Big Ten three-peat with a special book offer!\n\nWhile it certainly makes a statement about the past three seasons — Michigan is now 39-3 during that stretch, now in consideration for the best era of all-time — it most importantly keeps the dream alive in 2023, as U-M is assured to be one of four teams in the College Football Playoff.\n\nWho or where Michigan will play? That's another, not-yet-clear, story, but a trip to Pasadena, California, and the Rose Bowl seems the most likely scenario. The College Football Playoff committee, which includes U-M athletic director Warde Manuel, will announce its decision at noon Sunday.\n\n\"I was just talking in the locker room to (former U-M wide receiver) Jason Avant and he was saying how he played in two Rose bowls,\" said Cornelius Johnson, who had a team-high nine catches for 64 yards, on which destination he would prefer. \"Especially like for the history of it, at Michigan and in the Big Ten.\n\n\"But I mean the Sugar Bowl, either one, never been to New Orleans in my life. So it would be fun to see.\"\n\nThe Wolverines (13-0) won't be sweating their spot in the field because they didn't overlook the Hawkeyes. As ugly as it was, U-M put together a simple, yet effective (enough) game plan. J.J. McCarthy completed 22 of 30 passes for 147 yards and Corum added 16 rushes for 52 yards and two scores.\n\nSHAWN WINDSOR:Michigan earned confetti with Big Ten championship. But questions remain for biggest stage\n\nBut the defense was the star of the day.\n\nThe unit forced more punts (seven) than allowed first downs (five). It also forced two turnovers and three turnovers on downs and also came away with the second shutout in Big Ten title game history, led by Sainristil who had two forced fumbles, a quarterback hit, a pass break up and a tackle.\n\n\"Just a playmaker, when a play has to be made, when the magic needs to happen, Mike makes it happen,\" head coach Jim Harbaugh said. \"It's been game after game. Especially down the stretch here these final four games, he has been a stalwart.\n\n\"He intercepts, makes the big hit, makes the big hit in the fumble, causes a fumble. Just an incredible player.\"\n\nOffense struggles early\n\nThe Wolverines' best drive of the half was their first, when they marched methodically down the field.\n\nMcCarthy found AJ Barner for a gain of 13 to get to midfield, then found his other tight end, Colston Loveland, on fourth-and-7 to keep the drive alive a few plays later. The Wolverines again faced fourth-and-1 later on the possession, but center Drake Nugent left the game on the play prior with an injury, so U-M, satisfied it had milked more than 7 minutes off the clock, opted for a 35-yard James Turner field goal to take an early 3-0 lead.\n\nRAINER SABIN:Michigan's Big Ten title merely a stop toward the summit of eternal greatness\n\nHowever, that drive represented nearly half (52) of U-M's first-half total yards (111), in what was the most sluggish offensive half of the season. Michigan punted on four straight drives in the period before McCarthy was sacked on the final play of the half.\n\n\"Uncharacteristically we had some drops and uncharacteristically we had some protection issues andthings that we'll work on, and definitely Zak (Zinter) was missed,\" Harbaugh said. \"I mean, (McCarthy never hung his head. Never got on anybody. He has just got this demeanor, and the more you hit him, the more he is just motivated to come back, which is amazing.\"\n\nThe only time Michigan's offense scored a touchdown, a two-yard run by Corum, was with 1:07 to play in the first quarter and that was set up by Morgan's show-stopping punt return effort.\n\nOn U-M's third drive, Trente Jones was flagged for holding and McCarthy was sacked on third down to force a punt. Then, facing third-and-10 on the next drive, McCarthy tried to extend the play with his legs but slipped and fell for a sack.\n\nAnother three-and-out followed, then a quick punt when Loveland dropped a would-be first down on third-and-6. The Wolverines finished the half 1-for-7 on third down and taking sack yards into consideration, their 15 rushing attempts tallied 16 yards.\n\n\"Today's performance, it wasn't our best, but there's nothing better than winning,\" Corum said. \"It got the job done. Shout-out to the defense, special teams... Iowa's defense was good, but we have things to clean up.\"\n\nDefense holds strong\n\nThe reason none of U-M's offensive struggles mattered, other than as a point of frustration for fans, was because Jesse Minter's defense stifled the Hawkeyes from the get-go.\n\nTHAT WASN'T AWKWARD:Jim Harbaugh passes on encounter with Big Ten commissioner at trophy presentation\n\nIowa's longest play of the first half? An 8-yard pass to Nico Ragaini that came with 6:00 left and got the Hawkeyes to the Michigan 30. The only reason the Hawkeyes were in scoring position was because a Tommy Doman punt bounced directly backward, netted just 25 yards and was downed at the U-M 38.\n\nBut three plays later, on third-and-2 from the U-M 30, Sainristil forced a fumble and Kris Jenkins recovered it to keep Iowa off the board. Though that was the most notable play, there were a number that continued to set Iowa behind the sticks.\n\nOn the first drive of the second quarter, Sainristil jumped a third-and-3 pass and nearly came away with an interception, but settled for a pass breakup. On Iowa's next drive, Kenneth Grant blew up a first-down run for a loss of 3.\n\nThe drive after that was the Jenkins fumble recovery, and the time after that, Josaiah Stewart came away with a batted ball at the line of scrimmage to force a three-and-out, before one final punt.\n\nIowa netted 61 yards in the half and had six punts compared to two first downs.\n\n\"Glorious defensive performance,\" Harbaugh said. \"Just tremendous, lights-out. Three-and-outs, I think we're maybe four on the game. Then one first down and out. Incredible shutout. How many turnovers were there?\n\n\"Three or four — three plus the four fourth-down stops. That's, like, seven turnovers. And giving the ball to the offense in great position. So just spectacular\"\n\nThe final touches\n\nMichigan's offense crossed midfield to open the half and punted shortly thereafter, but the special teams helped bail the offense out and pinned Iowa at its five. On second down of that drive, Sainristil came flying around the right edge to make the game-changing play\n\nThe call on the field was an incompletion, and the reaction from many when it went to review was that the replay didn't do much to overturn that. The call, however, was reversed and the result was a career-high seventh turnover forced by Sainristil.\n\nWHO'S NEXT?Here's who the CFP committee should pick to face Michigan in the Rose Bowl\n\nOn its next possession, U-M's defense allowed two first downs for the first time all day, but Junior Colson and Michael Barrett went over the pile and stopped a tush-push attempt on fourth-and-1 to stifle the drive.\n\nThen, in the fourth quarter, Braiden McGregor swatted Iowa quarterback Deacon Hill's throwing arm and forced a fumble, which Grant jumped on. However, much like after the defense forced a turnover on downs, Michigan's offense couldn't capitalize on a short field and had to settle for a field goal.\n\nTurner finished the day 4-for-4 on field goals — the three in the second half were from 46 yards, 36 yards and then a Big Ten title game record 50-yarder with 3:38 to play in the game.\n\n\"To me, it feels 10 out of 10 happy,\" Harbaugh said. \"Like it did last year, and like it did in '21.\"\n\nContact Tony Garcia: apgarcia@freepress.com.

Washington is looking for its first national title since winning the coaches vote following the 1991 season (with Miami winning the AP vote).\n\nSHAWN WINDSOR:Michigan football proves what it knew along: The Wolverines belong among the best\n\nScouting report\n\nWhen the Wolverines have the ball: Which U-M offense will show up? The one that compensated for an offensive line yet to jell by passing for 257.1 yards a game over its first nine outings (admittedly against sub-par competition)? Or the one that, with an ailing J.J. McCarthy at QB, largely ditched the pass, averaging just over half that (132.5 yards) against Maryland, Penn State, Ohio State and Iowa? Despite the run game’s inconsistency all year, Jim Harbaugh and Sherrone Moore never abandoned it, with the Wolverines rushing at least 31 times in every game. (For comparison’s sake, the Huskies reached 31 rushes just four times in 2023.) So, yes, Blake Corum will get his touches, and probably a TD or two to add to his status as Michigan’s career leader in touchdowns (he’s at 58, after passing Anthony Thomas in Monday’s Rose Bowl).\n\nWhen the Huskies have the ball: No FBS team averaged more air yards than Washington did with Michael Penix Jr. executing Kalen DeBoer’s offense; the Huskies threw it 37.2 times a game (good for 13th in the nation) for 343.8 yards (first), making for a crisp 9.2 yards per attempt (11th). That’ll make for an ideal strength-vs.-strength matchup, as the Wolverines allowed the second fewest passing yards per game (152.6) and had the fourth-lowest passer efficiency rating against (100.8). After Penix was punished by opposing defenses in three seasons at Indiana, DeBoer’s crew has kept him nearly spotless — Washington allowed just 11 sacks in 13 games. That’s another bone to dangle in front of the Wolverines’ “we-fense,” which had a good-but-not-great 32 sacks through its first 13 games in 2023.\n\nRAINER SABIN:Michigan football's comeback win in Rose Bowl extends dream season, allows fans to celebrate\n\nKnow the foe\n\nPenix rising: Despite playing his sixth season of college ball, the 2023 Heisman Trophy runner-up has just 47 appearances, thanks to injuries and 2020’s abbreviated season. (J.J. McCarthy has 38 in just three years.) That includes three years in the Big Ten with Indiana, where, despite being in the same division as the Wolverines, he faced them just once: IU’s 38-21 victory in November 2020. DeBoer had moved on to Fresno State, but Penix did just fine, completing 30 of 50 passes for 342 yards and three TDs.\n\nBuilding Rome: Leading receiver Rome Odunze — that’s pronounced “ROAM oh-DUNE-zay” — caught 81 passes for 1,428 yards, with plenty of highlight reel grabs, but his most impressive feat came off the field in late September. After taking a knee to his ribs during an onside kick in Washington’s win over Arizona, Odunze was diagnosed with a broken rib and a punctured lung. The Huskies were off the following week, but faced rival Oregon the week after that, leaving Odunze no choice: “I was going to play [against Oregon after a bye] regardless,” Odunze told the Seattle Times. “So attacking my rehab with that mindset … that was going to be the outcome regardless of how I felt.” That meant a 23-hour car ride in a rented Chrysler 300 from Arizona to Seattle — the lung meant he wasn’t allowed to fly — just to get back to practice. And then, two weeks later, hauling in eight passes for 128 yards and two TDs.\n\nSorry, Mr. Jackson: There’ll be at least one familiar face on the Washington sideline for the Wolverines: receiver Giles Jackson, who spent two seasons in Ann Arbor before shipping out to Seattle ahead of the 2021 seaso. Jackson caught 24 passes for 309 yards as a Wolverine; he hasn’t done much more as a Husky — 50 catches for 521 yards, including 14 for 106 and a TD this season.\n\nRyan Ford’s two cents\n\nComing up Roses: It’s almost a shame this game will be played under the retractable roof of NRG Stadium in Houston, rather than under the shadows of the San Gabriel Mountains, as U-M and UW have met four times in the Rose Bowl. (U-M won the 1981 and 1993 editions, while UW won in 1978 and 1992, with the latter sealing a split national title for the Huskies.) In all, Michigan is 8-5 against Washington, though the Wolverines are riding a two-game win streak (2002, 2021) in the series.\n\nThe Bigger Ten: One way or another, a Big Ten school will be raising a national championship banner come September, as Washington is set to ditch the Pac-12 (of which it was a founding member in 1915) for the chilly climes and bigger TV checks of the Midwest come August. Also, one way or another, the loser of this one gets a rematch this fall, as the Wolverines are set to visit Husky Stadium on the shores of Lake Washington on Oct. 5. (The Huskies will hit the Big House soon enough, too, with a visit to Ann Arbor slated for sometime in 2025.)\n\nMichigan vs. Washington prediction\n\nPenix is a more polished passer than the QB U-M just dealt with (Jalen Milroe), though he doesn’t present nearly the challenge with his legs. Add in that the Wolverines’ offense is the most two-dimensional the Huskies have seen this year, the four-team CFP era should come to a close just as it began: With a (legacy) Big Ten team hoisting the trophy in Houston.

With a win, the Longhorns could further entrench themselves for a playoff spot, and potentially a first-round bye.\n\nMeanwhile, the Aggies — coming off a 43-41 loss to Auburn in four overtimes last week — enter the game fully in control of their CFP destiny. But they need a win over the Longhorns and, likely, the Bulldogs to win make the playoff as the SEC's automatic qualifier.\n\nIt's only fitting that the first SEC matchup between Texas and Texas A&M, and the first in 13 years, has so much at stake. Here's what you need to know about the Texas-Texas A&M football rivalry, including records, stats and more:\n\nTexas-Texas A&M football history\n\nTexas and Texas A&M have played 118 times in their respective histories. At the time the rivalry was put in hiatus in 2012, when the Aggies left for the SEC, it was the third-longest college football rivalry in the sport.\n\nThe Longhorns lead the all-time series 76-37-5, including a 10-game winning streak between 1957-66. The Aggies' longest win streak in the series was six games, lasting from 1984-89. The series ran uninterrupted from 1915 until 2011, when the Aggies left the Big 12 for the SEC.\n\nThe largest margin of victory in rivalry history came in the teams' second-ever meeting in 1898, when the Longhorns won 48-0. The last meeting between the two programs came on Nov. 24, 2011, when Justin Tucker hit a game-winning field goal as time expired to give the Longhorns a 27-25 win.\n\nTexas record vs Texas A&M\n\nSeries record: Texas leads 76-37-5\n\nTexas leads 76-37-5 Texas' last win: 2011 (27-25 in College Station)\n\n2011 (27-25 in College Station) Texas A&M's last win: 2010 (24-17 in Austin)\n\nThe first matchup between Texas and Texas A&M occurred on Friday, Oct. 19, 1894, with the Longhorns earning a 38-0 shutout win over the Aggies in Austin. Texas won the first seven matchups of the series, and the eighth ended in a 0-0 tie on Oct. 25, 1902.\n\nTexas A&M got on the board with a 12-0 win on Nov. 27, 1902, in Austin, in the teams' second matchup of the season. It wasn't until Nov. 19, 1915, that the teams played in College Station, with Texas A&M winning 13-0. The first 21 matchups were played in Austin (12 times), San Antonio (four), Houston (four) and Dallas (once).\n\nTexas vs Texas A&M on Thanksgiving\n\nThe Texas-Texas A&M matchup has been a staple for much of history during the final weekend of the regular season until the teams stopped playing after the 2011 season. Most of the Texas and Texas A&M football matchups have occurred on Thanksgiving day, with 69 games on the holiday.\n\nAfter both schools joined the Big 12 Conference in 1996, the teams played on Black Friday until 2017. They returned to playing on Thanksgiving from 2008 until the series was paused in 2011. However, a return to the holiday game is unlikely for the rivalry, mainly because the NFL moved from two Thanksgiving day games to three in 2006.\n\nTexas athletic director Chris Del Conte, however, expressed a desire for a return to a Thanksgiving day game in February.\n\n\"Obviously, this year is gonna be played on Saturday,\" Del Conte said. \"My goal is that we move that game back to Thursday [Thanksgiving].\"\n\nTexas vs Texas A&M recent football games\n\nTexas has won 12 of the last 17 matchups between the programs, including a 7-3 record in the previous 10 games. Here's a look at the 10 most recent games between Texas and Texas A&M.

Coach Jim Harbaugh was in his first year of coaching at the University of San Diego, and just three years removed from playing in the NFL. But Michigan is not without some heavy-duty championship history, despite its first appearance in the Big Ten championship, adopted in 2011.\n\nSaturday clinched the Wolverines’ 43rd conference title, dating back to 1898 and the early days of the Western Intercollegiate Conference. It was also their 18th outright conference title (though the last came in 2003) and their 23rd share of first place since the Western Intercollegiate Conference admitted Michigan State and became the Big Ten we all know and love.\n\nSATURDAY'S GAME:Michigan wins Big Ten title with 42-3 win over Iowa, College Football Playoff next\n\nRELIVE AN EPIC SEASON! Celebrate Michigan football's historic Big Ten championship with a new Free Press book!\n\nSHAWN WINDSOR:Michigan's amazing renaissance story is still far from ending\n\nAnd so, with Michigan — as the song goes — “victors valiant” and “conquering heroes” once again, let’s look back at the Wolverines’ 42 previous conference championships.\n\n1898 (tie): 10-0, 3-0\n\nThe Wolverines’ three Western Intercollegiate Conference (the Big Ten’s predecessor) wins looked more like a homestand for the Tigers (who were three years from existence): 6-5 over Northwestern, 12-5 over Illinois and 12-11 over Chicago.\n\n1901: 11-0, 4-0\n\nFielding H. Yost’s first team outscored its Western opponents — Indiana, Northwestern, Chicago and Iowa — by a combined 134-0 before beating Stanford, 49-0, in the Rose Bowl and claiming U-M's first national title.\n\n1902: 11-0, 5-0\n\nThe national champion Wolverines finally allowed a point in league play under Yost when they beat Minnesota, 23-6, in the season finale (after beating Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa and Chicago 194-0 in the first four).\n\n1903 (tie): 11-0-1, 3-0-1\n\nThe Golden Gophers strike again: A 6-6 tie with Minnesota on Halloween accounted for the only points allowed all season by Yost’s Wolverines. (They scored 559 against the rest of their schedule for U-M’s third straight national title.)\n\n1904 (tie): 10-0, 2-0\n\nWas the nation catching up with the Wolverines? Six points allowed to (then-independent) Ohio State, only 28 points scored against Wisconsin and 12 allowed to Chicago in the Nov. 12 home finale. (By the way, Minnesota went 3-0 in conference —with a 56-0 point differential to U-M’s 50-12.)\n\n1906 (tie): 4-1, 1-0\n\nThe Wolverines adapted well in the first year of the legal forward pass, beating Illinois, 28-9, to tie 3-0 Wisconsin and 2-0 Minnesota atop the conference.\n\n1918 (tie): 5-0, 2-0\n\nThis sounds familiar: A pandemic-stricken season ended with a two-score (14-0) win over Ohio State … and then a national title, as Michigan State (then known as Michigan Agricultural College, and playing as an independent) was the only team to score on U-M.\n\nBIG TEN INSIDER:Why Michigan's Big Ten title will reverberate in the years ahead\n\n1922 (tie): 6-0-1, 4-0\n\nThis sounds familiar, Part II: Iowa (5-0 in league play) and Michigan topped the standings as the Wolverines beat Ohio State (19-0), Illinois (24-0), Wisconsin (13-6) and Minnesota (16-7).\n\n1923: 8-0, 4-0\n\nThe Wolverines added another national title, but did it the hard way, with conference wins over Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota by a combined 19 points. (They still beat Ohio State by 23.)\n\n1925: 7-1, 5-1\n\nEven a 3-2 loss to Northwestern couldn’t derail Michigan as the Wolverines outscored their five other conference foes (Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio State and Minnesota) 132-0.\n\n1926 (tie): 7-1, 5-0\n\nMichigan split the conference title with Northwestern in Yost’s final season; the Wolverines outscored their foes 94-22 while the Wildcats lapped the field 114-13.\n\n1930 (tie): 8-0-1, 5-0\n\nFormer U-M captain Harry Kipke coached a squad that was offensively challenged. After beating Eastern Michigan 7-0 and a scoreless tie vs. Michigan State, the Wolverines scored 14 against Purdue, 13 against Ohio State, 15 against Illinois, seven against Minnesota and 16 against Chicago in the season finale.\n\n1931 (tie): 8-1-1, 5-1\n\nThe Wolverines shared the title with Purdue and Northwestern, two of the three teams they didn’t play during the season. (The other, Iowa, went 0-3-1 to finish ninth in conference.)\n\n1932 (tie): 8-0, 6-0\n\nNorthwestern scored six points in Michigan’s nine-point win in the conference opener. The Wolverines, held their other five league foes scoreless while averaging 11.3 points to win a national title. (Michigan shared the league title with Purdue, which tied Northwestern in late October.)\n\n1933 (tie): 7-0-1, 5-0-1\n\nOnly a 0-0 tie with Minnesota on Nov. 18 marred the Wolverines’ record; they shared the title with the Gophers, who won twice in conference play and racked up three other ties. Michigan also won its eighth national title.\n\n1943 (tie): 8-1-0, 6-0\n\nFritz Crisler’s squad held all six of its conference foes to seven points or less, including a shutout of Wisconsin. Co-champ Purdue gave up 21 to Illinois in its conference opener, then 21 combined over its final five league games.\n\n1947: 10-0, 6-0\n\nMichigan returned to the Rose Bowl for the first time in 46 years, taking down USC, 49-0; the mammoth victory boosted the Wolverines into the No. 1 spot in a rare-for-the-times Associated Press poll held after the bowls.\n\n1948: 9-0, 6-0\n\nNo Rose Bowl for the Wolverines, since Western Conference teams at the time weren’t allowed to go in back-to-back seasons. Still, Michigan outscored its conference foes 190-37 on the way to another national title.\n\n1949 (tie): 6-2-1, 4-1-1\n\nMichigan and Ohio State entered their Nov. 19 season finale tied for the Western lead. Sixty minutes later, they were still tied, as both scored seven points in front of 97,239 fans in a newly expanded Michigan Stadium,\n\n1950: 6-3-1, 4-1-1\n\nMisery during the Wolverines’ game against Ohio State in Columbus — in which U-M punted 24 times and scored only a touchdown and a safety, both on blocked punts in a brutal snowstorm — led to joy: A 9-3 win and a Rose Bowl return.\n\n1964: 9-1, 6-1\n\nThe Wolverines’ first Big Ten title was marred only by a mid-October loss to Purdue, 21-20, in which coach Bump Elliott opted to go for two rather than settle for a tie in the fourth quarter. It ended with a win over Oregon State in the Rose Bowl.\n\n1969 (tie): 8-3, 6-1\n\nBo Schembechler clinched his first title (in his first season) with a 24-12 upset of No. 1 Ohio State (which finished tied with U-M), avenging a 36-point loss the previous season. In a harbinger of his U-M tenure, however, Schembechler lost the Rose Bowl, 10-3, to USC.\n\n1971: 11-1, 8-0\n\nSchembechler won his first outright title by crushing the conference, 281-70, with only Michigan State (13) and Purdue (17) reaching double-digits. The Wolverines lost in the Rose Bowl, however, 13-12 on a last-second field goal by Stanford.\n\n1972 (tie): 10-1, 7-1\n\nThe Wolverines were stopped twice by Ohio State on goal-line stands with nine minutes left in the fourth quarter, including on fourth down, when Schembechler opted to go for it, rather than kick a tying field goal. OSU won, 14-11, to share the Big Ten title with U-M and claim the conference’s Rose Bowl berth.\n\n1973 (tie): 10-0-1, 7-0-1\n\nSchembechler’s “Ten Year War” with Woody Hayes and Ohio State reached new levels when his Wolverines squad, which had won its seven previous league games by at least 15 points, tied OSU, 10-10, in the season finale. The result gave both teams a share of the title, and resulted in a vote of conference ADs on the Rose Bowl representative; they chose the Buckeyes.\n\n1974 (tie): 10-1, 7-1\n\nAnother agonizing loss to the Buckeyes — this time on a missed 33-yard field goal with 16 seconds left — gave Ohio State a share of the Big Ten title, and another agonizing vote by Big Ten ADs the next day left the Wolverines sitting at home during the Rose Bowl for the third straight season.\n\n[ Subscribe now for even more great Wolverines coverage! ]\n\n1976 (tie): 10-2, 7-1\n\nA two-point loss to Purdue in early November ruined a perfect season (and an eight-game streak of scoring at least 31 points) but two weeks later, Michigan shut out Ohio State, 22-0, in Columbus to claim a share of the conference crown and, finally, a spot in the Rose Bowl … where the Wolverines lost to USC, 14-6.\n\n1977 (tie): 10-2, 7-1\n\nMinnesota shut out Michigan in late October, knocking the Wolverines out of the No. 1 spot in the polls, but Schembechler’s squad kept its cool in Ann Arbor (unlike OSU’s Hayes, who punched an ABC cameraman) to beat the Buckeyes, 14-6, and claim the Roses. (Where they, of course, lost to Washington, 27-20.)\n\n1978 (tie): 10-2, 7-1\n\nThe Wolverines’ lone conference loss came in mid-October against the Spartans, who shared the title with U-M. But MSU was on postseason probation for violations under former coach Denny Stoltz, sending Michigan to the Rose Bowl … where they lost to USC, 17-10.\n\n1980: 10-2, 8-0\n\nBack-to-back September losses to Notre Dame and South Carolina left the Wolverines unranked — gasp! — for a month, but Michigan allowed just 64 points in league play to return to the Rose Bowl … where they … WON?!? Michigan held Washington scoreless in the second half for a 23-6 victory, Schembechler’s first bowl win in eight tries.\n\n1982: 8-4, 8-1\n\nEven a loss to Ohio State in Michigan’s Big Ten finale — 24-14 in Columbus — couldn’t stop the Wolverines from making the Rose Bowl again. (Both U-M and OSU had one loss in league play, but the Wolverines had eight Big Ten wins to the Buckeyes’ seven.) Unfortunately for Schembechler, the losing continued in Pasadena, 24-14 to UCLA.\n\n1986 (tie): 11-2, 7-1\n\nJim Harbaugh should remember this one: After losing to unranked Minnesota, the then-Michigan QB guaranteed a win over Ohio State and a spot in the Rose Bowl. Running back Jamie Morris then delivered 210 yards rushing and two TDs in Columbus to back him up in a 26-24 win and send the Wolverines to Pasadena … where they lost to Arizona State, 22-15.\n\n1988: 9-2-1, 7-0-1\n\nAnother win over OSU (and former ASU coach John Cooper in his rivalry debut), but that wasn’t’ the title decided. Instead, the clincher turned out to be U-M’s 17-3 win over Michigan State in early October, as the Spartans finished 6-1-1. And so Michigan headed to the Rose Bowl … where they beat USC, 22-14.\n\n1989: 10-2, 8-0\n\nMichigan opened at No. 1 in the AP poll, then dropped to No. 2 before losing to No. 1 Notre Dame to open the season. That was about all that went wrong, as Schembechler went out on top in his final season in Ann Arbor (before losing in the Rose Bowl, again, to USC).\n\n1990 (tie): 9-3, 6-2\n\nThe Wolverines’ back-to-back losses to MSU and Iowa in October left the Big Ten race wide open in coach Gary Moeller’s first year, and it stayed that way: a four-way tie between Illinois, Iowa, MSU and U-M, with the Hawkeyes heading to Pasadena and Michigan beating Ole Miss, 35-3, in the Gator Bowl.\n\n1991: 10-2, 8-0\n\nA 51-31 blowout by No. 1 Florida State scuttled the Wolverines’ national title hopes, but they won seven of their eight Big Ten games by at least three scores — a 24-16 win over Indiana in mid-October was the closest finish — en route to the Rose Bowl … where they lost to split national champ Washington, 34-14.\n\n1992: 9-0-3, 6-0-2\n\nThe NCAA was still four years from adopting overtime, and so the Wolverines tied Notre Dame to open the season (17-17) and Illinois (22-22) and Ohio State (13-13). Those two ties, and no conference losses, were better than OSU’s 5-2-1 record, sending Michigan to Pasadena for a rematch with Washington (won by U-M, 38-31).\n\n1997: 12-0, 8-0\n\nPerfection! In his third season, Lloyd Carr led the Wolverines to their first national championship since 1948, capped by a 22-16 victory over Washington State in the Rose Bowl and Charles Woodson’s Heisman Trophy win. (U-M topped the AP poll while Nebraska was No. 1 in the Coaches Poll.)\n\n1998 (tie): 10-3, 7-1\n\nThe Wolverines went down to Columbus alone atop the Big Ten, they left in a tie with the Buckeyes after OSU coach John Cooper picked up his second win, 31-16, in 11 editions of “The Game.” So Michigan headed to Orlando for the Citrus Bowl, where they carved up Arkansas, 45-31.\n\n2000 (tie): 9-3, 6-2\n\nMichgan’s two losses in conference play came against Purdue (32-31 on a field goal in the final seconds) and Northwestern (54-51 on a touchdown in the final minute), the two other co-champs. That sent the Boilermakers to Pasadena, the Wildcats to the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio and the Wolverines to, yep, Orlando for a Citrus Bowl win over Auburn, 31-28.\n\n2003: 10-3, 7-1\n\nThe Wolverines didn’t need to thump the defending national champion Buckeyes to clinch a trip to the Rose Bowl — they’d done that the week before with a 31-point rout of Northwestern — but they still did, rolling 35-21 in Ann Arbor. (They then lost to eventual national champ USC, 28-14, in Pasadena.)\n\n2004 (tie): 9-3, 7-1\n\nOnce again, the Big Ten title came down to Michigan … and Iowa? Both squads had just one loss in conference play — the Wolverines’ came in Columbus, 37-21 to the four-loss Buckeyes — but Michigan claimed the Roses on a 31-17 win over the Hawkeyes in late September. (U-M then lost to Vince Young and Texas, 38-37, on a last-second field goal.)\n\nContact Ryan Ford at rford@freepress.com.

Manuel replaces Boo Corrigan, North Carolina State's athletic director, who served as chair for the past two seasons.\n\nManuel has been on the selection committee each of the past two seasons after he was named to a three-year post in January 2022.

As a former student-athlete, he will also be a good spokesperson to let fans know how the committee reached its rankings.”\n\nManuel will be the face of the selection committee as the college football postseason undergoes seismic changes. The playoff, which started in the 2014-15 season, is expanding from a four-team field to 12 teams in 2024. The 12-team field will include the six highest-ranked conference champions as well as six teams with an at-large bid and the top four teams receiving a first-round bye.\n\nFirst-round games will be played at venues selected by the lower-seeded team, and the quarterfinals and semifinals will be played at six bowl venues — the Rose Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Cotton Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Orange Bowl and Peach Bowl ― that will rotate each season and the national championship will be determined through bidding by potential host sites.\n\nNext season's quarterfinals will take place on Dec. 31, 2024, and Jan. 1, 2025, and the semifinals will be Jan. 9-10, 2025. The College Football Playoff championship game will be Jan. 20, 2025, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\n\nAlong with Manuel's elevation to the chair position, the committee announced the addition of six new members to the selection committee: Washington State athletic director Patrick Chun, former Arizona State player Randall McDaniel, former Toledo and Missouri coach Gary Pinkel, Baylor athletic director Mack Rhoades, Virginia athletic director Carla Williams and Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek.\n\nThe new members will be replacing Corrigan, Kentucky athletic director Mitch Barnhart, Utah athletic director Mark Harlan, Kansas State athletic director Gene Taylor, former Virginia Union coach Joe Taylor and former Notre Dame football player and businessman Rod West.\n\nMichigan, which has made the CFP in three straight seasons and enters the 2024 season as reigning champion, will look to get back to that spot in the expanded field with a team that will look much different, led by new head coach Sherrone Moore. Michigan was one of three Big Ten teams to make the four-team playoff, along with Ohio State and Michigan State, and one of two teams to win the national championship, along with the Buckeyes in 2014-15.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/08"}]}
