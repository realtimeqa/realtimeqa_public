She received 49 of the 97 votes, well ahead of Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr. of Spain, who finished second with 28.\n\nIn addition to becoming the first female IOC president, Coventry is also the first person from Africa to hold the role. There have been only nine other IOC presidents since the organization's founding in 1894.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud of both of those different identities,\" Coventry said. \"I'm grateful, as well, to have been given a platform to work extremely hard over the last six months with IOC members to really make sure that they know who I am and what values I hold dearly. It wasn't just about being a woman or being from Africa. I'm so grateful that the members saw more than just gender or where I come from.\"\n\nCoventry, a former Olympic swimmer, will assume the office June 24 and serve an initial eight-year term, with the possibility of serving an additional four years upon re-election. Former German fencer and longtime IOC executive Thomas Bach has had the job since 2013.\n\nCoventry had long been one of the favorites to win Thursdsay, and she was believed to have been Bach's preferred candidate. As a swimmer, she competed at five editions of the Summer Games from 2004 to 2016 and won seven Olympic medals. Along the way, she also swam collegiately in the United States at Auburn and later joined the IOC as a member of the athletes' commission in 2013.\n\nCoventry needed to secure 49 votes on the first ballot to win outright and avoid subsequent rounds of voting, in which the candidate who received the fewest votes in each round would be eliminated. And she got exactly 49. The runner-up was Samaranch, a longtime IOC executive whose father, Juan Antonio Sr., also served as IOC president. Seb Coe, the president of the international federation that oversees track and field, placed third with just eight votes.\n\nInternational cycling leader David Lappartient (four votes), International Gymnastics Federation president Morinari Watanabe (four votes), Prince Feisal Al Hussein of Jordan (two votes) and International Ski and Snowboard Federation head Johan Eliasch (two votes) rounded out the pool of candidates.\n\n\"We celebrate Kirsty’s election as president of the IOC and eagerly anticipate collaborating with her as she steers the Olympic Movement into the future,\" U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee chair Gene Sykes said in a statement.\n\n\"As we look forward to a transformative decade of Olympic and Paralympic sport in the United States − welcoming the Games back in 2028 and 2034 − a robust partnership with the IOC will be essential. We are confident that under Kirsty’s leadership, the IOC will provide the stability and support necessary to achieve our shared goals.\"\n\nWith Thursday's win, Coventry ascends to one of the most powerful roles in international sports. The IOC is the wealthiest multi-sport organization in the world, with revenues of more than $7.7 billion in the most recent Olympic cycle, from 2021 to 2024.\n\nThe organization is charged with not just planning and operating the Summer and Winter Olympics but also shaping and guiding the Olympic movement around the world. And, as a result, the IOC president regularly schmoozes with heads of state and at times serves as the de facto leader of the global sports community as a whole.\n\nBach, for example, spearheaded the international sporting community's response to the state-backed Russian doping scandal early in his tenure. He also led the IOC through the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the postponement of the 2020 Tokyo Games to 2021 and required the 2022 Winter Olympics to be held behind closed doors.\n\nCoventry will now face a new − and lengthy − set of challenges, including Russia's possible return to the Olympics following its invasion of Ukraine, the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports and simmering tensions in the anti-doping community between the United States and the World Anti-Doping Agency. She will also have to work closely with the United States, which is is slated to host two of the next five editions of the Olympics.\n\nAt a news conference Thursday, Coventry was asked specifically about building a relationship with President Donald Trump, who has threatened to withhold visas for transgender athletes ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Games, even if they are cleared to compete by the IOC.\n\n\"I have been dealing with, let's say, difficult men in high positions since I was 20 years old. And first and foremost, what I have learned is that communication will be key,\" Coventry said. \"My firm belief is that President Trump is a huge lover of sports. He will want these Games to be significant, he will want them to be a success.\"\n\nCoventry said she will relocate to Lausanne, Switzerland − where the IOC's headquarters are located − in the coming months and resign from her government role in Zimbabwe. She has served as the country's minister of youth, sport, arts and recreation since 2018, drawing criticism for her role in a government that has been accused of silencing political opposition.\n\nIn a recent op-ed published by Newsweek, a pair of policy experts from the Human Rights Foundation wrote that the IOC's election of Coventry would be \"a victory for the brutal regime she has become the soft face of.\"\n\n\"I chose to want to try and create change from the inside. It gets criticized, and that's OK,\" Coventry said. \"At the end of the day, I don't think you can stand on the sidelines and scream and shout for change. I believe you have to be seated at the table to try to create it.\"\n\nBoxing approved for 2028 Los Angeles Olympics\n\nIn other significant news from Thursday's session, the IOC formally approved the inclusion of boxing in the Olympic program for the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\nBoxing's place at the Games had been in doubt after the IOC's fight with the International Boxing Association, the international federation that previously ran the sport. The IOC cut ties with the IBA in 2023 due to governance concerns and the organization's growing coziness with Russia.\n\nThe emergence of a new federation, World Boxing, over the past 18 months paved the way for the IOC to welcome the sport back into the Olympic fold.\n\n\"This is a great day for boxers, boxing and everyone connected with our sport at every level across the world,\" World Boxing president Boris van der Vorst said following the decision.\n\n\"This outcome has been achieved by a massive team effort ... and would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all of the national federations, boxers, coaches, officials and boxing leaders that have worked together to enable this to happen.\"\n\nMilan Cortina sliding track on schedule\n\nIOC members also received an update from organizers of next year's Milan-Cortina Winter Games − including news about the Cortina sliding center that is supposed to host bobsled, skeleton and luge events.\n\nMilan-Cortina chief executive officer Andrea Varnier told IOC members that efforts to build and prepare the track are on schedule, and athletes are slated to test it next week. Bach called it \"a clear and encouraging report.\"\n\n\"After these reports today I must tell you we are not nervous anymore,\" Bach said. \"The trust in your capabilities remains and has even been reinforced today. We can look forward to brilliant fantastic Winter Games.\"\n\nOrganizers have been scrambling to build and prep the track ahead of next year's Olympics, and there was so much uncertainty over the timeline that they felt compelled to arrange a Plan B. If the track isn't ready, the sliding events will instead take place in Lake Placid, New York.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @tomschad.bsky.social.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2025/06/26/ioc-president-2028-los-angeles-games/84367477007/", "title": "IOC president says 2028 Los Angeles Games will reflect Olympic ...", "text": "Kirsty Coventry has plenty of complicated issues to tackle as the new president of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nHosting the 2028 Summer Games in the United States − where President Donald Trump has sparked an international trade war, banned visitors from a dozen countries and orchestrated widespread deportations of residents − is certainly among them.\n\nYet in her first news conference since officially assuming her role as the highest-ranking official in global sports, Coventry indicated on June 26 that she has few concerns about the 2028 Los Angeles Games. She relayed \"reassuring\" reports from local organizers about their conversations with government authorities, including at the federal level, and said she is confident that the Games will reflect the Olympic movement's core values.\n\n\"There is an incredible willingness to see that the Olympic Games are a huge success,\" said Coventry, who is the first female president of the IOC. \"The reason I mention that is that that gives us faith, as the Olympic movement, that that platform will be there to ensure that our values are stuck to. But (also) that our values will also be heard and that we will be able to ensure successful Games for our athletes.\"\n\nThe Trump administration recently banned visitors from 12 countries from entering the United States. And, according to multiple news reports, it has considered expanding the ban to include people from 36 other nations − including, notably, Coventry's home country of Zimbabwe.\n\nThough the enacted ban includes a carveout for athletes, relatives and coaches who are entering the country to attend a major sporting event, such as the 2028 Olympics, it raises questions about the ease with which the rest of the world will be able to enter and exit the United States for sporting events. Senegal, for example, recently canceled a women's basketball training camp in the U.S. after several of its players were denied visas, according to a Facebook post from the country's prime minister, Ousmane Sonko.\n\nOfficials with the IOC, the LA28 organizing committee and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee have all downplayed such concerns, while attempting to highlight the cooperation of U.S. government officials so far.\n\n\"We all believe that sport is a great unifier,\" Sarah Hirshland, the CEO of the USOPC, said on June 18. \"... And we have every assurance from the administration that they will be great partners in helping ensure that we are a great host country.\"\n\nFor Coventry, the Los Angeles Games are just one item on a lengthy to-do list.\n\nAfter formally taking over for outgoing president Thomas Bach earlier this week, Coventry met with more than 70 members of the IOC to seek input and brainstorm ideas for reform within the movement. Following those conversations, she said the group identified two main areas as ripe for immediate reform: The Olympic Games bid process and the participation of trans and intersex athletes, which she described as the \"protection of the female category.\"\n\n\"It was pretty much unanimously felt that the IOC should take a leading role in bringing everyone together to try to find a broad consensus (on that issue),\" Coventry said.\n\nCoventry, a former Olympic swimmer, said the IOC will soon establish working groups to examine both issues, though she did not provide any additional details on who will be part of the groups or any timelines for recommendations.\n\nCoventry said she will spend parts of her first year as IOC president traveling to meet with various Olympic leaders. When asked by a Chinese journalist about plans to visit the country, she said a trip had been tentatively scheduled for November. When asked by a Ukrainian journalist about a possible visit to Ukraine, she expressed a desire to visit all Olympic stakeholders \"and that will, at some point, include all of the (national Olympic committees) around the world.\"\n\n\"I think that sport plays an incredibly important role in today's world, and especially the Olympic Games — where we see the best of humanity,\" Coventry said. \"... You see grit, you see determination, you see teamwork — all things and all messages that are not just relevant but have to be passed to the younger generation today, to remind them and to show them that it's not all doom-and-gloom. And that we actually, if we can celebrate in the diversity that we are and that we have, we can really work towards creating something great.\"\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @tomschad.bsky.social.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/02/paris-olympics-gender-parity-competitors/74284825007/", "title": "2024 Paris Olympics making history with female athlete participation", "text": "Women were not allowed to compete at the Olympic Games until the 1900 Paris Olympics. Now, 124 years later, female athletes will make history in the same city at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nReflecting over a century of progress, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has allocated its approximately 10,500-athlete quota spaces equally among men and women for the 2024 Paris Olympics. This milestone marks the first time in history an equal number of men and women will compete at the Olympics.\n\n“We are about to celebrate one of the most important moments in the history of women at the Olympic Games, and in sport overall,” said Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee.\n\n“We will see the results of the enormous efforts made by the Olympic movement and female trailblazers come to life,” Bach added. “This is our contribution to a more gender-equal world.”\n\nThe number of medals available to male and female athletes will also be the most balanced in history following the addition of disciplines once only offered to men, such as the Canoe sprint and the 15,000-meter freestyle swim (one of Katie Ledecky’s most dominant events), at the Tokyo Games. Additionally, 28 of the 32 sports at the Paris Olympics will be fully gender equal.\n\nHowever, the number of medals awarded to female athletes will still be slightly fewer than those awarded to male athletes. The 2024 Paris Olympics will include 329 medal events — 152 for women, 157 for men, and 20 for mixed-gender teams.\n\nWomen competed in the Olympics for the first time at the 1900 Paris Games, where they represented just 2.2% of the field and were limited to just five events: tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrianism and golf. Since then, female participation has steadily increased.\n\nThe 2012 London Olympics marked the first time each National Olympic Committee (NOC) sent a female athlete to the Olympics, as well as the first time women could compete in all sports with the addition of women’s boxing. Still, women comprised only 44% of the athlete field. Before the 2024 Paris Games, the Tokyo Olympics were the closest to achieving gender parity, with women making up 48% of competing athletes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/08/29/jacques-rogge-dies-international-olympic-committee-president/5642870001/", "title": "Jacques Rogge, ex-International Olympic Committee president, dies", "text": "Jacques Rogge, who led the International Olympic Committee for 12 years (2001-13), has died at the age of 79.\n\nThe IOC announced his passing Sunday without providing a cause of death. He leaves a wife, Anne, a daughter, a son and two grandchildren.\n\nRogge, a native of Belgium, succeeded Juan Antonio Samaranch (1980-2001) as the eighth president in the organization's history as the IOC recovered from the Salt Lake City corruption scandal. Current president Thomas Bach took over from Rogge in 2013.\n\n\"Jacques loved sport and being with athletes – and he transmitted this passion to everyone who knew him. His joy in sport was infectious,\" Bach said in a statement.\n\n\"He was an accomplished President, helping to modernize and transform the IOC,\" Bach's statement continued. \"He will be remembered particularly for championing youth sport and for inaugurating the Youth Olympic Games.\"\n\nBefore his presidency, Rogge headed the European group and Belgian Olympic committees. He was also an orthopedic surgeon with a degree in sports medicine.\n\nAs an athlete, Rogge played rugby for the national team and won a Belgian championship. He was a successful sailor, with 16 national titles and one world championship; Rogge competed in the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics in the men's Finn class.\n\nThe IOC said the Olympic flag will be flown at half-staff for five days at Olympic House in Lausanne, Switzerland. The family will have a private ceremony, but a public memorial service will take place later this year.\n\nRogge was elected president three days after the body awarded the 2008 Summer Games to Beijing, and he steered the first Olympics in China. Before the event, Rogge said the Chinese government would not censor the Internet for journalists, only for the IOC to retract the statement and admit Internet censorship.\n\nRogge also faced backlash for criticizing legendary Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt's celebration during the 100 meter dash in Beijing. He later clarified his issues were with Bolt's gesticulations during the race.\n\nThe host cities between 2010-20 (Vancouver, London, Sochi, Rio, PyeongChang and Tokyo) were selected during his presidency. Rogge also attempted to curtail doping and touted reforms during his tenure. However, the state-sponsored doping program in Russia marred the 2014 Sochi Games.\n\nRogge served as Honorary President after his time as president. The Associated Press reported that Rogge's health had \"visibly declined\" when he was seen at Olympic events after his presidency.\n\n“The entire Olympic Movement will deeply mourn the loss of a great friend and a passionate fan of sport,” Bach said.\n\nFollow Chris Bumbaca on Twitter @BOOMbaca.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/01/olympic-gender-testing-boxers/74615354007/", "title": "Olympics gender testing discussed as two female boxers cleared", "text": "PARIS – The case of two Olympic boxers has drawn attention to a thorny issue: Who and what determines which female athletes can compete.\n\nAlgerian boxer Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan both were disqualified from the 2023 women’s boxing world championships when they reportedly failed gender eligibility tests.\n\nBut this week, the International Olympic Committee confirmed the two boxers have been cleared to compete here at the Paris Games, as they both did at the Tokyo Games in 2021. The issues of so-called gender verification or sex testing have fueled discussion at the Olympics as the fighters prepare to enter the ring at North Paris Arena.\n\nKhelif, a silver medalist at the 2022 world championships, is scheduled to fight Thursday against Angela Carini of Italy in the welterweight division at 146 pounds. Lin, a two-time world champion, is scheduled to fight Sitora Turdibekova of Uzbekistan in the featherweight division at 126 pounds.\n\n“Yeah, it’s really tricky,\" Australian boxer Tiana Echegaray told reporters Tuesday when asked about the situation. \"I don’t know exactly what their circumstances are.\"\n\nIOC spokesman Mark Adams indicated Tuesday no personal information about the boxers' medical histories would be disclosed. \"They've been competing in boxing for a very long time,\" Adams told reporters. “They've achieved all the eligibility requirements in terms of sex and age. We're following the rules in place in Tokyo.\"\n\nWho's in charge of boxing?\n\nAt the Summer Olympics, when it comes to gender eligibility, the IOC defers to the international federations that govern each of the 32 sports.\n\nThe IOC does provide a framework to the international federations. But it's “nonbinding.\"\n\nIn other words, it’s not up to the IOC. And the situation has grown especially complicated with boxing.\n\nLast year the IOC banished the International Boxing Association (IBA), long plagued with scandal and controversy that jeopardized the future of Olympic boxing. In fact, the IOC denied IBA the right to run Olympic boxing during the Tokyo Games in 2021 and instead turned over control to an ad-hoc unit.\n\nWith that ad-hoc unit in charge, Kehlif and Lin both competed at the Tokyo Olympics. Neither won a medal.\n\nBut the IBA has maintained control of the world championships and gender eligibility rules. And after Lin won gold and Kehlif won bronze at the event in March 2023, officials announced the boxers had failed medical eligibility tests and stripped them of the medals.\n\nIBA president Umar Kremlev said DNA tests “proved they had XY chromosomes and were thus excluded.\"\n\nWhat's the eligibility criteria?\n\nA passport could be key, based on comments from Adams, the IOC spokesman.\n\n“I would just say that everyone competing in the women’s category is complying with the competition eligibility rules,\" he said. “They are women in their passports and it is stated that is the case.”\n\nThursday Adams added that the issues with the previous tests for the boxers \"was not a transgender issue, there's been some misreporting on that in press. ... These women have been competing as women for many years.\n\n\"What I would say just quickly on testosterone is, the testosterone (test) is not a perfect test. Many women can have testosterone, even what would be called 'male levels' and still be women and still compete as women. So this is not a panacea − this idea that suddenly you test, do one test for testosterone. Each sport needs to deal with this issue but I think we agreed, I hope we're agreed, we're not going to go back to the bad old days of 'sex testing'. That would be a bad idea.\"\n\nIn the past, other eligibility standards have hinged on science.\n\nCaster Semenya, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in track and field in 2012 and 2016, was forced to give up competing in the 800 meters because her testosterone levels were too high based on tests administered by World Athletics, the sport’s international federation previously known as the IAAF.\n\nSemenya was assigned female at birth. She said she was told at age 18 that she has XY chromosomes and naturally had high levels of testosterone.\n\nKhelif and Lin have not publicly addressed details of their medical histories regarding the tests.\n\nThe issue of eligibility surfaced as a source of controversy in the United States in 2022 when swimmer Lia Thomas became the first openly transgender athlete to win an NCAA championship.\n\nAt the time, the NCAA required transgender female athletes to have undergone one year of testosterone suppression treatment to be eligible to compete on a women's team in any sport. The NCAA has been under pressure to update its guidelines after the NAIA banned all transgender athletes from competing in women's sports.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld a decision in June by World Aquatics, the international federation for swimming, that prevented Thomas from competing in elite competitions through World Aquatics or USA Swimming.\n\nWho are these two boxers?\n\nLin, 28, has been fighting as an amateur for more than a decade, according to BoxRec, a widely regarded boxing site.\n\nShe made her official amateur debut about three months shy of her 18th birthday, winning at the 2013 AIBA World Women’s Championships. She won gold medals at the world championships in 2019 and 2022.\n\nAt 5-foot-9, she often has enjoyed a height advantage while amassing a record of 40-14 with one knockout. The record does not reflect the four fights she won at the 2023 world championships before her disqualification, which resulted in the outcome of the fights being changed to “no contest.’’\n\nShe lost her last fight – a split-decision defeat against Brazil’s Jucielen Cerqueira Romeu in April at the 2024 USA Boxing International Invitational in Pueblo, Colorado.\n\nKhelif, 25, made her amateur debut at the 2018 Balkan Women's Tournament. She won a silver medal at the 2022 world championships.\n\nAt 5-foot-10, she also has enjoyed a height advantage while amassing a record of 36-9 with four knockouts, according to BoxRec. That does not include the three fights she won at the 2023 world championships before her disqualification resulted in the fights being changed to “no contest.’’\n\nIn one of those fights, Khelif stopped her opponent by TKO.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2021/04/04/rckaela-aquino-wins-silver-qualifier-makes-olympics-merit/7081769002/", "title": "Rckaela Aquino wins silver at qualifier, makes Olympics on merit", "text": "Guam wrestler Rckaela Aquino became Guam's first-ever female to qualify for an Olympics on merit.\n\nShe won a silver medal at the 2021 African & Oceania Wrestling Olympic Qualification Tournament Sunday in Tunisia, wrestling at 53 kilograms.

The president of Paris 2024 offered a very emotional goodbye to the Olympics.\n\nWhat to know about Stade de France?\n\nStade de France (Stadium of France) was built to host the 1998 soccer World Cup. It is located just north of Paris in Saint-Denis. It's where the athletics events took place, as well as rugby sevens. It has a seating capacity of about 80,000, making it the largest stadium in France. Tonight every single one appears to be taken. — Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nLos Angeles 2028 update\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and LA28 Olympic Games chair Casey Wasserman, who are both here tonight, told reporters on Saturday that while the Paris Games have been \"authentically French,\" the 2028 Games will be \"authentically Los Angeles.\" The jury's out on that for another four years but Wasserman said this meant tapping into LA's music, fashion, culture and of course movies pedigree.\n\n\"We don't have an Eiffel Tower. We do have a Hollywood sign,\" said Wasserman. — Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nPhoenix, Kavinsky bring the party to closing ceremony\n\nThe first of many musicians to come onto stage for these closing ceremonies was Phoenix, a French indie band from Versailles. The group played their 2009 hit song \"Lisztomania\" from their fourth album, Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix.\n\nPhoenix was followed by French musician Kavinsky, who played his 2010 single Nightcall. Phoenix and Nightcall combined for a three-song set to entertain the crowd, and it was quite a show for such a short set. — Jon Hoefling\n\nAthletes rush the stage\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Athletes from several nations, including Team USA athletes, rushed the stage, albeit in a somewhat orderly fashion. They seemed to be joining performers who ran out of tunnels onto the stage.\n\nBut then broadcast across the stadium was this message in English: \"Please don’t stand on the stage. Please get down from the stage, dear athletes. … Dear athletes, please leave the stage.\" — Michelle Martinelli\n\nWhat was the final medal count at 2024 Olympics?\n\nThe United States finished this year's games with the most medals (126) of any competing country. They also finished the Olympics tied for the most gold medals (40) alongside China.\n\nFind the full final medal count here.\n\nOlympic rings come together in Paris\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Leading up to the giant, golden Olympic rings coming into place above the stage, the Hymn to Apollo — the oldest hymn from ancient Greece — was performed by Alain Roche. But perhaps you noticed he, amazingly, was seated and playing a piano while suspended vertically in the air. Because the stadium was dark, it was challenging to notice this in person.\n\nThe hymn was discovered in the ruins of Delphi and was first performed in modern times to celebrate the 1894 revival of the Olympics two years later. The ancient score is in the Louvre. — Michelle Martinelli\n\n'The Golden Voyager' hits the stage at closing ceremony\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — The stadium went dark, save for people’s phone flashlights and dramatic periodic flashing lights on the stage. The idea was to transport viewers to another world that is dark, deserted and mysterious, opening the door for the arrival of The Golden Voyager.\n\nCovered in golden sparkles and lowered down into the stadium, The Golden Voyager was inspired by elements of French history, including the Spirit of the Bastille, the Génie de la Liberté — a 1836 bronze-gilded statue signifying liberty by Auguste Dumont — and video games and science fiction.\n\nThe Golden Voyager character is also a nod to the Voyager Golden Record, which the Voyager spacecraft launched into the void in 1977 \"containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth\", should other spacefarers find it, according to NASA. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nWomen's marathon medal ceremony\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — The women’s marathon was one of the last events at the 2024 Paris Olympics on Sunday morning, and the three medalists received their hardware at the closing ceremony: Netherlands’ gold medalist Sifan Hassan, Ethiopia’s silver medalist Tigst Assefa and Kenya’s bronze medalist Hellen Obiri. The crowd roared when Hassan was introduced.\n\nThe ceremony also paid video tribute to the Marathon Pour Tous, or the Marathon For All — a public event where people ran parts or the whole course on Saturday night. There were 20,024 participants registered.\n\nThe marathon route was inspired by the legendary Women’s March of 1789, where Parisians revolted over King Louis XVI’s apathy toward a flour shortage. They marched from through Paris to Versailles to bring the king back to the city in a moment the French remember for its defense of human rights and freedom. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nWhat's in the boxes Olympic medalists receive?\n\nEach Olympic medalist at the 2024 Paris Olympics also receives a box while they're standing on the podium, but what's inside?\n\nAccording to the International Olympic Committee, it's the official poster for this year's Games. French artist Ugo Gattoni designed this year's posters over several months of work.\n\nRead more on what medalists have received this Olympics from Jordan Mendoza.\n\nKatie Ledecky and Nick Mead represent the U.S. as flag bearers\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Katie Ledecky doesn’t usually get to attend the Olympics opening ceremony because of her swimming schedule, but Sunday night, she was one of Team USA’s flag bearers at the closing ceremony, joined by rower Nick Mead.\n\nWhen she found out she was chosen as the flag bearer, Ledecky teared up when fellow 1,500 freestyle Olympic champion Bobby Finke delivered the news.\n\nAt the closing ceremony, Ledecky and Mead entered with all the nations’ flag bearers, donning their vintage NASCAR-esque Ralph Lauren outfits. They both looked excited walking around the stage at the booming stadium.\n\nMead, a 29-year-old first-time Olympian, was part of the men’s four team that won gold for the U.S. for the first time since the 1960 Olympics.\n\nWith 14 total medals, Ledecky, a 27-year-old four-time Olympian, is the most decorated American woman at the Olympics in any sport and the most decorated woman in swimming of all time. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nFlag bearers' procession into the Stade de France begins\n\nFollowing tradition, Greece leads the procession of all nations that participated in this year's Olympics into the arena. Delegations from the territories of all 206 National Olympic Committees and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team march into the stadium and onto the stage in the center of the Stade de France. — Jack McKessy\n\nLéon Marchand takes charge of the Olympic flame\n\nFollowing the choral performance to start the closing ceremony, the French swimmer lifted a lantern containing the Olympic flame next to the grand Olympic torch. He carried the lantern out of the Jardin des Tuileries and began his procession to bring the flame to the Stade de France. — Jack McKessy\n\nClosing ceremony begins with musical performance\n\nThe closing ceremony festivities began in front of the 2024 Paris Olympics' Olympic torch in the Jardin des Tuileries. French singer Zaho de Sagazan and the Choir of the Haendel-Hendrix Academy treated spectators to a rendition of \"Sous le ciel de Paris.\" — Jack McKessy\n\nCasey Wasserman on the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics\n\nThe chairman of the LA28 Organizing Committee sat down with NBC's Mike Tirico to discuss what to expect in four years' time, when the Olympics return to the U.S. for the first time since 1996. — Jack McKessy\n\nWhat is Team USA's closing ceremony outfit?\n\nAs in the opening ceremony, Ralph Lauren is the designer of Team USA's closing ceremony outfits. Here's what the Americans will be wearing on Sunday evening in Paris:\n\nClosing ceremony flag bearers\n\nSwimmer Katie Ledecky will bear the U.S. flag with rower Nick Mead at Sunday's closing ceremony. — Jack McKessy\n\nWhat time does the closing ceremony start?\n\nThe closing ceremony begins at 3 p.m. ET on Sunday. NBC will broadcast the ceremony, which is expected to conclude a little after 5 p.m.\n\nThere will also be an encore broadcast of the closing ceremony starting at 7 p.m. ET. — Jack McKessy\n\nWhy did Gabby Williams play for France?\n\nGabby Williams, the No. 4 overall pick out of UConn in 2018, was one of France's best players at the 2024 Paris Olympics. She was drafted by the Chicago Sky but started playing overseas full time after the 2022 season.\n\nWilliams is from the United States but is eligible to play for France in the Olympics due to her mother, Therese, being from the host country of this year's Olympic Games. Williams also competed in the Tokyo Olympics, winning the bronze medal in the last competition. — Austin Curtright\n\nA'ja Wilson had NSFW answer to describe Kahleah Copper's performance\n\nKahleah Copper played a huge role for Team USA, coming off the bench to score 10 of her 12 points in the fourth quarter. Copper sank two crucial free throws with 3.9 seconds left that enabled the Americans to withstand Williams' buzzer beater.\n\nWhen asked for one word to describe the performance of Copper, Wilson gave a two-word term of endearment to describe the Phoenix Mercury All-Star guard.\n\n\"That (expletive)!\" Wilson said before giving a look into the camera that let the rest of the world know they were sleeping on Copper's skills. — Scooby Axson\n\nUSA women's hoops hang on for eighth consecutive gold\n\nWith the U.S. clinging to a 62-59 lead, Breanna Stewart got a fingertip on France’s 3 attempt, a huge defensive play with 20 seconds to go. At the other end, A'Ja Wilson hit one of two free throws to make it a two possession game.\n\nFrance’s Gabby Williams hit a shot at the buzzer but the forward wasn’t behind the 3-point line when it left her hand, leaving France short of tying the game and leaving the U.S. with a one-point victory, 67-66. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nUS women hold 3-point lead with less than a minute left\n\nAfter Gabby Williams hit a long 2 for France with about 1:30 left, Kahleah Cooper answered with a layup out of the timeout to give the Americans a 62-59 lead with 54 seconds left. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nUS women's hoops reclaims lead at end of 3Q\n\nThe national emergency appears to be over — for now. A’ja Wilson is getting ticked off, and that’s usually when the Americans start rolling. Wilson is up to four blocks (it feels like more) and dominated the third quarter defensively when the U.S. really needed it. She’s got 14 points and 12 rebounds. Two nice Sabrina Ionescu-to-Napheesa Collier baskets also helped the Americans get back into it after trailing by 10. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nFrance starts second half with surge\n\nA lot of people thought the U.S. would have a cakewalk to its eighth consecutive gold. France has other ideas. After an 8-0 run that gave the French a 33-25 lead to open the second half, the U.S. needed a timeout to talk things over. This crowd is only going to get louder. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nEvacuation takes place near Eiffel Tower\n\nFrench police briefly evacuated the area around the Eiffel Tower on Sunday after there were reports a man attempted to climb the 1,083-foot structure. The incident, reported by the Associated Press and in unverified eyewitness posts on social media, took place just hours before the Olympic closing ceremony was due to get underway. The shirtless man was spotted just above the Olympic rings that decorate the second section of Paris' famous landmark, the city's tallest building. The Eiffel Tower was a centerpiece of the opening ceremony. A purpose-built stadium directly in front of it hosted beach volleyball events. Blind football events will be played there during the Paralympics. The tower is not part of the closing ceremony. — Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nUS women's hoops tied with France at halftime\n\nThe women's basketball gold medal game is all tied up at the half after a crucial tip-in from Team USA’s Napheesa Collier just before the buzzer.\n\nReal talk: That half was ugly. The U.S. shot 29%, France shot 28% and the teams combined for 19 total turnovers. A’ja Wilson has six points but is just 2-of-9 from the field, while Stewart is 1-of-6 with five points. Wilson and Collier have nine rebounds each. Gabby Williams leads France with eight points.\n\nThe U.S. looks sloppy and disjointed and if it wants to keep the streak of seven-gold-medals-in-a-row-and-counting going, the Americans going to need to clean up a lot in the second half. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nSifan Hassan's Olympic feat arguably greatest in Summer Games history\n\nNetherlands' Sifan Hassan and Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa tangled. They jostled. They were one false move away from taking each other out. Then, in the blink of an eye, Hassan was gone; a blur of Netherlands orange leaving Assefa behind and streaking to the gold medal. And when she crossed the wire in an Olympic record 2 hours, 22 minutes and 55 seconds, there was just one question left.\n\nHow is it possible for a human to do this?\n\nRead Dan Wolken's column on the extraordinary performance in the women's Olympic marathon.\n\nUSA men’s water polo wins bronze in shootout\n\nNANTERRE, France — Team USA men’s water polo were victorious in a thrilling 11-8 bronze-medal match that ended in a shootout against historical powerhouse Hungary on Sunday to win its first Olympic medal since 2008.\n\nThe American’s not only won the match and bronze medal, but they also shut out Hungary in the shootout, 3-0, at París La Défense Arena.\n\nUSA goalkeeper Adrian Weinberg – who stood on his head, especially in the final minutes and was spectacular in the shootout – made 16 saves on 24 shots, while American captain Ben Hallock led the team in scoring with two goals.\n\nRead more on Weinberg from Michelle Martinelli.\n\nAmerican cyclist takes gold in women's Omnium\n\nAmerican Jennifer Valente won her second consecutive gold medal in women’s Omnium cycling at the National Velodrome on Sunday.\n\nValente totaled 144 points, edging Poland’s Daria Pikulik (silver) and New Zealand’s Ally Wollaston (bronze). Omnium consists of four races (scratch race, tempo race, elimination and points), and points are awarded for each race. Valente won the 2022 and 2023 world championship in Omnium.\n\n\"It’s been a really long week of racing. I raced (team pursuit) qualifying over a week ago, and we had some really good performances, so to pull it off on the last day, I'm really excited,\" Valante said.\n\nValente, who won the event three years ago at the Tokyo Olympics, was also part of the squad that won gold in team pursuit in Paris. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nUSA women's hoops goes for eighth consecutive gold\n\nThe U.S. women's basketball team gets to bring down the curtain on the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nIn the final event of these Games, the United States plays France with an eighth consecutive gold medal on the line. The Americans have mostly cruised through this Olympics tournaments, with each of their five wins coming by double digits, and three coming by 19 or more points. A'ja Wilson (18.2 points per game) and Breanna Stewart (18.0) have been leading the way, with Wilson also leading the team in rebounds (9.6), blocks (2.4) and steals (1.6).\n\nFollow along for updates and highlights.\n\nIOC has precedent to give two bronzes for gymnastics floor routine\n\nIn stripping Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal, the International Olympic Committee is not following the precedent it set for itself in the most publicized double-medal controversy in Olympic history.\n\nAt the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, in what became known as the French judge scandal, the IOC gave out two gold medals – to Canada and Russia – rather than take the gold medal from the Russian pairs skaters nearly a week after they received it, as it should have.\n\nRead more from Christine Brennan.\n\nItaly beats USA for gold medal in women's volleyball\n\nPARIS — The repeat dream is over for the U.S. women’s volleyball. Italy swept the Americans (25-18, 25-20, 25-17) in a match that lasted 81 minutes to deny the USA a second consecutive gold medal.\n\nItaly’s opposite hitter Paola Egonu supplied the bulk of her team’s attack, as she went off for 22 kills and was by far the best player on the court.\n\nJordan Thompson led the Americans with eight attack points. Italy finished with seven aces – five coming in the third set. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nItaly takes two-set lead over USA in women's volleyball\n\nPARIS — The teams traded points through the first part of the second set, but Italy pulled away during the middle portions and took the frame, 25-20. Now the Americans are on the ropes and will have to win three straight sets to claim their second consecutive Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe U.S. looks out of system defensively and Italy is keeping the Americans off balance with a variety of attacks.\n\nPaolo Egonu has 15 kills for Italy.\n\nAvery Skinner leads the way for the U.S. with six kills, and Jordan Thompson has five. Jordan Larson and Andrea Drews both have four. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nChina's 40th gold comes in women's weightlifting\n\nWenwen Li of China secured her country's 40th gold medal Sunday in the women's +81kg weightlifting competition, extending China's gold medal lead over the United States to 40-38 with several medal events remaining on the final day of competition at the Paris Games.\n\nLi lifted a total of 309 kilograms (136 snatch, 173 clean & jerk) to take gold with relative ease over the Republic of Korea's Hyejeong Park (299 kg) and Great Britain's Emily Campbell (288 kg).\n\nTeam USA's Mary Theisen Lappen finished fifth with a total of 274 kg (119 snatch, 155 clean & jerk). — Chase Goodbread\n\nUS women's volleyball falls behind in gold medal match\n\nPARIS — In a gold-medal match, that was not the first set the U.S. women’s volleyball team was looking for.\n\nItaly, behind a crowd decidedly in favor of the Italians, rolled to a first-set victory, 25-18.\n\nA 6-1 start for Italy set the tone. The Americans could not navigate Italy’s block, and Italy finished with four block points in the frame.\n\nU.S. coach Karch Kiraly burned both timeouts by the time his team trailed 12-6. That deficit turned into 14-7. The Americans battled to 18-15 but were unable to overcome the rest of the margin.\n\nMeanwhile, the fans got loud for Italy.\n\n\"It-a-lia!

After a little bit of a shove between them, Hassan took the lead and pulled away for a three-second margin of victory. — Dan Wolken\n\nWomen's marathon result under review after protest\n\nPARIS — The result of the women's marathon is still under review after a protest from second-place finisher Tigst Assefa of Ethopia against the winner Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands.\n\nJust a couple hundred yards from the finish line, the two competitors appeared to bump as Hassan tried to break through an opening inside of Assefa near the fence.\n\nAfter a little bit of a shove between them, Hassan took the lead and pulled away for a three-second margin of victory.\n\nRace officials informed the media that the medal ceremony and press conferences would be delayed until a decision is made whether to change the finish. — Dan Wolken\n\nPARIS — U.S. gymnast Jordan Chiles will be required to return the individual bronze medal she received at the 2024 Paris Olympics, the International Olympic Committee announced Sunday morning.\n\nThe news comes less than 24 hours after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that the judging panel for the women's floor exercise final made a mistake in granting an inquiry filed by Chiles' coaches, which moved the American gymnast into medal position. The Romanian Gymnastics Federation had challenged the validity of that move, saying it was filed four seconds beyond the deadline by which any inquiries had to be submitted.\n\nThe IOC said in a statement that it will reallocate the bronze medal to Romania's Ana Barbosu. — Nancy Armour and Tom Schad\n\nNetherlands' Sifan Hassan wins women's marathon\n\nSifan Hassan — who won the bronze medal in both the 5,000- and 10,000-meter race — completed an incredible 2024 Paris Olympics by winning the women's marathon on Sunday, finishing in an Olympic record time of 2:22:55.\n\nIt required a late sprint to the finish for the track star, who out-paced Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa to the finish line of the 26.2-mile race. Assefa finished three seconds behind Hassan to win silver. Kenya's Hellen Obiri won the bronze.\n\nAmerican Dakotah Lindwurm finishes 12th in women's marathon\n\nPARIS — Near the halfway point of the women’s marathon on Sunday, American Dakotah Lindwurm found herself in the lead. It was a scenario the former hockey player from Minnesota, ranked No. 138 in the world, could have never imagined.\n\n“I looked up and said, ‘God, you’re crazy – I can’t believe I’m at the front of the Olympic marathon right now,’” she said. “But you’ve got to put yourself in that position if you want to run well, and I’m not afraid to take the lead. I never have been, and it was fun.”\n\nThough it was a temporary thrill, Lindwurm surpassed all expectations by finishing 12th on the difficult, hilly course in a time of 2 hours, 26 minutes and 44 seconds. The only disappointment was that she couldn't stay in the top 10, finishing 34 seconds behind that milestone.\n\nStill, being at the head of the pack was something she'll always remember. She even choked up a bit talking about the fact that she wasn't the most likely Olympian and how happy she was just to be a part of this event.\n\n“I swear I could hear all of Minnesota cheering for me in the moment when I took the lead,” she said.\n\nLindwurm led the American contingent, as Emily Sisson finished 23rd and Fiona O’Keefe dropped off the pace and stopped just a few kilometers into the race due to injury.\n\nSisson, who qualified for the Olympic team in Tokyo for the 10k, said her run did not meet expectations.\n\n“I’m pretty disappointed,” she said. “Pretty sad. I think there were signs. Three marathons in a year is too much for me. I had some good workouts and no major injuries or anything. I like challenging myself and wanted to do a fall marathon for learning experience and it did help me in the trials. Btu this marathon didn’t feel like the last two, like I needed to freshen up my legs. Lesson learned, unfortunately.”\n\nBoth Americans were amazed to learn that Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands had won the race, barely outfinishing Tigst Assefa of Ethiopa. The marathon was Hassan’s third event of these Olympics, having already won bronze medals in both the 5k and 10k.\n\n“Oh my God,” Lindwurm said. \"My legs are trashed and I don’t know how she’s running on tired legs. She’s amazing.”\n\nSaid Sisson: “I’m not surprised. She’s a generational talent. I think she is solidified as the GOAT now, if she wasn’t already.” — Dan Wolken\n\nAmerican Dakotah Lindwurm drops off lead pace in marathon\n\nDakotah Lindwurm managed to stick with the lead runners through the 13.1-kilometer halfway point, but has since dropped off the pace set by the lead pack.\n\nThrough 30k, Lindwurm — the lead American runner — was 46 seconds behind the leaders. Another America, Emily Sisson, was more than two minutes behind the leaders.\n\nStill attached to the lead group of Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, winner of the bronze medals in the 5,000m and 10,000 at Stade de France. The lead group also included three Kenyan runners (Sharon Lokedi, Peres Jepchirchir and Hellen Obiri), two Ethiopians (Tigst Assefa and Amane Beriso Shankule), Romania's Delvine Relin Meringor, Japan's Yuka Suzuki and Bahrain's Eunice Chebichii Chumba. Lokedi clocked in with the top time through 30k at 1:43:59.\n\nAmerican Dakotah Lindwurm pacing with lead group in marathon\n\nThe women's marathon is underway in Paris, and 29-year-old American Dakotah Lindwurm was right in the mix with the lead group through the halfway point of the race.\n\nLindwurm was in third place with a time of 1:13:25 at the 13.1-kilometer mark, with Australia's Jessica Stenson just ahead in first place at 1:13:22. Lindwurm was among 20 runners that comprise the lead group.\n\nThe Netherlands' Sifan Hassan, who also won bronze medals in the women's 5,000- and 10,000-meter races at the 2024 Paris Olympics, also is among those runners in the lead group.\n\nFellow American Emily Sisson was 27 seconds off the lead. A third American in the race, Fiona O'Keeffe, dropped out of the race during the opening miles.\n\nOlympics schedule today\n\nHere are some Olympic schedule highlights.

In Paris, the women will be showcased on the final day of the Games, ending just a few hours before the closing ceremony.\n\nOlympic closing ceremony today: What to watch\n\nUnlike the opening ceremony, the closing ceremony will be held at the national stadium with NBC and Peacock offering live coverage beginning at 2 p.m. ET. Jimmy Fallon and Mike Tirico are slotted in as NBC’s hosts. The parade of athletes brings a party atmosphere with music and dancing. At the end, Paris will hand off to the organizers of the 2028 Los Angeles Games.\n\nTeam USA has showed off its speed and strength at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nThe Americans fared well in the pool, but dominated athletics.\n\nThe U.S. won by far the most medals in track and field with 34 overall, the most for the U.S. since winning 40 the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nPARIS — If U.S. women were a nation unto themselves, their results at the 2024 Paris Olympics would make them one of the most dominant athletic countries on earth.\n\nThe exhilarating U.S. soccer victory over Brazil Saturday evening added an exclamation point to what already have been a fabulous Olympic Games for the American women.\n\nThey are winning medals at such a terrific rate that if they jettisoned the guys, they would be third in the overall medal standings, behind only the full U.S. team and China.\n\nThat means half of the U.S. team is performing better at the Paris Olympics than the full teams of about 200 other nations, including 85 countries that have won at least one medal. — Christine Brennan\n\nPARIS — Victor Montalvo became the first Olympic bronze medalist in the history of men's breaking Saturday night.\n\nHe knows he might also be the last.\n\nOrganizers for the next Summer Games in Los Angeles in 2028 had the ability to propose new sports they wanted to include and opted for flag football, cricket and lacrosse over breaking − despite the dance's deep history in the United States, including the fact its birthplace is the Bronx. — Tom Schad\n\nPARIS − After the Paris Olympics conclude Sunday, the Paralympics will run Aug. 28 to Sept. 8, then the squash racket, lacrosse stick and cricket ball − all sporting additions to the 2028 Games − will be in Los Angeles' court.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and and LA28 Olympic Games chair Casey Wasserman, who are in Paris as part of a U.S. presidential delegation to the Olympics that was led by First Lady Jill Biden, provided a few details Saturday to reporters about what sports fans − and Angelenos − can expect to see four years from now. — Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Over in one corner of the foyer sits Richard Carrion, deep in discussion with a fellow member. A few tables away, Ng Ser Miang chats with a colleague over a cup of tea.\n\nAll in the same room, three leading contenders all quietly engaged in the so-far unofficial campaign for perhaps the most powerful job in world sports: president of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nJust don't say out loud that that the race is on.\n\nWith the election nine months away, the campaign to succeed Jacques Rogge is forging ahead behind the scenes without fanfare, policy platforms, debates — or any declared candidates for that matter.\n\nRogge, the Belgian surgeon who has led the Olympic body since 2001, steps down at the end of his term in September 2013. Although no one yet speaks openly about replacing him, the list of potential contenders is an open secret in IOC circles.\n\nSome members are still sounding out their chances, while a few others look certain to run.\n\nThe deadline for declaration of candidacies is not until June, three months before the vote in Buenos Aires on Sept. 10. Candidates are likely to wait until closer to the date before announcing their intentions, thereby avoiding the impression of being too hasty or undercutting the outgoing president.\n\n\"It's little by little coming out in the open,\" Gerhard Heiberg, a senior IOC member from Norway who is not in the running, told The Associated Press. \"It's still too early, but people are preparing for what's going to happen. I think that's good. It's an open field with many possible candidates and that's what we want.\"\n\nHeading the prospective field are Bach, Carrion and Ng. All three were in Lausanne this month for IOC meetings, and they were hard to miss. While Bach and Ng are vice presidents who sit on the ruling executive board, Carrion is no longer a board member and must make an extra effort from outside the inner circle.\n\nAfter the Lausanne meetings, all three men also made the trip to Israel for the 70th birthday celebrations of IOC member Alex Gilady.\n\nBach, a German lawyer and former Olympic fencer, shapes up as the favorite. He ticks several boxes: He's from Europe, the dominant bloc in the IOC. Of the IOC's eight presidents since 1894, only one — Avery Brundage of the United States — came from outside Europe.\n\nThe 58-year-old Bach has been on the executive board — as a regular member or vice president — since 1996. He's a former Olympic athlete, having won the team foil gold medal at the 1976 Montreal Games. As chairman of the IOC juridical commission, he leads most of the investigations into doping cases. He's president of the German Olympic Sports Confederation.\n\nCarrion, chairman of Puerto Rico's largest bank, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, has made his mark as a money man. Head of the IOC's finance and audit commissions, he led the negotiations that secured the record $4.38 billion deal with NBC for U.S. TV rights through 2020. Carrion, 60, also oversees the IOC's financial reserves, which have grown to more than $550 million from $105 million in 2001.\n\nIf Carrion has a drawback, it's that he doesn't have a strong sporting background like Bach.\n\nNg, a 63-year-old member from Singapore, is seen as the candidate from Asia, a continent with growing influence on the world stage. Ng is best known for having led the organizing committee for the inaugural Youth Olympics — Rogge's pet project — in Singapore in 2010. Whether he can marshal the full backing of Asian members remains key to his chances.\n\nBritish bookmakers are even listing odds on the race — with Bach the even-money favorite with Ladbrokes, followed by Carrion at 2-1 and Ng at 6-4.\n\nThere are a handful of others in the frame.\n\nNawal El Moutawakel, the Moroccan who won a gold medal in the women's 400-meter hurdles at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, confirmed recently that she was thinking about a possible run. She was elevated to the IOC vice presidency in July and holds a high-profile position as head of the coordination commission for the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAnother woman, longtime U.S. member and former IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz, is a possible candidate. The former rower, who chairs the women and sports commission, ran for IOC president in 2001, but was eliminated in the first round. DeFrantz has failed in several attempts to return to the executive board since then.\n\nTwo Swiss members, Rene Fasel and Denis Oswald, are also weighing their options. Fasel is president of the International Ice Hockey Federation and led the IOC oversight panel for the 2010 Vancouver Games. Oswald, the former longtime head of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations, chaired the IOC commissions for the 2004 Athens and 2012 London Games.\n\n\"There are a few colleagues who are trying to convince me to run,\" Oswald told The Associated Press. \"I haven't decided yet. I will have to assess the situation and my chances. I will make a decision in a few months, probably.\"\n\nIn the end, a field of four or five candidates would seem likely.\n\n\"Nobody is talking openly and declaring any firm intention but it's always pretty much the same names floating around,\" Oswald said. \"I have the feeling that more than one (are) in the situation where they don't know yet and still wait to see how it develops and talk with some people.\"\n\nRogge was elected to an initial eight-year term and was re-elected unopposed to a final four-year mandate in 2009. The succession battle is developing as the 70-year-old Rogge, coming off recent hip replacement surgery, looks his age — a far cry from the sturdy and youthful man who took over 12 years go.\n\nMembers believe the election campaign should not overshadow the remainder of his presidency.\n\n\"Jacques Rogge is still the president and should not be disturbed by candidates going out openly at this stage,\" Heiberg said. \"I hope the longer it takes before that starts, the better. The closer we get to the day for the voting, the better.\"\n\nHolding off before declaring a candidacy can have strategic advantages. Once members become official candidates, they are covered by tight ethics rules that restrict election campaigning.\n\nUnder rules drawn up the ethics commission, candidates must limit their travel to promote their campaign. So, until then, members can still benefit from traveling to meetings or conferences where they can approach colleagues and privately discuss the election.\n\nThe ethics code also prohibits candidates from using social media to promote themselves and bars them from organizing any public meetings or taking part in any debate. The intention is to \"prevent any excesses\" and conduct the campaign with \"dignity and moderation.\"\n\n\"In a way I think it's not a political election,\" Oswald said. \"It shouldn't be at least. We know each other pretty well. I don't think we need to have a campaign the American way. The president who is able to have the best financial support is the one who is going to be able to win pretty much. It's good that we don't have something similar.\"\n\nRogge, meanwhile, has pledged to remain neutral in the race. The idea of grooming a successor or endorsing a candidate has never been an issue.\n\n\"It's certainly our president's attitude in general not to show any preference,\" Oswald said. \"We have to respect that. I'm pretty sure he won't give any instruction or show any specific support to anyone.\"\n\nFor now, the instruction is simple: Shhhh! The campaign has yet to begin.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/04/sport/gallery/beijing-winter-olympics-best-photos", "title": "The best photos of the Beijing Winter Olympics | CNN", "text": "The Beijing Winter Olympics are in the books.\n\nSunday's closing ceremony wrapped up an action-packed Games filled with memorable moments.\n\nIn figure skating, the United States' Nathan Chen was crowned the new men's champion, setting a world record in the short program and closing the deal with an impressive free skate.

Similarly to Airbnb, Musk said owners will have the option to add their Tesla vehicle to the robotaxi fleet when they are out of town by 2026.\n\n\"These Teslas will be in the wild with no one in them in June,\" Musk said. \"This is not some far off mythical situation. It's literally five, six months away.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHowever, he has made this same promise for many years now with no robotaxis yet in circulation. He did not provide details on how the paid service would work.\n\nMusk later said the company eventually aims for unsupervised self-driving to allow Tesla vehicle owners to focus on their phone instead of the road when the technology can safely allow that. He added these vehicles are already self-driving autonomously at the Tesla factory in Fremont, California.\n\n\"We just need, we need to be very confident that the probability of injury is low before we are able to allow people to check their email and text messages,\" he said.\n\nPrior to Wednesday, analysts have cited the company's advanced Full Self-Driving (FSD) software as a major contributor to its higher-than-expected profit margin in the third quarter, Reuters reported.\n\nMusk also did not give new details on his affordable vehicle plans, including their pricing, size and specifications.\n\nTesla is trying to make cars for less, and it said the average cost of materials and labor for building its cars had hit its lowest level ever in the fourth quarter, driven by lower raw material costs. Reuters calculations showed the cost of making Teslas had fallen to about $33,000 from nearly $39,000 two years earlier.\n\nZuckerberg hails Trump administration: Meta to pay $25 million to settle Donald Trump lawsuit\n\nTesla has a history of delivering products late and the company's recommitment to delivering the new vehicles in the first half of the year was positive, said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Tesla shareholder Globalt Investments, who was also encouraged by its reduced costs.\n\n\"They've been able to execute on the cost side and get that down. Their ability to do that in the fourth quarter definitely cushioned the blow,\" he added.\n\nTesla last year abandoned plans to build a cheaper vehicle platform for the mass market, often called the Model 2, Reuters reported in April. Instead, Musk said the company will use its current electric vehicle platform and production lines to produce more affordable models this year.\n\n\"People are reading into the results that FSD and robotaxi are potentially on the cards in the next couple of years,\" said Will Rhind, CEO of global ETF issuer GraniteShares. Musk, however, said that computers in some older Teslas would have to be upgraded for full self-driving.\n\nTesla has used cheap financing to pump up EV demand, a strategy analysts had predicted would erode automotive profit margins in future quarters as the company absorbs the impact of high interest rates.\n\nHow did Tesla do in the fourth quarter?\n\nTesla's fourth-quarter profit margin from vehicle sales, excluding regulatory credits, fell to 13.59% from 17.05% in the prior three-month period, according to Reuters calculations. Wall Street had expected the figure to be 16.2%, according to 23 analysts polled by Visible Alpha.\n\nRevenue was $25.71 billion for the October-December quarter, compared with estimates of $27.27 billion, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share stood at 73 cents, below the 76 cents analysts had estimated.\n\nThe EV pioneer's annual deliveries dropped for the first time last year, due to higher borrowing costs and intense competition. Rivals such as China's BYD as well as European manufacturers BMW and Volkswagen have launched new cheaper models.\n\nTesla said it expected the vehicle business to return to growth this year, after a small drop in 2024. Musk had said late last year he expected vehicle sales to grow 20% to 30% in 2025, a forecast the company did not repeat in its results announcement.\n\nTrump has vowed to impose this year a range of tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, Europe and other U.S. trading partners − a move that could disrupt supply chains and raise costs for automakers such as Tesla. Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said tariffs, if imposed, would affect Tesla's business and profitability as it still relies on overseas suppliers.\n\nTesla shares were up about 4% Wednesday in after-hours trading after the company softened analyst projections for 2025 vehicle sales growth.\n\nTesla aims to create thousands of robots by year's end\n\nTesla aims to exponentially speed the production of its Optimus humanoid robots within the next few years, including creating thousands in 2025, according to Musk.\n\nThe SpaceX CEO said the Optimus robots, which were the central focus of Wednesday's meeting, will be far more useful than its cars. The robots will offer humans assistance from a broad range of tasks from playing the piano to threading a needle.\n\nMusk said he expects the robots to eventually exceed Tesla vehicles as the company's primary revenue, but clarified the exact timing for this process remains uncertain. He compared the creation process to designing a moving train while simultaneously developing the tracks and the station it's heading to.\n\n\"It doesn't take very many years before we're making 100 million of these things a year,\" Musk said. \"This is such an exponential ramp that it'll go from 'no one's receiving humanoid robots' to 'these things are coming out like crazy, we can't build enough.'\"\n\nAffordable model, AI development, more\n\nTesla also plans to launch a more affordable model in the first half of 2025, according to Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja.\n\nAnother key success driver is AI development, which Musk said will make 2025 the most significant year in Tesla's history.\n\n\"There is no company in the world that is as good at real world AI as Tesla. I don't even know who's in second place,\" Musk said. \"I would need a very big telescope to see them. That's how far behind they are.\"\n\nHe also credited Tesla's energy business as a vital revenue driver, adding that energy storage \"enables far greater energy output to the grid than is currently possible.\"\n\nThis story was updated to add new information.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/tech/ford-self-driving-argo-shutdown", "title": "Ford takes $2.7 billion hit as it drops efforts to develop full self ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nFord is essentially pulling the plug on an effort to develop its first full self-driving car, and it’s going to cost the automaker $2.7 billion to walk away.\n\nThe company announced Wednesday it would no longer provide financial support for Argo AI, a self-driving car technology company it invested $1 billion in back in 2017.\n\nInstead of having Argo develop self-driving car technology for cars without steering wheels, brakes or accelerator pedals — what is known in the industry as Level 4 or L4 technology — Ford will instead pursue in-house development of a lower level of automated driving technology.\n\nThe level it will now pursue on its own, known as Level 3 or L3, allows a driver to not pay attention to the road in certain conditions, such as on the highway, but it would expect a driver to be aware enough to quickly take control of the car if needed.\n\nThe decision will mean that Argo AI will shutdown. And the drop in value of Ford’s investment in Argo caused it to take a $2.7 billion charge in the just-completed third quarter. That resulted in an $827 million loss in the period.\n\nEven excluding the special charges for Argo and other items, Ford reported adjusted earnings per share of 30 cents, a slide from the 51 cents it earned on that basis a year ago, but a slight improvement over the 27 cents forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.\n\nFord reported automotive revenue of $37.2 billion, a jump of $4 billion from a year ago and $1 billion more than the analysts’ forecasts. The revenue was helped by a $3.4 billion from higher pricing on vehicles.\n\nFord did have some problems in the quarter beyond the charge it took for closing down Argo. It said supply shortages left it with about 40,000 vehicles in its inventory at the end of the quarter that were built but awaiting needed parts before they can be shipped to dealers.\n\nIt also was hit with $1 billion in higher-than-expected supplier payments, and a $1.5 billion increase in commodity costs.\n\nAnd it had a smaller profit and profit margin in its core North American market due to those higher commodity costs, and a loss in China, due to costs associated with the development of electric vehicles.\n\nWhile higher pricing on vehicles helped its European unit post a narrow profit in the quarter compared to a narrow loss a year ago, CEO Jim Farley did concede, “Our performance in China and Europe is not nearly as healthy as we’d like it to be.”\n\nBut, in good news, Ford raised its goal for full-year cash that will be generated by the business to be between $9.5 billion and $10 billion — up from $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion — on strength in the company’s automotive operations.\n\nShares of Ford (F) were down 1% in after-hours trading following the earnings news.\n\nBut in the end, the big news of the earnings report was a major change in direction on self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe company insists it still expects to offer full self-driving vehicles in the future, just not soon enough to make the investment such technology will require today. It said it decided it is better to invest in driver assistance technology that is closer to being implemented on vehicles today, and that customers want from their new cars, rather than a fleet of robo-taxis with no drivers at all aboard.\n\n“We’re optimistic about a future for L4 ADAS [advanced driver assistance systems], but profitable, fully autonomous vehicles at scale are a long way off and we won’t necessarily have to create that technology ourselves,” said Farley.\n\nFarley said he expects to be able to find jobs for many of the Argo employees at Ford, having them switch gears to develop L3 driver assistance features.\n\n“That’s really the decision, in many ways, that is driving what we’re doing here at Argo… we are deeply passionate about the L3 mission,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief advanced product development and technology officer.\n\nHe said there is only so much talent available to develop the different driver assistance and self-driving features.\n\n“So this is the way we want to use that talent,” he said.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Matt Mcfarland Peter Valdes-Dapena", "Chris Isidore", "Matt Mcfarland", "Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2023/11/10/gm-cruise-safety-stock-market-investors-self-driving-autonomous-vehicles/71520901007/", "title": "GM Cruise safety issues has investors, Wall Street watching closely", "text": "Sam Abuelsamid has had firsthand experience with safety concerns riding in a self-driving car operated by General Motors' subsidiary Cruise.\n\nCruise had been operating its self-driving robotaxi fleets in San Francisco, Austin, Texas, and Phoenix in recent months until it halted all operations last week following an incident in San Francisco in which a car hit a pedestrian, forcing her in the path of a driverless Cruise car that then pinned her underneath and dragged her several feet, critically injuring her.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2020/01/21/gm-cruise-origin-self-driving-ride-hailing-robotaxi/4536725002/", "title": "GM's Cruise takes wraps off Origin, self-driving ride-hailing robotaxi", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO – The world's first self-driving electric-powered ride-sharing vehicle is here, but no word on when you'll actually be able to app-hail this robotaxi.\n\nCruise, the self-driving car division of General Motors, unveiled the Origin on Tuesday night in a former Honda dealership just south of downtown. The six-passenger vehicle looks a bit like a small bus, has no steering wheel or pedals, and offers a cavernous area where two rows of three passengers face each other.\n\nIn introducing the vehicle, Cruise CEO Dan Ammann, a former president of GM, told a crowd made up mostly of company employees that the Origin \"is a production vehicle,\" adding that an announcement about where and when manufacturing will begin is coming soon.\n\nKyle Vogt, Cruise's co-founder who sold the company to GM in 2016 for $1 billion and now serves as chief technology officer, said that being the first automotive or tech company to introduce a dedicated autonomous ride-sharing car doesn't guarantee success.\n\n\"There are pros and cons to being the first mover on this,\" said Vogt. \"Our plan is to keep investing on the self-driving software side of things, to the point where that becomes the thing that really makes a difference to the experience.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nConsumers have yet to warm in huge numbers to sharing their Uber or Lyft rides with other riders, and Ammann said that Origins can be hailed by a single rider.\n\nBut Vogt felt confident that the roomy and clubby nature of Origin's interior would \"cut into the friction and discomfort that often comes with cramming into the back seat of a car with someone you don't know, and therefore increase the adoption of these vehicles.\"\n\nCruise's announcement comes at a time when long-running excitement in the past decade over the prospect of self-driving EVs has gradually turned to skepticism, as promises about when consumers will finally be able to ride in them get broken.\n\nIn 2018, Cruise, which has been testing a fleet of sensor-packed Chevrolet Bolt EVs throughout San Francisco, announced that a ride-hailing service open to the public would kick off in 2019. Currently, such a service is only available to Cruise employees.\n\nNeither Vogt nor Ammann offered a new prediction, with both focusing instead on the need to continue to refine existing sensors and develop new ones.\n\nAt the presentation, Vogt showed off a device that was attached to the front of the Origin when he said was capable to \"superhuman\" abilities when it comes to scanning for nearby pedestrians, cyclists and motorists.\n\nCruise's technology came in for scrutiny last summer, when The Information, a technology-focused media site, reported that cautious Cruise vehicles sometimes took 80% longer to complete rides than a standard ride-sharing vehicle and that software glitches often required the human safety drivers to take control of the vehicle.\n\n\"We've made a lot of progress, but we haven't cracked that superhuman threshold yet, so tomorrow it's back to work,\" said Vogt.\n\nGM bought Cruise at arguably the height of the self-driving car craze, when tech start-ups such as Google and Uber were pouring resources into the field. Not wanting to get caught out, some automakers opted to buy their way into the autonomous game, with Ford buying Argo AI in 2017 with a $1 billion-over-five-years deal.\n\nFord has set a 2021 goal to unveil a ride-hailing service powered by a self-driving hybrid vehicle, with a mission to pick up passengers and also deliver goods. Cruise also said that its Origin vehicle could easily be reconfigured to accept packages.\n\nCruise has been fueled by a series of major investments in recent years, including a $2.2 billion infusion from Japanese investment firm SoftBank and $750 million from Japanese automaker Honda.\n\nThe company currently has a valuation of $19 billion, much of that predicated on the promise of delivering a ride-hailing service that will greatly undercut the fares of Uber, Lyft and other human-driven services.\n\nCruise executives said the modular and low-speed nature of the Origin EV means that each vehicle will cost less to produce (about half of what it takes to build an electric SUV, according to Ammann) and be able to run 24/7 for up to 1 million miles.\n\nWhile the valuations of companies such as Uber and Lyft remain high, some analysts question whether a business model anchored to subsidized rides is tenable long term. The most expensive part of a ride-hailing journey remains the driver.\n\nSelf-driving cars have been a near obsession at many technology companies, foremost among them Google. The Silicon Valley search company, now called Alphabet, started tinkering with the idea more than a decade ago and by most accounts has made the most progress based on sheer miles driven in the real world and in simulators.\n\nGoogle's self-driving car company, Waymo, has been testing a ride-hailing service in select cities with specially made Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid SUVs. The company also has developed a two-person vehicle with no controls that has undergone testing at private facilities, and also tests cars with no drivers behind the wheel in California.\n\nOne unknown remains human adoption: Will consumers' innate concerns about having tech at the wheel with no possibility of human intervention been overridden by the lure of cheap fares?\n\nIn 2018, an Uber self-driving Volvo struck and killed a woman in Arizona when the car's sensors failed to see her crossing a busy thoroughfare and the on-board safety driver did not react in time.\n\nThat was a stark reminder that accidents will happen with self-driving cars. But proponents of the new technology point to the 40,000 Americans killed each year in traffic accidents, typically due to human error.\n\nCruise, in fact, opened its event with a video presentation that featured the sights and sounds of a car's engine starting, followed by the thunderous sound of a car crash.\n\n\"Speed or safety?\" said Ammann after taking the stage. \"What if you didn't have to choose?\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY national correspondent Marco della Cava: @marcodellacava", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/detroit-auto-show/2017/01/07/new-mobility-automakers-technology/96107234/", "title": "New mobility is challenging automakers' assumptions", "text": "Greg Gardner\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nWhether you regard “new mobility” as an over-hyped trend of the moment or a preview of our future, it threatens the foundation of an auto industry built on the premise that more is better.\n\nIndeed, there are a slew of unanswered questions.\n\nDo we really want robots driving us around?

Amazon, we know you’re out there, but so far this is one domain the Seattle-based “Everything Store” has tiptoed around.\n\nSkepticism is usually healthy, but here are a few reasons we are actually on the cusp of major change, at least in big cities.\n\nPain of driving: It is not heresy, even in the Motor City, to say driving is not always fun. Addiction: Smartphones, or their next iteration, are not going away and neither is our addiction to them. More free time: Many of us can be more creative, productive and less stressed when we have more choices for how to get from Point A to Point B. Cost factor: The cost of insurance and parking isn’t falling. Most of us already have friends or family in larger cities who have decided those costs aren’t worth it, and they don’t feel trapped not owning a car. Cool factor: The software needed to “teach” machines to drive, and the freedom from auto-dependency is making the auto industry “cool” far beyond the confines of mechanical engineering students. Traditional automakers are finding it easier to attract software coders and robotics engineers who five years ago headed straight to Silicon Valley. That’s a good thing for southeastern Michigan. It's real: The technology is here. True the regulatory and legal systems have to work through thorny issues, but this is not a science-fiction fantasy.\n\nDegree of change will vary by geography\n\nOutside major cities, the change won’t be that threatening.\n\n“No one’s taking your car away if you want to drive,” said Gary Silberg, national automotive leader for KPMG, a global consulting and accounting firm. “Over time as semi- and fully autonomous vehicle technology becomes common, all vehicles will have most of the capabilities on the spectrum.”\n\nThe vast majority of early self-driving, or Level 5, AVs will be in ride-hailing fleets such as Uber, Lyft and perhaps airport shuttle fleets.\n\nAdvocates point to the potential safety benefits. There were 35,200 traffic deaths in the U.S. in 2015, up 7.7% from 2014. Data from the first six months of 2016 indicate there will be another increase.\n\nRead more:\n\nMany pathways to the promised land of self-driving cars\n\nAuto show to spotlight mobility tech\n\nGlobally, there are about 1.2 million traffic fatalities annually, according to the World Health Organization\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports 94% of fatal crashes in the U.S. are caused by human error.\n\nThe catch is that today’s self-driving technology is nowhere near as safe as the average human driver. The target is to make autonomous driver 100 times safer than a human driver. That will take hundreds of millions of more test miles driven.\n\nSo autonomous cars are not going to replace human driven vehicles in our lifetimes. There will still be traffic deaths, but potentially tens of thousands less per year in the U.S. alone.\n\nA 2015 McKinsey & Co. study estimated that by 2030 when the technology is reliably safe, self-driving cars could cut U.S. traffic fatalities by 90%, or roughly 30,000 a year. That could reduce damages and health care costs tied to accidents by as much as $190 billion a year.\n\nSome jobs may disappear\n\nYes, jobs are at risk. Uber said about 600,000 drivers in the U.S. and 1.5 million worldwide. Not all those drivers will be replaced by software at once. In initial stages such as Uber’s self-driving tests in Pittsburgh, the vehicles are restricted to a few routes that its vision and mapping tools can safely navigate.\n\nJohn Zimmer, Lyft co-founder and president, said Lyft has about 700,000 drivers and he predicted that a majority of Lyft vehicles will be self-driving within five years.\n\nThere are 3.5 million over-the-road truck drivers, according to the American Trucking Association. But Bob Costello, the ATA’s chief economist, recently said there’s a shortage of between 35,000 and 40,000.\n\nPlatooning — the synchronized spacing and speed-control that can connect a series of trucks — is the main form in which autonomy can increase efficiency, reduce driver fatigue and save fuel. But there are regulatory issues to resolve.\n\nIn November the American Transportation Research Institute warned that significant infrastructure spending is needed to remove potholes and repaint faded lane marking before platooning and other autonomous benefits can make a difference.\n\nOn the bright side, our daily routines could change for the better.\n\nLet’s take a typical example. Say you walk four blocks between a parking deck and your office at least twice a day. Of course the car sits for eight, sometimes 10 hours a day.\n\nOver two years that distance is roughly 26 miles, or about the same as a marathon. In the time needed for that stroll, in my case, I could have written 50 to 75 more stories, maybe even a book.\n\nOr you could deal with those e-mails you should not have answered while driving.\n\nRethinking urban land-use\n\nThen think about other uses for the real estate now occupied by parking structures. In a city like San Francisco, where housing is scarce and unaffordable for most residents, they could be converted to apartments, art galleries or green space.\n\nFirst, parking decks are not the most attractive architecture in our cityscapes. Second, as with vehicles, many of these structures sit idle and empty between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n\nRead more:\n\nSelf-driving fleets to give consumers more options\n\nThe days of self-driving cars are closer than you think\n\n“All of a sudden we can create more living space,” said Stefan Knupfer, former head of McKinsey’s automotive practice in Detroit, who now focuses on sustainability. “The denser a city’s population, the more receptive it will be to autonomous cars.”\n\nA 2011 University of California-Berkeley study found there are about 1 billion parking spaces in the U.S. to accommodate a vehicle population of about 260 million. Cumulatively this country devotes 6,500 square miles to parking, an area larger than Connecticut.\n\nThat's enough for re-imagining urban development and commuting patterns.\n\nWho will profit and how?\n\nHow does any business, whether manufacturer, service provider or software creator, make money from transportation services that go beyond personal vehicle ownership?\n\nGeneral Motors can buy a stake of Lyft, acquire Cruise Automation. Ford can buy a Chariot, a small shuttle service in San Francisco. And Fiat Chrysler can partner with Google, now Waymo, to automate minivans.\n\nBut how patient will shareholders be? Can they hold on until the path to profitability becomes clear?\n\nHere’s the challenge. The vast majority of automakers’ revenue has come from the sale of a big-ticket item, ranging in price from $15,000 to $100,000. If the customer has a positive experience over four to seven years, she may come back to the same brand for her next vehicle.\n\nLeasing, which now accounts for about 30% of all vehicle transactions, accelerates that cycle. Getting customers to have maintenance done at the dealership where they bought augments that cycle, but there are no guarantees the customer will return.\n\nAs transportation becomes more service and software-based, rather than product-centric, the world changes.\n\n“The only way automakers can succeed in the coming world is to sell people on becoming a GM, Ford, BMW or Toyota person based on services and data,” said Brendan O’Brien, co-founder and chief innovation officer of Aria Systems, a San Francisco-based software company that is helping product-based companies adopt to a service or usage-based model. “If traditional companies can do that, then they have an opportunity to for an ongoing relationship with customers in a service-based model.”\n\nThink about something like a lease, but you are acquiring the ability to use 150,000 miles over four years during which you have access to four or five vehicles depending on your needs. One might want an SUV for vacations or weekend trips, perhaps a fully autonomous compact car for commuting, or a crossover for weekend errands.\n\nAudi already does this in San Francisco and Miami. BMW tried it in North America a few years ago but halted the program in 2013. Just this past Thursday GM's luxury brand launched Book by Cadillac through which a customer can have access to concierge-delivery of any of five or six Cadillac models for $1,500 a month.\n\nBut who will we go to for that type of deal? A dealer? A branch office of GM, Ford or Toyota? Or an Uber, Maven, Chariot or Zipcar station?\n\nUnder Book by Cadillac the concierges will be dispatched by non-dealer representatives.\n\n“This will be about fleet management. Dealers’ role is going to change,” Aria’s O’Brien said. “They may not continue to be the main entry point for the consumer.”\n\nAnother key to the new business model will be commercializing the growing reservoir of data new vehicles are collecting, but doing so without violating privacy rules.\n\nFor example, Progressive, Allstate, State Farm and others offer devices that plug into the car’s on-board diagnostic port to monitor everything from a driver’s speed to rates of acceleration braking patterns. The data are transmitted wirelessly to the insurance company.\n\nDepending on what it shows the insurer may reduce or raise the driver’s premium. What it doesn’t do is show the driver what rates competing insurers might offer based on the same information.\n\n“What if the car companies did that?” O’Brien said. “They could analyze the data and compare rates from a range of insurers. Then for a small fee, show that data to their customer who can then choose the option that saves the most of their premium.”\n\nHere’s the question that no one can answer yet. When robo-taxis become a mainstream choice for city dwellers, which company will be regarded as providing the most value? The maker of the vehicle? The company that developed the self-driving technology? Or the app creator?\n\nThink of it like the smartphone. Companies such as Samsung, Apple, LG, Lenovo and Huawei may be doing the manufacturing innovation and they get paid upfront when we buy their phones, but we write our checks each month to Verizon, AT&T, Sprint or T-mobile.\n\nSays McKinsey’s Knupfer, “The worst scenario for the auto industry would be that the vehicle becomes like the cell phone and the new players become the wireless providers.”\n\nContact Greg Gardner: 313-222-8762 or ggardner@freepress.com.

But are we going to continue making mistakes or can we learn from them?”\n\nThe shift to greater fossil fuel reliance comes as little surprise.\n\nA 2017 NYISO study predicted the 2,000 megawatts of power lost when Indian Point closed would be picked up by three new natural gas plants – in Dover Plains, Wawayanda and Bayonne, N.J. One megawatt powers between 800 and 1,000 homes.\n\nAnd Indian Point’s former owner, Louisiana-based Entergy, noted that the year after its Vermont Yankee plant shut down in 2014, natural gas-fired generation jumped 12 percent, just as it has since the Buchanan plant closed. The first of Indian Point’s two working reactors shut down in April 2020, followed by the second in April 2021.\n\nWith Indian Point eliminated from the energy mix, it has become even harder to wean a downstate region that includes New York City off fossil fuels.\n\nWhy did the plant close?\n\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration brokered the 2017 deal with Entergy that led to Indian Point’s shutdown, with Cuomo citing fears of a nuclear mishap at a power plant located some 35 miles from New York City. He chose to keep open three upstate nuclear plants – two on Lake Ontario and another near Rochester − by arranging for some $7.6 billion in subsidies over 12 years.\n\nBut the agreement that shuttered Indian Point came when natural gas was cheap. Entergy cited competition from natural gas in the energy market as the prime mover behind its decision to close a plant that had generated electricity for Westchester County and New York City for six decades.\n\nToday, with natural gas prices surging, electricity is not so cheap.\n\n“We got used to having historically cheap natural gas in the United States,” said Madison Hilly, the founder and executive director of the Campaign for a Green Nuclear Deal in Chicago. “So places that shut down their nuclear plants, even if they were replaced with gas, consumers really didn't feel that in their pocketbooks. Now the era of nonprofit natural gas − as I call it − seems to be over. It's really expensive.”\n\nThe push to reconsider nuclear power\n\nIn 2021, the average wholesale price of electricity in New York was $47.59 per megawatt hour last year, nearly double what it was the previous year. NYISO’s independent monitor credited the increase in wholesale electric prices to the Indian Point shutdown, the NYISO report said.\n\nCalifornia, which is pursuing a slate of clean energy goals like New York’s, appears to be rethinking its decision to do away with nuclear power.\n\nIn May, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he would support keeping the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant open beyond its planned 2025 closure to ensure the reliability of the state’s electric grid. Researchers from Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have concluded keeping the plant open for another ten years could limit carbon emissions and save the state $2.6 billion in power costs.\n\nHilly has teamed with Nuclear New York, a coalition of scientists, engineers and labor and management from the nuclear industry, to urge the state to give nuclear power a larger role in the state’s energy mix. In April, Hansen, a former NASA scientist who was among the first to identify the consequences from climate change, appeared at an Albany press conference to urge the state to include nuclear in a plan being drafted for the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.\n\n“We're trying to prevent the situation from getting that bad – that reality that forces politicians to eat crow,” Hilly said. “Eventually, if we keep going down this path, ratepayers and voters are not going to tolerate it and politicians will quickly have to get on board or get out.”\n\nA spokesman for Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state is forging ahead with its twin goals of having 70% of the state’s electric demand met by renewables by 2030 and 100% zero emissions by 2040.\n\n“These goals, which are being met through solar, wind, and hydroelectricity along with the continued use of the state’s three existing upstate nuclear plants, were developed to reduce emissions from fossil fuels, combat the dangerous impacts of climate change and benefit New Yorkers by reducing volatility in electricity pricing,” spokesman Leo Rosales said. “Planning for these goals took into account the necessary closure of Indian Point following dozens of safety and operational hazards and in no way jeopardizes New York’s clean energy goals or the reliability of the state’s electric grid.\"\n\nNY's electric grid under siege\n\nIncreased energy costs are only part of the problem.\n\nNYISO’s June \"Power Trends\" report offers a sobering assessment of grid reliability in the years ahead.\n\nThe amount of energy resources the state can access each day is decreasing, and that trend is expected to worsen in the years to come as the demand for electricity surges. Electricity needed to charge cars and heat buildings will shift peak usage to the winter instead of summer, which typically sees the highest energy usage as air conditioners run around the clock.\n\nAdding to the problem are environmental regulations that will impact the output of the state’s peaker plants, fossil-fuel generated plants that take their name from delivering energy at times of peak demand. Roughly half of the 3,300 megawatts these plants generate in the lower Hudson Valley, Long Island and New York City will be unavailable during the summer of 2025, NYISO notes.\n\n“The margins that we see on our system are shrinking,” NYISO president and chief executive officer Rich Dewey told reporters at a media briefing last month.\n\nThe grid is in perhaps the most transformative moment in its history.\n\nOlder generating plants are being shut down while the state introduces a slate of renewable energy projects – offshore wind on Long Island, wind power upstate, batteries to store solar energy.\n\nA network of transmission lines stretching from western New York to New York City is currently under construction, part of an effort to remove a bottleneck that kept clean energy stuck north of Albany. Upstate’s energy mix is decidedly cleaner than downstate’s. Upstate, three nuclear power plants and hydropower from the Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station contribute to a 91% carbon-free energy grid.\n\nThere are also plans to deliver hydropower to New York City from Canada by way of 340 miles of underground cable that will run in the Hudson River. Another 174-mile transmission line will bring upstate wind down to Queens along upstate rights-of-way.\n\nBut it will be years before these projects are up and running.\n\nThe NYISO report anticipates a 10% gap in the amount of renewable power that will be available on an as-needed basis in the winter of 2040.\n\n“We've identified there is a need for dispatchable, emissions-free resources,” Dewey said. “That technology does not yet exist and there's a gap that needs to be closed. We're only going to get so far with wind, solar and storage, due to the intermittent nature of those resources.”\n\nAnd by next year, a heatwave with an average temperate of 95 degrees may result in thin margins and “significant deficiencies,” NYISO says.\n\nA 98-degree heatwave would test the system’s limits today and exceed grid capabilities next year, the report adds.\n\n“We're taking on a little bit more risk in our ability to manage unplanned, unforeseen events on the power system, or potentially severe weather events,” Dewey added.\n\nNYISO isn’t alone in its concerns about grid reliability. The state’s utilities have been raising their concerns.\n\nA group representing most of the state’s major utilities recently studied energy production for the month of January, an especially cold month and the first winter when Indian Point wasn’t producing power. The plant’s Unit 2 shut down in 2020 and Unit 3 the following year.\n\nWind and other renewables contributed 5% of total generation. There was less wind and less solar generation due to shorter daylight hours and heavy cloud cover.\n\n“Today’s renewable resources are emissions-free, but their output is weather-dependent,” the Utility Consultation Group analysis says. “This intermittency and the need for electric supply to meet customer energy demand every hour of the day may result in reliability issues if not proactively addressed.”\n\nThe group represents Central Hudson, ConEdison, Rochester, Niagara Mohawk, NYSEG and Orange and Rockland utilities.\n\n'Closing Indian Point was a mistake'\n\nCritics of the deal that led to Indian Point’s closure question why the plant couldn’t remain open while the state pursued a renewable buildout.\n\n“Maybe someday renewables could be a big factor in the energy market,” said Theresa Knickerbocker, the mayor of the lower Hudson Valley village of Buchanan, home to Indian Point. “But, right now, two gas plants were opened up to compensate for the loss of Indian Point, which has zero carbon emissions. It’s kind of hypocritical, right?”\n\nBuchanan faces the loss of some $3.5 million in property taxes that Entergy paid the village while the reactors were still operating.\n\nBusiness groups fear the thinner energy surplus could impact a factory’s ability to deliver goods on time, while driving away companies that are considering relocating.\n\n“The renewable buildout is a multi-decade process,” said Ken Pokalsky, the vice president of the Business Council of New York. “It's probably going slower than we would like. Every one of these project is complicated…It would be safe to say it's moving forward. But fast enough is a subjective evaluation.”\n\nNuclear New York wants the state to work with the federal government to encourage and develop new nuclear reactors, which don't produce the nuclear waste that older generation reactors do.\n\nThis week, Entergy announced it was partnering with Holtec, the New Jersey company that is tearing down Indian Point, in a deal to build small nuclear reactors. Their plan envisions building one of the first reactors at Oyster Creek, a shutdown nuclear power plant in New Jersey.\n\nAnd the nuclear group wants New York to continue the subsidies that have allowed the three upstate nuclear power plants to continue beyond 2029.\n\nSchue said other nations have been adopting the next generation of nuclear energy generation into the mix. \"We'd like to change that,\" Schue said. \"We'd like to see New York step up to the plate. We've got the skills. We've got the spirit of innovation, we have the manpower.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/05/31/end-era-as-pilgrim-pumps/5014423007/", "title": "End of an era as Pilgrim pumps out its last watt", "text": "Christine Legere Cape Cod Times\n\nPLYMOUTH — Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station, which weathered four-plus decades of nor’easters, protests and lawsuits, in the end could not withstand energy market forces and the costs of operating an aging plant.\n\nThe state’s only nuclear plant, which provided about 17 percent the state's electrical power, shut down for good at 5:28 p.m. Friday..\n\nEntergy Corp., the plant’s owner-operator, announced in October 2015 that it planned to close the 680-megawatt reactor. A month earlier, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission categorized it as one of the worst-run plants in the country.\n\nThe plant climbed back into Category 1 — requiring the least federal oversight — in March after undergoing thousands of hours of inspections and addressing hundreds of items on a checklist of violations.\n\nBut it still limped to the finish line, never returning to full power after temporarily shutting down May 17 because of problems with a pump that delivers water to the cooling system — the latest in a long series of manual shutdowns in the last five years.\n\nPilgrim, which began generating electricity in December 1972, will descend into permanent shutdown in a process that takes about five hours. But work at the 100-acre portion of the Plymouth site where the plant sits will continue, as the years-long process of decommissioning begins, and plant watchdogs will find a new set of concerns to monitor.\n\nPilgrim attracted enthusiastic supporters and vocal detractors during its 47-year history.\n\nThe plant has provided six-figure incomes to some who worked there, customers for local businesses and millions of dollars in host fees and perks for the town of Plymouth.\n\nCritics have pointed out the frequent equipment problems and alleged deficiencies in emergency planning for an operation that could affect hundreds of miles around it if a major malfunction occurred.\n\nBut as the town’s population slowly grew from 19,000 when the plant opened to 60,000 today, many residents did not think much about Pilgrim either way.\n\n“Most people didn’t have an opinion because they didn’t deal with it,” state Sen. Viriato “Vinny” deMacedo said. “They knew it was there and went on with life. Of course, you clearly had people who opposed it.”\n\nBudding opposition\n\nBill Abbott moved to Plymouth in 1973, a stone’s throw from the Manomet property where the Pilgrim plant sits on the shore of Cape Cod Bay. The reactor had begun churning out power less than a year earlier.\n\nA physics and engineering major in college, Abbott was eager to educate himself on nuclear power. The more he read, the more concerned he became over the impacts of exposure to low levels of radiation.\n\nIn those early days, Pilgrim, then owned and run by Boston Edison, enjoyed considerable popularity in town because it provided high-paying jobs and helped keep taxes low.\n\nFew voices initially joined Abbott’s in opposition.\n\n“There was no one on our side anywhere,” he recalled. “Even my friends thought I was on some kooky venture. My father, who was in the utility business, asked, ‘Why are you doing this?’”\n\nWhen Boston Edison announced plans for two more reactors on the same property in 1974, Abbott took action. He contacted Dan Ford, then executive director of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge. The pair established the Plymouth County Nuclear Information Committee, known as PICNIC.\n\n“We had a storefront on Main Street,” he said. “We even had a nice little brochure. It said, ‘Do you know what plutonium is?’ On the inside it said, ‘You’d better find out.’\n\nIt was black with white lettering, designed to get everyone’s attention.”\n\nPICNIC peppered Boston Edison with lawsuits, with as many as six pending at one time. It seemed the natural course to Abbott, who was a lawyer and could represent the citizens group.\n\n“It was clear to me the only way to stop them was to litigate it in every way possible,” Abbott said. “Power companies can deal with people physically trying to block trucks, but it’s more effective to do it in court.”\n\nBoston Edison abandoned plans for the other two reactors, although it took until 1981 for the utility giant to give up on Pilgrim 2.\n\n“When they threw in the towel, we had a celebration at Bert's, and the room was full,” Abbott said.\n\nAmong the lawsuits filed by Abbott’s group was a class action suit in 1979 against Boston Edison and the state departments of Public Health, Public Works and Environmental Quality Engineering and what was then the state Civil Defense Agency.\n\nThe case was settled. The agreement included such provisions as expanding the emergency zone from 5 to 10 miles and using 40 to 50 monitors to track radiation within 10 miles of the plant.\n\nEnvironmentalists, meanwhile, were fighting to replace the plant’s cooling system, which, under federal and state permits, drew 500 million gallons of seawater from Cape Cod Bay each day to cool the reactor, trapping thousands of fish and other marine life in the process. The water was then discharged into the bay at temperatures up to 30 degrees hotter than when it entered.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Plymouth County Nuclear Information Committee appealed the issuance of the permits, pushing for a longer pipe that would discharge the water about a half-mile from shore. That effort failed, and the plant’s cooling system remained unchanged throughout its 47-year history.\n\nCape Cod scientist Charles “Stormy” Mayo has expressed concerns about the warming of Cape Cod Bay for years, but he said that although the plant was an obvious contributor, it was difficult to say to what extent because factors related to climate change also contributed.\n\n“We’re seeing layer after layer of change, but it’s impossible to say for certain the percentage of decline due to the thermal pollution of the power plant,” he said.\n\nA tough decade\n\nThe 1980s was a tough decade for Pilgrim. In 1982, the NRC fined Boston Edison $550,000 — the largest penalty in the commission’s history at the time — for giving the agency false information and for its subsequent delay in reporting the information was false.\n\nPilgrim’s first extended shutdown was in December 1983, when the reactor was powered down for a year to replace cracked pipes in the water system caused by corrosion.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1989, the plant was placed on a federally ordered extended shutdown for frequent equipment issues and a series of emergency power-downs.\n\nOpponents of the plant fought vigorously to keep it permanently closed, but Pilgrim received the go-ahead from the NRC to restart after nearly three years.\n\nMary Lampert, founder of Pilgrim Watch in Duxbury, and Diane Turco, co-founder of Cape Downwinders, along with a small band of other protesters, were arrested and taken to jail on New Year’s Eve 1988 for trespassing on the plant property during a demonstration against the reactor’s pending restart.\n\nTurco said she had not planned to step over the property line but couldn’t let her fellow Cape protester and friend Sarah Thacher step over alone. Since that first time, Turco has lost track of her trips to jail for plant-related civil disobedience, and her fellow Downwinders have frequently joined her.\n\n“The risk of something happening at Pilgrim has always overshadowed what might happen to me,” Turco said.\n\nEntergy takes over\n\nIn 1999, Pilgrim became the first nuclear power plant in the country to be sold through a competitive bid process. Entergy bought it for $80 million.\n\nCitizens groups continued fighting, offering particularly vehement opposition to the reactor’s federal relicensing in 2012.\n\n“Of the $80 million, $67 million of it was for its fuel,” said David Lochbaum, former director of the Nuclear Safety Program for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “If you buy a used car and pay more for the fuel in its tank than on its engine, tires and radio, you have simply got to understand that you are not acquiring a reliable car in the prime of its life.”\n\nEntergy was able to keep “this junker on the road ticket-free for a while,” Lochbaum said. A change in upper management in 2011 shifted the focus from safety performance to financial performance, in his opinion.\n\nWhether it was the result of management or worn-out parts or lack of upkeep, by 2015 Pilgrim and two other Entergy-owned reactors were categorized as Column 4 performers by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the worst in the country and one step from mandatory shutdown.\n\nThe plant remained in Column 4 until two months ago, when the commission moved it to Column 1, even though it was shut down for 60 days for equipment problems in 2018.\n\nOther safety issues were raised through the years. Upper Cape resident Paul Rifkin, a longtime activist, said Turco’s continued passion and perseverance inspired him to join the cause in 2012.\n\nRifkin asked a friend with a helicopter to fly over the plant so he could take pictures. The photos showed Entergy was building a pad for spent fuel casks without first getting a permit, he said.\n\nBut the trip pointed to a far more troubling deficiency.\n\n“It demonstrated there was no security: Nobody called the pilot and said ‘You can’t be there,’” he said. “If you can fly over the plant like that, you can fly into the plant like that.”\n\nMixed reactions\n\nPilgrim has been a loser from the start, Lampert said, with a switchyard historically plagued by short circuits during blizzards, unreliable backup diesel generators and safety-related systems that have failed when needed.\n\nAs director of Pilgrim Watch, Lampert through the years has spent as many as 50 hours each week on plant-related issues. She has penned too many petitions to count, urging tighter requirements.\n\nThe group has had many successes, Lampert said, including Duxbury’s decision to stockpile potassium iodide pills to temporarily prevent thyroid damage from radiation. The state soon followed suit, providing potassium iodide to communities around the plant.\n\nThe group also promoted real-time radiation monitoring, with Duxbury leading the way by buying its own system. Other causes pushed by Pilgrim Watch and the town of Duxbury include installing monitoring wells to track any contamination from the property and transferring radioactive spent fuel out of a pool in the reactor building and into dry casks.\n\n“I know I’ll hear, ‘Good, that’s the end of the subject’” when the plant closes, “but there’s a lot left to do,” Lampert said.\n\nPilgrim’s presence will be missed by some, however, including local business owners who have benefited from the patronage of the 580 workers at the plant as well as property owners whose tax bills have been kept low thanks to the millions of dollars Pilgrim pitched in via host agreements with the town.\n\n“As it was coming to the end of its life, safety has been a big concern, but people also recognized the plant provided a lot of jobs and a lot of tax revenue to the community,” said Kevin O’Reilly, former executive director of the Plymouth Area Chamber of Commerce and current vice chairman of the Nuclear Decommissioning Citizens Advisory Panel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/05/30/three-mile-island-1969-today/355837001/", "title": "Three Mile Island from 1969 to today", "text": "July 1969: Met-Ed begins construction on Unit 2.\n\nSeptember 1974: Unit 1 goes on line.\n\nDecember 1978: Unit 2 goes on line.\n\nMarch 28, 1979: Accident at Unit 2 leads to partial meltdown.

Actually, Trump may have FDR beat on the signature first-100-days marker, even though his predecessor was inaugurated with a Great Depression to tackle.\n\nIt takes most presidents months or even years to make a difference in the daily lives of Americans, not to mention those who live around the world. But this time, Trump's unprecedented use of executive powers has already slashed the federal workforce, banned diversity programs, dismantled USAID, divided opposition Democrats over how to respond and prompted longstanding U.S. allies to calculate how to navigate a new global reality.\n\nHe even seems to have had an effect on the most popular baby names.\n\nHere's a look at 100 things that have changed during Trump's first 100 days − the momentous and the less so.\n\n1 - The Dow Jones industrial average has been on a rollercoaster. It plunged with the announcement of tariffs, spiked with news of a 90-day delay, and rose and fell with headlines of an escalating global trade war. The markets faced their worst slide since the coronavirus pandemic and the bond market went into an historic panic.\n\n2 - The number of migrant crossings at the U.S. southern border plummeted since the end of the Biden administration to about 8,450 in February 2025, Trump’s first full month in office, the lowest level in at least 25 years. In December 2024, President Joe Biden’s last full month in office, Immigration and Customs Enforcement had reported 47,000 apprehensions, more than five times more.\n\n3 - Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who gained prominence as a vaccine skeptic, took over the federal health agenda. He banned some artificial food dyes and promised a report by September explaining the rise in autism cases.\n\n4 - The number of deportations by ICE dropped a bit despite Trump administration efforts to step up the pace. More than 12,000 were deported in February 2024, during Biden’s administration, to about 11,000 in February 2025, during Trump's administration.\n\n5 - Eggs are more expensive. The average cost of a dozen large eggs, which became a symbol of inflation during the 2024 presidential campaign, continued to rise amid a bird-flu crisis, to $6.23 in March, though wholesale prices had begun to drop.\n\n6 - Relations with Canada soured as Trump imposed tariffs and suggested making it the 51st state. The debate over the U.S. president became a major factor in Canada's elections on April 28.\n\n7 - The Gulf of Mexico was renamed the Gulf of America – at least in official federal government publications.\n\n8 - DEI programs, designed to address the nation's history of racism, were scrapped across federal government agencies and the military. The Trump administration also targeted the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs at private law firms, public universities and other institutions that receive federal funding or rely on federal approvals. T\n\n9 - Republican victories leave Republicans nervous. Randy Fine and Jimmy Patronis were sworn in as new Republican U.S. House members, holding on to GOP seats in special elections in Florida – but by margins slashed in half since last November’s election that Democrats chalked up to Trump's early controversies as president.\n\n10 - Evidence of that nervousness: Trump backed away from elevating the star of the GOP's attack on college antisemitism because he was worried Republicans couldn't hold on to her House seat. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik was nominated as UN ambassador on Jan. 20 and then un-nominated in March.\n\n11 - The Black Lives Matter Plaza, a two-block stretch in downtown Washington, D.C., pointed to the White House, was dismantled and repainted, a capitulation by the city government to Trump. It was created as an emblem of defiance to him during his first term amid protests over the death of George Floyd.\n\n12 - Susan Crawford won a swing seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, with potential repercussions on everything from abortion rights to legislative redistricting in the battleground state. Billionaire Elon Musk spent $25 million on behalf of her opponent, making it the nation's most expensive judicial race ever. It was a boost for Democrats after November's losses.\n\n13 - The White House overhauled the press pool, the small group of journalists that tracks the president in small spaces and during travel. First the Associated Press, then Reuters and Bloomberg lost their permanent standing in the pool. \"New media\" outlets, including some with MAGA sentiments, were added to the rotation.\n\n14 - Chinese imports −from toys and clothes to furniture and sports equipment − were slapped with an escalating series of tariffs that reached 145%. China responded by imposing a 125% tariff on U.S. goods – a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.\n\n15 - The penguins and seals that are the sole inhabitants of the remote Heard and McDonald islands in Antarctica were hit with 10% tariffs on any goods they might be thinking about exporting to the United States.\n\n16 - The nation’s top military official, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., was dismissed and replaced by retired Air Force Lieutenant General Gen. Dan \"Razin\" Caine.\n\n17 - Two girls died of measles in Texas, the first deaths from the highly contagious virus in the United States in a decade. Neither child had been vaccinated. Across the U.S., two dozen states reported a total of more than 800 cases of measles.\n\n18 - Trump's average job approval rating during his first three months in office was a bit higher than it was during his first term, 45% compared with 41% in the Gallup Poll. He trailed every other post-World War II president at this point in their terms by double digits.\n\n19 - Views of the Democratic Party sank to record lows, with a favorability rating of 27% in an NBC poll.\n\n20 - In the same survey, 39% of registered voters had a favorable view of the Republican Party.\n\n21 - New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker won props for stamina with a no-bathroom-breaks speech on the Senate floor that stretched past 25 hours, beating the record set by South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond. Booker was blasting Trump’s policies; Thurmond had been filibustering the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\n22 - Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired. Tens of thousands more took buyout offers.\n\n23 - Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, designed and led the Department of Governmental Efficiency, which cut a swath through federal agencies. DOGE ordered the firing of tens of thousands of federal workers and gained access to closely-held data systems with information on millions of citizens.\n\n24 - Vivek Ramaswamy, the Republican billionaire who was initially Musk’s partner on DOGE, decided to run for governor of Ohio in 2026.\n\n25 - Tesla profits plummeted 71% in the first quarter of 2025 amid a backlash to the brand and Musk, its CEO. Auto tariffs played a role, too. Musk said he would be spending more time at Tesla, less time with DOGE.\n\n26 - Birthright citizenship, guaranteed in the Constitution's 14th Amendment, was ordered ended by executive order. The issue is headed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n27 - Hundreds of alleged members of the violent Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs were deported to El Salvador’s notorious maximum-security prison.\n\n28 - The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia became a flashpoint in the debate over whether the administration's immigration crackdown needed to follow due process rules. He was deported from Maryland to the Salvadoran prison in what U.S. officials acknowledged was an administrative error. The Supreme Court told the administration to facilitate his return. The issue remains in the courts.\n\n29 - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivered an invitation from King Charles III to Trump for an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom. The president accepted on the spot.\n\n30 - Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance went to Greenland to test the waters on Trump’s proposal to take it over. The waters were, well, icy. Trump was undeterred, and United Airlines announced it would become the only U.S. carrier with service to Greenland − starting on June 14, the president's 79thbirthday.\n\n31 - Washington Capitals player Alex Ovechkin broke Wayne Gretzky’s long-standing record for most goals scored in the National Hockey League. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ovi's longtime friend, was among those congratulating the Russian player.\n\n32 - Trump is no longer a federal defendant. Indictments on charges of trying to overturn the 2020 election and of mishandling sensitive documents were dismissed at the request of his administration’s Justice Department. Special counsel Jack Smith said in his final report that there was enough evidence to convict Trump.\n\n33 - The U.S. House of Representatives agreed to allow members who were new parents to use \"vote pairing\" to ease the burden of traveling to Washington with newborns. Speaker Mike Johnson had opposed a bipartisan proposal to allow them to vote remotely.\n\n34 - Attorney General Pam Bondi directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The Biden administration had imposed a moratorium on federal capital punishment to study how executions were conducted.\n\n35 - Columbia agreed to dramatic concessions after the Trump administration threatened to cancel $400 million in federal funding amid complaints about antisemitism. The university said it would tighten rules on protests and appoint a senior vice provost to oversee the Middle Eastern studies department.\n\n36 - Harvard refused Trump's demands. The administration said it would freeze more than $2 billion in federal funding, and the president said the school should lose its tax-exempt status. Harvard then sued the Trump administration, accusing it of threatening the school's academic independence.\n\n37 - Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP was the first of several elite law firms to cut a deal to avoid threatened penalties from Trump. In all, the firms have agreed to provide about $1 billion worth of free legal work for projects the firm and Trump support.\n\n38 - Perkins Coie, which represented Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, refused Trump's demands, as did Jenner & Block and WilmerHale. Their lawsuits are in the courts.\n\n39 - Environmental regulations on coal production were loosened, part of Trump's priority to increase U.S. energy production. \"Drill, baby, drill\" was a signature promise at his campaign rallies.\n\n40 - Logging was allowed on more than half of national forests, and federal lands in Nevada and New Mexico were opened to the mining of rare minerals, reversing prohibitions Biden put in place during the final weeks of his administration.\n\n41 - A vast Pacific Ocean reserve, 750 miles west of Hawaii, was opened to commercial fishing. President George W. Bush had established the reserve, home to coral atolls and endangered sea turtles, and President Barack Obama expanded it to nearly 500,000 square miles.\n\n42 - The U.S. and Iran opened negotiations in Oman over Tehran’s nuclear program, the first direct talks in a decade.\n\n43 - Economic forecasters increased the odds of a recession in the wake of Trump's trade war. A survey of economists in March raised the probability of a global recession this year to 47%, up from 25% in February.\n\n44 - Consumer confidence plunged, to 50.8% in April from 71.7% in January.\n\n45 - The dollar weakened, falling to a three-month low in April amid economic uncertainty.\n\n46 - Americans are less dissatisfied with the direction of the country than when Trump took office. In January, those polled by Gallup were dissatisfied by 77%-20%, almost 4-1. In March, they were dissatisfied by 62%-37%, less than 2-1.\n\n47 - Most staffers were fired and most contracts cancelled at the U.S. Agency for International Development. The foreign-aid agency was officially moved to the State Department.\n\n48 - The Education Department was largely dismantled, with about half of its staff fired.\n\n49 - Ceasefire efforts in Gaza stalled as Israel carved out a broad \"security zone,\" displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.\n\n50 - The head of NATO credited Trump's demands for spurring a \"staggering increase\" in defense spending by European countries.\n\n51 - Nvidia announced it planned to build AI servers worth as much as $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, seen as a victory for Trump's tariffs in moving manufacturing into the United States.\n\n52 - The Swiss drugmaker Novartis announced plans to build pharmaceutical manufacturing plants in the U.S., one of the goals of Trump’s tariff regime.\n\n53 - China suspended exports of rare earth minerals and magnets, material that is crucial to build cars, planes, robots, missiles and semiconductors. The move was a response to Trump's tariffs.\n\n54 - Federal restrictions on just how much water can flow from shower heads were loosened by presidential executive order, addressing a longstanding Trump pet peeve.\n\n55 - Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who is vice chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in the Middle East. The winner is usually announced in October.\n\n56 - Utah became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, a measure opposed by many dentists and medical organizations but praised by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others who question its safety.\n\n57 - Preorders for the hotly awaited release of the Switch 2, Nintendo’s new video game console planned for April 9, were delayed for two weeks or so after Trump unveiled tariffs, including on Vietnam, where it is made. The company announced that the price would remain at $499.99 but that accessories would \"experience price adjustments.\"\n\n58 - Amazon added reruns of “The Apprentice,” the reality-TV show starring Donald Trump, to its Prime Video streaming service. It ran from 2004 to 2017.\n\n59 - A website called thebump.com reported that the most popular baby name in 2025 was Kai − which happens to be the name of Trump's oldest grandchild.\n\n60 - The number of tornadoes in the U.S. surged to nearly double the historical average, AccuWeather reported. More than 470 had been reported by early April, killing more than 30 people and causing billions of dollars in damage and economic loss.\n\n61 - The number of foreign travelers arriving in the U.S. dropped in the first three months of 2025 by about 4.4%, compared with the last three months of 2024. In a March year-over-year comparison, the National Travel and Tourism Office calculated the drop doubled to almost 10%.\n\n62 - Comedian Amber Ruffin was canceled as the entertainer for the White House Correspondents Association dinner in April as the journalism organization’s leaders said it was reimagining the annual event in Washington, D.C.\n\n63 - Comedian Amber Ruffin was then booked to be the entertainer for the PEN America gala in New York City in May.\n\n64 - Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. The Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 in the Superdome in New Orleans.\n\n65 - Trump became the first sitting president to make more than one trip to the Daytona 500.

He had attended the championships in Tulsa in 2023, when he was out of office.\n\n67 - Trump attended Ultimate Fighting Championship events in New York and in Miami. During his first term, he became the first sitting president to attend a UFC fight.\n\n68 - Democratic governors sought to find areas of agreement with Trump, a contrast to his first term. During an Oval Office meeting to discuss Great Lakes protection and other state issues, Trump called Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan \"a very good person.\" He had previously referred to her as \"that woman from Michigan.\"\n\n69 - Democratic governors stepped up confrontations with Trump, including several who are considering 2028 president bids. Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2024, called on party leaders to \"do something, dammit!\" Even Whitmer looked less than enthusiastic about being embraced in the Oval Office, at one point holding file folders up to hide her face from news photographers.\n\n70 - Trump showed reporters the mock-up for a laminated \"gold card,\" a special visa that would allow immigrants to buy legal status in the U.S. for $5 million each. The card showed Trump's face, the Statue of Liberty, a bald eagle and the words \"The Trump Card.\"\n\n71 - Presidential golf is back. Trump spent at least 24 days on the golf course between Inauguration Day and April 19. Trump played three rounds of golf the weekend after announcing big reciprocal tariffs on a host of nations, claiming a club championship as financial markets plummeted. Then-President Joe Biden golfed once during his first 100 days in office.\n\n72 - The Saudi-backed LIV Golf league held its first domestic event of the year at Trump National Doral Golf Club in Miami. The president dined with LIV golfers, and his family members attended the tournament. Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, is keen to influence U.S. foreign policy in the region. Trump is keen to host professional golfers at his clubs, having been snubbed by the PGA Tour in the past.\n\n73 - Palm Beach again ranks among world capitals as a major power center. Since returning to the presidency, Trump regularly departs the White House on Friday to spend the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in South Florida. Trump hiked the club membership fee last year to $1 million.\n\n74 - Transgender student athletes are banned from playing women's sports. Trump signed an executive order in the White House surrounded by little girls in sports jerseys.\n\n75 - Smoot-Hawley is a thing again. The 1930 tariff act, which is name-checked in a famous scene from the 1986 movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", is being mentioned as part of the political debate around Trump's tariffs. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul is warning that Smoot-Hawley, blamed for worsening the Great Depression, led to a GOP political massacre that kept the party out of power for six decades.\n\n76 - Crypto is king! Trump signed an executive order to promote cryptocurrencies, staging an event with crypto leaders in the White House. The president even has his own crypto business. But Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, lost 14% of it's value between Inauguration Day and April 21.\n\n77 - Gold prices rose above $3,300 an ounce for the first time as investors looked for safe havens amid turmoil in the stock markets.\n\n78 - Trump's business interests are expanding.

It has since sunk in value, but still has a market capitalization of $1.6 billion.\n\n79 - Trump's face could be on Mount Rushmore and a proposed new $250 bill. Both of those ideas were proposed by GOP lawmakers in legislation filed in the House this year.\n\n80 -Fort Bragg, which had been renamed Fort Liberty during the Biden administration, was re-renamed Fort Bragg. The original Fort Bragg honored a Confederate general; Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the new Fort Bragg honored a World War II hero. He was barred by law from naming it for someone who had served in the Confederacy.\n\n81 - Move NASA to Ohio? HUD to Houston? State and local officials had until April 14 to vie to relocate federal agencies away from Washington and across the country. Decisions are pending.\n\n82 - The federal government is consolidating massive personal records about individual Americans which had been held separately at the Social Security administration, the Treasury Department and elsewhere. Trump signed an executive order to take the step, proposed by Musk and DOGE, despite concerns about privacy and security.\n\n83 - Trump fired the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., and named himself as chairman. The new leadership announced the exterior lighting of the building would permanently feature red, white and blue. The Broadway hit \"Hamilton\" canceled its upcoming performance. \"I never liked 'Hamilton' very much,\" the president said.\n\n84 - States were told they could no longer use Medicaid funding to pay for gender-affirming care for minors.\n\n85 - The U.S. Naval Academy's library was purged of books that officials said violated the Trump administration's ban on DEI, among them \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" by Maya Angelou. Left on the shelves was \"Mein Kampf\" by Adolf Hitler.\n\n86 - Paper straws? Out. Plastic straws? Back. Biden last year had ordered the federal government to phase out the purchase of single-use plastics, such as straws, by 2035. Within weeks of his inauguration, Trump ordered the federal government to stop buying paper straws.\n\n87 - Federal prosecutions for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act are on hold. Trump signed an executive order arguing that bribery prosecutions hurt U.S. companies trying to compete overseas. Among those convicted was Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chair in 2016. Trump pardoned him in the final days of his first term.\n\n88 - Funding for the Voice of America was slashed. Trump accused it of being a voice of \"radical propaganda.\" His attempt to fire its workers is in the courts.\n\n89 - TikTok has avoided the chopping block − that is, the congressionally mandated deadline for the popular app to be separated from its Chinese owner or be banned in the USA. Trump is trying to strike a deal, though that effort has become entangled in the trade war.\n\n90 - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ceased operations in February on order from its acting director, Russell Vought. The bureau, a top cause of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, was created in the wake of the Great Recession to help fight financial fraud. Now it's one of the federal agencies being dismantled by DOGE, but a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to halt efforts to shutter the CFPB.\n\n91 - Governing by tweet is back. Except now it's governing by Truth, as Trump takes to his social media platform, Truth Social, to announce all manner of administration actions. His big 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs? Announced first on Truth Social.\n\n92 - The presidential press conference is reborn. Trump took questions from the media while signing executive orders on his first day back in office. He hasn't stopped talking since. Trump's media availabilities have been constant, and are coming in all forms, including during Oval Office events, while meeting with world leaders, on Air Force One and in actual press conferences. It's a big contrast with Biden, who was tightly scripted and had limited media availability.\n\n93 - American diplomacy looks a lot different. Just ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump berated Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and later told him to leave the White House, a shocking moment in the annals of U.S. foreign relations.\n\n94 - Bilateral negotiations between Ukraine and Russia may loom. The conflict wasn't settled in a day, as Trump had promised during the campaign, but the administration has pushed for progress or threatened to \"move on.\"\n\n95 - Dozens of court cases have been filed to block administration actions at least temporarily, according to a Lawfare tracker. That is a record use of the court system as a recourse by states, unions, activist groups and individuals.\n\n96 - Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders became the most prominent politician ever to speak onstage at Coachella and, at 83, probably the oldest. He and New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez drew big crowds across the country with their \"fighting oligarchy\" tour.\n\n97 - Former Democratic presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden spoke out against Trump, at odds with a general tradition. Biden, who had largely disappeared from public view after Trump's inauguration, delivered a speech in Chicago on April 15, accusing his successor of \"taking a hatchet\" to the Social Security administration.\n\n98 - For 132 years, presidents who won two terms served them back-to-back. With Trump's inauguration, he dislodged Grover Cleveland's solo standing as the only president to win a term, lose an election, then win another term. \"It's kind of weird, and it's kind of fun,\" said Cleveland's grandson, George Cleveland, of Tamworth, N.H.\n\n99 − An addition to the White House grounds: 100-foot flag poles to display the American flag that Trump announced he would have installed on the North Lawn and the South Lawn.\n\n100 - Trump suggested he might run for a third term, despite the Constitution's 14th Amendment barring it. His company is selling \"Trump 2028\" hats for $50. He has encouraged the speculation and declined to endorse Vice President JD Vance as his successor. But does he mean it?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/01/07/uranium-enrichment-could-come-back-ohio-portman-trump-administration/2503171002/", "title": "Uranium enrichment could come back to Ohio thanks to Trump DOE ...", "text": "Cameron Knight and Sarah Horne\n\nThe Enquirer\n\nA $115 million investment from the Department of Energy could bring uranium enrichment back to Piketon.\n\nFor decades, the federal government enriched uranium in a sprawling facility along the banks of the Scioto River, but the last programs there were disbanded by the Obama administration in 2015.\n\nOn Monday, Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) said 16 centrifuges would be installed at the former American Centrifuge Project in Piketon to demonstrate the production of uranium fuel source for advanced nuclear reactors.\n\n\"Having domestic enrichment capabilities would provide stability and security to our country,\" Portman's office said in the statement. \"I want to thank the Department of Energy and the Trump administration for reconsidering the Obama administration’s decision to end the domestic uranium enrichment demonstration program.\"\n\nTimeline of Uranium Enrichment in Ohio:\n\n1954: Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant begins operation, first producing uranium for nuclear weapons then for power plants.\n\n1989: Environmental cleanup program launched at the site, which continues to this day.\n\n2001: Enrichment stops at the site.\n\n2007: U.S. Enrichment Corporation is licensed for and begins new enrichment at the American Centrifuge Plant on the site of Gaseous Diffusion Plant.\n\n2011: Decontamination and decommissioning begin at the Gaseous Diffusion Plant facilities.\n\n2015: Department of Energy defunded the American Centrifuge Plant under the Obama Administration's wider plan to end domestic enrichment.\n\n2016: The American Centrifuge Plant begins to shut down\n\nMore: American Centrifuge Plant to shut down\n\nSUPPORT JOURNALISM: Subscribe today to get access to all of our coverage\n\nSince the American Centrifuge Plant shut down, the only uranium enrichment plant in the United States has been Urenco USA in Eunice, New Mexico, according to the World Nuclear Association.\n\nThe association says this plant only provides about the third of the enrichment needs for the United States requiring the rest to be imported.

The Princeton Review ranks universities in a number of categories each year, and Auburn comes in No. 1 this year in terms of having a happy student body. Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, is ranked second behind Auburn. The rankings list Alabama as the nation’s second-best party school behind Syracuse University in New York. The Princeton Review is a college admission services company. Its rankings are determined by student surveys on their experiences at 385 universities nationwide.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A Russia-designed floating nuclear power plant has begun its journey through the Arctic Ocean this month, causing concerns in the Frontier State. Alaska Public Media reports the 472-foot barge launched in St. Petersburg, Russia, and will continue along the coast to the Bering Strait separating that nation from Alaska. Russian officials say the plan is to dock the world’s first floating nuclear power plant at Pevek, Russia, about 1,250 miles from Anchorage, Alaska. Alaska advocates say they are concerned about potential radiation the barge could produce in the northwest region. Officials say the barge named Akademik Lomonosov is capable of powering a city about the size of Fairbanks and will provide heat and power to the mining region, starting in December.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: The Southwest Wildlife Conservation Center is asking for food donations via its Amazon wish list, citing “an unexpected change in policy” tied to an existing supplier. The corporate decision on the handling of damaged, donated food products means Southwest Wildlife urgently needs dry dog and cat food, which can be given to a variety of animals, including bears, coyotes, skunks, foxes and raccoons. The organization says this year has been especially challenging due to the large number of injured and orphaned animals coming to the shelter. Southwest Wildlife’s wish lists include Purina dog and puppy food products and Nutro brand dry cat and kitten products. Donors can purchase food through the company’s Amazon wish list, send food to the center or drop it off.\n\nArkansas\n\nMansfield: Officials say a series of escapes from the Mansfield Juvenile Treatment Center is merely a symptom of larger problems with the facility, the Southwest Times Record reports. Arkansas Department of Human Services officials say the facility, which holds mid-level juvenile offenders and from January 2017 through June was run by the state, has security protocols, a lack of staff training and a climbable fence that have created an environment that since December has allowed 12 youths on four occasions to escape. Department of Youth Services officials also lied to Sebastian County Sheriff Hobe Runion about the placement of a youth who had previously escaped from the Treatment Center. Treatment Center personnel since the beginning of 2019 have called the Sheriff’s Office at least 17 times for assistance.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Ana: Orange County, long known as a national GOP stronghold, now has more registered Democrats than Republicans. The county’s Registrar of Voters says there are 89 more Democrats than Republicans among its 1.6 million registered voters. The county between Los Angeles and San Diego was home to President Richard Nixon and long known as a conservative bastion. The parties each have about 547,000 registered voters, while 441,000 registered voters have no party affiliation. The ascendancy of the county’s Democrats mirrors a long-running trend in California. Today, Democrats hold every statewide office; dominate both chambers of the Legislature; and command a nearly 4 million edge over the GOP in voter registrations. Republicans have drifted into third-party status in the state, behind Democrats and independents.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Thousands of people have hiked up to a popular scenic lake using a new reservation system. The Denver Post reports that White River National Forest officials received five out of five stars on a shuttle service implemented in May from more than 95% of survey respondents visiting Glenwood Canyon’s Hanging Lake. Park officials say the system replaces a visitor parking lot with $12 shuttle rides from Glenwood Springs to the lake about 155 miles west of Denver. Officials say the goal was to improve the health of the trail and lake by moderating human impact while also improving the visitor experience. Officials say Hanging Lake has a daily limit of 615 visitors and has reached more than 40,000 hikers since the program began earlier this year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: Construction of the planned National Coast Guard Museum is expected to begin early next year. Members of the museum’s board tell The Day of New London that a request for proposals for the first phase of construction is expected to go out Sept. 1. The final design, which was approved earlier this year by the board, calls for an 80,000-square-foot, five-story, interactive, environmentally friendly museum on the city’s waterfront. Plans call for the Coast Guard’s tall ship, the Barque Eagle, to be docked near the museum at a renovated City Pier when the ship is in New London. The museum association has raised about $48 million in public and private funds toward the estimated $100 million cost of the project.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Private donors have pledged to replace a memorial plaque dedicated to a lynching victim that was recently stolen. Delaware State University official Steven Newton said the school would donate funds to help replace the marker. Last week a person noticed the marker to commemorate the lynching of George White was missing. White, a black man, was accused of raping and killing a white woman. A mob lynched him in 1903. Public Archives director Stephen Marz said private donors have also begun contributing to the replacement costs. The marker was erected in June. The memorial organizers say they began raising funds for the new, $2,200 marker shortly after the original disappeared. Delaware authorities offered a $2,000 reward as they investigated.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The first black woman to serve as American University’s student government president has won a lawsuit against a neo-Nazi website operator who orchestrated an online harassment campaign against her. A federal judge granted default judgment Friday to Taylor Dumpson and awarded her more than $725,000 after The Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin and a follower failed to respond to her lawsuit. The judge also entered a restraining order against Anglin, his Moonbase Holdings limited liability company, and Brian Andrew Ade. After Dumpson became student government president in 2017, someone hung nooses with bananas containing derogatory messages on the university’s campus. Anglin posted an article about the incident and directed followers to “troll storm” Dumpson on social media.\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples: A wolf-dog hybrid that escaped from a sanctuary after jumping a 10-foot fence has been captured. News outlets report that something startled Eva on Wednesday morning at the Shy Wolf Sanctuary, prompting her to jump the fence. Sanctuary spokeswoman Cindee Woolley says Eva was spotted in the afternoon and shot with a tranquilizer but ran off before the sedation took effect. A news release from the sanctuary says calls of sightings to the Collier County Sheriff’s Office helped searchers locate the wolf-dog Wednesday evening. Woolley says Eva has been placed in a roofed enclosure to prevent any future escapes. Eva weighs about 60 to 70 pounds and is owned by Miami residents who had boarded her at the sanctuary days before her escape.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A court order has stopped demolition after it had already begun on a downtown building where the first country hit song is believed to have been recorded. Part of the building was knocked down Thursday before crews learned a Fulton County judge issued a temporary restraining order. News outlets report the ruling by Judge Shawn Ellen LaGrua will halt further demolition until a hearing Aug. 29. A developer plans to build a 21-story, Margaritaville-themed hotel and restaurant near where the building currently stands. Atlanta resident and architect Kyle Kessler sued the city, claiming it didn’t allow for due process in deciding to demolish the building. The city says it followed proper zoning procedures. Fiddlin’ John Carson likely recorded “Little Log Cabin in the Lane” in the building in 1923.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Experts say two native bird populations have declined by more than half and could face extinction. Hawaii News Now reports Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project discovered 312 Maui parrotbills and 2,411 crested honeycreepers remain in the wild. Experts say a new monitoring report conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey and other wildlife agencies reveals that is 50% less than previous population estimates. Wildlife officials say studies over several decades found multiple threats to these two bird species, including disease and habitat degradation. Experts say there are plans to reintroduce the parrotbills to the Nakula Natural Area Reserve in southwest Maui in order to boost the endangered species’ numbers. Officials say more than 200,000 native plants were planted in forest reserves since 2013 in preparation for the reintroduction.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Central Idaho ranch owners want construction of a trail connecting the popular tourist destinations of Redfish Lake and Stanley stopped and additional work to make it a smooth path for hikers and bikers prohibited. Sawtooth Mountain Ranch owners David Boren and Lynn Arnone have been fighting construction of the trail with a federal lawsuit against the U.S. government and on Thursday filed new documents contending the proposed trail violates terms of an easement. The U.S. Forest Service has a conservation easement deed dating to 2005 that allows a trail 30 feet wide to cross about 1.5 miles of private property. The lawsuit recognizes that an easement exists but contends it doesn’t allow the Forest Service to bring in machinery to create or maintain an improved trail for recreationists.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has signed legislation he says will remove a barrier for teacher candidates and help address a statewide shortage of teachers. The new law eliminates a requirement that teacher candidates pass a test of basic skills to get an educator license. Supporters say the test was unnecessary because admission to a teacher preparation program already demonstrates that candidates have basic academic skills. It also required candidates to demonstrate skills that weren’t related to the grade or subject they intended to teach. The test cost more than $60. The Illinois State Board of Education says more than 1,400 classroom positions were unfilled at the start of the last school year. The new law means about 1,300 teaching candidates will be able to start student teaching this fall.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In the past two decades, the state’s little-known caviar industry has pumped millions of dollars – one $25 ounce at a time – into the economies of some of southern Indiana’s poorest counties. But the windfall could soon come to an end. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources is considering a proposal to stop sanctioning commercial fishing for roe-bearing species, a move that officials say will end decades of overfishing but that some decry as a case of government excess. If approved, the plan would mark the end for a Hoosier industry that is probably better known for the publicity surrounding a series of poaching stings than for the valuable eggs fishermen harvest from American paddlefish and shovelnose sturgeon.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: Court records show a newspaper carrier helped save a woman caught in a sex trafficking ring. One of the Des Moines Register’s delivery workers, Lavon Franz, was on her paper route early the morning of July 28 in Ankeny when she saw a woman waving her arms on the side of the road. When Franz pulled over, the woman – who had no cellphone or ID – was crying and said she wanted to go back home to a small town about an hour northwest of Ankeny. Franz took the woman to a convenience store, where an employee called police. Police arrested a 25-year-old woman from East Dubuque, Illinois, on suspicion of pimping and human trafficking. Police say Walters scheduled times for men to pay the rescued woman and others for sex at hotels in Ankeny.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state plans to begin moving inmates to a private prison in Arizona by the end of the summer to help relieve crowding in state prisons. The state Department of Corrections announced Friday that it has signed a contract with Nashville, Tennessee-based CoreCivic that calls for moving up to 360 inmates to CoreCivic’s Saguaro Correctional Facility by the end of the year. Kansas has about 10,000 prison inmates, about 100 more than the listed capacity for its facilities. The department is housing more than 100 inmates in county jails. The state budget includes $16.4 million to put 600 male inmates in county jails or out-of-state prisons. But legislative leaders have had misgivings about using private prisons and in June blocked $6.6 million of the funding in June over that possibility.\n\nKentucky\n\nBowling Green: The city has been named one of the nation’s top destinations for bachelor parties. In Men’s Journal’s recent list of the 25 best bachelor party destinations in America, Bowling Green is No. 2. First, the group can take a trip to the National Corvette Museum to check out more than 80 variations of the classic American sports car. While a museum might not be what every groom has in mind for his last party as a single man, this museum also has a giant sinkhole containing even more cars. Once the crew have had their car fix, a little spelunking is in order. Men’s Journal recommends heading to Mammoth Cave National Park to explore the world’s longest cave system, about a 35-minute drive from Bowling Green.\n\nLouisiana\n\nRockefeller Wildlife Refuge: The state will build 3 miles of breakwaters to protect a wildlife refuge where the shoreline is rapidly eroding and the bottom is extremely soft. A news release says the new work adds to 4 miles of breakwaters already sheltering the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge in southwest Louisiana. Like the earlier one, the new breakwater will have a core of 10-foot-long geotextile “pillows” filled with very light clay baked at extremely high temperatures. A study in 2011 found that such breakwaters can be built higher than all-rock construction on soft water bottom, making them much better at preventing erosion. The $18 million cost includes $5 million of the state surplus and $4.3 million from Cameron Parish disaster block grants, with the rest in matching funds from BP oil spill penalties.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A survey indicates the cruise ship industry is an important source of return visitors to the state. The survey found that cruise ship passengers don’t make a huge economic impact during their brief visits ashore but that 1 in 3 of them plans to return in the near future. The Portland Press Herald reports the Maine Office of Tourism commissioned the survey to get a reading of passengers’ experiences, perceptions and spending. A Portland-based tourism research group talked to more than 2,500 passengers and crew across nine ports from July to November. CruiseMaine Director Sarah Flink says it was important to have a “baseline understanding of the demographics.” About 400,000 cruise visitors sailed on ships to Maine, spending $29 million. Passengers spent about $70 on average during their visits ashore.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city’s police commissioner has named a senior FBI agent as the head of the department’s Public Integrity Bureau, which oversees officer misconduct investigations and has faced criticism in the past. Michael Harrison introduced Brian Nadeau on Thursday. He has been the assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s Baltimore Field Office. Nadeau handled organized crime investigations for the FBI and led the agency’s public corruption unit. At a news conference, Harrison told outlets Nadeau is “quite familiar” with Baltimore and the challenges facing the department. A recent investigation by The Baltimore Sun revealed the department failed to investigate misconduct complaints soon enough, causing about 75 cases to expire without conclusions since 2016.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNick Cocchi is sheriff of Hampden County in western Massachusetts. His name was incorrect in a previous version.\n\nSpringfield: Officials are embracing a controversial tactic amid a dramatic spike in fatal overdoses – sending men to jail for court-ordered addiction treatment. Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi has designated a jail wing for the treatment of men civilly committed for substance abuse reasons. Cocchi and his supporters say the year-old program, which is the only one of its kind in western Massachusetts, is key to curbing the county’s opioid problem. Fatal overdoses have surged more than 80% in Hampden County even as they’ve declined statewide. But Bonnie Tenneriello, of Prisoners’ Legal Services, says forcing people into correctional facilities for treatment only stigmatizes addiction. The civil rights group is suing the state to end the practice. A state commission also recently recommended ending it.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: The University of Michigan will install locks on all classroom and lab doors inside a building where reports of an active shooter triggered campuswide panic last spring. The active shooter alert occurred in March when a sorority held an event featuring balloon popping at the same time as a vigil nearby for victims of the deadly New Zealand mosque shooting. The university said Wednesday that the changes at Mason Hall will help university faculty, staff and students facilitate a faster lockdown in the case of an emergency. MLive reports that the installation is expected to be completed by the end of this month. The project is expected to give the university a better idea of what types of locks are needed inside some of the campus’ more historic buildings.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRoseau: Local officials say they’re not optimistic about a return to normal hours at two customs stations used by many residents on both sides of the state’s border with Canada who had built their lives around the old order of easy crossings. U.S. Customs and Border Protection cut the hours of the stations in Roseau and Lancaster in January 2018 as it shifted officers to the Mexican border. The Border Patrol now says many of those officers are being sent home. But Roseau city planner Todd Peterson tells Minnesota Public Radio that Border Patrol officials have told him that officers returning north will be channeled to crossings viewed as more important than Roseau. And he says he doesn’t think local officials can do much to change their minds.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: A pizza shop is offering free pies for immigrants and refugees in response to immigration raids at seven poultry plants elsewhere in the state. Dodo Pizza owner Alena Tikhova tells WMC-TV she’s making the offer because she moved from Russia four years ago and wants to offset “hate and cruelty” that she sees against people from abroad. The Oxford pizza store is offering a free medium pizza though Aug. 18 to anyone from another country. Tikhova says the offer is a statement of compassion, saying the 680 arrests by immigration officials “doesn’t feel right to me as a human being.” The owner says Dodo Pizza has given free pizzas to first responders and government workers during past shutdowns, and she plans future donations.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Washington University plans to open a center aimed at becoming a national leader in research and learning on the issue of race. St. Louis Public Radio reports the Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity & Equity will open in October. The idea for the center emerged in the aftermath of unrest in nearby Ferguson after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, by a white police officer in 2014. The officer was not charged, but the resulting protests shone a light on how police in Ferguson and other areas targeted blacks and how courts profited from fines and court costs largely borne by blacks. Washington University’s provost and a professor of law, Adrienne Davis, will lead the center as founding director.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Forest Service officials have proposed increasing prices and charging new fees for rental cabins and campgrounds in the Lolo National Forest. The Missoulian reports the federal agency aims to bring the income at sites in the forest in line with the cost of services. The changes include increasing lookouts and cabins that cost $30 to $80 per night up to $45 to $115 per night. Campgrounds would increase to $10 to $20 depending on the site. Forest implementation staff officer Chris James says the new and higher fees are expected to bring in about $250,000 each year. He says about 95% of the fees are directed back into maintaining the forest. The agency is taking public comment on the proposal through Sept. 30.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state Supreme Court on Friday upheld the dismissal of a unique lawsuit brought by a group of tanning salon owners who had claimed the Nebraska Cancer Coalition defamed them and hurt their businesses with an anti-indoor tanning message. The business owners, who operated some 30 tanning salons in Omaha and Lincoln, sued in 2015 after the coalition launched its “The Bed is Dead” campaign, which includes a website and ads that link tanning bed use to skin cancer. The campaign makes such claims as, “Tanning before age 35 raises your risk of melanoma by nearly 60%.” The lawsuit says the campaign not only defamed the salons but also violated the Nebraska Deceptive Trade Practices Act. But the high court in its unanimous decision agreed with a Douglas County District Court judge’s dismissal of the lawsuit last year, saying a defamation claim requires more than general criticisms of an industry.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Transportation officials are marking what they call “substantial completion” of three years of work on a $1 billion upgrade of the state’s busiest freeway near downtown and the Las Vegas Strip. Gov. Steve Sisolak declared at a Thursday ceremony that the work dubbed “Project Neon” will improve safety and reduce congestion and commuter delays. Workers widened a crucial 4 miles of Interstate 15 between Sahara Avenue and the busy “Spaghetti Bowl” interchange with U.S. 95, and they installed new overpasses and 42 electronic signs to notify motorists of traffic snarls and road hazards. Officials call the highway the busiest in Nevada, carrying 300,000 vehicles a day. They say traffic is expected to double by 2040.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has vetoed a bill that would have re-established and raised the state’s minimum wage, saying it would have had a detrimental effect on workers. The state currently relies on the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, the lowest in New England. The Legislature’s bill would have set it at $10 per hour in 2020 and $12 per hour in 2022. Sununu said according to studies, other states and cities that have artificially raised the minimum wage have seen take-home pay decline because minimum-wage workers have their hours cut or their jobs eliminated. The National Federation of Independent Business in New Hampshire supported Sununu, saying many small businesses can’t afford the increased labor costs. Rep. Brian Sullivan, D-Grantham, said it’s impossible for a couple to live on two 40-hour jobs at $7.25 per hour.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWestfield: A house whose current owners were scared off the property by a series of threatening letters has sold for $400,000 less than the owners paid. Derek and Maria Broaddus bought the Westfield home for $1,355,657 in 2014 but didn’t move in after receiving the first of four letters from the anonymous writer. NJ.com reports Andrew and Allison Carr purchased it for $959,360. It was originally listed for $1.25 million in 2016. Andrew Carr declined comment. In a series of letters, the writer asked if the Broadduses were bringing “young blood” into the home and asked the names of their two children. The Broadduses claimed the writer had a “mentally disturbed fixation” on the home. The writer was never found. A judge threw out lawsuits stemming from the purchase.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A smattering of heroin hotspots dotted an online map of the state’s largest city Friday as officials announced the new mapping tool, saying they plan to use it to track drug-use migration across the area. At a news conference, Bernalillo County officials said the GIS map will show the public where used needles and syringes have been collected by county cleanup crews and volunteer groups in Albuquerque and elsewhere across their jurisdiction. It also will show how many needles have been picked up at a single location, providing data that officials say can be used to make sound policy decisions and learn more about the habits of drug users. On Friday, a cleanup crew of mostly county workers gathered at an abandoned property in northeast Albuquerque, where they collected 84 needles – the first batch to be logged in real-time – into the GIS map at bernco.gov/needles.\n\nNew York\n\nMacedon: Singer Alicia Keys and music producer husband Swizz Beats are planning to create a performing arts center in upstate New York. The couple’s proposal to transform an industrial site in rural Macedon was introduced at a town board meeting Thursday. Linda Shaw, an attorney for Keys and her husband, whose real name is Kasseem Dean, says the project will repurpose three vacant buildings to include a classroom, an office building, an art exhibit hall and a performing arts center. The Democrat and Chronicle reports the center is a part of The Dean Collection, the couple’s organization that focuses on supporting artists. Town engineer Scott Allen called the proposal exciting. Shaw says she is scheduled to appear before the city’s planning board Aug. 19.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state has a new law focused on ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft that supporters contend will improve safety for both passengers and drivers. Gov. Roy Cooper said Friday that he’s signed a bill that cleared the General Assembly unanimously last month. The bill’s impetus was the death of a University of South Carolina student who police say was killed after getting into a car driven by a man posing as an Uber driver. The law makes impersonating a ride-hailing driver a crime while increasing the penalty for assaulting a genuine ride-hailing driver. Starting in October, ride-hailing cars must have front license tag numbers. By next summer, they’ll have to display their company’s logo to be clearly seen day and night, although alternative signage is possible.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The huge white tube between Washburn and Underwood that once carried coal over U.S. Highway 83 is coming down. The Bismarck Tribune reports the tube that for decades served as a landmark along the road in central North Dakota is being removed Monday. It’s part of a 3-mile conveyor that the Falkirk Mining Co. installed in 1992 to transport coal from its mining operations east of the highway to its handling facilities on the west side. The company last used the conveyor in 2001. In the years since, Falkirk has relied on large trucks, which can each haul more than 200 tons of coal. The vehicles pass underneath the highway to Great River Energy’s Coal Creek Station. The power plant burns it to generate electricity.\n\nOhio\n\nWilberforce: A historically black university is advancing its plans to become the first public institution in the state to conduct hemp research. Central State University announced Thursday it’s received $7.1 million in contributions toward current initiatives, including its new hemp research program. The sum includes a single record-setting private donation of $2 million from philanthropist Frank Murphy. President Cynthia Jackson-Hammond says Central State is the only Ohio public university planting seeds for research into hemp, a strain of the cannabis plant used for fiber and cannabidiol, or CBD. Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill last month legalizing cultivation of industrial hemp and the manufacture and sale of CBD products. The next day, the Department of Agriculture planted Ohio’s first legal hemp plants since World War II.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s treasurer says overall receipts to the treasury are continuing to rise, but he warns there are signs of a potential economic slowdown on the horizon. State Treasurer Randy McDaniel released figures Friday that show gross receipts to the treasury topped $1.1 billion in July, up nearly 10% from July last year. Overall collections for the past 12 months totaled nearly $13.7 billion, almost 12% higher than the prior 12 months. But McDaniel also reports tax receipts from the production of oil and gas are declining, and sales tax collections are beginning to drop for the first time in two years. Treasury officials reported sales tax receipts fell below those of the prior year in both June and July.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown has decided not to veto a bill that will ease rules for farmers clearing out irrigation ditches, her office told Oregon Public Broadcasting. Oregon Public Broadcasting reported her decision was likely to please many in rural parts of the state, but it spurred a furious reaction from environmental groups. The legislation says farmers would need to give notice that they were going to clear an irrigation ditch but would not need a permit unless they planned to move more than 3,000 cubic yards of material over a five-year period – a 60-fold increase from the current 50-cubic-yard threshold, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. Environmental groups argued that the measure undermines the state’s ability to protect state wetlands. Many farm fields in the Willamette Valley are classified as wetlands.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Workers have started to neutralize a highly toxic chemical on the site of a massive refinery that’s been shut down since explosions and a blaze June 21. Philadelphia Fire Commissioner Adam Thiel says workers are at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions site around the clock, seven days a week in an effort to neutralize the 33,000 gallons of hydrofluoric acid there. It could take several weeks to complete. Hydrofluoric acid is one of the most dangerous chemicals in use. Refineries use it to create high-octane fuel. Chemical safety officials have said once it had been released into the atmosphere, a low-lying toxic cloud could travel quickly over miles, affecting more than a million people. Thiel says air monitoring is continuing, and there are no signs that the chemical was ever released.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s oldest black church celebrated its 200th anniversary over the weekend. The Congdon Street Baptist Church opened in 1819 and has had an integral role in providing spiritual and educational needs for the city’s black communities. The Providence Journal reports the original members of the church came from the First Baptist Church in America, where they were forced to worship in a segregated space. In 1863, as tensions grew among the congregation and their white neighbors, the original church was torn down without their approval. Harold Metts, a church deacon and Democratic state senator from Providence, says the congregation has always combated “such evil” with good.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nBlythewood: “School Prayer Zone” signs are cropping up near some schools in the state. News outlets report the white and fluorescent green signs show two figures kneeling in prayer, their hands clasped above the words “2 Chronicles 7:14.” The Bible verse promises those who pray and “turn from their wicked ways” will be forgiven. The $714 signs by nonprofit Christ Teens can be seen in several counties and resemble official signs by the South Carolina Department of Transportation. The agency says it didn’t approve the signs, but they’re legal as long as they sit on private property and are outside the highway rights of way. Nonprofit director and founder Vanessa Frazier says she came up with the idea in 2016 and has been working out the details with the state agency ever since.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The military says recent high-altitude balloon flights over the state and others in the Midwest complied with federal laws against conducting surveillance on civilians. Pentagon spokesman Chris Mitchell says two test flights recently launched from Baltic, South Dakota, were part of a project to develop all-weather radar-imaging capability from the stratosphere. He says no tracking information was collected during these flights, and none will be collected in future flights. But the South Dakota chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said Friday that it still has many questions about the imagery and how it will be used. Policy Director Libby Skarin says the Pentagon statement seems to contradict filings, first reported by The Guardian, saying the balloons were meant to provide persistent surveillance to locate drug trafficking and homeland security threats.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Health officials say this year’s first human case of West Nile virus in the state has been reported. The Shelby County Health Department said Thursday that the mosquito-borne illness has been found in an unidentified person. The person’s condition wasn’t released. Officials said in June that the virus had been found in mosquitoes in the county. Crews have been treating mosquito breeding sites with insecticides and setting traps to capture and kill the insects. The West Nile virus can occasionally cause severe disease or even death. But most human infections are mild and cause fever, headache and body aches that last a few days. The case reported Thursday is the state’s first this year. Three people died of West Nile virus in 2018 in Shelby County.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A local Native American group is bringing a new battle to the Alamo, filing a legal notice declaring the grounds to be an abandoned or unknown cemetery. The San Antonio Express-News reports that could delay the $450 million project to restore and enhance the sacred Texas shrine. And the American Indians in Texas at the Spanish Colonial Missions plans to go even further: The group has launched a fundraising campaign to file a federal lawsuit alleging discriminatory practices in the way city, state and nonprofit officials are guiding the project. Executive Director Ramon Vasquez says new guidelines on the handling of human remains unearthed during the planned restoration work were developed without consulting his organization, whose members are descendants of indigenous people who lived – and likely were buried – in this area well before the Battle of the Alamo.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Voter fraud is rare in the state and typically involves parents submitting ballots for children who are away from home serving missions for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the lieutenant governor says. Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox says voter fraud is usually the result of a misunderstanding of election laws, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. “They think, ‘Oh, I’ll just fill it out for him, and I’ll sign it and send it back in,’ ” Cox said during a gubernatorial campaign visit to Fielding. In those cases, Cox said state officials “call them up and tell them that’s illegal, you can’t do that.” Completing another person’s voting form is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine. Parents may be concerned the postal system will not deliver a ballot in time from overseas. But electronic voting options are now available to young missionaries, officials say.\n\nVermont\n\nBurke: Law enforcement is suggesting that the town require bicyclists to ride single-file on town roads. The Kingdom Trail Association attracts thousands of mountain bikers and others to a trail network in the Northeast Kingdom. The Caledonian Record reports that a deputy from the Caledonia County Sheriff’s Department suggested the ordinance and says it would be safer for everyone. Deputy Joe Rossi says some of the roads in the area are narrow and twisty. Abby Long, executive director of the Kingdom Trail Association, said she would support such an ordinance. Selectboard Chair Christine Emmons said the present law in Vermont is for two bicyclists abreast, so a change would require the adoption of an ordinance.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A federal judge ruled Friday that a school board’s transgender bathroom ban discriminated against a former student, Gavin Grimm, the latest in a string of decisions nationwide that favor transgender students who faced similar policies. The order issued by U.S. District Judge Arenda Wright Allen is a major victory for the American Civil Liberties Union and for Grimm. His four-year lawsuit was once a federal test case and had come to embody the debate about transgender student rights. The Gloucester County School Board’s policy required Grimm, a transgender male student, to use girls’ restrooms or private bathrooms. The judge wrote that Grimm’s rights were violated under the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause as well as under Title IX, the federal policy that protects against gender-based discrimination.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Water has gushed from a glacier on Mount Rainier, damaging a road and trail as it flowed down. The News Tribune reports the water burst on the South Tahoma Glacier started last Monday without warning. Mount Rainier National Park officials say the flow formed new waterfalls and moved boulders down the mountain, leading to the closure of Westside Road and the Tahoma Creek Trail. No injuries were reported. Geologists say similar glacier bursts could occur in the coming weeks or months. The park is warning visitors to head to higher ground if they hear unusual sounds or see changes in creek water levels and ground shaking.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice says he’s asked his administration to see what it can do to prevent the closure of Ohio Valley Medical Center in Wheeling. The Republican governor issued a statement Thursday saying that saving the hospital’s jobs must be a top priority. The Ohio Valley Medical Center and the East Ohio Regional Hospital in Martins Ferry, Ohio, released a statement Wednesday saying they would close within two to three months. The planned closures also come after an unsuccessful search for a buyer. The hospitals have lost more than $37 million in the past two years due to declining volume and reimbursements, the statement says. It also says they haven’t been able to compete with the business practices of nearby Wheeling Hospital, pointing to a federal lawsuit that accuses Wheeling Hospital of defrauding Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nWisconsin\n\nManitowoc: A judge has rejected a man’s bid for a new trial in a killing featured in the Netflix series “Making a Murderer.” Judge Angela Sutkiewicz on Thursday denied Steven Avery’s request in the 2005 killing of photographer Teresa Halbach. Halbach’s remains were found in the Avery family’s salvage yard. Avery argued the state turned over bones to the Halbach family without notifying the defense, but WLUK-TV reports the judge ruled that does not mean Avery should get a new trial. The bones were given to Halbach’s family in 2011, but Avery’s attorneys were not notified until 2018. Tests were inconclusive about whether the bones were animal or human. Avery’s attorney, Kathleen Zellner, tweeted an appeal is likely. Avery’s nephew, Brendan Dassey, also is serving a life sentence in the killing.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The city attempted to break the Guinness World Record for the most sparklers lighted simultaneously over the weekend. Organizers were hoping for about 2,000 people to participate in Saturday night’s effort. The current mark of 1,713 was set in August 2018 in the Japanese city of Takarazuka. Jessica Seders, executive director of Gillette Main Street, told the Gillette News Record she believes the effort was record-breaking. When the count is complete, photos and video will be submitted to Guinness for a determination. Fran Silverness says, if nothing else, it brought the community together.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/22/sequoia-toll-daffodil-project-ferret-release-news-around-states/49419721/", "title": "Sequoia toll, Daffodil Project: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A television station has donated thousands of items including historic footage from the civil rights era to the Alabama Department of Archives and History, which will make the material available to the public. WSFA-TV in Montgomery announced it had given the agency materials dating to the 1950s, including footage from news conferences by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., coverage of the Freedom Riders in 1961 and original film from the “Stand in the School House Door” by then-Gov. George C. Wallace in 1963. The video also includes scenes from a visit to the NASA center in Huntsville by the President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson in 1962 and special reports on the death of former University of Alabama football coach Paul “Bear” Bryant in 1983. As the TV station was planning to switch locations, managers determined it wasn’t practical to move the large numbers of delicate film reels and boxes full of video and other items. Steve Murray, the state archives director, said archivists had long suspected the WSFA studios held valuable content for historical preservation, and his department jumped at the opportunity to add to its collection when a phone call came in late 2019.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Members of the Biden administration have launched a series of events aimed at exploring the Arctic’s potential to act as a “living laboratory of clean energy innovation.” Officials participating in the online event, billed as “ArcticX,” spoke of the challenges faced by remote communities in Alaska’s Arctic region, such as high energy costs and impacts from climate change. During the event’s broad discussions, they said they see opportunities for sustainable or renewable energy systems. Wednesday’s meeting was the first of four planned online events, with an in-person gathering set for May in Alaska. Among the speakers was U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Offices that fall under the department co-hosted the event. “We hope to combine the world-class expertise of our national labs, of our 17 national labs, with the know-how that Arctic communities have developed over centuries of innovation in the far north so together we can get new technologies out of the lab and into the field and onto the market and support communities in taking control of their own clean energy future,” Granholm said. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, renewable sources accounted for about 30% of Alaska’s electricity generation in 2019. Many rural communities rely largely on diesel electric generators for power.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s Motor Vehicle Division failed to notify more than 34,000 drivers that their licenses had been suspended, revoked or canceled and also lagged for months in alerting prosecutors. The MVD notified county attorney’s offices around the state of the problem Wednesday, saying in an email that notices weren’t mailed “beginning in late 2020 and ending in March.” A glitch with the agency’s mailing process was the cause. “When MVD discovered this issue in February 2021, the first step was to understand what caused the problem, the extent of customers affected and how to resolve the problem,” MVD spokesman Doug Parcey said in an email. “Once those were known, the affected customers were immediately notified.” Some prosecutors learned about the issue from defense attorneys. Potentially thousands of drivers might have been arrested and prosecuted or paid hefty fines because they unknowingly drove with a suspended license. Prosecutors in Maricopa and Pinal counties have already flagged more than 1,000 cases. Municipal and justice courts will also have to review cases involving suspended licenses. “Our first priority is to look at convictions,” said Rachel Mitchell, acting division chief of the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office. “We are focusing on prison. … It is certainly scary for me as a prosecutor.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State lawmakers on Friday delayed a vote on whether to allow state-run health care facilities to require employees to get COVID-19 vaccines – a move officials say is needed to protect millions of dollars in federal funding. The Arkansas Legislative Council voted to delay considering the requests by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the Department of Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs for an exemption from a state law banning vaccine requirements by government entities. The law conflicts with a federal COVID-19 vaccine requirement for health care workers issued by President Joe Biden’s administration that’s set to take effect in January. A group of Republican-led states, including Arkansas, have asked a federal judge to block its enforcement. UAMS could lose $600 million in Medicare and Medicaid funding and another $100 million in federal contracts if it doesn’t comply with the federal rule, Chancellor Dr. Cam Patterson told the panel. Patterson said the exemption was needed to ensure that the university’s workers are in compliance with the federal requirement and that funding isn’t threatened. The panel did not set a date for considering the exemptions. But legislative leaders said they hoped to meet before Dec. 5.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Lightning-sparked wildfires killed thousands of giant sequoias this year, leading to a staggering two-year death toll that accounts for up to nearly a fifth of Earth’s largest trees, officials said Friday. Fires in Sequoia National Park and surrounding Sequoia National Forest tore through more than a third of groves in California and torched an estimated 2,261 to 3,637 sequoias, which are the largest trees by volume. Nearby wildfires last year killed an unprecedented 7,500 to 10,400 giant sequoias that are only native in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range. Losses now account for 13% to 19% of the 75,000 sequoias greater than 4 feet in diameter. Blazes so intense to burn hot enough and high enough to kill so many giant sequoias – trees once considered nearly fireproof – put an exclamation point on climate change’s impact. A warming planet that has created hotter droughts combined with a century of fire suppression that choked forests with thick undergrowth have fueled flames that have sounded the death knell for trees dating to ancient civilizations. “The sobering reality is that we have seen another huge loss within a finite population of these iconic trees that are irreplaceable in many lifetimes,” said Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Denver suburb of Aurora has agreed to pay $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the parents of Elijah McClain, a Black man who died after police stopped him on the street and put him in a neck hold two years ago, the city and family attorneys announced Friday. A federal magistrate judge accepted terms of the settlement after a mediation session, said Qusair Mohamedbhai, an attorney for McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain. Outside court, Sheneen McClain said she was glad to have the agreement finalized but noted the work of fighting for justice for her son just makes her miss him more. “The money is just the world’s way of saying, ‘We’re sorry,’ but it’s not going to help me heal the hole in my heart,” she said. The settlement amount was agreed to in July but not officially disclosed until now because of a dispute between McClain’s parents about how the wording of the agreement could affect their dispute over how the money should be divided. Sheneen McClain said Elijah’s father, LaWayne Mosley, was not involved in raising him. How the money will be divided will be addressed separately. In a statement, Mosley did not address the dispute but said he hoped the settlement would send a message to police. “I hope Elijah’s legacy is that police will think twice before killing another innocent person,” he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nPlymouth: Officials believe nearly 40 drug overdoses across the state since July may be linked to marijuana laced with the powerful opioid fentanyl and are warning the public about the potential danger. State health officials said marijuana seized in Plymouth after an overdose in early October tested positive for fentanyl at the state crime lab. “This is the first lab confirmed case of marijuana with fentanyl in Connecticut and possibly the first confirmed case in the United States,” Dr. Manisha Juthani, the state’s public health commissioner, said in a statement Thursday. Officials had been investigating reports of people across Connecticut who overdosed and were revived with naloxone but denied using opioids. They told authorities they only smoked marijuana. There were 11 such overdoses in July, nine in August, nine in September and 10 from Oct. 1 to Oct. 26. No deaths were reported. Brian Foley, an aide to state public safety Commissioner James Rovella, said the state crime lab will now be testing all marijuana that police submit for fentanyl. An estimated 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in a recent one-year period – a never-before-seen milestone that health officials say is tied to the COVID-19 pandemic and a more dangerous drug supply.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: In October, as the state allocated $78 million in federal money to health care facilities struggling with staffing shortages, hospitals received $25million total – only about one-third of what they requested. Health care workers, who have been fighting the coronavirus for nearly two years, have said they’re burned out and exhausted. Some chose to leave the hospital bedside or the profession entirely. Others declined financial incentives of several hundred dollars offered to fill shifts, citing mental health reasons. Many are jumping ship to other hospitals in Delaware or the Philadelphia area because health systems are providing hefty signing bonuses and significant increases in pay. Hospitals are also relying on travel nurses, who work in three-month shifts, to fill the gaps. Travel nurses can make twice as much or more what permanent hospital nurses take home in pay. ChristianaCare requested $40 million in federal aid, according to documents provided by the governor’s office. Instead, the state’s largest hospital and private employer received $12 million, the biggest sum any health system received. ChristianaCare, like others, continues to offer $10,000 signing bonuses for a number of open nursing positions.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser’s decision to ease mask requirements in the nation’s capital has sparked a public debate about timing, with the majority of the D.C. Council pleading with her to reconsider. It’s a localized debate that reflects a broader national dynamic in the country’s coronavirus-mitigation stance, with some leaders and businesses pushing for more normalcy after the successful reopening of schools and others preaching caution against reckless pre-winter moves. Starting Monday, masks will no longer be required in many indoor spaces in D.C. They must still be worn in multiple settings, including schools, libraries, public transportation, ride-share vehicles, and group-living facilities like nursing homes, dorms and jails. Private businesses will still be able to require customers to wear masks. Bowser has cautiously hailed the step as a “shift in where we are with the pandemic,” saying the return of the mask mandate earlier this year helped blunt the late-summer surge of the delta variant. The nation’s capital originally lifted its indoor mask requirement for fully vaccinated individuals in May but reinstated it in late July as cases began to rise again. According to D.C. Health Department statistics, the current seven-day average of new cases is higher than it was in May but still well below the late-summer delta-variant peak.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed work on a $339 million Everglades restoration project aimed at cleansing water runoff before it flows into a troubled river. Corps and local officials held a ceremony Friday for the 12,000-acre project in Martin County known officially as the C-44 Reservoir and Stormwater Treatment Area. It’s a key part of a broader effort to restore the vast Florida Everglades. The reservoir will capture, store and clean fertilizer-laden runoff from farms and development before it is routed into the St. Lucie River and ultimately the Indian River Lagoon. Both have been plagued by harmful algae blooms and other long-term problems associated with water pollution that threatens wildlife and human health. “I think it’s huge” for the east coast, said Chauncey Goss, chair of the South Florida Water Management District. “Not only symbolically, but it’s also going to be taking water, cleaning it up and helping to get rid of some of these discharges, which is really the goal of all of this.” The project can store 19.7 billion gallons of water, according to state water managers. It will use plants such as cattails to suck up about 35 metric tons of phosphorus every year before the water makes its way into the St. Lucie River.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCumming: Leaders with Forsyth County Schools, Congregation Beth Israel and the OneForsyth Council have planted 500 daffodil bulbs outside the school district’s new Forsyth County Arts and Learning Center as part of the Daffodil Project, a worldwide initiative aiming to plant the flowers all over in honor of each of the 1.5 million children who died during the Holocaust. Thanks to the partnership, Forsyth County will now be home to 500 of those daffodils, which will bloom in the spring on Holocaust Remembrance Day. FCS Superintendent Dr. Jeff Bearden, Rabbi Levi Mentz with Congregation Beth Israel and OneForsyth Council Chair Kristin Cook all gave opening remarks at a Nov. 8 ceremony before county and school district leaders began planting each of the bulbs. Cook said she was proud to be there, speaking on behalf of OneForsyth, the Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce’s diversity initiative, and modeling their guiding principles of uniting, celebrating and promoting inclusion in the county. “Our hope is that, by continuing to support events like these, we will all grow to appreciate the unique identities that embody us all,” Cook said. Metz said he was overjoyed to see the project coming to Forsyth County, his involvement feeling personal to him and his family since his grandfather was a survivor of the Holocaust.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is considering additional protections for waters off the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. NOAA announced the proposal to designate oceanic areas of Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, which is already one of the largest protected natural areas in the world, as a national marine sanctuary on Friday. The agency opened the plan to public comment through January. The designation would build on existing protections meant to maintain marine habitats and wildlife. The new rules would apply only to oceanic areas, not the islands that are already part of the monument. “Papahānaumokuākea’s ecosystems are increasingly under pressure from threats such as marine debris, invasive species, and climate change,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement. NOAA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the state of Hawaii and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs currently co-manage the monument. Papahānaumokuākea is larger than all other U.S. national parks combined and is home to endangered Hawaiian monk seals, green sea turtles, seabirds and extensive coral reef ecosystems. The area is home to many species found nowhere else on Earth.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: If anyone has a good idea on how to put a nuclear fission power plant on the moon, the U.S. government wants to hear about it. NASA and the nation’s top federal nuclear research lab on Friday put out a request for proposals for a fission surface power system. NASA is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory to establish a sun-independent power source for missions to the moon by the end of the decade. “Providing a reliable, high-power system on the moon is a vital next step in human space exploration, and achieving it is within our grasp,” Sebastian Corbisiero, the Fission Surface Power Project lead at the lab, said in a statement. If the effort is successful in supporting a sustained human presence on the moon, the next objective would be Mars. NASA says fission surface power could provide sustained, abundant power no matter the environmental conditions on the moon or Mars. “I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,” Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement. The reactor would be built on Earth and then sent to the moon.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new store at the Illinois State Museum will feature products from the state, along with themed souvenirs, specialty foods and toys. The Shop opened to the public Saturday. Families were invited to attend an opening event in their flannel and fleece pajamas. The store is located in the first floor of the Illinois State Museum, which owns and operates the Shop to fund programs and research. Cinnamon Catlin-Legutko, the museum’s director, called the opening an important moment in the museum’s return to operations. Former Gov. Bruce Rauner’s administration shut down the museum in 2015 during an ongoing budget impasse. It reopened the following year but since then has seen closures related to the coronavirus pandemic. The museum was established in 1877 and has branch facilities in Lewistown and Lockport.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A renewed push for the state to join more than two-thirds of states with some form of legalized marijuana use appears to face the same roadblock from Statehouse Republicans who have opposed such a step for many years. Legislative Democrats and the state Democratic Party united last week in urging approval of marijuana legalization during the legislative session that starts in January, arguing that it could benefit those wanting to use it for medical purposes, create new jobs and become an additional state tax revenue source. The Republican-dominated Legislature has not taken any action on bills submitted over the past decade for allowing medical marijuana or removing criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of the drug, even as recreational marijuana sales have won approval in Michigan and Illinois and as medical use is allowed in Ohio. Legalization advocates haven’t yet changed the minds of legislative leaders, who reject arguments that Indiana is losing money to neighboring states and point to pot still being illegal under federal law. “I think when you make the argument about having that substantial a public policy change just because you’re trying to chase dollars makes no sense to me, so I’m in the same place I’ve been,” Republican House Speaker Todd Huston said.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: A city park will now be named Ioway Creek Park to align with the creek’s name change earlier this year. The Ames City Council voted unanimously last week to change the name of Squaw Creek Park to Ioway Creek Park. In February, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names changed the name of Squaw Creek, a 42-mile-long tributary of the South Skunk River, to Ioway Creek, as the original name is considered derogatory to Native Americans. The Ames Tribune reports that an Indigenous teen, Fawn Stubben, pushed for the change in the 1990s, but the proposal wasn’t considered until Ames resident Jasmine Martin applied to the federal board in 2019. The Ames City Council and Story County Board of Supervisors both voted in support of the change. The current name honors the Ioway, an Indigenous tribe that once lived in parts of Iowa. Creek sign names have since been adjusted around Ames, but there were still remnants of the former name, including Squaw Creek Drive. The street was renamed Stonehaven Drive as part of the meeting’s consent agenda. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on Friday formally declared “squaw” a derogatory term and said she is taking steps to remove it from federal government use and to replace other derogatory place names.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Next year, the state will start requiring employers, individuals and health insurance companies to pay some costs associated with coronavirus testing. The state Department of Health and Environment announced Friday that it will start phasing out free screening tests for people who aren’t showing COVID-19 symptoms or haven’t potentially been exposed. The agency said it expects the policy to begin in March 2022. The department said it can’t sustain having public health agencies cover the cost of all testing indefinitely. The agency said it initially allocated $141 million in federal funds to make coronavirus tests available and support commercial and university labs to expand processing and sampling capacity. But the department said infections from the delta variant depleted the funds faster than expected. “Testing has become an increasingly important way in which those who choose to be unvaccinated may still be able to work, attend events, and travel,” Ashley Goss, the department’s acting secretary, said in a statement. The changes will mainly affect programs used by employers to test 10% of their workers on a regular basis and programs by community organizations to offer free rapid tests.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The city has received a perfect 100 score from the Human Rights Campaign, a national civil rights organization, for its laws, policies, services and programs to protect and support lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. The city received a total score of 106 for additional steps it has taken over the past few years to benefit the LGBTQ community. It’s the highest ranking of any city in Kentucky, though Louisville has received a perfect score for several years. A 100 is considered a perfect score, but cities can earn up to 122 additional points for programs and services. “We’ve worked hard to create an atmosphere welcoming all people,” Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton said. “That hard work has resulted in the highest score received by a Kentucky city.” It’s the first time since the rankings began eight years ago that Lexington has earned a perfect score. In 2020, it received a 95 out of 100. Lexington received high marks despite Kentucky not having a statewide LGBTQ nondiscrimination law. The Human Rights Campaign evaluated more than 506 cities across the country. Other evaluated Kentucky cities include Berea, Bowling Green, Covington, Frankfort, Morehead and Owensboro. Covington’s score was 96. The lowest-scoring Kentucky city was Owensboro with 18.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State lawmakers on Friday lambasted Louisiana’s temporary housing program enacted after Hurricane Ida, saying it continues to move too slowly to help people living in damaged homes and tents since late August. “We’re moving at a snail’s pace. It’s just unbelievable,” said Sen. Mike Fesi, a Houma Republican who represents Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes, which were among the hardest hit by Ida. The state has spent $90 million in federal disaster aid on more than 2,000 trailers to provide temporary shelter to residents in southeastern Louisiana. Half have been placed on residents’ properties and other community housing sites, and 653 families have moved into the trailers so far, the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness told lawmakers. The program has received near-constant criticism about the time it’s taking to place trailers since Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration launched the Hurricane Ida Sheltering Program on Oct. 4. That critique spilled over into Friday’s meeting of the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget, as the homeland security agency asked lawmakers to approve $500 million in authority to spend federal disaster recovery aid. Director Casey Tingle defended the housing program, telling lawmakers: “We have a brand new program that’s never been done before.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The developer of a $1 billion electric transmission line is suspending construction at the request of the governor after she certified election results Friday in which residents firmly opposed the project. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills had urged New England Clean Energy Connect Transmission LLC to stop construction on the 145-mile project until legal challenges are resolved. Thorn Dickinson, president and CEO of NECEC, said work will be temporarily halted until a judge rules on a request for a preliminary injunction in its lawsuit contending the referendum was unconstitutional. “This was not an easy decision. Suspending construction will require the layoff of more than 400 Mainers just as the holiday season begins,” Dickinson said in a statement Friday evening. Mills supports the project but said she also supports “the rule of law that governs our society and the will of the people that informs it.” Funded by Massachusetts ratepayers, the project would supply up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to the New England power grid. That’s enough electricity for 1 million homes. Critics said the project is damaging the woods and changing the character of a part of western Maine with little if any benefit for its residents.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: With sailboats taking over Carroll Creek, a unique holiday tradition has returned to downtown Frederick for its sixth year. About two dozen sailboats were launched in the creek Saturday as part of the annual Sailing Through the Winter Solstice project. Volunteers rushed about Saturday morning, lowering the boats off the banks of the creek into the water. Some volunteers had the unenviable task of wading through the water on the chilly November morning to ensure the boats were anchored in place. Peter Kremers, who co-founded and serves as the chair of the event, said there were about 25 sailboats in and around the creek this year. Now in its sixth year, the project has quickly grown into a beloved part of the holiday season in the city. This year’s event has more sailboats than ever. “We started with one boat in ’16,” Kremers said of the project’s speedy growth. “I think last year we had maybe 19 in the water; this year we have 22 boats in the water and three on land.” The sailboats will stay on Carroll Creek until March, each fitted with lights and decorations to brighten up the dark nights of winter. But the goal isn’t just to make the downtown look nice. The project also helps raise a significant amount of money for a number of local charities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A 48-foot white spruce chosen as the city’s Christmas tree has arrived from Nova Scotia as part of a decades-old tradition. This year’s tree was donated by L’Arche Cape Breton, a nonprofit that provides homes and work for people with disabilities. The 60-year-old tree was on the nonprofit’s property on Canada’s Cape Breton Island. A police escort brought the tree to Boston Common on Thursday, WCVB-TV reports. Nova Scotia donates a tree to Boston every year as a token of gratitude for relief efforts by Bostonians after a munitions ship exploded in Halifax Harbor in 1917, killing or injuring thousands of people. It will be lit Dec. 2. For Massachusetts residents buying a Christmas tree locally, finding the perfect one may prove difficult this year. Tree sellers are expecting one of their busiest and most challenging seasons yet, The Boston Globe reports. Last year, with many people cooped up at home during the pandemic, everyone wanted a tree – sometimes more than one, the National Christmas Tree Association said. Many local Christmas tree farms cut and sold trees they normally would have left in the ground. That means some sellers this year have fewer, shorter trees.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Pure Michigan is marketing the state’s upcoming winter season in an advertising campaign running in key regional and state markets. The Still Pure Michigan campaign is expected to run through the end of February and use broadcast and connected television, online video and digital ads, and social media, the Michigan Economic Development Corp. said. Much of the focus of the tourism and marketing campaign will be on travel and shopping. Advertising spots will run in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Lansing, Flint, Saginaw, Bay City, Traverse City, Cadillac, Marquette and Alpena. They also will be seen in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Kentucky. This year’s total winter advertising budget tops $3 million. The launch of the Pure Michigan campaign comes just ahead of the opening of many of Michigan’s ski resorts for the year, according to the MEDC. “As winter approaches, adventure awaits us in the form of downhill skiing, fat-tire biking or snowshoeing epic backcountry landscapes,” Travel Michigan Vice President Dave Lorenz said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Farmers across the state who grow about 45 million turkeys annually will benefit from higher prices this year, according to agriculture experts. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture said the price of turkeys has steadily increased as demand has risen following a year when there were fewer family gatherings, and restaurant traffic was down due to the coronavirus pandemic. “USDA is actually predicting this year to be a record-high price for turkeys,” said Tim Petry, a livestock marketing economist with the North Dakota State University Extension Service. “From a price standpoint, these are the best prices they’ve seen for a number of years. So, you know, that’s good news for producers.” The good news on prices is tempered somewhat by rising costs to raise the birds on more than 500 farms in the state, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Higher prices for corn and soybeans to feed the turkeys are cutting into profits, growers said. “Those are our two biggest ingredients, and and those prices were substantially higher than last year or past years,” said Jessica Westbrock, the president of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. While turkey prices are up 17 cents a pound from last year, Petry said consumers are still likely to find bargains, as many stores sell turkeys below cost.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi School Boards Association is joining a handful of other states in breaking ties with the National School Board Association after the nonprofit sent a letter to President Joe Biden asking for federal support investigating harassment and threats of violence against school board members. Mississippi School Boards’ leadership wrote this week in a letter explaining the decision that the National School Boards Association’s “inflammatory language and the request for federal agencies to intervene in our communities, was just one in a series of lapses in governance.” It said Mississippi will end its relationship with the nonprofit NSBA on June 30, 2022, the end of the term for which the Mississippi School Boards Association has paid its dues to the national organization. Mississippi will then work with school board associations in other states to form a new organization that “will provide services to its member state school boards associations which are requested by and tailored to each member state school boards associations’ unique needs.” Local school boards across the country have become political battlegrounds over issues such as COVID-19-related mask rules, the treatment of transgender students, and how to teach the history of racism and slavery in America.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A couple who gained fame after waving guns at protesters near their home in 2020 are seeking to keep their law licenses by arguing their actions were justified because they were defending their property from a violent and threatening mob. Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who are both lawyers, made that claim in response to a complaint asking the Missouri Supreme Court to suspend their licenses. The demonstrators went past the McCloskeys’ home June 28, 2020, at the height of racial injustice protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. The couple, who were eating dinner on the patio with their daughter, responded by waving two weapons at the protesters. No shots were fired, and no one was hurt. Their actions gained praise from conservatives, including then-President Donald Trump. Mark McCloskey is now a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate. They contend in their legal response that the demonstrations “involved significant unlawful and violent conduct,” KCUR reports. The response cites a report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association finding nearly 89% of protests in St. Louis in June 2020 involved unlawful activity, and 11% involved some level of violence. Still, special prosecutor Richard Callahan has said his investigation determined the protesters near the McCloskeys’ home were peaceful.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The Biden administration on Friday said it will consider new measures to protect greater sage grouse, a bird species once found across much of the West that has suffered drastic declines in recent decades due to oil and gas drilling, grazing, wildfires and other pressures. The announcement of a range-wide evaluation of habitat plans for greater sage grouse came after the Trump administration tried to scale back conservation efforts adopted when Biden was vice president in 2015. A federal court blocked Trump’s changes. But Biden administration officials said the attempt set back conservation efforts – even as the chicken-sized bird’s habitat was further ravaged by wildfires, invasive plants and continued development. U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., said he believed Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning – a former aide to the lawmaker – would pursue a collaborative, balanced approach that will keep sage grouse from becoming an endangered species. But Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines criticized the action, saying states should be given deference to manage wildlife and federal lands kept open for energy exploration and grazing. Daines said state and local conservation efforts needs to be protected from “federal overreach,” while Brooke Stroyke, a spokesperson for Gianforte, said Montana already has a plan that balances conservation and rural economies.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s unemployment rate fell to a mere 1.9% last month – the lowest any state has reached since data collection began in 1976, according to labor statistics released Friday. The October rate reported by Nebraska’s labor department and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics marked the first time any state’s unemployment rate dropped below 2%. Spokespeople for both agencies confirmed that Nebraska’s rate is the country’s lowest on record. Nebraska has maintained its status as the state with the lowest rate through much of the pandemic. Its 1.9% rate for October was down slightly from the September rate of 2%. Nebraska Labor Commissioner John Albin said total nonfarm employment has risen by more than 30,000 from October of last year. The state reported 1,031,001 filled jobs in October, which was 10,718 more than the previous month. Nebraska has struggled with a chronic worker shortage since even before the pandemic, and it has driven up wages and made it difficult for employers to hire and expand. Earlier this month, the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry released a survey of its members in which 92% said finding skilled workers was a top priority.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A big southern Nevada sewage pumping facility failed last year, spewing an estimated 500,000 gallons of wastewater and leaking into a creek that leads toward the Lake Mead reservoir on the Colorado River, a television station investigation found. Officials want to spend $40 million to rehabilitate the Clark County Water Reclamation District wastewater lift station, where the January 2020 spill was blamed on a corroded underground pipe, KLAS-TV in Las Vegas reports. Most of the spilled sewage was vacuumed up from land outside the Whitney Lift Station, KLAS-TV reports, citing documents, photos and emails obtained with a public records request. But an estimated 10,000 gallons – about enough water to fill an average kidney-shaped backyard swimming pool – went into a nearby creek that feeds the Las Vegas Wash. The wash flows to Lake Mead, the drought-stricken reservoir that provides about 90% of the Las Vegas-area drinking water supply. The Whitney Lift Station is one of 24 similar facilities operated by the reclamation district, which was formed in 1956 to reclaim wastewater from unincorporated Clark County, the largest jurisdiction in the Las Vegas area. The district treats nearly 106 million gallons of wastewater per day, according to its website.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State lawmakers accepted $22.5 million in federal COVID-19 vaccine funding Friday that has sparked intense debate and angry protests for the past two months. The Joint Fiscal Committee had tabled a request from the Department of Health and Human Service in September to spend the money to hire new workers to promote the vaccines and help providers comply with the state’s new vaccine registry system. Meanwhile, the Executive Council, which approves state contracts, initially rejected the money before reversing course earlier this month. On Friday, three Republicans joined the committee’s three Democrats in voting to accept the money. Four Republicans voted no, with some citing concerns that language in the grant would require the state to follow future federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19. “The action we take today will be historic,” said Sen. Bob Giuda, R-Warren. “It will be historic because we will either reject the notion of subservience to government coercion, or it will be historic because we accede to that notion and violate the most fundamental premises of freedom upon which our state and nation were founded and which are imperiled as never before in our nation’s history.” Giuda predicted the vote would become a campaign issue next year. At least one audience member agreed, shouting at Sen. Chuck Morse, R-Salem: “Treason! You will never get elected again, Morse! You’re done!”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The decades­long odyssey to find the remains of Jimmy Hoffa, a tenacious leader of the Teamsters union, apparently has turned to land next to a former landfill that sits below an elevated highway in the Garden State. The FBI obtained a search warrant to “conduct a site survey underneath the Pulaski Skyway” last month, said Mara Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Detroit field office. She didn’t indicate whether anything was removed. The FBI’s disclosure is another turn in a mystery that has gripped law enforcement for more than 45 years. Hoffa was last seen July 30, 1975, when he was to meet with reputed Detroit mob enforcer Anthony “Tony Jack” Giacalone and alleged New Jersey mob figure Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano at a restaurant in suburban Detroit. The focus now is in Jersey City, below a four-lane bridge where the sound of cars and trucks doesn’t stop. Wild overgrown brush thrives in the gritty industrial area, and green dumpsters abound. No one nearby at Interstate Waste Services offered a comment. “I’ve been assured that the body hasn’t been dug up yet,” journalist Dan Moldea said, referring to the FBI’s work in October.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Internet problems continue to slow down many students in the state, but a pilot project using TV signals to transmit computer files may help. On Thursday, state public education officials distributed devices to eight families in Taos that allow schools to send them digital files via television. The boxes the size of a deck of cards allow digital television receivers to connect with computers using technology called datacasting. Many rural areas of New Mexico are too far from internet infrastructure such as fiber cables and cell towers but do get TV reception. In October, local broadcasting affiliates of New Mexico PBS finished testing the technology to make sure they could set aside bandwidth not taken up by TV show broadcasts and dedicate it to broadcast downloadable digital files. The pilot program in Taos relies on a broadcast from northern New Mexico PBS affiliate KNME, while two others are planning to roll out pilot programs in the cities of Silver City and Portales. Remote learning during the pandemic highlighted the digital divide for New Mexico students, many of whom had to learn using paper packets while their peers could participate in virtual lessons via video chat.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The New York Assembly’s investigation into former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s conduct in office concluded the Democrat’s administration misrepresented how many nursing home residents died of COVID-19, according to a lawmaker who reviewed the committee’s still-secret report. Assembly Member Phil Steck was among the Assembly Judiciary Committee members who were able to review a copy of the approximately 45-page report Thursday and Friday in advance of its public release, possibly as soon as this week. The report, compiled by the New York City law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, covers a wide array of allegations of misconduct by Cuomo, including sexual harassment claims and the participation of his staff in writing his book on the coronavirus pandemic. Other topics include the Cuomo administration’s manipulation of data on COVID-19 deaths as presented to the public. Gaps in the state’s statistical accounting of fatalities include the administration’s decision to exclude from its nursing home death totals thousands of patients who died after being transferred to hospitals. The Davis Polk investigators confirmed press reports that the state Department of Health wanted to include those hospital deaths in the state’s nursing home fatality count.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A bear cub wandering around a neighborhood with a jug stuck on its head is running free in the forest again thanks to wildlife biologists and some observant residents. Wildlife biologists with the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission spent two days searching for the bear cub, according to a news release. The commission said the bear likely got stuck while going through some trash and was wandering around an Asheville neighborhood. District Biologist Justin McVey got the initial report about the bear Monday night. Commission officials reached out to the public to help identify its location. McVey said a combination of responses to a message posted to NextDoor by the commission and direct calls to biologists, local residents led personnel directly to the bear cub. The bear was anesthetized before the jug was taken off its head. Biologists performed a health check before relocating it to a remote area in western North Carolina.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMedora: The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library has agreed to take a controversial equestrian statue of the 26th president that has stood on the steps of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City since 1940. The bronze statue, designed by James Earle Fraser, was commissioned by the Board of Trustees of the New York State Roosevelt Memorial in 1929. The library opening next year in Medora will be getting it as a long-term loan. The statue, which depicts the former president on horseback with a Native American man and an African man flanking the horse, has been the subject of years of criticism that it symbolizes colonial subjugation and racial discrimination. Objections grew more forceful after the death of George Floyd sparked a racial reckoning and a wave of protests across the U.S. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to remove the statue in 2020, calling it “problematic,” which drew an angry response from President Donald Trump, who tweeted: “Ridiculous, don’t do it!” With the support of members of the Roosevelt family, the North Dakota library will establish an advisory council composed of representatives of Indigenous and Black communities, historians, scholars and artists to “guide the recontextualization” of the statue.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law a map of new congressional districts Saturday that will be in effect for the next four years, despite objections from Democrats and voting rights groups. DeWine said in a statement that, compared with other proposals from House and Senate lawmakers from both parties, the Senate legislation he signed “makes the most progress to produce a fair, compact, and competitive map.” The redistricting measure cleared the Legislature along party lines with House approval Thursday after a breakneck sprint through both chambers, amid praise from majority Republicans. Democrats blasted the Republican-led mapmaking process as unfair, partisan and cloaked in secrecy. The Senate approved the bill Tuesday, only about 16 hours after the new map was released. The nonpartisan Princeton Gerrymandering Project gave the map an F grade. The new law creates at most three safe Democratic districts out of 15 new U.S. House seats in a state where voters are split roughly 54% Republican, 46% Democratic. Populous Cuyahoga and Hamilton counties – home to Cleveland and Cincinnati, respectively – are divided three ways each. Franklin County, home to Columbus, is divided two ways, and the western Cleveland suburbs in Lorain County are part of a district that stretches to the Indiana border, a nearly 3-hour drive.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s building code commission has undermined the efforts of its own committee tasked with reviewing energy conservation standards by shooting down proposed changes and completing a takeover of the committee itself. Last week’s actions leave green building in Oklahoma a dozen years behind, stuck in 2009, standing pat with current minimum standards, said Kelly Parker, chairman of the committee whose months of work was spurned. The committee started its work in May as part of a state-mandated code review every six years to update the state’s modified versions of various building codes. But committee members had not seen the commission’s recommendations on energy conservation until they were presented Tuesday. Commission Chairman Cary Williamson, Ardmore’s fire chief, wondered why and argued that the energy committee, effectively shut down in October, should have been allowed to do its job. Commissioner Kyle Lombardo, an architect with Rees Associates, complained that he was not given time to review the complex, technical recommendations, which will go to state lawmakers next year. The Oklahoma Uniform Building Code Commission further eroded efforts to make home construction in the state more environmentally friendly, Parker said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A man who was protesting outside the city’s federal courthouse when a federal law enforcement officer shot him in the face with a “less lethal” impact munition is suing in federal court. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the lawsuit filed by Donavan LaBella calls the unnamed officer’s actions “unprovoked, unjustifiable, and unlawful.” LaBella’s injury July 11, 2020, was captured on video and shared widely. The video depicts then-26-year-old LaBella holding a speaker over his head, pointed at the courthouse. Federal officers turn on a bright light, and then an officer fires a less lethal munition striking LaBella. Like other protesters who have tried suing federal law enforcement agencies over injuries at protests for racial justice, LaBella’s attorneys have struggled to identify the officers. The lawsuit names “John Does 1-10″ as unknown federal law enforcement officers, believed to be with the U.S. Marshals Service, present or responsible for shooting LaBella. Desiree LaBella, Donavan’s mother, said the people responsible for injuring her son need to be held accountable. “As much as we wish it didn’t have to come to this, he’s irreparably damaged,” she said. He now suffers from a debilitating, permanent frontal lobe brain injury that has negatively altered the course of (his) life,” the lawsuit says.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Frozen vials labeled “Smallpox” that were discovered in a freezer at a vaccine research facility in the state “contain no trace of virus known to cause smallpox,” federal health officials said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that testing showed the vials contain “vaccinia, the virus used in smallpox vaccine,” and not the variola virus, which causes smallpox. The CDC had said Monday that the vials “were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker” who was wearing gloves and a face mask while cleaning out the freezer. The CDC said no one was exposed to the contents. Mark O’Neill, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, told the New York Times that the vials were found at a Merck facility in Montgomery County. It was not clear why the vials were in the freezer. The CDC said it was “in close contact with state and local health officials, law enforcement, and the World Health Organization” about the findings. Smallpox is a deadly, infectious disease that plagued the world for centuries and killed nearly a third of the people it infected. Victims suffered scorching fever and body aches, followed by spots and blisters that would leave survivors with pitted scars.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority is getting a $900,000 federal boost to develop plans for a high-capacity transit corridor to connect Central Falls to Warwick via Providence, according to the state’s congressional delegation. The corridor was one of five goals included in RIPTA’s Transit Master Plan for the next 20 years. The planning grant could enable RIPTA to complete the preliminary work needed to eventually bring a bus rapid transit or light rail project to the region. The $900,000 planning grant is made available through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity grant program, for capital investments in surface transportation that will have a significant impact on or directly benefit areas of persistent poverty. The state’s congressional delegation and RIPTA CEO Scott Avedisian have scheduled a news conference for Monday at the agency’s Chafee Transportation Center in Providence to discuss the study and its potential impacts.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSeneca: One of the most wanted fugitives in the United States apparently died about four months ago in a South Carolina home about 16 years after he was first wanted in San Diego for sexually assaulting children, investigators said. Frederick Cecil McLean, 70, died of natural causes in July, but his body wasn’t found until Nov. 6, when someone asked deputies to check on a neighbor who hadn’t been seen in a while, Oconee County Coroner Karl Addis said. McLean has been on the U.S. Marshal Service’s 15 Most Wanted list since 2006, a year after the San Diego Sheriff’s Department issued arrest warrants for sexual assaults on a child and determined he was a high risk to continue attacking girls. One girl was assaulted more than 100 times before she turned 13, marshals said in a statement. McLean had been living in South Carolina for 15 years, going by the name of James Fitzgerald, marshals said. “The discovery of Frederick McLean’s body marks an end to the manhunt, but the investigation continues,” U.S. Marshals Service Director Ronald Davis said. Investigators are now trying to determine if anyone helped McLean avoid being found by police. They have determined he used several other aliases and also lived in Anderson, South Carolina, and Poughkeepsie, New York.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nMcIntosh: The work of two wildlife management agencies has resulted in the release of 28 endangered black-footed ferrets on the South Dakota side of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which straddles the Dakotas. The push behind the effort by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is twofold: to maintain control of black-tailed prairie dogs in an area of the reservation used primarily for grazing and to save from extinction the black-footed ferret, considered the most endangered mammal in the U.S. They are yellowish-buff in color and weigh 11/ 2 to 2 pounds. The forehead, muzzle and throat are white, and the feet are black. They have a black mask around the eyes that is well-defined in young ferrets. The ferrets were released Oct. 20 in prairie dog towns between McIntosh and Bullhead, said Michael Gutzmer, ecologist with New Century Environmental, the Nebraska company that provides biological services to the tribe, The Bismarck Tribune reports. Prairie dogs make up 90% of the black-footed ferrets’ diet. The ferrets live in prairie dog burrows, and each eats a prairie dog about every three days, said Seth Gutzmer, biologist on the Standing Rock project and Michael Gutzmer’s son. The ferrets were considered extinct in the wild in 1987.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Friends and associates of slain rapper Young Dolph handed out Thanksgiving turkeys at a neighborhood church Friday, two days after he was gunned down in broad daylight inside his favorite bakery. Known for acts of charity in his hometown, the hip-hop artist and label owner had helped organize the event at St. James Missionary Baptist Church and was going to participate before he was fatally shot Wednesday. Undaunted, members of his music label, Paper Route Empire, along with church volunteers and community activists, distributed dozens of turkeys, stuffing mix and cranberry sauce to people driving past the church. It was the type of event Young Dolph, who grew up in the Castalia neighborhood where the church is located, has been organizing for years, often without the reporters and cameras present Friday. Before the event, volunteers spoke quietly among themselves or sat in solemn reflection as his music played outside the church on the sunny afternoon. Label employee Bee Bee Jones, 38, helped hand out the food, honoring his friend of 30 years. “When I hear his music, I just break down,” Jones said. “The truth in all of it, and where he came from, that’s what really gets to me sometimes. This is what he would want us to do right here, still keep on giving. He came from nothing, but he wanted to make sure everybody got some.”\n\nTexas\n\nBig Spring: A pickup truck heading the wrong way on a West Texas highway slammed into a bus carrying members of a high school band, killing three people, officials said Friday. Two students from the bus were critically injured in the late Friday afternoon crash on Interstate 20 in Big Spring, about 250 miles west of Fort Worth, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. The bus from Andrews High School was headed to a football game with 25 students aboard when it was hit by the wrong-way truck, which burst into flames, killing the truck’s driver, said DPS Sgt. Justin Baker. One of the adults from the bus was also pronounced dead at the scene, he said. A third adult and two students were airlifted to University Medical Center in Lubbock, 95 miles north of the crash site. The adult died at the hospital, and the two students were listed in critical but stable condition, Baker said. Other students were taken to the Scenic Mountain Medical Center for treatment of minor injuries, he said. The football playoff game between Andrews and Springtown in Sweetwater was postponed.\n\nUtah\n\nBeaver County: Climate change has been making droughts more frequent and intense and limiting Utah farmers’ ability to grow crops. In the past two years, a growing number of farmers have signed up for a state program that helps fund projects to increase their water use efficiency, KUER-FM reports. Among them is Trent Brown, a longtime rancher and farmer in Beaver County who’s also the county assessor, since farming doesn’t pay all the bills. It’s a family tradition: His father and grandfather were ranchers and farmers and worked government jobs, too. Brown finished the switch from growing alfalfa to grass five years ago to save water, but it wasn’t enough to overcome this summer’s drought. Earlier this year, he used a grant from the state’s Water Optimization Program to replace the cement in a ditch that brings water from the nearby Manderfield Reservoir to him and other farmers in the valley. “The concrete ditch was put in in the ’60s, and it was just falling apart, failing,” he said. “We were losing a lot of water. We figure probably 20%.” Utah established the Water Optimization Program in 2020. It got $3 million in state funding that year and another $3 million in 2021. During the latest round, the program got 81 applications totaling $10.6 million – more than triple the money available to spend, according to the program’s director, Jay Olsen.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Captain Snowpants; Yo Bro, No Snow; Plow-A-Tron 6,000; and Jennifer Snowpez are among the names that will be on some of the state’s snowplows this winter. Vermont school students participated in the state transportation department’s Name a Plow contest to come up with names for the plows serving their communities. The entries ranged from “creative and clever to cute and silly,” the agency said. Participating schools got a visit from their newly named plows last week. One child was so upset she had missed the visit from the snowplow named Super Snow Storm that the driver and plow will visit again, said Amy Tatko, spokesperson for the Vermont Agency of Transportation. The full list of the Vermont names – including Snowbegone Kenobe, Plowy McPlowFace, Brr-rito and Steve – can be found on the transportation department’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam issued an executive order Thursday aimed at improving how the state receives and evaluates input from tribal nations when making decisions about permits related to environmental, historical or cultural resources. The order directs four agencies to draft their own policies within 90 days for working with tribal nations before a permit is approved or denied. The Northam administration said this would help Virginia identify and understand concerns from tribal nations before finalizing permits, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The directive applies to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Historic Resources, and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. Northam’s executive order also directs the secretary of the commonwealth to appoint an ombudsman who can work with both state agencies and tribal nations. Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin will take office a month before Northam’s deadline and could potentially cancel the executive order. The Youngkin transition team didn’t immediately respond to the Times-Dispatch’s requests for comment.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: As lawmakers prepare for a new legislative session to craft and pass a supplemental budget, they’ll have more money to work with thanks to a steady increase of state revenues over the past year. Updated numbers by the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council released Friday show that projected revenue collections for the 2021-2023 budget cycle are $898 million above what had been originally forecasted in September. And projections for the next two-year budget cycle that ends in mid-2025 increased by more than $965 million. Revenues for the current budget cycle that ends mid-2023 are now projected to be $60.2 billion. And projected revenues for the next two-year budget cycle that starts July 1, 2023, are projected to be about $64 billion. Steve Lerch, the chief economist and executive director of the council, said compared to the first forecast this year in March, overall revenues increased $3.6 billion for the current biennium and $4.1 billion for the next. Republican legislative members of the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council said in response to the strong growth, tax cuts should be part of any final plan. Democratic budget writers said nothing is off the table but expressed caution.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBramwell: A 128-year-old church collapsed suddenly in the middle of the night Thursday, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Bramwell’s historic Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, which has stood since 1893, caved in about midnight, Mayor Louise Stoker told the paper. The church’s original congregation included many of the town’s first residents, Stoker said. The Independent Bible Church later occupied the building before donating it to the town, which had been planning to conserve the historic structure. “I’ve been in dialogue with a preservation contractor,” Stoker said. “This week, in fact, we had sent him photos.” Workers clearing the debris noted things that could be saved such as large wooden beams and the old church bell. Some of the church’s Queen Anne-style stained glass windows were also mostly intact. Stoker said the town council will discuss what to do next, but it’s possible that a portion of the building that didn’t collapse will have to be taken down. Standing outside the church Friday, she pointed out six circular stained glass windows in the remaining structure. “Not one of them has a broken piece,” she remarked.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: As the state kicked off its 170th deer gun season Saturday, some hunters were feeling ill-equipped for the second straight year. A nationwide ammunition shortage due to the supply chain issues affecting other products has left hunters searching far and wide for ammo in the first place and then shelling out more money if they do find it. Randy and Tiffani Rogness, who own Paddock Lake Sporting Goods in Salem, had empty ammunition shelves Friday. When a new supply is delivered, it lasts two to three hours, even with a one-box limit per customer, they said. “We search everywhere. We’ve ordered so much, and it’s just not coming in,” Tiffani Rogness said. One of the nation’s biggest ammunition manufacturers, Vista Outdoor in Anoka, Minnesota, said it’s “ramping production ahead of schedule at its Remington facility to meet unprecedented demand.” The price of almost any caliber ammunition is double what it was a year ago. Manufacturers say the pandemic created new gun buyers, along with more hunters looking for something to do outside, WISN-TV reports. More than 570,000 deer hunters from around the world are expected to try their luck in this year’s nine-day season, Department of Natural Resources officials said. Wisconsin has more than 7 million acres of land open for hunting.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: For the past four months, people have been protesting the presence of sexual education and LGBTQ books in the children’s and teen sections of the Campbell County Public Library. The movement, part of a national trend, is being led by the Wyoming chapter of MassResistance, a national group headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, that prides itself on “pro-family activism.” The local chapter was formed in July. Since then, the group has worked to get its message out to the community that the library is actively corrupting the youth with its books, the Gillette News Record reports. “It’s been hard on the library staff,” said library director Terri Lesley. “It’s been a long time, and I’m very proud of them for how well they’re doing, how well they’re holding up. It’s not easy to be in the middle of a big controversy.” MassResistance’s goal is to protect “the traditional family, school children, and the moral foundation of society.” It believes in marriage between a man and a woman and that people are not born homosexual. Library board member Charlie Anderson said he’s been called names, and Lesley said she and some of her staff have received angry emails and letters, some from out of state. Lesley said she’s also received a lot of support, which has helped balance out the calls for her resignation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/columns/2022/09/10/claudine-schneider-only-woman-serve-rhode-island-congress/8014870001/", "title": "Former U.S. Rep.

Now, with the 40th anniversary approaching, there is one nagging thought not possible for me to dismiss.\n\nI recall where I was when the initial news broke over the local AM radio station on my way into York that morning. There were no details, but it had a serious tone. Like Sept. 11, 2001, the day’s news would slowly build to turn everyone’s attention to what was going on, except that no one really knew what was going on.\n\nMy initial impression was this is going to be a day of misinformation and unnecessary confusion directed to an uninformed public made worse by an uninformed media on how nuclear power plants work. Months later a local newspaper reporter was at my home for an unrelated feature and recounted her on-site experiences with national media celebrities like Walter Cronkite. They really were clueless about what and how to report any plant status information.\n\nIt was nearly six years earlier that I left the Navy in 1973 as a nuclear reactor plant operator after serving on the USS Enterprise — an aircraft carrier with eight nuclear reactors and 32 steam generators that powered four main steam engines to propel the ship and launch planes, as well as make electricity to run the ship. It was an engineering marvel of its day, and the reactor crew was the best trained in the world.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nSupport Local Journalism - Your story is our story.\n\nSo, on the morning of March 28, 1979, I wasn’t concerned. Safety designs for Navy reactors have redundant backup systems and automatic shutdown procedures if any component fails. An integral part of our training was to understand what sequence of events would occur if even a minor part failed to operate. No matter how many steps it took in a series of actions, the reactor would shut down safely. For ships at sea, there was a design provision that would ensure the control rods would insert downward into the core for a shutdown — even if capsized, or, as the Navy would call it, an inadvertent loss of gravity.\n\nIn the 1960s, as the nuclear age was evolving from WWII weapons to peaceful use for electricity, I can recall an exhibit at the 1964 World’s Fair in New York. Many can quote the futuristic prediction from that era that by using nuclear energy, “electricity would be too cheap to meter,” meaning it would be so abundant at low cost that we could use as much as possible and just be charged a flat rate in our homes and businesses.\n\nAt that World’s Fair Atomic Energy pavilion, you could take a dime and have it “irradiated” with gamma rays — how cool was that! Then you put it back in your pocket and moved on. It was harmless, but it would be a few years later until I understood and in turn could explain why. Which brings us back to March 1979.\n\nEven with all the documentation and hindsight of what happened at TMI on the initial incident day, and the following days to get the plant stabilized, there’s still a lot of dispute on what the effects and consequences were (or still are). Public panic set in when the media reported a radiation release with no quantifying information. Was it gaseous or particulate? Was it in the air or in the water or both? Was it Alpha, Beta or Gamma forms of radiation? It makes a difference on how to avoid being contaminated and how to be decontaminated and treated if exposed. Did it exceed the limits in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations? Did the public and media know the limits in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations?\n\nAnd then there was the wild speculation on whether the plant would “blow up” if the mysterious “bubble” in the reactor was not managed. Remember that? Residents living well beyond the 10-mile radius were packing up and driving as far as they could to some subjective safe zone. One small borough near me had an emergency management coordinator do exactly that — he and his family headed for Delaware. Everyone else should fend for themselves. Highways were jammed, and Gov. Thornburg had not yet ordered a full evacuation. Under pressure, he did order a partial evacuation for vulnerable groups. Many took that as a sign to get out of town.\n\nAfter analyzing the incident many years later, it was apparent that the evacuation plans for each county were not coordinated for such a regional mass catastrophe. Basic emergency plans called for Dauphin County traffic to be directed to Cumberland County. Oh, wait. Cumberland County was directed to Dauphin County. Funny now — not so funny then.\n\nHershey Medical Center had plans in place for one or two workers to be decontaminated in a maintenance related type emergency. Now they were scrambling to process hundreds if needed. How do you do that? Initially, it was proposed to hook up fire hoses in the parking lot to wash down personnel. Realizing the cool March weather and that the water main temperature is 55 degrees, what’s Plan B?\n\nMet-Ed (later to be part of First Energy) operated the TMI power station and was just completing the second plant at the end of 1978. There was a rush to get #2 “online” for the typical business reasons any investor-owned utility would want to — profit. The official date was Dec. 30, 1978 — just in time. Bear in mind that the structure of electric utilities then was wholly owned and operated. Met-Ed generated the electricity and sold it directly to their customers, unlike today’s arrangement of electric choice. So, Met-Ed had to recover the cost of constructing TMI as quickly as possible to blend it into the rates Met-Ed customers paid. See where this is going?\n\nBack then, commercial nuclear plants lacked the high standards of the Navy when it came to training. Commercial control room operators just needed to know how to follow procedures from a book. They didn’t need to have comprehensive knowledge. Loads on a commercial reactor plant change slowly compared to fast changes brought on by a ship maneuvering at sea and launching planes with a steam catapult. When an alarm sounded, or a warning light came on — see what the book says to do. When I was on duty, I knew what to do and so did the guy next to me and the officer in charge standing behind us. “We didn’t need no stinkin’ book.” We had the book memorized.\n\nFortunately, commercial plant operators are vastly better trained today.\n\nSo, what is it that still nags me about TMI? It was sometime in December 1978 that I received a phone call at home one evening. A former shipmate had left the Navy after I did and was working for Babcock and Wilcox, the company that built TMI. My friend, name withheld, said he was working at TMI “trying to straighten out the mess the plant was having with the steam generators in Plant 2.” He briefly described the problem, and then said he’d call me back so we could get together. He never called back. For a long time, I forgot about the call.\n\nIn March 2014, Penn State-Capitol Campus held a two-day 35th anniversary seminar on TMI. I attended. Most of the prominent individuals were there to re-live the events surrounding the incident. Speakers included Gov. Dick Thornburg and Harold Denton, the man sent by President Jimmy Carter to “save the day” and calm the public fears. So many great individuals spoke about what “we didn’t know at the time” and how that has now benefited so many critical areas of public safety that are in place from lessons learned.\n\nI spoke up at the seminar with my story. It was not considered significant compared to the full scenario of events. It is true that the severity of the incident was largely due to “operator error” and had the wrong action by a control room operator(s) not been taken, the plant would have shut down safely all on its own. No nuclear plant design accident analysis can factor that in. And yet, what did my friend know that might have contributed to the initial fault that started the incident? That’s the unknown part that still nags me.\n\nAlso, at the time, the U.S. economy, and the nuclear industry specifically, was still reeling from a period of steep inflation that nearly stopped the nuclear industry from expanding. The incident at TMI brought that to a complete stop.\n\nAt that 35th anniversary, it was concluded that there would be no more anniversaries — all the important living figures then are not likely to want to do it all over again. As long as there’s never another TMI, I’m OK with that.\n\nJoe Stafford lives in York Township.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/19"}]}

Tickets cost between $1 and $2.\n\nThe program would soon become known as the Michigan State Spartans, the stadium name would change, the college would join the Big Ten and become a university by 1955. And as the campus in East Lansing started to sprawl outward, Spartan Stadium remained in the heart and still serves as the epicenter of celebration and communion about a half dozen days each fall for students, alumni and fans.\n\nMany of the greatest college football players -– as well as Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones and Bono and U2 – have graced the field. Many historic moments in the history of the sport have happened there as well.\n\nHere is a look at 10 of the most significant games played at Spartan Stadium, 100 years in.\n\n10. Nov. 28, 1963: No. 8 Illinois 13, No. 4 MSU 0\n\nThe only MSU loss on this list for is here for reasons well beyond football. Originally scheduled for Nov. 23, the game was postponed after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy a day earlier. The two teams agreed to reschedule for Thanksgiving Thursday, a rare midweek game. Linebacker Dick Butkus helped the Illini to a shutout and Rose Bowl berth as Duffy Daugherty’s Spartans finished 6-2-1 and second in the Big Ten.\n\n9. Sept. 7, 1987: MSU 27, No. 19 USC 13\n\nThe first night game in Spartan Stadium history opened a special season on Labor Day weekend – something that has become somewhat of a tradition since the 2010s. Lorenzo White scored twice and ran for 111 yards, and MSU's defense forced five turnovers that led to 13 points.\n\n8. Nov. 14, 1953: MSU 14, Michigan 6\n\nIn December 1948, after years of being blocked by U-M, Michigan State finally received membership in the Big Ten. It took until 1953 for the Spartans to compete against the Midwest powerhouses as a conference member, by which time Clarence “Biggie” Munn’s program had become one of the nation’s elite – at one point winning 28 straight games between 1950-53. After years of playing its biggest rival almost exclusively in Ann Arbor, other than four losses in rare U-M visits to East Lansing, the Spartans finally got their first home win over the Wolverines. A fourth straight victory in the rivalry secured a Big Ten championship and Rose Bowl berth in their inaugural season in the conference.\n\n7. Nov. 14, 1987: No. 13 MSU 27, No. 16 Indiana 3\n\nWith a Big Ten title on the line for the winner, coach George Perles unleashed White, and the Hoosiers had no answers. White had a school-record 56 carries for 292 yards, which still ranks second in MSU history, and scored twice. Fans rushed the field and tore down the goalposts after MSU earned its first Rose Bowl berth since the 1965 season, going on to beat USC again in Pasadena.\n\n6. Oct. 22, 2011: No. 15 MSU 37, No. 4 Wisconsin 31\n\nFuture NFL quarterbacks Kirk Cousins and Russell Wilson turned a nighttime showdown into a personal prize fight. Wilson helped rally the Badgers from a 14-point deficit in the fourth quarter to tie the game with 86 seconds to play. But Cousins moved the Spartans across midfield, then with 4 seconds left, heaved a pass toward the end zone that bounced off a defender to Keith Nichol. The former MSU quarterback wrestled Badgers defenders, and, after a long review, was awarded the touchdown to send Spartan Stadium into a frenzy. MSU won the Legends division title and met Leaders division champ Wisconsin again in the inaugural Big Ten championship game in Indianapolis, losing the rematch 42-39 in another epic battle.\n\n5. Oct. 30, 2021: No. 8 MSU 37, No. 6 Michigan 33\n\nFans were not permitted at the 2020 game in Ann Arbor, a shocking MSU win in coach Mel Tucker’s first game against U-M. That helped amplify the electricity across the state before a capacity crowd gathered in East Lansing, where both teams entered with 7-0 records for the first time in history and met as top-10 foes for the first time since 1964. The back-and-forth slugfest lived up to the hype. Kenneth Walker III ran for 197 yards on 23 carries and five touchdowns, scoring the winner with 5:08 to play, as the Spartans rallied from a 16-point second-half hole. Tucker became the first MSU coach in school history to beat Michigan in his first two attempts.\n\n4. Nov. 3, 2001: MSU 26, No. 6 Michigan 24\n\nJohn Navarre's touchdown pass to Jermaine Gonzales put U-M ahead 24-20 with 5 minutes to play. MSU got the ball back with 2:28 remaining, and quarterback Jeff Smoker directed the Spartans to the 2-yard line with a run as the clock continued. Smoker dashed to the line and spiked the ball, with the clock stopping with 1 second remaining. On the final play, as the Wolverines chased Smoker to his right, he spotted T.J. Duckett open in the middle of the end zone and threw across his body for the winning score in one of the most controversial moments in the history of the rivalry.\n\n3. Sept. 18, 2010: MSU 34, Notre Dame 31 (OT)\n\n“Run ‘Little Giants.’” Three words and a gutsy play-call began Mark Dantonio’s ascent in turning MSU into a national powerhouse over the next decade. The two traditional rivals battled into overtime, and the Irish opened with a field goal. When the Spartans’ drive stalled, Dantonio told holder Aaron Bates to fake the field goal attempt, catching Notre Dame off-guard as the punter and former high school quarterback threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Charlie Gantt that stunned Irish coach Brian Kelly. After the game, Dantonio suffered a heart attack and was taken to a local hospital. He returned to the sidelines a few weeks later to guide MSU to a share of its first Big Ten title since 1990, his first of three over six seasons of a 13-year tenure in which he surpassed Daugherty to become the Spartans’ all-time winningest coach.\n\n2. Nov. 9, 1974: MSU 16, No. 1 Ohio State 13\n\nChaos and controversy, as well as a stunning upset of the nation’s top team made for one of the most talked-about games in MSU history. The Spartans entered unranked and as a 25-point home underdog against Woody Hayes' juggernaut, but Levi Jackson's 88-yard touchdown burst down the right sideline gave the Spartans a lead and ended with fans mobbing him in the end zone. The Buckeyes and two-time Heisman Trophy-winning running back Archie Griffin got the ball back and marched down the field. With time running out, MSU's defense stopped Champ Henson near the goal line. OSU appeared to recover a fumble in the end zone, but two refs said time had expired while another signaled touchdown. It took 46 minutes for Big Ten commissioner Wayne Duke to declare the Spartans as the victors.\n\n1. Nov. 19, 1966: No. 2 MSU 10, No. 1 Notre Dame 10\n\nNot just the best moment at Spartan Stadium, but perhaps the greatest game of all time and a watershed moment in televised college football history, with 33 million watching at home along with 80,000-plus in East Lansing. The numbers from the battle for No. 1 are astounding — 25 All-Americas, 42 pro football draft picks (10 first-rounders), 33 pro players, eight College Football Hall of Famers (including both coaches — Daugherty and Notre Dame's Ara Parseghian). A week worth of hype hit its crescendo early in the 33-degree afternoon as the Spartans’ Bubba Smith knocked out Irish starting quarterback Terry Hanratty and center George Goeddeke left the game two plays later. MSU went ahead 10-0 on a Regis Cavender touchdown run and a Dick Kenney field goal. But Irish backup QB Coley O'Brien threw a 34-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter, and kicker Joe Azzaro tied the game late in the third quarter. With both defenses locked in, Parseghian opted to run out the clock after Daugherty decided to punt with about a minute and a half left, closing out one of the most debated endings in football history in a game still talked about nearly 60 years later. Notre Dame played USC the following week and finished No. 1 in most polls. The Spartans' season ended without a Rose Bowl berth due to league rules at the time, despite winning a second straight Big Ten title.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nOct. 10, 1924: Michigan 7, MSU 0 (Spartan Stadium dedication).\n\nOct. 10, 1987: MSU 17, No. 12 Michigan 11.\n\nNov. 3, 1995: MSU 28, No. 7 Michigan 25.\n\nOct. 9, 1999: No. 11 MSU 34, No. 3 Michigan 31.\n\nSept. 23, 2000: No. 23 MSU 27, No. 16 Notre Dame 21.\n\nSept. 12, 2015: MSU 31, Oregon 28.\n\nNov. 2, 2013: MSU 29, Michigan 6.\n\nNov. 28, 2015: No. 6 MSU 55, Penn State 16.\n\nOther significant events\n\nSept. 9, 1994: Rolling Stones play the first concert in stadium history.\n\nMay 5, 1995: Bill Clinton delivers MSU commencement address.\n\nOct. 6, 2001: MSU and Michigan tie 3-3 in the “Cold War” outdoor hockey game.\n\nJune 26, 2011: U2 plays the second and only other concert at the stadium.\n\nContact Chris Solari: csolari@freepress.com.

Previous honorees include Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Maya Angelou, Billie Jean King and Biden himself. Doling out the awards is one of the final official duties Biden will take in office, and his picks (a mix so far of congresspeople, activists and war heroes) will form one part of the larger legacy he hopes to leave.\n\n\"America is my country — my home and its history, traditions and values have always been an inspiration,\" Lauren said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"To receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom conferred personally by the President of the United States is an honor of a lifetime. As a proud American citizen, I accept it with gratitude and great humility.\"\n\nA star-studded roster of honorees joined Lauren at the White House ceremony, which included chef José Andrés, Irish singer and U2 frontman Bono, Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, \"Back to the Future\" star Michael J. Fox, Oscar-winning actor Denzel Washington and TV personality Bill Nye, among other cultural luminaries.\n\nNeed a break?

Classic yet creative, timeless yet innovative, Ralph Lauren reminds us of our distinct style as a nation of dreamers and doers.\"\n\nOccupying a middle ground few high-fashion labels tread, Lauren designs haute couture for the runway and offers (relatively) mid-price staples for Americans.\n\nDefying homogeny but bound still by a common thread, Ralph Lauren clothing projects a specific strain of Americana. Bordering on sporting wear, his polos and sweaters have a Kennedy-classic look to them, sometimes even featuring large embroideries of the American flag.\n\n\"His life and career are deeply rooted in the rich tapestry of American heritage, drawing inspiration from the country's landscapes, cultures, and artistry,\" Lauren's team said in a statement to USA TODAY prior to the announcement.\n\nBorn in the Bronx borough of New York City, Lauren got his start designing men's ties by hand from a single drawer in the Empire State Building. In 1967 he launched a neckwear line titled \"Polo\" and a year later released his first full men's collection.\n\nMarked by a steady upward progression, his career moved him quickly up the ranks from men's retailer to trend-setter to fashion royalty. Outfitting Robert Redford as Jay Gatsby and Diane Keaton as Annie Hall, Lauren's influence wove itself stealthily into entertainment and the culture, his name eventually becoming shorthand for a certain aesthetic.\n\nThe signature polo horse and rider logo − first introduced in 1971 − sits atop the corner of golf shirts and cardigans alike, signaling old-money elegance. It wasn't until later, in 1979, that Lauren made his mark on another core American aesthetic: the cowboy. His \"Polo Western\" and \"Santa Fe\" collections channeled a more dust-tinged look.\n\nIn the 1990s, the designer introduced a newer clarion of the Lauren song: \"Polo Bear,\" a short and scruffy creature who dons different outfits for each new collection.\n\nLauren's Polo gear also ingratiated itself into the hip-hop scene with many rappers incorporating the brand into their signature looks. From Ye to Pharrell and Kid Cudi, the horse and bear logos made their rounds.\n\nStretching his influence beyond the fashion industry, Lauren's brand is also behind New York hot spot Polo Bar (known for its burger) and Ralph's Coffee, a java truck and actual coffee shop with locations in many major cities.\n\nTaken together, Lauren's various pursuits have made him as much an auteur as his peers in other creative industries.\n\n\"His story is a profound testament to the boundless possibilities of creativity, determination, and the American Dream,\" the release reads.\n\nThis story was updated to add new information and photos.\n\nContributing: Edward Segarra, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/03/16/how-celebrate-st-patricks-day-authentic-way/99208358/", "title": "How to celebrate St. Patrick's Day the authentic way", "text": "Sean Rossman\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nEarly Irish-American immigrants couldn't foresee the St. Patrick's Day celebrations of today: Hoards of drunken people elbowing their way to the bar for another green Bud Light.\n\nAfter all, 19th Century immigrants celebrated St. Patrick's Day — always March 17 on the Feast of St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland — as a way to honor their heritage while embracing their new homeland. It often came with parades, food and a little bit of partying.\n\nIt wasn't until later on that St. Patrick's Day was celebrated in Ireland. There it's a national holiday with schools and government buildings closed. Eamonn McGrath, a native Irishman and executive director of the Irish Cultural Center of New England, equates the day to the Fourth of July, where people spend time with family, attend a special Catholic mass, drink, eat and go to a parade.\n\nMcGrath claims St. Patrick's Day is \"more raucously and widely\" celebrated outside of Ireland than inside, a phenomenon he said makes sense. All people with Irish heritage, he said, long for home.\"\n\nMore:\n\nSt Patrick's Day food and drink deals\n\nDebunked: St. Patrick was an Irish guy who wore green\n\nThis boozy Shamrock Shake is the perfect St. Patrick's Day recipe\n\nThink you know St. Patrick's Day? Think again\n\n\"You have to really leave it to know what you've left,\" he said. \"It makes sense that it's more poignant and more expressive.\"\n\nPlus, he adds, Ireland is \"a nice country to be associated with.\"\n\nSure, many would concede their annual bar crawl doesn't fit traditional Irish norms, but there is a way to have your fun, fill your belly and celebrate St. Patrick's Day the authentic way.\n\n\"Pub culture was never about getting drunk,\" said Professor Christopher Dowd of the University of New Haven, \"It was about socializing, usually around music or storytelling.\"\n\nThat means any St. Patrick's Day revelry should be kept social and celebratory. Here are other ways to celebrate St. Patrick's Day the right way.\n\nEat Irish\n\nIt's peasant food, but a perfect meat and potato base for your celebration.\n\nShepherd's Pie is made with beef and vegetables and topped with mashed potatoes. There's colcannon, mashed potatoes mixed with a type of green, often cabbage. Irish soda bread is a simple, dense, not-too-sweet bread that goes well with corned beef and cabbage. That dish, it turns out, may be more American than Irish. McGrath said Irish immigrants ate bacon and cabbage in the homeland. But they couldn't afford bacon in America, so they opted for the cheaper corned beef.\n\nDon't forget about Irish boxty, a potato pancake, and Dublin coddle, a mixture of potatoes, onions and sausage topped with bacon.\n\nDrink Irish\n\nThe Irish are known for their Guinness, but there's plenty of other beer options such as Harp, Murphy's, Smithwick's and Beamish & Crawford. If it's in the cards, Irish whiskey is always popular. Try Jameson, Bushmills and Tullamore D.E.W. For those early starters, Bailey's Irish Creme goes well in coffee.\n\nThe raucous nature of today's St. Patrick's Day celebrations, McGrath explained, doesn't rattle the Irish.\n\n\"I think people want to feel Irish for the day and feel part of the Irish diaspora,\" he said, but added, \"it kind of feeds that old stereotype that the Irish are drunks. That's probably not a good thing.\"\n\nJam Irish\n\nUpbeat traditional Irish music is crucial, McGrath said, to a proper St. Patrick's Day. Some Irish classics to consider: \"Skibbereen,\" \"Finnegan's Wake,\" and \"The Fields of Athenry.\" Crank up the Clancy Brothers, The Dubliners and The Wolf Tones. When the fiddle and banjos wear off, there's always other Irish artists Van Morrison, The Pogues, U2 and The Cranberries.\n\nWatch an Irish movie classic\n\nDowd suggests people pay homage by watching a movie rooted or set in the Emerald Isle, such as The Quiet Man, which according to IMDB, features John Wayne as a boxer who returns home to Ireland, where he falls in love. Dowd, who teaches Irish literature, also recommends The Commitments, about a Dublin soul band, andThe Wind that Shakes the Barley, a story of two brothers during the Irish War of Independence.\n\nRead like the Irish\n\nDig up some Irish poetry or gothic literature. There's always James Joyce, the author of great Irish novels such as Dubliners and Finnegans Wake. There's also Bram Stoker, who brought us Dracula.\n\nWatch Gaelic hurling and football\n\nThe two sports unique to Ireland, Gaelic hurling and Gaelic football, host championship games on St. Patrick's Day.\n\nIf you can, watch as the Irish do.\n\nRemember Irish contributions to society\n\nThe Irish helped build canals, railroads, cities and infrastructure despite being disenfranchised and subject to prejudice.\n\nIdeally, Dowd said, this is how most people would celebrate the day.\n\n\"Reflect on what the incredible contributions this immigrant group made to the country,\" he said. \"Look at how an immigrant group benefited the United States in pretty profound ways.\"\n\nFollow Sean Rossman on Twitter: @SeanRossman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/columns/brandy-mcdonnell/2014/12/05/oklahoma-luminaries-light-up-national-music-scene-in-2014/60780356007/", "title": "Oklahoma luminaries light up national music scene in 2014", "text": "Brandy McDonnell\n\nFrom Garth Brooks’ comeback and Kristin Chenoweth’s homecoming to Carrie Underwood’s 10-year retrospective and The Flaming Lips’ classic Beatles revisitation, the Oklahoma stars have been lighting up the national music scene in 2014.\n\nHe’s back, at last\n\nWhen he retired from touring and recording back in 2001, Oklahoma country music megastar Garth Brooks promised he’d be back once he finished raising his three daughters.\n\nShortly after his youngest graduated high school in May, the Tulsa-born and Yukon-bred singer-songwriter kept his word, staging a comeback that practically proved why the phrase “absence makes the heart grow fonder” is a cliche.\n\n“The Garth Brooks World Tour with Trisha Yearwood” sold out dates, added shows and broke his previous ticket sale records as soon as each stop went on sale (individually, no less, affirming that Brooks earned that marketing degree from Oklahoma State University), and when “Man Against Machine,” his first album of new material in 13 years, debuted, the longtime Owasso resident had no trouble wresting the top spot on the Billboard Country Albums chart away from hot young stars like Florida Georgia Line and Sam Hunt. The longtime digital holdout not only finally made his multiplatinum catalog available online, but he also launched his own fully functional digital music service, GhostTunes, to do it.\n\nBrooks, who last month received an ASCAP Centennial Award alongside the likes of Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Joan Baez, had such a big year that even his controversial cancellation of five shows in Dublin, Ireland, couldn’t cast too dark a pall over it.\n\nTo her credit, his wife hasn’t just ridden his comeback coattails. Yearwood last month released “Prizefighter: Hit After Hit,” her first album since her 2007 Grammy-nominated “Heaven Heartache and the Power of Love,” while maintaining her second career as a New York Times best-selling cookbook author and Food Network star.\n\nWhat’s next: The comeback comes home with seven shows between Jan. 9 and Jan. 17 at Tulsa’s BOK Center.\n\nMore power couple\n\nTishomingo residents Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert released new albums in 2014 — her “Platinum,” which was well-named, in June, and his “Bringing Back the Sunshine,” which featured the water tower of his hometown of Ada on the cover, in September — and that means both spent time atop the album charts.\n\nI honestly don’t have adequate time or space to list all the milestones the reigning country music power couple achieved in the past 12 months. But here’s a couple of highlights: Shelton recently scored a record 13th straight No. 1 hit with “Neon Light,” marking the most consecutive No. 1 songs on the Billboard and Mediabase country charts during the monitored airplay era, and his fifth straight Country Music Association Male Vocalist of the Year Award last month tied a record set by fellow Oklahoma native Vince Gill. He and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Wanda Jackson also were inducted last month into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame.\n\nFeted this week as one of CMT’s Artists of the Year, his Texas-born and bred wife set a record at last month’s CMA Awards with her fifth consecutive female vocalist of the year title.\n\nWhat’s next: Shelton is vying this month for another win as a coach on NBC’s hit reality show “The Voice.” Plus, both superstars will be touring in 2015, with Lambert’s “Certified Platinum” trek coming to Oklahoma City March 6 for a show at Chesapeake Energy Arena.\n\nDynamic debut\n\nBlake and Miranda weren’t the only Oklahoma-Texas pair to make themselves heard on the country music scene in 2014. Maddie and Tae became one of the format’s breakout stars of the year on the sassy strength of their debut single “Girl in a Country Song,” which they wrote on St. Patrick’s Day and had certified gold before Thanksgiving.\n\nThe talented pair — Tae Dye, 18, of Ada, and Maddie Marlow, 19, of Sugarland, Texas — also released their self-titled EP on Dot Records, a newly established imprint underneath the Big Machine Label Group; made national television appearances on the “Late Show With David Letterman” and “Today”; and made their debut at the hallowed Grand Ole Opry. Plus, the uproarious video for “Girl in a Country Song” has already been viewed more than 13.4 million times on YouTube.\n\nWhat’s next: Maddie and Tae will be playing several big country festivals in 2015, including Stagecoach, Country Thunder and Australia’s CMC Rocks, and fans will be expecting the pair’s first LP soon.\n\nSpecial deliveries\n\nAs unbelievable as it sounds, Carrie Underwood on Tuesday will release “Greatest Hits: Decade #1,” her first hits collection.\n\nYes, it has been almost 10 years since the Checotah native won “American Idol,” and as usual, her 2014 was packed with highlights, including performances at the Global Citizen Festival, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony and Monday’s World AIDS Day event organized by U2.\n\nPlus, Underwood almost broke Twitter on Labor Day when she revealed that she and her hockey star husband Mike Fisher are expecting their first child.\n\nWhat’s next: After Tuesday’s “Greatest Hits” release, we’re on baby watch until spring, when her son is due.\n\nSaintly success\n\nAlong with fronting Nirvana at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, appearing as musical guest on “Saturday Night Live’s” season finale and temporarily filling in for Fred Armisen as band leader on “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” Tulsa native St. Vincent (aka Annie Clark) in February released her self-titled fourth solo album to widespread critical acclaim.\n\nWhat’s next: Touring with The Black Keys, St. Vincent will open the band’s Dec. 20 show at Tulsa’s BOK Center.\n\nFlaming collaborations\n\nLongtime fans have learned to expect the unexpected from Oklahoma City-based psychedelic rockers The Flaming Lips, but even some of their most ardent devotees were surprised this year when the Lips befriended pop tart Miley Cyrus. But the strange friendship led to the trippy all-star album “With a Little Help From My Fwends,” a cover of The Beatles’ masterwork “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” that featured the Lips playing with Miley, My Morning Jacket, Moby and more.\n\nThe Lips’ Steven Drozd and Wayne Coyne also joined forces with Nashville’s Linear Downfall in 2014 to launch the side project Electric Wurms. The Wurms made their OKC debut with a now-traditional Halloween Freakout! at Coyne’s Womb gallery.\n\nWhat’s next: The Lips will take another holiday tradition, their New Year’s Eve show, to San Francisco this year, where the freak rockers will ring in 2015 at the Warfield Theatre with Foxygen.\n\nHomecoming special\n\nWhen the ever-busy Kristin Chenoweth returned to her hometown in August to perform a two-night stand at the Broken Arrow Performing Arts Center, the Tony- and Emmy-winning superstar wasn’t just trying to blow the roof off the Kristin Chenoweth Theatre with her enormous operatic voice. The home stand also was recorded for a PBS concert special, which aired over Thanksgiving weekend, and her first live album, which recently marked her debut on Concord Records.\n\nWhat’s next: Appropriately enough, she will perform Sunday on Logo TV’s “Now Next Awards,” which will wrap up the current year and predict who and what will dominate pop culture in the year to come. Chenoweth’s 2015 plans include returning to Broadway in a long-awaited revival of “On the Twentieth Century”; starring opposite Halle Berry in the thriller “The Boy Next Door”; and playing Maleficent in the Disney Channel Original Movie “Descendants.”\n\nBroadway and beyond\n\nElk City native Kelli O’Hara earned her fifth Tony Award nomination for her leading role in the musical “The Bridges of Madison County,” which despite four Tony nods closed just three months after opening.

Plus, he became a grandfather for the first time in August.\n\nWhat’s next: He and the Western swing outfit The Time Jumpers are working on the follow-up to their Grammy-nominated, self-titled 2012 studio effort, while Gill is laboring on a new solo outing, the successor to 2011’s widely praised “Guitar Slinger.” Gill and Lyle Lovett also will play a four-show East Coast tour in January.\n\nIconic Reba\n\nMultimedia superstar Reba McEntire, who hails from Chockie, will receive the first-ever Nash Icon Award during the inaugural American Country Countdown Awards, airing Dec. 15 on Fox. She recently became the first artist to sign to Nash Icon Music, and she has been in the studio recording her first new music in more than five years.\n\nWhat’s next: If new music from Reba isn’t enough to get you excited about a new year, then I just can’t help you.\n\nOther Okie highlights\n\nRascal Flatts, which includes Picher-bred guitarist Joe Don Rooney, scored its eighth consecutive No. 1 album on the country charts with “Rewind” and recently announced a nine-show February residency in Las Vegas.\n\nMoore/Norman singer-songwriter Toby Keith again topped Forbes’ list of top-earning country stars, raking in an estimated $65 million between June 2013 and June 2014, and again got fans raising their glasses with “Drunk Americans,” the first single from a new album planned for early next year.\n\nMultiplatinum-selling Oklahoma City-based rockers Hinder also recently released the first single, titled “Hit the Ground,” from their as-yet-untitled 2015 album, which will be their first with new lead singer Nolan Neal.

Cook uncharacteristically lost his Southern cool.\n\n\"When we work on making our devices accessible to the blind, I don't consider the bloody ROI,\" Cook shot back at the representative from a conservative think tank. \"If you want me to do things only for ROI reasons, you should get out of the stock.\"\n\nIf that was Cook's right jab, his left hook came a few weeks back when the company unveiled its new iPhone 6 handsets and forthcoming Apple Watch. While Jack Ma recently taking Chinese shopping juggernaut Alibaba public dominated news cycles, steering a post-Steve Jobs Apple through a key corporate inflection point is what makes Cook USA TODAY's Tech Person of the Quarter.\n\nNot that this Cook-fest has been purely celebratory.\n\nAlthough the company notched an impressive 10 million iPhone 6 sales in its first weekend, its larger model — the iPhone 6 Plus — was hit with charges that it bent under pressure. And the first update to iOS 8 was almost immediately pulled down after it caused some users to lose their cell connection and access to Touch ID. And its ballyhooed free U2 album promotion backfired when some consumers complained they initially couldn't opt out if they didn't happen to like the Irish band.\n\nBut for better and for worse, \"After this launch, the company has become Tim Cook's Apple,\" says Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights and Strategy, who worked with Cook in the 1990s at computer maker Compaq. \"Not only were these new products developed under his care, what we've also seen under Cook is a very conscious move to strategically engage other companies.\"\n\nSpecifically, back in May Apple made its biggest acquisition ever, purchasing Beats Electronics for $3 billion. While Beats headphones have a huge slice of the premium market, what Cook really bought was not just the fledgling Beats Music streaming service, but the marketing zip of music producer Jimmy Iovine and rapper Dr. Dre.\n\nThen in July, Cook upped the ante by announcing a partnership deal with IBM that will seek to significantly boost the company's enterprise business.\n\n\"Tim has answered the question, 'Can Apple innovate without Steve?'\" says Robert Brunner, Apple's first design chief and founder of design firm Ammunition, which crafted Beats' popular headphones.\n\n\"The iPhone is incremental, but the Watch really can define the category,\" Brunner says of the $349-and-up time piece that when tethered to a nearby iPhone becomes an at-a-glance mobile device. \"By being fully supportive of (Apple lead designer) Jony (Ive) and his team,\" he said, \"Tim showed that form and beauty would still live side by side with engineering at Apple.\"\n\nThat in-house synchronicity will be critical as the Cupertino, Calif.-based company tries to keep its spot at the top of the Cool Tech food chain. And its leader knows it. \"You see the collaboration across the company carrying its way all the way through these products,\" Cook told USA TODAY just hours after his Sept. 9 keynote. \"Jony isn't focused just on the hardware but on the software, too, so they feel as one.\"\n\nAs for the challenges facing Cook & Co., they include seeing if Watch sales can equal those of the wildly popular iPhone. Brunner says that in addition to smart watches \"just being a tough new category, there's the fact that by wearing them on your wrist you're screaming, 'I'm part of the Apple club.' That may work for some fans, but maybe not everyone.\"\n\nAnother concern for Brunner is Apple's marketing strategy, which he feels has lost a little zip since the days of Jobs' late-'90s memorable \"Think Different\" campaign. But an ace up Cook's sleeve is Iovine, \"who is a consummate marketeer, as evidenced by what he did with Beats,\" says Brunner.\n\nUltimately, what may help keep Apple in the cultural mix is Cook, a genteel if laser-focused Alabaman who hasn't been afraid to say that his company won't just make great products but will do so while being supportive of everything from gay rights issues to climate change concerns.\n\n\"This talk about being eco-conscious and attuned to diversity are Tim things, but they also reflect a mature view of what a company is and what responsibilities it has to the rest of society,\" says Moorhead. \"Tim knows it's not just about dominating a market and making money. He also knows that many of today's younger consumers don't trust powerful companies. But he now has a chance here to show that Apple can be trusted.\"\n\nAbout this series: Each quarter, USA TODAY's technology team of editors and writers selects an individual or company whose news is likely, over time, to have the broadest repercussions on the tech and consumer landscapes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/greatamericanbites/2019/08/08/bbq-road-trippers-owe-themselves-visit-clyde-coopers-raleigh/1954555001/", "title": "BBQ road-trippers owe themselves a visit to Clyde Cooper's in Raleigh", "text": "Larry Olmsted\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThe scene: Clyde Cooper’s Barbecue is a landmark of the genre. The North Carolina mainstay has been rated in the nation’s Top 20 barbecue eateries, wins all sorts of local awards including best Raleigh restaurant of any kind, and draws a dedicated mix of area faithful, traveling BBQ roadtrippers and office workers and government employees, as it sits in the heart of downtown (but with ample public parking within a block).\n\nThe urban street front location stands in stark contrast to most of its rural roadstop national peers of this vintage, making it pretty easy to stop in when visiting Raleigh – in fact, Bono did just that and then had the restaurant cater U2's show when the Irish supergroup came to town.\n\nReason to visit: Pulled pork, hush puppies, pork rinds, fried chicken\n\nThe food: The signature of North Carolina style barbecue is chopped whole hog, an entire pig smoked, chopped and then seasoned with a vinegar-based sauce.\n\nBut Clyde Cooper was a bit of a rebel in this regard and always preferred whole pork shoulders because he could trim them to his liking, use just the best meat and avoid all the parts of the pig he considered “junk.” It was a more expensive way to do it, and less common at the time, but he believed in quality, and to this day, Cooper’s uses just shoulders for its signature dish – or one of many - pulled pork.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThat’s just one of the many quirky things about the menu here. The other half of this equation is the pork skin from the shoulders, which have always been used for homemade crackling, or fried pork rinds, served in a plastic basket full of half rinds and half the best hushpuppies I have ever tasted as a house extra along with your meal. Most people nosh on the rinds like chips, some add one of the BBQ or hot sauces on the table, but old time faithful often add them into their pulled pork sandwich for crunch – a strategy worth trying.\n\nBecause its roots are more Southern than just barbecue, there is a lot here you won’t find at your modern style BBQ joints that specialize in just smoked meat and a few sides. For instance, there is BBQ chicken, by the piece or chopped pork-style, but there is also exceptional fried chicken, and in either case you order by your preferred meat, white or dark, an interesting wrinkle.\n\nThe menu is big for a place like this, and there are a lot of different ways to order, with trays (one meat, slaw and the side of hush puppies); dinners (one meat with choice of two veggies and hushpuppies) and combos (choice of two meats, two sides and hush puppies) as well as BBQ sandwiches and a few random items like the pork chop sandwich.\n\nMore meat: Other BBQ meats include beef brisket, the Texan barbecue signature that is not as common in these parts, as well as ribs, a favorite of smoked meat fans everywhere. The brisket could be a bit more moist, but it’s quite tasty, while the ribs are excellent.\n\nCarolina BBQ, done right: The standout is the pulled pork. You can find ribs and fried chicken as good as these superlative examples elsewhere, but you will be hard pressed to beat Cooper’s in terms of Carolina style vinegar scented chopped pork – which they just call chopped BBQ. Unfortunately, this style is often too dry and/or too vinegary, but they hit the perfect sweet spot (maybe it’s the shoulders) and it is delicious.\n\nA side of Southern bliss: The sides also deeply reflect the regional cuisine, with fried okra, butter beans and collard greens in addition to more universal BBQ staples like potato salad, cole slaw and mac & cheese, along with some more rarer local specialties such as the baked beans simmered in Cheerwine, an old fashioned Southern soda that is a staple consumed with barbecue, and Brunswick stew, a sort of chili-like concoction of tomatoes, beans, chopped veggies and meat, usually (and in this case) pulled pork.\n\nThe macaroni and cheese is not the best you’ll find, but noteworthy in its experimentation, using a mix of elbows and bowties. On the other hand, the hushpuppies are amazing, and these are fried fritters made of corn meal, a dish that often sound better than they taste and tend to be either dry or hard, but the log shaped version here is crispy outside, light and delicate inside. There’s a lot and it’s tough to choose, but the good news is it is also heard to go wrong.\n\nFinally, there is a bin of bags of pork rinds for sale to go by the door so you can take part of your Clyde Cooper’s fix with you.\n\nThe history: In 1938, Clyde Cooper took the fifty dollars he had saved and used it to open a Southern food and barbecue restaurant in downtown Raleigh. It proved a wise investment, as Cooper’s BBQ became and remained immensely popular.\n\nHalf a century later, Cooper sold it to Debbie and Randy Holt, and five years ago, the current longtime owners were forced to move out of the original 1884 building, but relocated just down the street.\n\nMany of the original wooden booths were relocated, as was the signature green awning, now inside, and the vast array of photographs, memorabilia and pig-shaped novelties (like the porcine neon in the window) that had accumulated over the years. There are still stools at a diner-style counter overlooking an open kitchen, the main seating area in the middle with all the booths, and another row of stools against a small dining counter on the backside.\n\nIf you had never been to the original Clyde Cooper’s you could easily believe this one had been here for eight decades – well, maybe except for all the neon.\n\nPilgrimage-worthy? Yes, this is a key stop on any tour of America’s pantheon of BBQ joints.\n\nRating: OMG! (Scale: Blah, OK, Mmmm, Yum!, OMG!)\n\nPrice: $-$$ ($ cheap, $$ moderate, $$$ expensive)\n\nCash only: Clyde's does not accept credit cards but does provide an ATM on-site\n\nDetails: 327 S.

But until now, they have been unable to make babies this way in primates, the category that includes monkeys, apes and people.\n\n“The barrier of cloning primate species is now overcome,” declared Muming Poo of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai.\n\nIn a paper released Wednesday by the journal Cell, he and his colleagues announced that they successfully created two macaques. The female baby monkeys, about 7 and 8 weeks old, are named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua.\n\n“It’s been a long road,” said one scientist who tried and failed to make monkeys and was not involved in the new research, Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health & Science University. “Finally, they did it.”\n\nIn principle, Poo said, the feat means humans can be cloned. But he said his team has no intention of doing that. Mainstream scientists generally oppose making human babies by cloning, and Poo said society would ban it for ethical reasons.\n\nInstead, he said, the goal is to create lots of genetically identical monkeys for use in medical research, where they would be particularly valuable because they are more like humans than other lab animals such as mice or rats.\n\nThe process is still very inefficient – it took 127 eggs to get the two babies – and so far it has succeeded only by starting with a monkey fetus. The scientists failed to produce healthy babies from an adult monkey, though they are still trying and are awaiting the outcome of some pregnancies. Dolly caused a sensation because she was the first mammal cloned from an adult.\n\nThe procedure was technically challenging. Essentially, the Chinese scientists removed the DNA-containing nucleus from monkey eggs and replaced it with DNA from the monkey fetus. These reconstituted eggs grew and divided, finally becoming an early embryo, which was then placed into female monkeys to grow to birth.\n\nThe scientists implanted 79 embryos to produce the two babies. Still, the approach succeeded where others had failed. Poo said that was because of improvements in lab techniques and because researchers added two substances that helped reprogram the DNA from the fetus. That let the DNA abandon its job in the fetus, which involves things like helping to make collagen, and take on the new task of creating an entire monkey.\n\nThe Chinese researchers said cloning of fetal cells could be combined with gene editing techniques to produce large numbers of monkeys with certain genetic defects that cause disease in people. The animals could then be used to study such diseases and test treatments. The researchers said their initial targets will be Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.\n\nMitalipov, noting the Chinese failed to produce healthy babies from adult cells, said he suspects attempts to clone babies from a human adult would also fail. “I don’t think it would be advisable to anyone to even think about it,” he said.\n\nJose Cibelli, a scientist at Michigan State University, said it might be technically possible someday, but “criminal” to try now because of the suffering caused by the many lost pregnancies the process entails.\n\nIf the procedure became efficient enough in monkeys, he said, society could face “a big ethical dilemma” over whether to adapt it for humans. The key step of transferring DNA might be combined with gene editing to correct genetic disorders in embryos, allowing healthy babies to be born, he said.\n\nOf course, the familiar image of human cloning involves making a copy of someone already born. That might be possible someday, but “I don’t think it should be pursued,” said researcher Dieter Egli of Columbia University. “I can’t think of a strong benefit.”\n\nHenry Greely, a Stanford University law professor who specializes in the implications of biomedical technologies, said the strongest argument he can think of would be the desire of grieving parents to produce a genetic duplicate of a dead child. But he doubts that’s a compelling enough reason to undertake the extensive and costly effort needed to get such a procedure approved, at least for “decades and decades.”\n\nMarcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society in Berkeley, California, called it unethical to subject that new child to “the psychological and emotional risks of living under the shadow of its genetic predecessor.” Human cloning could also require many women to donate eggs and to serve as surrogates, she said.\n\nAt the moment, because of safety concerns, federal regulators in the U.S. would not allow making a human baby by cloning, and international scientific groups also oppose it, said biomedical ethics expert Insoo Hyun of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals condemned the monkey-cloning experiments.\n\n“Cloning is a horror show: a waste of lives, time and money – and the suffering that such experiments cause is unimaginable,” PETA Senior Vice President Kathy Guillermo said in a statement.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/world/synthetic-embryos-stem-cells-scn", "title": "A synthetic embryo, made without sperm or egg, could lead to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nScientists have created mouse embryos in a dish, and it could one day help families hoping to get pregnant, according to a new study.\n\nAfter 10 years of research, scientists created a synthetic mouse embryo that began forming organs without a sperm or egg, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Nature. All it took was stem cells.\n\nStem cells are unspecialized cells that can be manipulated into becoming mature cells with special functions.\n\n“Our mouse embryo model not only develops a brain, but also a beating heart, all the components that go on to make up the body,” said lead study author Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, professor of mammalian development and stem cell biology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.\n\n“It’s just unbelievable that we’ve got this far. This has been the dream of our community for years, and a major focus of our work for a decade, and finally we’ve done it.”\n\nThe paper is an exciting advance and tackles a challenge scientists face studying mammal embryos in utero, said Marianne Bronner, a professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena (Caltech). Bronner was not involved in the study.\n\n“These develop outside of the mother and therefore can be easily visualized through critical developmental stages that were previously difficult to access,” Bronner added.\n\nThe researchers hope to move from mouse embryos to creating models of natural human pregnancies – many of which fail in the early stages, Zernicka-Goetz said.\n\nBy watching the embryos in a lab instead of a uterus, scientists got a better view into the process to learn why some pregnancies might fail and how to prevent it, she added.\n\nFor now, researchers have only been able to track about eight days of development in the mouse synthetic embryos, but the process is improving, and they are already learning a lot, said study author Gianluca Amadei, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge.\n\n“It reveals the fundamental requirements that have to be fulfilled to make the right structure of the embryo with its organs,” Zernicka-Goetz said.\n\nWhere it stands, the research doesn’t apply to humans and “there needs to be a high degree of improvement for this to be truly useful,” said Benoit Bruneau, the director of the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease and a senior investigator at Gladstone Institutes. Bruneau was not involved in the study.\n\nBut researchers see important uses for the future. The process can be used immediately to test new drugs, Zernicka-Goetz said. But in the longer term, as scientists move from mouse synthetic embryos to a human embryo model, it also could help build synthetic organs for people who need transplants, Zernicka-Goetz added.\n\n“I see this work as being the first example of work of this kind,” said study author David Glover, research professor of biology and biological engineering at Caltech.\n\nHow they did it\n\nIn utero, an embryo needs three types of stem cells to form: One becomes the body tissue, another the sac where the embryo develops, and the third the placenta connecting parent and fetus, according to the study.\n\nIn Zernicka-Goetz’s lab, researchers isolated the three types of stem cells from embryos and cultured them in a container angled to bring the cells together and encourage crosstalk between them.\n\nDay by day, they were able to see the group of cells form into a more and more complex structure, she said.\n\nThere are ethical and legal considerations to address before moving to human synthetic embryos, Zernicka-Goetz said. And with the difference in complexity between mouse and human embryos, it could be decades before researchers are able to do a similar process for human models, Bronner said.\n\nBut in the meantime, the information learned from the mouse models could help “correct failing tissues and organs,” Zernicka-Goetz said.\n\nThe mystery of human life\n\nThe early weeks after fertilization are made up of these three different stem cells communicating with one another chemically and mechanically so the embryo can grow properly, the study said.\n\n“So many pregnancies fail around this time, before most women (realize) they are pregnant,” said Zernicka-Goetz, who is also professor of biology and biological engineering at Caltech. “This period is the foundation for everything else that follows in pregnancy. If it goes wrong, the pregnancy will fail.”\n\nBut by this stage, an embryo created through in vitro fertilization is already implanted in the parent, so scientists have limited visibility into the processes it is going through, Zernicka-Goetz said.\n\nThey were able to develop foundations of a brain – a first for models such as these and a “holy grail for the field,” Glover said.\n\n“This period of human life is so mysterious, so to be able to see how it happens in a dish – to have access to these individual stem cells, to understand why so many pregnancies fail and how we might be able to prevent that from happening – is quite special,” Zernicka-Goetz said in a press release. “We looked at the dialogue that has to happen between the different types of stem cell at that time – we’ve shown how it occurs and how it can go wrong.”", "authors": ["Madeline Holcombe"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/06/new-gene-editing-tool-offers-promise-treating-many-genetic-diseases-progeria/6556277002/", "title": "New gene editing tool offers promise of treating many genetic ...", "text": "A woman's gloved arm reaches down into a plastic tub and carefully gets hold of a mouse. Caught on video, the woman speaks in a coaxing voice as the tiny animal quivers, but stays put. The mouse's coat is speckled with grey, and the lab technician says it's clear he isn't feeling well.\n\nIn a second tub, she points to several fast-moving mice. They all look healthy and active, with sleek, black coats. If she picked them up, she says, they would jump out of her hand.\n\nAll of these animals are genetically identical – almost.\n\nIf their genes were a book 2.7 billion letters long – just a little shorter than the King James Authorized Bible – only one letter would be different between them.\n\nScientists have shown they can change that one letter and create healthier, longer-lived mice.\n\nTheir study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, demonstrates a tool that can correct the kind of single-letter genetic mistakes that cause thousands of diseases.\n\n\"There’s a long road\" before the tool, called a base editor, can be used to treat a genetic disease, says the paper's senior author, David Liu, a chemist at Harvard University. \"But establishing that a base editor can correct a mutation that causes a systemic and devastating genetic disease in an animal, rescuing many of the symptoms of the disease and greatly extending lifespan is a good start!\"\n\nIn this case, Liu and his colleagues repaired a gene that, when mutated, causes progeria, an ultra-rare disease leading to premature aging. The average lifespan of someone with progeria is just 14, and they die of conditions such as heart disease that usually kill people decades older.\n\nPrevious gene editing tools work like scissors to cut the double-stranded DNA that serves as life's blueprint. But treating most genetic diseases requires precise correction of the mutation rather than disrupting the gene, says Liu, vice chair of the faculty at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, a biomedical and genomic research center.\n\n\"For the vast majority of known genetic mutations that cause disease, it's difficult to understand how destroying the gene is going to benefit patients,\" he says.\n\nInstead, a base editor tool works like a pencil, capable of erasing and rewriting a single letter mistake.\n\nCorrecting the genetic error in the mice is a huge scientific achievement, says Fyodor Urnov, a gene editing expert at the University of California-Berkeley, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAlthough there is a long way to go before a similar error is fixed in a person, Urnov likens the findings to climbing halfway up Yosemite's El Capitan without ropes.\n\n\"It's such a cause for celebration,\" Urnov says enthusiastically. \"There's a lot of climbing that lies ahead and a lot of danger and a lot of unpredictability, but the part they just traversed, first, is a breathtaking achievement and second, is the riskiest.\"\n\nThe field of genetic engineering has moved forward in fits and starts for three decades, pocked with tragedies, such as the death of teenager Jesse Gelsinger in 1999, and crises such as the revelation in 2018 that Chinese scientist He Jiankui gene edited embryos leading to the birth of three babies. He is behind bars, and no other scientist has reported editing viable human embryos.\n\nHe used a gene editing tool called CRISPR-Cas9, developed earlier in the decade by two women, Jennifer Doudna of Berkeley and French scientist Emmanuelle Charpentier, who won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their achievement.\n\nCRISPR has been shown in the past year to work effectively in people.\n\nIn March, a paper revealed it had been used in the eye to treat a genetic form of blindness. Last month, researchers showed a patient with sickle cell disease and another with the blood disorder beta thalassemia were able to stop regular transfusions in the year since their blood cells were gene edited, and the sickle cell patient has avoided pain crises.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 was used as a starting point for the new base editors developed in Liu's lab by then-graduate students Alexis Komor and Nicole M. Gaudelli, though not all base editors rely on CRISPR technology.\n\nThe base editor used in the new study changes one DNA letter to another using a protein that took years of work to evolve. Then it nicks the opposite strand – the unedited one – so the cell’s repair mechanism fixes the DNA letter on that strand, too.\n\nDNA is shaped like a \"double helix,\" a twisted ladder made up of pairs of nucleotides, abbreviated as letters. A always pairs with T, and C pairs with G. The tool is called an A base editor, or ABE, because it changes an A-T pair to a G-C pair.\n\nNearly half of the thousands of diseases caused by single-letter mistakes could be corrected by making this type of change.\n\nProgeria is one of those diseases.\n\nLeslie Gordon, a pediatric researcher at the Alpert Medical School of Brown University, and a co-author on the new paper, has been trying to effectively treat progeria since her son Sam Berns was diagnosed with the condition at age 2 in 1998. He died in 2014.\n\nThere are 19 people in the USA and about 400 worldwide with progeria, which is also called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.\n\nIn November, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first treatment for the disease, Zokinvy (lonafarnib), from a class of drugs usually used to treat cancer. A 13-year study showed the drug can provide an extra 2.5 years of life for a child with progeria – an improvement but far from a cure.\n\n\"It's sort of a beacon that says we really can help these kids,\" says Gordon, who co-founded the Progeria Research Foundation and serves as its volunteer Medical Director.\n\nGene editing offers the prospect of even more improvement, because it addresses the underlying cause of the disease, she says.\n\nThe progeria mice used in the study were specially developed to have the same gene that's mutated in humans. That work was led by Dr. Francis Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health and a co-author on the paper.\n\nThe fast-moving mice treated with the base editor were in that second plastic tub. They were healthier, much more active and lived a median of 510 days, compared with 215 days for the mice with progeria. That's the cusp of old age, Liu says.\n\n\"The results were much better than we expected,\" Liu says.\n\nThe mice that received the one-time treatment with the gene editor when they were 14 days old fared better than those treated at 3 days old. The gene editor was delivered by a virus modified to be harmless, though it can cause liver problems in mice.\n\nLiu, whose lab developed a C-to-T base editor that can correct 14% of all single-letter gene mutations, is working to address the remaining types of tiny genetic errors.\n\nSeveral more years of research will be needed before the technique can be tested in children with the disease, including safety studies and testing in monkeys.\n\n\"There's more to be done,\" Gordon says. \"This is the initial big, beautiful hit on those disease features in the animal model. That's very important.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Now, scientists have found one of the ingredients in the triangle-shaped tasty tortilla chips has a superpower – it can make the skin of mice transparent.\n\nResearchers at Stanford University detail, in the Sept. 6 issue of the journal Science, how they were able to see through the skin of live mice by applying a mixture of water and tartrazine, a bright yellow-orange food coloring used in Doritos and other foods, drugs, and cosmetics.\n\nThe experiments arose from the quest for better methods to see tissue and organs within the body. The researchers chose tartrazine because the dye's molecules absorb blue and ultraviolet light, which makes it easier for light to pass through the mouse skin.\n\n“For those who understand the fundamental physics behind this, it makes sense; but if you aren’t familiar with it, it looks like a magic trick,” said Zihao Ou, the lead author of the study who is now an assistant professor of physics at The University of Texas at Dallas, in a description of the research on the university's website.\n\nAre cellphones a risk for cancer?: Not likely, report says.\n\nThe Doritos effect: Snack ingredient yields invisible mouse\n\nAfter testing the dye on mice tissue samples and raw chicken breast, the researchers rubbed the dye and water solution onto the skulls and abdomens of the mice. As the dye was absorbed, within a few minutes they could see \"the skin, muscle, and connective tissues transparent in live rodents,\" the researchers write in the journal article.\n\nOnce researchers wash off the dye, the mice lost their translucency and the dye is excreted through urine, according to the university site's description of the study. “It’s important that the dye is biocompatible – it’s safe for living organisms,” Ou said. “In addition, it’s very inexpensive and efficient; we don’t need very much of it to work.”\n\nBefore you start slathering yourself in Doritos – the coloring is used in several Doritos flavors including Nacho Cheese, Cool Ranch and Flaming Hot Nacho – tartrazine won't necessarily give humans a cloak of invisibility á la Harry Potter.\n\nThat's because human skin is about 10 times thicker than a mouse and it's not sure how much of the dye – or how it would be administered – is needed to work in humans, Ou said.\n\nResearchers plan to continue investigating that and experiment with other substances that could outperform tartrazine.\n\n“Optical equipment, like the microscope, is not directly used to study live humans or animals because light can’t go through living tissue,\" Ou said. \"But now that we can make tissue transparent, it will allow us to look at more detailed dynamics. It will completely revolutionize existing optical research in biology.”\n\nIn an accompanying editorial article in the journal, biophotonics researcher Christopher Rowlands and experimental optical physicist Jon Gorecki, both at the Imperial College London, compare the finding to H.G. Wells' 1897 novel \"The Invisible Man.\"\n\nCombined with other techniques, the tartrazine development could result in \"permitting deeper imaging than either could alone,\" they wrote.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Scientists create babies without egg, sperm", "text": "Scientists are getting closer to the possibility of making a new person from skin or blood cells – without the need for sex.\n\nThis approach goes well beyond in vitro fertilization, which combines egg and sperm in a laboratory, because it doesn't require natural eggs or sperm.\n\nCalled in vitro gametogenesis, or IVG, it promises to someday provide a cure for many types of infertility, to slow or even turn off biological clocks, and to enable the kind of embryo selection that sends chills up many spines.\n\nIn a three-day meeting last week at the National Academies of Sciences, researchers eagerly discussed their work, advocates laid out their vision for making IVG useful, and ethicists squirmed in their seats.\n\n\"The search for a 'perfect' race, 'perfect' baby, 'perfect generation' is not science fiction,\" Amrita Pande, a sociologist at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, told the group Thursday.\n\nThe technology for making babies from cells other than eggs and sperm still remains a decade away or more.\n\nBut now – before the science turns possibility into reality – is a good time for the public to consider the implications of IVG, said I. Glenn Cohen, an expert on the intersection of law and bioethics at Harvard Law School.\n\n\"There's certainly a lot of publications and a lot of interest in the scientific community, and it's great that we're introducing it to a larger community,\" Cohen said after the first day's presentations. \"If people have serious ethical concerns, this is the time to spell them out.\"\n\n'Big shift' for cancer treatment: mRNA vaccine shows promise against melanoma\n\nEggs from male mice\n\nIn one of the latest advances in the field, Japanese researcher Katsuhiko Hayashi showed in March that he can transform skin cells from adult male mice into healthy eggs.\n\nOnly a tiny fraction of the mouse eggs he made were viable, but the mice grown from these egg cells were healthy and able to have pups and grandpups of their own.\n\nHe envisions eventually using this approach to treat infertility in people who have extra sex chromosomes, such as XXY or XYY, as compared with the typical XX for females and XY for males. It also could allow single-sex couples to have a child who is biologically related to both parents.\n\nHayashi also has developed a method of making viable sperm from adult male mouse cells, and he and others are working to mature eggs made from adult females – all of which fit under the rubric of IVG.\n\n\"My primary wish is to contribute to helping people suffering from infertility,\" Hayashi said in an interview last month. \"What I am doing now is very basic biology.\"\n\nIn animals, IVG could be used to conserve species in danger of extinction, said Insoo Hyun, a bioethicist at Harvard Medical School and director of life sciences at Boston's Museum of Science.\n\nBut whether IVG could ever be considered safe in humans, and how many embryos would have to be sacrificed in the process, remain open questions.\n\nAnd while the science may be driven by curiosity, everyone agrees it will be used to make money from people desperate to continue their biological line or just willing to pay for the offspring of their choice.\n\n\"It is a perversion of the sanctity of procreation as a fundamental aspect of human life,\" said Ben Hurlbut, a bioethicist and historian of science at Arizona State University, before the meeting. \"It makes it into an industrial project that responds to and also inspires and cultivates the desires of their future customers.\"\n\nAlready several startups backed by private venture capital are looking to commercialize the creation of lab-made eggs and sperm, perhaps first in farm animals.\n\nAnimal testing no longer required for drug approval: But high-tech substitutes aren't ready.\n\nThe ethical perspective\n\nOne ethical question raised by IVG is who benefits from this kind of work.\n\n\"The child that would be created exists not for its own sake but for the sake of others,\" Hurlbut said. \"That child is the expression of other people's desires.\"\n\nSeveral people at the conference raised the specter of 90-year-olds having offspring in this way, or babies having babies, or long-dead people.\n\nResearchers and ethicists alike agree it's OK to tinker with genes for the sake of curing a sick child. Those genetic changes won't be passed down to future generations.\n\nIVG doesn't tinker with genetics, it just uses the programs already in place in a cell to give it a different function – turning a skin cell into a sperm cell, for instance. But once this can be done in an unlimited way, people could choose among dozens, hundreds or thousands of embryos, compared with IVF in which just a handful of embryos are created.\n\nCutting-edge advances in cancer are underway: Here are 3 that could change lives.\n\nThe perspective of history does not make the fertility field look good, Hurlbut said, and the \"Wild West\" approach doesn't seem to be changing.\n\nIn vitro fertilization, for example, was introduced without the standard clinical trial process.\n\nReproductive technologies have long been a biological, social, legal and moral experiment, Hurlbut said.\n\n\"We really still do not understand the subtleties even of IVF itself, which is 45 years old this year, let alone all of the other things we've layered on top of it,\" he said.\n\nA similar nonscientific process established the hormonal regimen that women still routinely get to generate eggs for IVF, he said.\n\n\"It's a quite fundamental norm that you don't experiment on children, and yet this in vitro cultivation of a technology is also cultivation of desires and of a potential market that at the end of the day fundamentally entails experimentation on children,\" he said.\n\nPursuing this work also sends a mixed message to families that result from adoption, said Françoise Baylis, a philosopher at Dalhousie University in Canada, before the conference. Pursuing a biologically related child, regardless of the financial, scientific and ethical cost, devalues families based on other relationships, she said.\n\nReining in science\n\nThe public tends to assume scientists pursue only worthwhile research, said Katie Hasson, associate director of science for the Center for Genetics and Society, an advocacy group that argues for responsible use of genetic technology.\n\nBut once something is possible, she said, the presumption becomes \"now that we can do it, how can anyone say we should not do it?\"\n\nMeetings like last week's are intended to foster discussion before it becomes too late to stop scientific \"progress.\"\n\nDr. Peter Marks, an official with the Food and Drug Administration, laid out the many regulatory hurdles IVG probably would face in the U.S. just to reach the stage of a clinical trial.\n\nFederal funding cannot be used for the creation of embryos, and right now, embryos can't be allowed to develop for more than 14 days in a lab, which limits the ability to test their safety, Hyun said.\n\nMany conference attendees worried aloud that other countries, perhaps with less scientific and regulatory oversight, will pursue the work first.\n\n\"There's ego and also the structure of incentives in science,\" Hasson said. \"That also feeds into arguments like 'If we don't do it, X country is going to do it, therefore we should do it first.' ... The profit potential and the push to commercialize these technologies can be a big motivation.\"\n\nTo Baylis, the question about pursuing IVG is also one of priorities.\n\n\"There are only so many scientists, so much money and time to solve dramatic problems.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

It was at Kibale that one of the two new viral relatives was found in the aptly named cyclops leaf-nosed bat. The bat virus has been named ruhugu.\n\nGoldberg and his former doctoral student Andrew J. Bennett teamed up with U.S. and German researchers to report the two rubella relatives in a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\nThe German researchers discovered the second relative of rubella, a virus called rustrela.\n\nRustrela was found at an unidentified German zoo in three animals – a donkey, a Bennett's tree-kangaroo and a capybara, the largest rodent in the world. All three zoo animals died after suffering severe neurological disease. The virus also was found in yellow-necked field mice in and around the zoo. The mice appear to have remained healthy.\n\nThe major rubella breakthrough comes at a time when interest in the nature of viruses and in the threat they pose is perhaps higher than ever because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Rubella is more of an orphan virus because so few people work on it,\" said Roberto Cattaneo, a researcher and measles expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\nCattaneo, who was not involved in the study, called it \"great work,\" adding \"I think this will sure help with understanding the fundamental virology of rubella.\"\n\nThe discovery of the two rubella relatives may also aid efforts to develop a treatment for more than 100,000 babies around the world stricken each year with congenital rubella syndrome.\n\nThe syndrome, in which the virus passes from mother to fetus during pregnancy, can result in the baby suffering loss of hearing, loss of sight, heart disease, or other birth defects.\n\nMany cases of congenital rubella syndrome result in stillbirths, miscarriages and fetal malformations.\n\nThe last major epidemic of rubella in the U.S. took place in 1964 and 1965, infecting 12.5 million people and causing 11,000 pregnant women to lose their babies.\n\nThe rubella vaccine was approved for widespread use in 1969, and infections then declined rapidly. In 2004, the Pan American Health Organization declared rubella eliminated from the U.S. The disease is no longer spread year-round in the Americas region or the United States.\n\nStill, the virus has remained a puzzle, and congenital rubella syndrome has remained a problem in other parts of the world.\n\nThe UW discovery began with Bennett's interest in a species of bat that had not been a major target for virus hunters. For one thing, cyclops leaf-nosed bats roost in trees, not caves, making them more difficult to find and capture.\n\nAt the field station in Kibale, Bennett investigated the hollow trees in the forest and began to identify different roosts. He then ventured out to the trees exactly at dusk, which is when the bats leave their roosts.\n\nIn 2017, he caught bats using a net and took saliva samples. DNA from the samples was then analyzed at the Naval Medical Research Center in Frederick, Maryland, where Bennett now works as a research scientist.\n\nEarly in 2019, Bennett received a text from one of the scientists in Maryland who had analyzed the bat DNA. The bat had a virus that appeared similar to rubella.\n\n\"It blew my mind,\" Bennett said. \"Rubella has been so impactful to humans. The fact that it had no close relatives was actually unique among all viruses.\"\n\nAs he and Goldberg were preparing to publish their discovery, they learned that the team in Germany had found another rubella relative, and the two groups decided to collaborate on a single paper.\n\nBennett said he believes researchers will now start to find other rubella relatives.\n\nGoldberg said that relatives of rubella could potentially cross species barriers and infect humans.\n\nHe said a key region of the rubella virus and its two relatives is very similar. It happens to be the region of all three viruses that bind onto the cells of the infected hosts.\n\nAt present, Goldberg said, there is no evidence that the bat virus has spilled over into other species.\n\n\"But that region of rubella looks very similar to our bat virus,\" he said, \"similar enough that we should not dismiss the possibility.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/07/dire-wolf-returns-colossal-de-extinction/82774316007/", "title": "Dire wolf brought back from extinction: Colossal revives species", "text": "Colossal Biosciences, the genetic engineering company working to bring back the woolly mammoth, has actually already brought back one of its extinct Ice Age cohabitants: the dire wolf.\n\nThe Dallas, Texas-based biotech company revealed Monday the recent successful birth of three dire wolf puppies, a major step in proving the viability of Colossal's \"de-extinction technologies\" and its potential use in bringing back other species.\n\nThe birth of the dire wolf pups marks the first successfully de-extincted animal, Colossal CEO and co-founder Ben Lamm said in a press release.\n\n“Our team took DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull and made healthy dire wolf puppies,\" Lamm said. \"It was once said, ‘any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.’ Today, our team gets to unveil some of the magic they are working on and its broader impact on conservation.”\n\nLamm and George Church, a biologist at Harvard Medical School, founded Colossal in 2021 with the goal of bringing back the woolly mammoth. Since then, the private company, valued at about $10 billion, according to Bloomberg, has expanded its plans to include the de-extinction of the Australian thylacine (Tasmanian tiger) and the dodo.\n\nLast month, Colossal revealed it had genetically engineered the Woolly Mouse, which shared some coat characteristics with a woolly mammoth, including longer, lighter-colored hair with a rough, woolly texture. \"This is a very, very big step for us because it proves that all of the work we've been doing for the last three years on the woolly mammoth is exactly what we predicted,\" Lamm said at the time.\n\nWe've got today's trends: Sign up for USA TODAY's Everyone's Talking newsletter.\n\nWith the reveal of the dire wolf puppies, Colossal shows \"that our end-to-end (de-extinction) toolkit that we talked about with the mouse works, but now it's working with ancient DNA and it's been pretty incredible,\" Lamm told USA TODAY.\n\nWhat is a dire wolf?\n\nMany may have first heard of the dire wolf from HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" and George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series of fantasy novels, on which the TV show is based. (The dire wolf was the sigil, or mascot, of House Stark.) Others may be familiar with the Grateful Dead song, \"Dire Wolf.\"\n\nDire wolves have also appeared in video games including Final Fantasy and World of Warcraft, tabletop game classic Dungeons & Dragons, and card game Magic the Gathering.\n\nBut the dire wolf is an actual real-world predator, which went extinct about 13,000 years ago after roaming North America for thousands of years before that, alongside saber tooth tigers and mastodons.\n\n“Many people view dire wolves as mythical creatures that only exist in a fantasy world, but in reality, they have a rich history of contributing to the American ecosystem,” said the author Martin, who is also an investor and cultural advisor to Colossal, in a statement. “I get the luxury to write about magic, but Ben and Colossal have created magic by bringing these majestic beasts back to our world.”\n\nAbout 25% larger than modern-day gray wolves, dire wolves had thicker, more muscular legs, more powerful shoulders, a wider head and snout with larger jaws and teeth. The dire wolf stood about 3½ feet tall and could be even longer than 6 feet and weigh up to 150 pounds.\n\nResearchers have long been intrigued by the dire wolf because it coexisted with the gray wolf – which did not go extinct – but there hasn't been enough dire wolf DNA found to analyze. Many dire wolf remains have been found in the La Brea tar pits, for example, but the tar pit damages the DNA, said Beth Shapiro, Colossal's chief science officer.\n\nShapiro and the researchers at Colossal contacted museums and laboratories with dire wolf specimens and got access to a tooth thought to be about 13,000 years old, found in Ohio, and a 72,000-year-old skull from Idaho. Inside the skull is the petrous, or inner ear bone, which is a good source of well-preserved DNA, Shapiro said.\n\nFrom those two specimens, Shapiro and the team at Colossal recovered enough DNA to create two dire wolf genomes to compare with other canid species including coyotes, jackals, dholes and, of course, other wolves, Shapiro said. Using the genetic data, researchers could confirm the gray wolf as the closest living relative of the dire wolf – they share 99.5% of their DNA code.\n\nNext, the Colossal researchers edited the gray wolf genome in 20 sites over 14 genes to express specific traits of dire wolves including a light-colored coat, hair length, coat patterning, along with body size and musculature.\n\nFertilized dire wolf eggs were implanted into and born by surrogate dog mothers. Two litters have led to a pair of male dire wolves, Romulus and Remus, now six months old, and a female, Khaleesi (named after the \"Game of Thrones\" character), born in January. These newcomers are not 100% exactly the same dire wolf that roamed the earth ages ago, but look as genetically close as cutting-edge technology could get.\n\n\"Their coat is just absolutely amazing. It's super thick,\" said Lamm, describing the wolves, which live on a 2,000-acre ecological preserve in the northern U.S. \"They are super friendly because we've raised them ... (chief animal officer) Matt (James) bottle fed them when they were just young pups. But they are starting to come into their own, where they're acting more and more like wolves.\"\n\nWhy bring back the dire wolf from extinction?\n\nWolves became a focus at Colossal after Lamm and James had a meeting with The MHA (Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara) Nation in central North Dakota. While talking with the tribal leaders about research on buffalo and bison conservation, \"they told us there's not enough going into wolf conservation,\" Lamm said, and began discussing the dire wolf and wolves' importance to generations of Native Americans.\n\nSoon after that, they met with officials in North Carolina about the state's Red Wolf Recovery Program, which seeks to increase the population of the one-time extinct animal through breeding in captivity and releasing wolves. At about the same time, investors including Peter Jackson and Tom Brady came on board who were \"super excited about this business,\" Lamm said.\n\nWith the dire wolf, Colossal thought \"we could do something that could bring awareness from pop culture to science … and we could build technologies to help wolves, which we did in this process, and do something that the indigenous people were really excited about,\" Lamm said. \"We kind of joke that we didn't pursue the dire wolf, in a weird way it pursued us.\"\n\nThe dire wolf is a symbol that \"carries the echoes of our ancestors, their wisdom, and their connection to the wild,” said MHA Nation Tribal Chairman Mark Fox in a statement. “Its presence would remind us of our responsibility as stewards of the Earth – to protect not just the wolf, but the delicate balance of life itself.\"\n\nDuring the project to de-extinct the dire wolf, the Colossal researchers developed a cloning shortcut using blood instead of tissue samples from wild coyote-Red Wolf mix wolves, which carry Red Wolf DNA, to birth two litters of Red Wolf puppies. \"So we're able to inject these new genetics into the recovery population in a way that can bolster their adaptive ability,\" James said.\n\nColossal plans to breed more dire wolves and study them and how they act in packs. As of now, there's no plan for the wolves to breed.\n\nThey hope North Carolina is interested in using the company's technology to bring more Red Wolves into nature, too. Wolves are \"critical to ecosystems, they're helpful to the planet and they're also an American icon,\" Lamm said.\n\nNews about the dire wolves hit on Monday with stories by outlets such as The New York Times, Time, and People. Colossal will soon publish a paper about the ancient DNA used to create the three dire wolves. And the company has kept experts in the field informed about their advances.\n\n\"I think for me the most exciting thing about this project is that shows how we can use cutting edge technologies in molecular biology to help protect and preserve populations of animals that are at risk of extinction today,\" said Elinor Karlsson, the director of vertebrate genomics at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and a geneticist who's a member of Colossal's advisory board.\n\n\"Colossal produced healthy puppies with genetic variants that haven't existed for over 10,000 years,\" she told USA TODAY. \"To do this, they innovated new methods for sampling, biobanking and cloning. Their work could will help us preserve genetic diversity that is on the brink of disappearing from earth today, which includes a number of Canidae species,\" which includes domestic dogs, foxes, wolves and other mammals.\"\n\n\"I also appreciate how careful Colossal was in the way they approached this work,\" she said. \"They prioritized the health and well-being of both the dog mothers and the wolf puppies.\"\n\nColossal constantly weighs the ethics of its technology in case readers are worried about something as happened in the movie \"Jurassic Park\" coming to fruition. \"We have spent a lot of time thinking about whether we should (bring back a species),\" Shapiro said. \"We weren't just focused on whether we could. We've now proven we can.\"\n\nThe ability to revive and sustain species is important, she said. \"We have to keep in mind and understand that there is an incredible risk in the decision not to use these technologies,\" Shapiro said. \"We know what the consequences of that decision are and it's an increased rate of extinction throughout the world.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.\n\nMike Snider is a reporter on USA TODAY’s Trending team.

It’s the newest part of the brain in terms of evolution, and differentiates the brains of mammals from other animals, according to researchers.\n\nA team of researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston started by recording brain activity in a portion of the mouse’s visual cortex roughly the size of a grain of salt while it watched a series of YouTube clips and movies.\n\nScientists at the Allen Institute, a research center in Seattle, then sliced that piece of the mouse’s brain into more than 25,000 layers, each a tiny fraction of the width of a human hair, and took high resolution photos of the slices through microscopes. The material was sent to a team at Princeton University, in New Jersey, which used artificial intelligence to reconstruct the pieces in 3D.\n\nOther scientists compared their approach to understanding a car's combustion engine.\n\n“Just as an engine is composed of pistons, cylinders and a fuel system, the brain consists of neurons and synapses – the tiny, specialized connections at which neurons communicate,” two Harvard researchers wrote in a companion piece to the Nature article.\n\nThe data set from the research contains 84,000 neurons, 500 million synapses and neuronal wiring that could extend the length of New York’s Central Park nearly one and a half times, molecular biologists Mariela Petkova and Gregor Schuhknecht wrote.\n\nFindings from the studies have led to discoveries of new cell types, characteristics and ways to classify cells, researchers said. The achievement also puts scientists closer to their larger goal of mapping the wiring of the entire brain of a mouse.\n\n“Inside that tiny speck is an entire architecture like an exquisite forest,” Clay Reid, a senior investigator who helped pioneer this area of study, said in a statement. “It has all sorts of rules of connections that we knew from various parts of neuroscience, and within the reconstruction itself, we can test the old theories and hope to find new things that no one has ever seen before.”\n\nWhy it matters\n\nResearchers view wiring diagrams as a foundational step that scientists can build on and, eventually, potentially use to find treatments for brain conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s and schizophrenia.\n\nThey compare the studies to the Human Genome Project, which created the first complete map of the DNA in every human cell. The Human Genome Project has led to profound advances in drug discovery, treatments and disease screenings and helped pave the way for revolutionary gene therapies to treat certain diseases, including some cancers.\n\nWith a functional map of the brain, researchers say they now have the ability to understand the brain’s form and function and have opened up new pathways to study intelligence.\n\nNuno da Costa, an associate investigator at the Allen Institute, described the data they collected as a “kind of Google map” of the piece of the visual cortex.\n\n“If you have a broken radio and you have the circuit diagram, you’ll be in a better position to fix it,” he said in a statement. “In the future, we can use this to compare the brain wiring in a healthy mouse to the brain wiring in a model of disease.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/10"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/954653/what-is-the-new-skin-patch-covid-19-vaccine", "title": "How Covid-19 vaccine patch could replace jabs | The Week", "text": "A needle-free Covid-19 vaccine is on track to become a “significant addition” to the global effort to stop the spread, according to scientists.\n\nIn a newly published study in the Science Advances journal, Australian researchers say they have developed a 1cm x 1cm skin patch that has been found to be “superior to traditional needle-and-syringe vaccination”.\n\nThe “microneedle patch” is a small plastic chip that is “administered with the click of a small, round applicator device” to the upper arm, explained the US-based Smithsonian magazine. The vaccine is then deposited via 5,000 tiny spikes, each about a quarter of a millimetre long.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Experts hope the patches “could eventually be sent through the mail or even delivered by drones in hard-to-reach places without reliable cold storage”, said Smithsonian mag.\n\nAnd since the patches can be self-administered, they could be ideal for communities without access to trained medical staff too.\n\n“We wanted to come up with an alternative that would be stable long enough to go that last mile, especially in resource-limited settings,” virologist David Muller, part of the team behind the development, told New Scientist.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nThe patch may have some side effects. Smithsonian said that “like any vaccine”, it may “leave your arm feeling sore because it delivers an agent that’s meant to stimulate an immune response”.\n\nThe patch “also produces some redness that usually goes away over the course of a few days”, the mag added.\n\nTimeline for roll-out\n\nThe Covid-19 patches have only been tested on mice so far. Scientists and Massachusetts-based biotech company Vaxxas, which is manufacturing the patches and applicators, are aiming to begin human trials next year.\n\nAlthough skin patch vaccines for Covid “may still be a few years away”, said Smithsonian mag, “many experts predict that the coronavirus will become endemic, and it’s possible that booster vaccines will be needed regularly.\n\n“An easy-to-apply, shelf-stable vaccine option could help ensure that more of the world’s population is vaccinated.”", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/11/02"}]}

The three have a combined estimated income of half a billion dollars as they've made major moves in the past year.\n\nMessi Mania made a splash on South Beach this summer when the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner joined Inter Miami with a historic MLS deal. The news came after much speculation that the former Paris Saint-Germain star would join the Saudi Pro League or return to FC Barcelona.\n\nRonaldo and Neymar's spots on the list are partially thanks to paychecks from the Saudi Pro League, a branch of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund that also fuels LIV Golf. Ronaldo left Manchester United to break ground with the rising league and Neymar is one of the newer signees after departing from Paris Saint-Germain, where he was teammates with Messi for two seasons.\n\nHere are the Top 5 richest soccer players of 2023, according to Forbes:\n\n1. Cristiano Ronaldo - $260 million\n\nCristiano Ronaldo is the highest-paid soccer player in the world with an estimated $260 million income in 2023. He returns to the top spot after being dethroned by Kylian Mbappé last year and had a four-year run from 2014-2017.\n\nIn December, Ronaldo, 38, signed a 2 ½-year contract with Saudi Pro League team Al Nassr worth an estimated $200 million per year. The deal came after a fallout with English Premier League club Manchester United. Besides performing on the pitch, the Portuguese star has also appeared in promotional campaigns for the kingdom, including hyping up the boxing match between Tyson Fury and Francis Ngannou in Riyadh, the country's capital.\n\nThe additional $60 million comes from off-field sponsorships. Ronaldo boasts 608 million Instagram followers and an immense celebrity profile that he leverages to promote brands like Nike, Clear and Herbalife.\n\n2. Lionel Messi - $135 million\n\nLionel Messi is second on the list with an income of $135 million. The 2022 World Cup winner last held the top spot in 2020 when he was the highest-paid soccer player for three years in a row.\n\nOf his 2023 income, $65 million comes from his Inter Miami CF contract with an estimated $70 million coming from off-field deals.\n\nWhen Messi, 36, inked a deal with David Beckham's MLS team, he reportedly got stake in adidas and Apple TV along with his paycheck.\n\nThe Argentinian star's presence in the United States has boosted ticket sales and social media followings for the team and the league as a whole.\n\nHis 489 million Instagram followers and family friendly image make him a prized marketing voice.\n\n3. Neymar Jr. - $112 million\n\nNeymar is third on the list with an estimated 2023 income of $112 million.\n\nThe Brazilian star, 31, followed the trend Ronaldo started and joined Saudi Pro Club team Al Hilal this summer in a deal that's worth a reported $100 million per year. He left French club Paris Saint-Germain where he played with Messi for two seasons.\n\nNeymar reportedly makes $32 million of his income off the pitch. His involvement in fashion and pop culture have given him an Instagram following of 215 million and sponsorship deals with Puma, Konami and Red Bull.\n\n4. Kylian Mbappé - $110 million\n\nAfter leading all soccer players last year with a reported $128 million, Kylian Mbappé slides down the 2023 list to fourth place with an income of $110 million.\n\nThe French phenom has stayed with Paris Saint-Germain and is making $90 million on the field. Reports have floated around that Saudi Pro League team Al Hilal offered him a deal worth $1 billion, which included the transfer fee, but he remains on the Ligue 1 side for now. Real Madrid has also been in talks on and off to sign the 2018 World Cup winner.\n\nThe 24-year-old is the second-youngest player on the list (No. 6 Erling Haaland is a year younger) and boasts 109 million Instagram followers and a smart fashion sensibility.\n\n5. Karim Benzema - $106 million\n\nKarim Benzema is fifth on the list with a reported income of $106 million.\n\nThe defending Ballon d'Or winner also plays in the Saudi Pro League for Al Ittihad. He joined the club in June after spending 14 years with Real Madrid and Forbes said he's making $100 million for his on-field play.\n\nBenzema, 35, perhaps isn't as marketable as others on the list as he missed the 2018 World Cup due to a scandal and the 2022 tournament with an injury. But he still has deals with adidas and Fendi and an Instagram following of 75.5 million.\n\nRead the entire list of the highest-paid soccer players of 2023 at Forbes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/961454/are-saudis-taking-over-sport", "title": "Football, F1, golf, boxing: are the Saudis taking over? | The Week", "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo was first to go, lured to Riyadh club Al Nassr last December by an offer that doubled his salary, said Jack Johnson on TalkSport.

Several more Premier League players have since followed suit, including Rúben Neves of Wolves and Édouard Mendy and Hakim Ziyech of Chelsea. With stars of the calibre of Mohamed Salah and Bernardo Silva also linked to moves to the kingdom, stand by for more shock announcements to be made before the summer transfer window closes.\n\nWhy now?\n\nThere is no great mystery as to why so many players are upping sticks to play in Saudi Arabia, said Will Unwin in The Guardian. The riches they’re being offered dwarf even their hefty European salaries. Ronaldo’s deal at Al Nassr is worth a reported £173m a year – or £357 a minute; Benzema is set to earn a similar amount; Kanté will make £86m a year – six times what he earned at Chelsea; Neves is to earn a reported £300,000 a week at Al Hilal.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nThe more intriguing question is why this is suddenly happening now, and the answer is to be found in a deal that the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) struck in early June with four of the country’s leading clubs. The deal gave PIF a 75% stake in each club, at a stroke transforming them from relatively modest operations into four of the richest clubs on the planet.\n\nIt’s all part of a well-established pattern we’ve been witnessing in other sports, said Paul MacInnes in The Observer. With estimated reserves of £500bn, the PIF – which is ultimately controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – can afford to spend an almost unlimited amount buying up global sporting assets. And that’s just what it has been doing, propelled, it would seem, by a desire to compete with other Gulf states such as Qatar and Abu Dhabi. Heavy investment in boxing means the sport “increasingly revolves around Jeddah and Riyadh rather than Madison Square Garden and Wembley”. The PIF also has a ten-year deal in place to host a Formula 1 Grand Prix each season, and already wants to expand that to two.\n\nAnd more recently, the kingdom has turned its attention to golf, provoking a civil war within the sport by paying players such as Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson hundreds of millions of dollars to join its rebel LIV tour. A truce was finally brokered in early June, with the “bombshell” announcement that golf’s two pre-existing tours – the PGA and the Europe-based DP World Tour – had agreed to merge with LIV, creating a single global tour. Although the deal was presented as an equal partnership, most observers believe it means that Saudi Arabia has “effectively bought golf”.\n\nReputational gains\n\nNow it wants to do the same with football, said Jawad Iqbal in The Spectator. Not content with owning Newcastle (bought for £350m in 2021), Saudi Arabia now wants to induce the greatest players on the planet to play in “an irrelevant football league”. Somewhere down the line, a financial advantage may emerge, but in the short term the gain is chiefly reputational: by showing the world that it’s the sort of place where “Ronaldo and co are happy to play football”, the kingdom wants to boost its international standing and distract attention from its “abysmal human rights record”. How depressing that so many big names are showing “themselves to be shameless mercenaries” by colluding with this “cynical strategy”.\n\nThe prospect of football “going the way of golf” is indeed “terrifying”, said Oliver Kay on The Athletic. Yet we in England are hardly in a place to indulge in too much “handwringing”. The growth of the Premier League was “underpinned by a total disregard for the source of inward investment and for the impact on the wider game”. At the core of the League’s expansion has been its ability to offer “mind-boggling contracts”, which clubs in other countries have been powerless to resist. And this has bled “other leagues of their best talent”.\n\nNow that the same is being done to England, it is natural that we don’t like it – but “any complaints about the Saudi Pro League should be tempered by an awareness of the danger of sounding hypocritical”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2023/07/24/kylian-mbapp-paris-saint-germain-record-bid-al-hilal/70456523007/", "title": "Kylian Mbappé of Paris Saint-Germain nets record bid from Al Hilal", "text": "After missing out on Lionel Messi, Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal is making a record-breaking push for another star soccer player.\n\nThe club made a €300 million bid — or $332 million — to French club Paris Saint-Germain for striker Kylian Mbappé. If accepted, that would break the world record of $262 million that PSG paid Barcelona in 2017 for the right to negotiate with Brazilian icon Neymar. PSG confirmed the offer and has allowed Al Hilal to negotiate directly with Mbappé.\n\nESPN reported, citing anonymous sources, that Mbappé is not interested in the overture from the Saudi club. According to CBS Sports, Al Hilal is prepared to offer Mbappé a one-year salary of €700 million, or $776 million.\n\nMbappé is in a contract dispute with PSG after he declined to take up the option of a 12-month extension on his deal. He has been widely linked to a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid. PSG cut Mbappe from its preseason tour of Japan on Saturday, with the French club determined to sell him unless he can be convinced to sign a new contract.\n\nMbappé, 24, is widely considered to be one of the brightest young stars in global soccer because of his speed, ball control and finishing ability. Mbappé was a key figure in France's 2018 World Cup victory, scoring a goal in the final over Croatia, but also starred in the most recent World Cup, winning the Golden Boot.\n\nDid Al Hilal express interest in Lionel Messi?\n\nYes. The Saudi team, which is the rival team of Cristiano Ronaldo's current squad, Al-Nassr, had been trying to pry Messi away from Paris Saint-Germain. In May, Messi took an unauthorized trip to Saudi Arabia, which was part of a promotional tour with the country's office of tourism. PSG suspended and fined Messi two weeks for the matter. Messi, instead, opted to sign July 15 with Inter Miami of the MLS, where he has already made a splash, scoring a free kick winner in the 94th minute of his debut with the club.\n\nDid Cristiano Ronaldo sign with a Saudi Arabian team?\n\nIn December, Ronaldo signed with Al-Nassr on a contract that runs through June 2025 and reportedly pays him up to $200 million annually. Ronaldo criticized Messi's move to the MLS recently after Al-Nassr suffered a 5-0 defeat in a friendly against Celta Vigo. When asked after the match if he would look to join Messi in the MLS, Ronaldo told reporters in Portuguese: \"No because in Arabia, the competition much better than in the United States.\"\n\nWhat other players have joined Saudi teams?\n\nFormer Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema (Al-Ittihad), former Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kanté (Al-Ittihad), former Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino (Al-Ahli), former Chelsea defender Kalidou Koulibaly (Al-Hilal) and former Inter Milan midfielder Marcelo Brozovic (Al-Nassr) are among the players who have moved or will soon move to the Saudi league.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2023/08/25/giannis-antetokounmpo-playing-in-saudi-arabia/70668991007/", "title": "Why was Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo asked about playing in ...", "text": "In a video published to its site this week, TMZ Sports asked Giannis Antetokounmpo and his youngest brother, Alex, about playing in Saudi Arabia following the Milwaukee Bucks star’s social media posts playfully asking to play for some of the Saudi Arabian soccer teams owned by the government’s Public Investment Fund (PIF).\n\nIn the undated TMZ Sports video, Giannis said he would “of course” play in Saudi Arabia after his NBA career is over – he could opt out of his current contract following the 2024-25 season – and added it would take “A lot of money, baby!”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/23/sport/year-in-sport-review-2022-spt-intl", "title": "The year in sport: A fond farewell for some, a glimpse of the future for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn athlete, former jockey AP McCoy said earlier this year, is the only person who dies twice, such is the pain of walking away from the intoxicating, all-consuming nature of professional sport.\n\nMcCoy retired from his long, decorated racing career in 2015, and since then has had to learn, in his own words, how to “start again and have another life.”\n\nBased on the past 12 months, there are some notable sports stars who might have been listening extra closely to McCoy’s experience of retirement – or indeed to anyone else who has spoken candidly about the difficulty of ending a successful sporting career.\n\nAmong them is Roger Federer, who called time on his trophy-laden tennis career at the Laver Cup in September after years spent trying to recover from two knee surgeries.\n\nIn the letter announcing his retirement, Federer, like McCoy, alluded to the heightened emotions of being a professional athlete and how they make saying goodbye so hard.\n\n“I have laughed and cried, felt joy and pain, and most of all I have felt incredibly alive,” Federer wrote. “To the game of tennis,” he signed off the letter, “I love you and will never leave you.”\n\nAnd it's goodbye from Roger Federer ...

That’s what professionals do.”\n\nTom Brady flip-flopped on retiring. Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images\n\nBrady has redefined what most believed to be the average shelf-life of an athlete, and he’s not the only person refusing to let the light dim on his career.\n\nLeBron James is about to turn 38 but is still setting records in the NBA – in February passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most combined regular season and postseason points in NBA history.\n\nFederer’s rivals Rafael Nadal, 36, and Novak Djokovic, 35, meanwhile, have added to their grand slam tallies this year – the Mallorcan at the Australian Open and French Open, where he became the oldest men’s singles champion, and the Serbian at Wimbledon. Djokovic’s Wimbledon triumph moved him to within one grand slam title of Nadal’s men’s record of 22.\n\nHaving been deported from Australia over his vaccination status at the start of the year, Djokovic is set to compete at the Australian Open at the start of 2023 – a tournament he has won on nine previous occasions and is favorite to win again next year off the back of his recent ATP Finals victory.\n\nFor Nadal, his future in the sport rests on the amount of strain his injury-ravaged body can continue to withstand.\n\nIn golf, Tiger Woods faces similar questions. The 15-time major champion completed a stunning return from serious leg injuries suffered in a car crash at this year’s Masters, scoring a remarkable one-under 71 at Augusta National before making the cut the following day.\n\nThen there’s sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who turns 36 later this month but has shown no signs of slowing down. The Jamaican produced a string of consistently fast performances this year, running under 10.7 seconds for the 100 meters a record seven times and claiming her fifth world championship title over the distance in July.\n\nShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce celebrates winning the women's 100m final at the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, in July. Carmen Mandato/Getty Images\n\nAnd it’s not just athletes who have defied the call of retirement this year. In November, 73-year-old Dusty Baker became the oldest ever manager to win the World Series when he guided the Houston Astros to a 4-2 victory against the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nFamiliar faces and future stars\n\nMany of the athletes who stole the headlines in 2022 have been doing so for years.\n\nNo one is sure where an aging Cristiano Ronaldo will play his club football in January after ending his second spell at Manchester United in ignominious fashion, but the 37-year-old still appears to be set on extending his playing career after Portugal’s quarterfinal exit from the World Cup.\n\nHis rival Lionel Messi, meanwhile, ended the year on a sensational high, guiding Argentina to a third World Cup trophy. The 35-year-old Messi scored twice in an absorbing final against France and finally got his hands on the World Cup at the fifth time of asking, further staking his claim as the game’s greatest ever player.\n\nThat hasn’t been the only recent instance of an established superstar winning silverware. In last season’s NBA Finals, Steph Curry guided the Golden State Warriors to a fourth championship title in eight seasons – in the process picking up his first Finals MVP award as the Warriors beat the Boston Celtics.\n\nIn baseball, meanwhile, Aaron Judge enjoyed a season for the ages. The 30-year-old outfielder, who has reportedly just signed a nine-year, $360 million deal with the New York Yankees, hit 62 home runs last season, breaking Roger Maris’ single-season American League (AL) home run record from 1961.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Yankees named Judge, the reigning AL MVP, as the 16th captain in the franchise’s history.\n\nJudge (left) hit a record-breaking 62 home runs last season. New York Yankees/Getty Images\n\nBut even as familiar faces have continued to shine, the past year has also seen future stars emerge.\n\nThe 19-year-old Carlos Alcaraz ends the year as the youngest No. 1 in the history of the men’s tennis having triumphed at the US Open, and in the women’s game, Iga Swiatek, who rose to No. 1 in the world following Ashleigh Barty’s decision to retire after winning the Australian Open, looks set to dominate for years to come.\n\nThis year, the 21-year-old Swiatek won her second grand slam title at the French Open – which came in the middle of a 37-match winning streak – and her third at the US Open.\n\nIn Formula One, Max Verstappen has cemented his position as the best driver in the sport, comfortably defending his world title with four races to spare, while Erling Haaland, regarded as one of the best strikers in European football, has been scoring goals at a record-breaking rate during his first season at Manchester City.\n\nThere was no stopping Max Verstappen this year. Dan Istitene/Formula 1 via Getty Images\n\nAt the Winter Olympics in Beijing, then-18-year-old freestyle skier Eileen Gu stole the headlines, winning two gold medals and a silver for the host nation; she also became the first freestyle skier to earn three medals at a single Olympics.\n\nAnother teenager, figure skater Kamila Valieva, had a memorable Games for different reasons. The 16-year-old tested positive for trimetazidine, a heart medication, in December 2021, but the result didn’t come to light until Valieva was already in Beijing and had won gold in the figure skating team event.\n\nIn that competition, she became the first woman to land a quadruple jump – which involves four spins in the air – at the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe outcome from the positive test remains unresolved, and in November, the World Anti-Doping Agency referred Valieva’s case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport after deeming the Russian Anti-Doping Agency had made no progress.\n\nEileen Gu performs a trick during the women's freestyle freeski halfpipe final at the Beijing Winter Olympics in February. Lars Baron/Getty Images\n\nDefending Ukraine\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has cast a shadow over much of this year’s sporting calendar.\n\nAthletes and teams from Russia and Belarus were banned from competitions across various sports, including qualification games for this year’s World Cup and participation at Wimbledon.\n\nThe decision from Wimbledon was perhaps the strongest stance taken by a sports organization, resulting in the ATP and WTA Tours removing ranking points from this year’s tournament.\n\nAt the start of the war, many Ukrainian athletes – like skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych and MMA fighter Yaroslav Amosov – opted to put their careers on hold and support the country’s military efforts.\n\nBoxer Oleksandr Usyk has also spoken passionately about serving his country, and in the ring has extended his undefeated record, beating Anthony Joshua in August to retain his WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, and IBO heavyweight titles.\n\nOleksandr Usyk lands a punch on Anthony Joshua during their \"Rage on the Red Sea\" heavyweight title fight at King Abdullah Sports City Arena in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nThroughout 2022, sport and geopolitics have been closely entwined. This month, WNBA star Brittney Griner returned home to the US having been detained in Russia for nearly 10 months on drug smuggling charges.\n\nDespite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil that was found in her luggage, Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in the Mordovia republic in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\nThe 32-year-old’s arrest in Russia sparked diplomatic drama between the US and the Kremlin which played out alongside Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nShe was released in a prisoner swap that involved Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. The exchange, however, did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan.\n\nBrittney Griner is seen getting off a plane in an undated photo posted to her Instagram. Miguel Negron/US Army South\n\nNew competitions in new regions\n\nPerhaps no sport has been as gripped by internal politics this year as much as golf, which was rocked by the launch of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf series in June.\n\nLIV Golf has been criticized by some of the game’s leading players – including Woods and Rory McIlroy – while others – major champions Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson – have abandoned the PGA Tour in favor of the lucrative, breakaway series.\n\nIt has left the sport divided. Earlier this year, LIV Golf joined an antitrust lawsuit alongside some of its players, alleging that the PGA Tour threatened to place lifetime bans on players who participate in the LIV Golf series.\n\nThe suit also alleges that the PGA Tour has threatened sponsors, vendors, and agents to coerce players into abandoning opportunities to play in LIV Golf events.\n\nThe PGA Tour filed a countersuit in late September, claiming “tortious interference with the Tour’s contracts with its members.”\n\nThe LIV Golf series is backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) – a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the man who a US intelligence report named as responsible for approving the operation that led to the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Bin Salman has denied involvement in Khashoggi’s murder.\n\nLIV Golf’s launch is part of Saudi Arabia’s wider ambition to host and invest in global sports events. This year, it staged the rematch between Usyk and Joshua and even won a bid to host the 2029 Asian Winter Games.\n\nBut unquestionably, the most prominent sporting event held in the Gulf region this year has been the World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe four-week-long tournament came to a thrilling conclusion on Sunday as Argentina lifted the trophy, bringing down the curtain on what FIFA president Gianni Infantino argued was the greatest World Cup of all time.\n\nThere were upsets, high-scoring games, and brilliant goals throughout – right up to Sunday’s showpiece when Messi reigned supreme and Kylian Mbappé scored a stunning hat-trick in a losing cause.\n\nThe match between Argentina and France at Qatar 2022 is being viewed as the greatest ever World Cup final. Buda Mendes/Getty Images\n\nIt was the first time a country in the Middle East had hosted the World Cup, and Qatar, which has a population of just three million people, invested billions of dollars in building seven new stadiums, as well as new hotels and expansions to the country’s airport, rail networks and highways.\n\nThe tournament was also fraught with controversy, particularly when it came to allegations surrounding the country’s poor human rights record and treatment of migrant workers.\n\nSince 2010, many migrant workers in Qatar have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation, and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nIn the face of such criticism, Qatar has maintained it is an open, tolerant country and has seen the World Cup as a vehicle to accelerate labor reforms.\n\nStadium tragedies\n\nElsewhere in international football, England won the Women’s European Championships for the first time in front of a record crowd on home soil, while Senegal claimed the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) title in February, also for the first time.\n\nOutside international competitions, Real Madrid won its 14th European crown by defeating Liverpool in the Champions League final – a game that was marred by security issues.\n\nReal Madrid defeated Liverpool in this year's Champions League final in Paris. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nThe match itself was delayed by more than 35 minutes after Liverpool fans struggled to enter the Stade de France and tear gas was used by French police towards supporters held in tightly packed areas.\n\nParis police chief Didier Lallement admitted in June that the chaos was “obviously a failure” and said he takes “full responsibility for police management” of the event.\n\nTragically, football has witnessed multiple serious stadium disasters this year. In October, more than 130 people were killed in a stampede in the Indonesian city of Malang – one of the world’s deadliest stadium disasters of all time.\n\nIndonesia’s President Joko Widodo later said the country would demolish and rebuild the stadium, vowing to “thoroughly transform” the sport in the football-mad nation.\n\nPlayers and officials from Arema Football Club gather to pray on the pitch for victims of the stampede at Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang.

Fans were left bewildered by the action on the pitch at the Lusail Stadium, but the “other” side of this World Cup, the off-field controversies, will remain a huge talking point.\n\nQatar spent $6.5bn on stadiums and facilities and $200bn on infrastructure in order to host the “unlikeliest World Cup ever”, said Andrew England in the FT. But ever since it was awarded the tournament by Fifa in 2010, “ceaseless questions” have been asked about the “morality” of the decision.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Most of all, though, there has been intense scrutiny of the deaths and injuries of migrant workers used for its World Cup mega-projects.\n\nInside the Lusail Stadium ahead of the trophy presentation (Image credit: Mike Starling)\n\nQatar is the big World Cup winner\n\nThe real winner of this World Cup is not Argentina, the “upstart” semi-finalists Morocco, the “otherworldly” French hat-trick hero Kylian Mbappé, or the “legendary” Messi, said Jules Boykoff and Dave Zirin in The Nation.\n\nThe champion is Qatar, “and they didn’t have to win a match”. The host nation looks to have successfully – “with the West’s full complicity” – engaged in “brazen sportswashing”, earning plaudits and envy from authoritarians the world over. Qatar “executed its sportswash brilliantly”, and “despots” – and those “aspiring to be such tyrants” – are “noticing the dividends the country is reaping”. Even sportswashing that costs more than $200bn “appears to be money well spent”.\n\nThis World Cup “has delivered” for Qatar, said Sam Wallace in The Telegraph. Representatives of the “most powerful states in the world” have attended this tournament – and the world “now knows Qatar exists”. This is what “Big Football” can do for a nation.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nQatar “isn’t alone in crafting this game plan” though, said Daniel Rouse on The Score. Its Gulf neighbours are also “trying to boost their respective images” through sports, and money “isn’t much of an obstacle” in a region where fossil fuels were discovered throughout the 20th century.\n\nAfter the Winter Olympics in Beijing and the World Cup in Qatar, “the Year of Sportswashing comes to an end”, said Scott Stinson in the Toronto Sun. The big question now is how long before Fifa does it again?\n\nSaudi Arabia is rumoured to be “leading a potential joint bid” for the 2030 World Cup and that particular kingdom “has not been subtle about splashing around its wealth on sporting ventures”. It’s “not hard to imagine” the Saudis deciding that they want a “gleaming new 80,000-seat stadium” in Riyadh to host a World Cup final and it’s not hard to imagine that Fifa, “which is no one’s idea of a model for ethical governance”, would at least be “receptive to the idea”.\n\nKylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi in action during the World Cup final (Image credit: Lionel Hahn/Getty Images)\n\n‘Two adopted sons’ star in a classic\n\nThere has “always been two World Cups” at Qatar 2022, said Barney Ronay in The Guardian. First, “the one Qatar built out of human wastage”, the one that has held “a mirror up not only to the depravity of big sport”, but to a global labour market that “drives migrant workers into lucrative near-captivity” – a system Qatar did not create, which it has “simply embodied with manic hypercompetence”. Then there is the “other World Cup”, the spectacle that brings “joy and drama”, and that “feeling of collectivism”. And which Messi’s brilliance has “elevated into one of the great sporting stories”.\n\nBilled as “Messi vs. Mbappé”, this was the “dream World Cup final” for Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, said Jesús Mata in Spanish newspaper Marca. The duo are team-mates at Paris Saint-Germain, a club that has been owned by Qatar Sports Investments since 2011.\n\nIn the final, which ended 3-3 after extra-time before Argentina’s 4-2 triumph on penalties, Messi scored two and Mbappé scored three in a match full of end-to-end action. As well as lifting the trophy for the first time in his career, while dressed in a traditional Arab robe, Messi was also awarded the golden ball for the tournament’s best player. Mbappé, already a World Cup winner in 2018 with France, took home the golden boot for top goalscorer after his eight at Qatar 2022. It was a small consolation for scoring the first World Cup final hat-trick since Geoff Hurst’s for England in 1966.\n\nSo, “it turns out you can buy football history”, said James Olley on ESPN. With the “two adopted sons” of Qatari-owned PSG at the “epicentre of a pulsating, breathless 120 minutes”, it really could not have been “scripted more perfectly” for the host nation.", "authors": ["Mike Starling", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/football/cristiano-ronaldo-portugal-ghana-world-cup-preview-spt-intl", "title": "Cristiano Ronaldo begins World Cup campaign with Portugal after ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTwo days after his turbulent departure from Manchester United, Cristiano Ronaldo will begin his World Cup campaign with Portugal and look to put events from the last week-and-a-half behind him.\n\nPortugal faces Ghana at Stadium 974 on Thursday, kicking off what will likely be the 37-year-old Ronaldo’s final World Cup – a trophy that has so far eluded him over the course of his decorated career.\n\nA successful tournament in Qatar would also allow Ronaldo to move on from his messy divorce with United having ended his second spell at the club on Tuesday.\n\nIt came after the forward gave an explosive interview to Talk TV in which he said he felt betrayed by United and launched a scathing attack on manager Erik ten Hag.\n\nAnd as the World Cup gets underway, Ronaldo has offered assurances that the focus of his Portuguese teammates won’t be shaken by the timing of his bombshell interview.\n\n“In my life, the best timing is always my timing,” he told reporters on Monday. “I don’t have to think about what other people think. I speak when I want. The players know me really well for many years and know the type of person I am.”\n\nFollowing the announcement of his departure from Manchester United, Ronaldo was suspended for two games and fined £50,000 (around $60,000) by the English Football Association (FA) for slapping a cell phone out of a spectator’s hand earlier this year.\n\nThe incident came after United’s 1-0 loss against April in Everton.

Liverpool forward Darwin Núñez will also feature in the attack, while midfielders Rodrigo Bentancur and Federico Valverde have been in excellent form of late.\n\nThe positive news for South Korea is that star player Son Heung-Min has recovered from a damaged eye socket and has been training in a protective face mask this week.\n\nBrazil takes on Serbia\n\nIn Thursday’s other games, pre-tournament favorite Brazil and Serbia will be the last two teams to get their tournaments underway when they meet at Lusail Stadium.\n\nFive-time champion Brazil arguably boasts the best attacking line-up in the tournament, both in terms of quality and depth.\n\nNeymar Jr – like fellow talismans Ronaldo and Lionel Messi – is searching for his first World Cup trophy, and he will be ably supported upfront alongside Real Madrid’s Vinicius Jr., Barcelona’s Raphinha, and Tottenham’s Richarlison.\n\nNeymar (center) trains with Brazil in Doha, Qatar ahead of the World Cup.

Students at Arcadia University, however, can do just that thanks to First Year Study Abroad Experience (FYSAE) — a program that allows freshmen to study abroad in London, England or Scotland for the fall or spring semester of their first year.\n\nAccording to Jan Finn, the associate dean for International affairs at Arcadia University, about 90-100, first-year students spend semesters abroad each year. This means that, to date, Arcadia has sent about 900 freshmen from a variety of majors to London, England, Scotland and Ireland - a previous FYSAE site.\n\nFinn says, “FYSAE offers students a jumpstart on their global education. It challenges them to think outside the box of their own culture and examine the world through multiple lenses in some of the most exciting, innovative academic programs for first year students.”\n\nSenior Arcadia student and FYSAE alumna Valerie Hackett agrees. She spent the spring semester of her freshman year in London and says the experience made her more globally-aware.\n\n“I realized there is so much I don’t know about the world,” says Hackett.\n\nSenior Evan Hathaway also feels that his semester in Stirling, Scotland during the fall of his freshman year expanded his worldview.\n\n“I became a more independent, cultured and globally-minded person. This experience also gave me a more interesting perspective on the culture of the United States, seeing the nuances of our society from a different angle,” says Hathaway.\n\n\n\nRELATED: 4 essential things to do during your first week of study abroad\n\nWhile spending a semester abroad during your freshman year may seem intimidating, students usually adjust well to their new environments.\n\n“For me it was very easy to adjust,” says junior Chrissy Patton,who spent the spring semester of her freshman year in Scotland. “It is hard to feel [homesick] when you’re having such a fun time and seeing beautiful places.”\n\n“For me, it was an easy adjustment. There were infrequent awkward social interactions from time to time at the beginning,” Hathaway says. “These were few and far between though and adapting was easy for me. I made a good group of Scottish friends right away to help me through this process.”\n\nMost students also adjust well to the American university environment when they return home from abroad.\n\n“Going back to school the following fall semester was nice, because I had made friends the fall before I left, as well as on FYSAE, so I had a solid group of friends to go back to school to,” says Hackett.\n\nIn fact, many FYSAE students even return to Arcadia as campus leaders.\n\n“Our FYSAE students return to become mentors for new international students, and leaders for campus clubs, academic organizations [and] honor societies,” says Finn.\n\nFor most students, FYSAE usually acts as the first of many experiences abroad.\n\n“My first study abroad experience created an itch for travel that was hard to get rid of,” says Hathaway.\n\n\n\nRELATED: 5 tips to make the most out of your study abroad experience\n\nHathaway completed three different programs in Spain and one in Nicaragua after FYSAE, while Hackett traveled to Costa Rica with a Global Field Study course. Patton is currently spending her entire junior year abroad in Denmark.\n\nOverall, Finn says that FYSAE students are “globally-aware, intellectually-curious, independently-minded, culturally-sensitive [and] self-starters.”\n\nShe also says that the most common reaction she hears from students after FYSAE is, “It was a life-changing experience.”\n\nWant to learn more about the FYSAE program?

It's a bustling port city, a nerve center of power and commerce. It's also a place of economic and political unrest, in the aftermath of a deadly plague that has struck three continents. Part of the country is under the control of a foreign power and a ruler who might speak English or French. But not Irish, which is what you speak, as do most of the people you know.\n\nIn the midst of all this, you're accused of murder. Who's going to judge the evidence?

The primary sources he introduced in class drew me into Irish history. He became my mentor and he guided my (master's) thesis on early Irish literature and mythology. I stayed with medieval Irish history when I decided to pursue my Ph.D. at UConn. Aidan is the main reason I landed in medieval Ireland.\n\nTell me about the premise of your book.\n\nIt explores what happens in social memory in the late medieval period. Literacy is more commonplace, and written records are more common. I looked specifically at the records of coroners, legal record, court records in British-controlled territories in Ireland in the 13th and 14th century.\n\nOne half is the story of coroners and what happened in the aftermath of someone's death, and the other half is capital punishment — how someone arrives at the conclusion of sending someone to the gallows. It's really different from how we do things today.\n\nThe belief was that they should know the people involved. The jurors relied on that knowledge to make their decisions.\n\nSo that would be really different from today?\n\nToday, we separate the personal from justice. We have a jury of peers, but they are not personally connected to the people involved.\n\nHow did you become interested in writing a book on this topic?\n\nIt came out of my dissertation research. I earned my Ph.D. from UConn. I was interested in medieval death, because it is so different from the way we deal with death today. There was a familiarity with death we distance ourselves from now. I was looking specifically at what was happening in Ireland around death. They were using social and cultural memories in interesting ways.\n\nThen, I spent a couple years working on the dissertation, which ultimately becomes the book.\n\nWere there stories that made an impression on you?\n\nOh, yes. The one I think was the most interesting was a monk of St. Mary's Abbey in Dublin. He was highly respected. He was very pious. But, he got sick and he went mad, he ultimately lost his mind. One day, as the monks were getting up in the early morning for vespers, the first round of prayer, he snuck into the choir and he had a knife. He rushed at them, and he killed two of them. And that part I left out: He was naked. He tore his clothes, and he killed them.\n\nYou don't often get that kind of detail, so that really stands out. So, he was caught, captured, and thrown into the jail in Dublin Castle. The abbot came and claimed him and said, \"Can we please hold him in our prison?\" The jailer released him from Dublin Castle. He spent the rest of his days in chains at St. Mary's Abbey. They had their own prison.\n\nThese days, you don't normally think of abbeys having their own prison.\n\nYes, and they had their own courts.\n\nDoes British control play a big part?\n\nYes, that's the colonial dimension that distinguished it from what was happening in England at the time. You have a hybrid law from local lords that employed common law when it suited them, but also Gaelic law when it suited them. Colonial law really plays a part. If a victim of homicide was Irish, the consequences to the felon were much less than if the victim was English.\n\nDid you spend time in Ireland doing research?\n\nI was really lucky in that a lot of my sources were published online. In the age of Google, it's easier to find published sources. Now, I did spend time in Ireland researching the Dublin City Archives. One was called the Dublin Chain Book. The other is called the White Book of Dublin ... just being able to hold those manuscripts was an amazing experience.\n\nDid you visit any of the places you mention, such as St. Mary's Abbey?\n\nSt. Mary's doesn't exist anymore, but I visited as much of medieval Dublin as I could that still exists. St. Michan's Church has a crypt. It's very cool.\n\nYou mentioned the rich supernatural culture of Ireland. What was it like to be in those places?\n\nI don't know if that came into play so much ... but the supernatural is always present in the medieval period. You were always continuously reminded of death. They lived their lives so they would have a good death and a short period in purgatory. If you were richer, you could have elaborate monuments, and that would remind people to pray for you.\n\nDoes any of your research involve the Black Death (a pandemic that struck Europe, Asia and North Africa in the mid-1300s)?\n\nYes, it does. It's the aftermath of the Black Death period. There weren't many surviving records in the Black Death period in Ireland, so we rely a lot on what happened in England. We have a lot of upheaval. You have famine. You have Irish lordships, uprising against English rule.\n\nDid you come away with a different sense about death and dying?\n\nHow justice was carried, and not having an impartial jury. The people, the jurors controlled the story, and it's all about who controlled the story. It's all about people who worked alongside the people (involved) in the crime. They were the most trusted sources for jurors' decisions. These people were empowered. They had control over the narratives, and they informed the justices about what was happening. You could see them use social memory and social advantage.\n\nSo, it was literally a two-edged sword. We often think of, say, the Salem Witch Trials, when conflicts between neighbors might influence the outcome. But someone could say, \"I know that person, and I know for a fact he wasn't there.\"\n\nYes. They had to decide if someone would die or not, so to be faced with that decision is fairly horrifying. It was their neighbors they were making these decisions about, trying to imagine the emotions if they thought someone in their social networks was facing the gallows.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/09/health/sleep-history-wellness-scn", "title": "How our ancestors used to sleep can help the sleep-deprived today ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nLike many people, historian A. Roger Ekirch thought that sleep was a biological constant – that eight hours of rest a night never really varied over time and place.\n\nBut while researching nocturnal life in preindustrial Europe and America, he discovered the first evidence that many humans used to sleep in segments – a first sleep and second sleep with a break of a few hours in between to have sex, pray, eat, chat and take medicine.\n\n“Here was a pattern of sleep unknown to the modern world,” said Ekirch, a university distinguished professor in the department of history at Virginia Tech.\n\nEkirch’s subsequent book, “At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past,” unearthed more than 500 references to what’s since been termed biphasic sleep. Ekirch has now found more than 2,000 references in a dozen languages and going back in time as far as ancient Greece. His 2004 book will be republished in April.\n\nThe practice of sleeping through the whole night didn’t really take hold until just a few hundred years ago, his work suggested. It only evolved thanks to the spread of electric lighting and the Industrial Revolution, with its capitalist belief that sleep was a waste of time that could be better spent working.\n\nThe history of sleep not only reveals fascinating details about everyday life in the past, but the work of Ekirch, and other historians and anthropologists, is helping sleep scientists gain fresh perspective on what constitutes a good night’s sleep. It also offers new ways to cope with and think about sleep problems.\n\nThere is value in knowing about this prior pattern of sleep in the Western world, said Ekirch. He’s convinced “a large number of people who today suffer from middle-of-the-night insomnia, the primary sleep disorder in the United States – and I dare say in most industrialized countries – rather than experiencing a quote unquote, disorder, are in fact, experiencing a very powerful remnant, or echo of this earlier pattern of sleep,” said Ekirch, who stressed he was speaking from a historical perspective and not as a medical doctor.\n\nAdults need more than seven hours of sleep a night, but more than a third of American adults are not getting enough sleep on a regular basis, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA panel from a medieval stained glass church window depicts a married couple sleeping. TonyBaggett/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nMyth of 8-hour sleep?\n\nThe first reference to biphasic sleep Ekirch found was in a 1697 legal document from a traveling “Assizes” court buried in a London record office. The deposition of a 9-year-old girl called Jane Rowth mentioned that her mother awoke after her “first sleep” to go out. The mother was later found dead.\n\n“I had never heard the expression, and it was expressed in such a way that it seemed perfectly normal,” he said. “I then began to come across subsequent references in these legal depositions but also in other sources.”\n\nThese are notes made by historian A. Roger Ekirch when he came across the first reference to segmented sleep in a London archive office. University Distinguished Professor of History at Virginia Tech\n\nEkirch subsequently found multiple references to a “first” and “second” sleep in diaries, medical texts, works of literature and prayer books. A doctor’s manual from 16th century France advised couples that the best time to conceive was not at the end of a long day but “after the first sleep,” when “they have more enjoyment” and “do it better.”\n\nBy the early 19th century, however, the first sleep had begun to expand at the expense of the second sleep, Ekirch found, and the intervening period of wakefulness. By the end of the century, the second sleep was little more than turning over in one’s bed for an extra 10 minutes of snoozing.\n\nBen Reiss, author of “Wild Nights: How Taming Sleep Created Our Restless World” and professor and chair of the English department at Emory University in Atlanta, blames the Industrial Revolution and the “sleep is for wimps” attitude it engendered.\n\n“The answer is really to follow the money. Changes in economic organization, when it became more efficient to routinize work and have large numbers of people showing up on factory floors, at the same time and doing as much work in as concentrated fashion as possible,” Reiss said.\n\nOur sleep schedule got squeezed and consolidated as a result, Reiss said.\n\nThe image shows a lamplighter up a ladder. British streets were lit by oil lamps until the introduction of gas lighting around 1807. SSPL/Getty Images\n\nNo golden age\n\nHowever, preindustrial life was no halcyon era when our ancestors went about their day well rested and rejuvenated, untroubled by insomnia or other sleep problems, effortlessly in sync with the cycle of night and day, weather patterns and seasons, according to Sasha Handley, a professor of history at The University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. She studies how families optimized their sleep in Britain, Ireland and England’s American colonies between 1500 and 1750.\n\n“Every discussion of sleep history seemed to center around the sort of watershed moment of industrialization, the coming of electricity ruining everybody’s sleep lives. The corollary of that is that anything preindustrial was imagined as this golden age of sleep.”\n\nA 15th century miniature of a room is shown. NSA Digital Archive/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nHandley said her research suggested, just like today, sleep was linked to physical and mental health and was a topic that people worried about and obsessed over.\n\nDoctor’s manuals from the time are full of advice on how many hours to sleep and in what kind of posture, she said. The reference guides also list hundreds of sleep recipes to aid a good night’s sleep, she said. These include the bizarre – cutting a pigeon in half and sticking each half to each side of your head and the more familiar – bathing in camomile-infused water and using lavender. People also burned specific types of wood in their bed chambers that were thought to aid sleep.\n\n“For our period, sleep is very strongly linked to digestion, emotion, stomach, and therefore to people’s diets,” Handley said.\n\nDoctors advised sleepers to rest first on the right side of their body before turning to the left side during the second half of the night. Resting on the right, perhaps during the first sleep, was thought to allow food to reach the pit of the stomach, where it was digested. Turning to the left, cooler side, released vapors and spread the heat evenly through the body.\n\nIt’s thought this habit could be the origin of the phrase about getting out of bed on the wrong side.\n\nThis is a woodblock print of a fisherman dreaming, circa 1700, Japan. The artist is unknown. Heritage Images/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nNot all scholars believe that sleeping in two shifts, while perhaps common in some communities, was once a universal habit. Far from it, said Brigitte Steger, a senior lecturer in Japanese studies at the University of Cambridge in the UK, who didn’t uncover any references to segmented sleep in her work on sleep habits in Japan.\n\n“There is no such thing as natural sleep. Sleep has always been cultural, social and ideological,” said Steger, who is working on a series of six books about the cultural history of sleep.\n\n“There is not such a clear-cut difference between premodern (or pre-industrial) and modern sleep habits,” she said via email. “And sleep habits throughout pre-industrial times and throughout the world have always changed. And, of course, there has always been social diversity, and sleep habits have been very different at court than for peasants, for instance.”\n\nSimilarly, Gerrit Verhoeven, an assistant professor in cultural heritage and history at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, said his study of criminal court records from 18th century Antwerp suggested that sleep habits weren’t so different to our own today. Seven hours of sleep was the norm and there was no mention of first or second sleep.\n\n“As a historian I’m concerned that arguments about alleged sleeping patterns in the past – prolonged, by-phasic and with napping during the day – are sometimes presented as a possible remedy for our modern sleeping disorders. Before drawing such conclusions, we have to do much more research about these early modern sleeping patterns,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Try this routine before sleep to get a good night of rest 07:23 - Source: CNN Try this routine before sleep to get a good night of rest 07:23\n\nRethinking insomnia\n\nRussell Foster, a professor of circadian neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said Ekirch’s findings on biphasic sleep, while not without controversy, had informed his work as a sleep scientist.\n\nExperiments in sleep labs had shown that when humans are given the opportunity to sleep longer, he said, their sleep can become biphasic or even polyphasic, replicating what Ekirch found in historical records. However, Foster, who is also the director of the Sir Jules Thorn Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford, doubted that it was a sleep pattern that would happen for everybody.\n\nNobody should impose a regime of segmented sleep on themselves, particularly if it resulted in a reduction of total sleep time, he added.\n\nWhat was clear, Foster said, was that interrupted sleep was perceived as less of a problem in the past and that modern expectations about what constitutes a good night’s sleep – sleeping through the night for eight hours – weren’t always helpful.\n\nHe said a key point was waking at night need not mean the end of sleep. One example he cited was more people waking up at night during lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“They’ll get terribly anxious and worried about waking up in the middle of night, because that’s not what they normally experience,” said Foster, who is also the author of “Life Time: The New Science of the Body Clock, and How It Can Revolutionize Your Sleep and Health,” which will be published in May 2022. More likely, what had happened was that people’s sleep episode – how much time they have available for sleep – had expanded and wasn’t constricted by an alarm clock going off.\n\n“It’s a throwback to a time when we genuinely got more sleep,” he said.\n\nIf we wake up at night, sleep is likely to return, if sleep is not sacrificed to social media or other behavior that makes you more alert or activates a stress response, Foster’s research has suggested. Like most sleep experts, he recommended getting out of bed if you’re getting frustrated by the failure to fall back to sleep and engaging in a relaxing activity while keeping the lights low.\n\n“Individual sleep across humans is so variable. One size doesn’t fit all. You shouldn’t worry about the sort of sleep that you get,” he said.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2016/03/12/easter-rising/81451082/", "title": "Discovering an Irish rebel 100 years after the Easter Rising", "text": "John Wisely\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nIrish from around the world will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising.\n\nArchives from Ireland's revolutionary period offer a window into the past.\n\nIt was just before dawn on the morning of her 20th birthday when she heard the gunshots.\n\nThey were not random. They were precisely aimed and rang in unison. They came from a firing squad that was executing Tom Clarke, a man she knew and admired.\n\nIt was May 3, 1916. Clarke had been the first man to sign the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, Ireland’s equivalent of the Declaration of Independence. The Easter Rising he spearheaded was put down with overwhelming British force.\n\nThe rebels who launched it were locked inside Kilmainham Gaol, an 18th-Century stone fortress in the center of the Irish capital.\n\nThe rebellion's leaders were executed inside the high walls of the Stonebreakers' Yard.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThat young woman who left her teenage years in a jail cell and awoke to the sound of her comrades being executed was my grandmother, May Wisely.\n\nMay Wisely was an Irish rebel; a real life, gun-toting, overthrow-the-government kind of rebel. The kind of rebel people sing songs about this time of year. She was actively involved in the creation of modern Ireland.\n\nAs St. Patrick’s Day arrives this week, we’ll certainly celebrate her, but the bigger celebration comes later this month. The Irish government will mark the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising, the beginning of a bloody struggle to birth a new, independent nation, now called the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAncestry.com: Trace your Irish heritage for free\n\nDublin is preparing to welcome descendants from around the world, including 16 members of the Detroit branch of the Wisely family. We'll travel with our parents to dad’s hometown of Dublin to witness the ceremonies and learn a little more about where we come from and who we are.\n\nGrandmother we never knew\n\nMay Wisely is the grandmother my siblings and I never knew. We never felt her embrace or heard her voice. We can count the family photos of her on one hand.\n\nMy dad, whose name I share, can recount the stories that she told him. But even his memories of her were cut short. He was just 14 when she died. Yet almost 70 years after her death, we continue to learn new things about her.\n\nTo prepare for the anniversary, the Irish government has been posting online archival material from the 1916 era, including records of our grandmother.\n\nA research project in Dublin created a book titled “We Were There, 77 Women of the Easter Rising\" about those who were jailed in 1916. Grandma’s in there, too. Historians of that era have mostly neglected the contributions of women, and the project is an effort to offer a fuller account of their contributions.\n\nTaken together, along with the records of her brothers, and others who served with her, our family has begun to know a woman who was willing to die for a cause she believed in, an independent Ireland.\n\nCommitted fighters\n\nHer maiden name was May Moore, though it often appears as O'Moore. She served in a group known as Cumann na mBan, Gaelic for “League of Women.” Her branch was based in Fairview, the northeast Dublin suburb where she lived. Her group performed mostly First Aid functions and ambulance driving, but these women were committed fighters as well.\n\nMy dad remembers a story his mother told him about catching a spy in the weeks leading up to the Rising.\n\nA group of rebel leaders was meeting near Dublin and feared being raided by police. My grandmother was standing watch outside when she spotted a man approach the door and crouch outside, taking notes on what was being said.\n\n“She crept up on him and pointed her revolver at his head,” my dad remembers her saying. “She marched him into the meeting and turned him over to the leaders, saying ‘You can tell them all what you were doing.’ ”\n\nThe story ended there so dad never learned what happened to that man.\n\nAs the Rising approached, Grandma was preparing for a fight that was likely to be bloody.\n\n“I was making field dressings in Tom Clarke’s house,” she said years later. “I think a couple of nights a week I went down there.”\n\nHer description of her activities appears in a transcript of an interview she conducted on July 1, 1937 with a military pension board. By then, it was the middle of the Great Depression with thousands of Irish men and women seeking pensions. The board was scrutinizing every claim trying to determine who really fought.\n\nThe transcript, and other documents supporting her pension claim, were stored in a military archive for almost 80 years before the Irish government posted electronic copies online. When my dad learned they were available, he asked me to find hers.\n\nAs a newspaper reporter, I've always prized original documents for background research on the people I write about. But it was breathtaking to find such detailed records on my Grandma.\n\nIn addition to the transcript, the file included reference letters vouching for her service. The rebels didn't keep a lot of written records, which could be seized by the government they were attempting to overthrow.\n\nOne letter described her \"reliable and steadfast, and a most enthusiastic worker, both prior and subsequent to the Rising.”\n\nThe file also included letters she wrote, in her own hand, pleading her case. My dad instantly recognized her handwriting and he cried as he read it. Together we learned things about her that even dad didn't know.\n\nThe Rising was set for Easter Sunday, 1916.\n\nWith British troops bogged down fighting World War I in France, the Irish figured the time was ripe to break free of the British Empire once and for all.\n\nA mix up in orders delayed the attack but on Easter Monday, armed rebels stormed a series of buildings across Dublin and proclaimed a provisional government of the Irish Republic. The proclamation, which echoed in many ways the American Declaration of Independence, began with a battle cry.\n\n\"In the name of God and of the dead generations from which she receives her old tradition of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons her children to her flag and strikes for her freedom,” the proclamation began. It went on to promise women’s suffrage, equality of opportunity and an end to religious discrimination.\n\nThe rebels raised an Irish tricolour flag atop Dublin's General Post Office, which became the headquarters of a rebellion.\n\nMy Grandma was headed there that morning but when the streets were blocked with fighting she ended up with a different group in a city park known as St. Stephen’s Green.\n\n“I was serving out food and munitions to the men,” she later told the pension board.\n\nShe wrote that she delivered hand grenades to outposts in the green, provided First Aid to the wounded and delivered food and munitions, under fire, to soldiers. When the fighting intensified, her garrison retreated into the Royal College of Surgeons, a medical school across the street.\n\nLater in the week, the Royal Navy began shelling Dublin from the River Liffey. The rebels were overmatched and, eventually, overwhelmed. Six days after the Rising began, it ended in unconditional surrender. The rebels, including Grandma, were marched to Kilmainham, where a century of previous Irish rebels had been imprisoned.\n\nDublin, the second city of the British Empire, lay in smoldering ruins.\n\nI've tried to imagine the scene of my Grandma on her 20th birthday, locked inside a prison cell, hearing gunshots and knowing who was on the receiving end of them.\n\nDid she regret her idealism, her courage, her hopes?\n\nOne hundred years later, the moral question remains: In a historic grievance between peoples, at what point is violence justified? Grandma, and other citizen soldiers of the Rising, concluded their cause was just.\n\nThe executions were supposed to crush, once and for all, the rebel spirit, but they ended up having the opposite effect. Much of the world was outraged at their callousness and the spirit of Irish nationalism spread.\n\nRising's aftermath\n\nAfter the Rising, most of the surviving rebels, including Grandma's two brothers, Patrick and Sean, were deported to internment camps in Wales before eventually being released. Grandma, like most of the women prisoners, was released from Kilmainham after about 12 days.\n\nThe experience didn't appear to chasten her. She worked to re-establish her Fairview Branch of Cumman na mBan and began collecting donations to support the families of the fighters who were dead or deported.\n\nThe aftermath of the Rising led to a broader War of Independence and eventually a Civil War. By then she was married and continued her fight, noting that she \"obtained the use of my mother-in-law's house for men on the run and also storing arms and ammunition.\"\n\nMy father grew up in that house.\n\nThe war ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 that partitioned the island into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State. The partition remains today.\n\nThe pension file provides a view of Grandma that is spontaneous and unfiltered. Her manners were gracious, but she was full of fight.\n\n\"In my claim for pension, I have made no outlandish claims, merely stating a few facts,\" she wrote. \"I am now a married woman, with five boys and two girls and a husband out of work, so you may imagine what a godsend it would be to me to receive pension.\"\n\nIn April of 1938, she was approved for a pension of 20 pounds, 4 shillings and 9 pence per year. Converted to dollars and adjusted for inflation, it would be like getting about $136 per month today, as best as I can figure.\n\nMy dad remembers that it \"put food on the table,\" but Grandma accepted it under protest.\n\n\"All the years we worked for the cause and went into action, willing to give our all, and went to jail and came out to carry on the good work,\" she wrote. \"During all that time one thought of an award never entered our minds, but now that the country is in the position to give awards, I certainly think they ought to be given in a fairer and more generous spirit.\"\n\nThe lesson I take from Grandma's life is that there are, indeed, causes worth fighting for, and perhaps even dying for.\n\nShe died four days before Christmas 1946, at age 50. She received full military honors including a rifle volley. Dad remembers seeing her coffin draped in the tricolour flag of the nation she fought to create.\n\nShe's buried in her old neighborhood in a family plot that includes her brother, Sean, and his wife, Ame, both of whom fought in the Rising.\n\nMy dad is her youngest child and the last one still living. He immigrated to Detroit in 1954. He's returned to Ireland many times but this Easter, he is taking our mom, Joan; my four siblings; Kathleen, Kevin, Maryanne, Sheila, and me; plus seven grandchildren and some in-laws.\n\nMy parents even scored an invitation to a state celebration at Dublin Castle with the president of Ireland.\n\nOn March 31, our cousins from England and France will visit to help celebrate his 84th birthday in his hometown. He says it will be his last trip home and I asked him why he's doing it.\n\n\"I want you to know where you come from,\" he said.\n\nJohn Wisely is a Detroit Free Press reporter.\n\nContact him: 313-222-6825 or jwisely@freepress.com.

Community Development Director Mark Shipley and Assistant Director Bart Hose spearhead the committee. About a dozen members meet every four to six weeks to discuss and debate the direction the town will take with zoning and development.\n\nWith available open land in Farragut limited now, the committee looks at how to achieve smart growth for the long term, allowing commercial use while preserving quality of neighborhoods.\n\nResidents have been invited to participate in surveys and public meetings over the past year; a mid-March presentation provided examples of streetscapes, business use including building size and scale, and road design. Results from the group overwhelmingly showed a preference for small commercial use (no big-box stores) that would complement existing and new neighborhoods.\n\nMaking neighborhoods pedestrian and bike friendly with sidewalks and multi-use paths is another priority.\n\nTo that end, a new zoning district was developed and presented by Shipley’s department. “The Neighborhood/Convenience Commercial Zoning District was recommended for approval at the last planning commission meeting. It will go to BOMA in June. This district could help implement some of the land use concepts that were desired based on feedback we reviewed from the public workshop,” he said.\n\nPlanning for the town looks many years ahead; Shipley poses the question, “How would you envision Farragut in the next five, 10 or 20 years?” It’s a good question, as development and rezoning take time. Property owners have to come on board and topographical challenges have to be considered.\n\n“We have also to consider what people want to see in town,” said Alderman Ron Williams. And people want to see continued development of a town center at Kingston Pike and Campbell Station Road.\n\n“It’s underway right now with renovation of the Campbell Station Inn and construction at the new Farragut Gateway (old Silver Spoon location),” Williams said. A Starbucks with a drive-through and large patio will share space with a restaurant and other retail, according to Paul Schaffer, one of the developers of the project.\n\nResidents have been frustrated by the vacant buildings at the old Kroger and Ingles properties, but have to realize that the town can’t compel the owners and lessees to redevelop them. The good news is the town has been in talks with them about plans and both sites may see progress soon.\n\nNORTH\n\nJoshua and Sarah Ivester: pay it forward\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News correspondent\n\nJoshua and Sarah Ivester live by a philosophy that informs every corner of their work and their lives. “We’ve always just gone after what we love and what’s going to help our relationships and families stay strong,” says Sarah. “And we know if we continue working for the people who care about us, caring for each other and caring for the community, we’ll be fine.”\n\nTogether five years, they’re raising their 3-year-old son, Wyatt, in a home full of creativity, where their livelihoods represent much more than “just work.”\n\nNative Knoxvillian Joshua met art school student Sarah in Savannah, Ga., while he was working for Habitat for Humanity. Their first two years together were spent in Sarah’s home state, Colorado. Looking for a fresh start after Wyatt’s birth, “we saw that Knoxville is growing,” says Sarah, “and we thought it would be a cool thing to be a part of.”\n\nJoshua and his dad, Mike, are licensed electricians; they are A1 Electrical Service. Sarah’s passion was and is coffee; she is the coffee specialist at Wild Love Bakery on Central Avenue. “There’s a work ethic in serving the community this way. Working in coffee I’ve gotten to know a lot of the regulars. I’ve seen their pregnancies and births of babies, engagements, relationships – I’ve also seen tragedy in their lives and then been that person that they first see in the morning. I give them a good cup of coffee and just kind of ‘be that hug’ for people when they need it.” She knows a lot about her product, too. “The Bolivian coffees are just killing it this year.”\n\nMeanwhile, in addition to electrical work, Joshua fell into the business of scouting for and refurbishing furniture from the mid-20th century. He’s now a partner with Mid Mod Collective; his workshop adjoins the retail space.\n\n“You know, mid-century modern is often imitated,” he says. “But with these designers you have real craftsmanship. I don’t take that for granted.” He doesn’t take any shortcuts either, carefully selecting the products and the methods that best serve each piece. “There’s a right way and a wrong way to do this,” he says. “I want these pieces to last another 60 years.” His favorite moments are when a customer “might not even know that I’ve refurbished something, but they spot it and they just light up.”\n\nFollowing one’s passion, supporting each others’ successes and giving back – the Happy Holler business community is rife with this philosophy. “Keep paying it forward,” says Sarah, “and it pays you back.”\n\nGIBBS\n\nGibbs JROTC builds its own challenging course\n\nAli James, Shopper News correspondent\n\n“One of our students, Jordan Bishop, approached me last fall as he needed to earn an Eagle Scout badge,” said First Sgt. Kirk Tower of Gibbs High JROTC Eagle Battalion. “I said I have this wild idea to put in an obstacle course.”\n\nUltimately, Bishop’s Eagle Scout troop and the JROTC members plan to install eight or nine obstacles — some in front of the entrance to the quarter-mile nature trail and others in the woods beyond the outdoor classroom on the Gibbs High campus.\n\nConstruction has been slow. First, the students found it challenging to translate the Army drawings of the various obstacles. “The course was based off regular Army courses,” said Tower. “For safety reasons we followed their design.”\n\nThe students started working with the plans last fall, then submitted them to Knox County Schools for approval. “They had to create a bill of materials and get costings to be approved before they could start,” said Tower.\n\n“We have used volunteer labor, cash and materials donations, so the cost has been minimal,” said Tower. “Everything, the wood, the hardware, has been donated from businesses such as Home Depot, Lowe's and Tindell’s.”\n\nThen since February, the weather has caused many of the workdays to be canceled.\n\n“Four obstacles are in progress,” said Tower. “Two of them are operational.”\n\nThe current obstacles are the “Belly Robber,” where the goal is to work the logs across the wooden frame; followed by the “Six Vaults,” where team members sprint to the obstacle, place their hands on it and throw the legs over. The other two in progress are the “High Step-Over” and the “Hip-Hip.”\n\n“We can eventually add a tire flip; the options are limitless,” said Tower.\n\nOnce they have made it through the four obstacles in phase one, they will take to the trail loop to conquer obstacles, such as an inclining wall, that will be built at a later date.\n\n“We are working with a school videographer to create a safety briefing,” said Tower. “Our goal is to allow other coaches, school, community and youth groups to use the course after they view the safety procedures.”\n\nCurrently, 79 students are enrolled in the JRTOC program and are in various grades. Some are taking Advanced Placement (AP) classes while others are in the Individualized Educational Program (IEP). “One thing that helps is giving these kids structure, but they often need to do something different every so often or they get bored.”\n\nThroughout it all, Tower said the development of leadership skills has really shone through. “The Eagle Scouts and Cadet leaders have guided the volunteers through the building process,” said Tower. “You can see their minds working.”\n\nTower hopes that by building the obstacle course they can attract more students to join the JROTC. “I was trained to always seek to improve things,” he said. “If adding this obstacle course improves our numbers, I’m all for it.”\n\nA ribbon cutting ceremony will be scheduled in the fall. The addition of signs recognizing the Eagle Scouts' work, the start and finish lines are in the works as well.\n\nUNION COUNTY\n\nBEARDEN\n\nArts and barbecue draw smiles at BMS\n\nJohn Shearer, Shopper News correspondent\n\nAs both a teacher and a parent, Mike Weininger has noticed that some special after-school events can be almost as stressful on the parents as on the students in the spotlight.\n\nThat might be due to having to eat supper quickly and rush to get to an event, trying to find a place to sit or park, or having to wait or sit longer than desired.\n\n“I’m restless and I have a hard time going to events after school,” he admitted. “I try to make events I’m involved with as casual and easy as possible. I put the parents first.”\n\nThat was the philosophy he tried to use while helping coordinate Bearden Middle School’s recent “Night of the Arts” event.\n\nAnd by all accounts, it did end up being more fun time than stress time.\n\n“The whole event was good all around,” said Weininger, an art teacher at the school. “People were smiling and were happy.”\n\nFor the first hour during the evening event on May 10, parents and others could casually look at students’ artwork in the Commons area in the middle of the school and enjoy Archer’s catered barbecue, chips and drinks.\n\nThey could also take comfort in the fact that 20 percent of the concession proceeds were going to the Second Harvest food bank, which helps with the backpack program to help feed students in need in Knox County.\n\nAnd while the palates were being satisfied, so were the auditory senses. That was due to some singing, including snippets from the recent musical “Into the Woods Jr.,” and music from some student jazz musicians on the upper mezzanine.\n\nIf the parents and other attendees weren’t relaxed enough by then, the school tried to further help by the second hour with a choral presentation in the auditorium led by musical director Scott Williams.\n\nDespite the casualness of the evening, though, it had been planned with much thought. Weininger said they tried to tie it in with their International Baccalaureate program, including by emphasizing personal and cultural expression.\n\nThis was shown in the use of the song “This Is Me,” from the recent movie “The Greatest Showman,” as well as art displays of face cups from Weininger’s art classes and face jugs from Jessie Winston’s students. Decorative masks were also displayed, and an interactive mural was used.\n\n“We encouraged kids to show us who they are in fun and engaging ways,” Weininger said.\n\nBEARDEN\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nTindal takes on tourism amid fiscal challenges\n\nMargie Hagen, Shopper News correspondent\n\nTourism coordinator Karen Tindal views her job through the lens of a tourist, asking herself, “What would entice me to come to Farragut? Where do I want to shop, dine, play and stay?” Answering those questions is her mission, and also the tag line for the Visit Farragut website she is helping the town develop; it will be launching soon.\n\nBuilding on the program originally envisioned in 2010, Tindal has been on the job since mid-February. Tasked with advancing priorities set by town staff, aldermen and public opinion, she is implementing the messaging and social media programs established prior to her hiring.\n\nA new “Just Visiting” link on the TOF website provides information on town-sponsored events throughout the year: Farragut Book Fest for Children, Bob Watt Fishing Rodeo, Lawn Chair Concert Series, Independence Day Parade, Halloween’s Freaky Friday and Light the Park are all free; bring the family.\n\nThe “New in Town” link is the go-to resource for new residents. A downloadable checklist lists emergency contacts, school information and utility services and more, making it easier to organize relocation details.\n\nOne of Tindal’s main projects now is gathering information promoting local businesses for the Visit Farragut website. Retail, restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues will able to highlight individual aspects of their establishments along with details about town-sponsored events and park activities. Using analytics from the website, she’ll be able to quantify results and determine where traffic comes from.\n\nThe tourism program and Tindal’s position have been a source of heated discussion since last September; Alderman Bob Markli was opposed to both, but was outvoted in prior votes. At issue were the part-time tourism position and the proposed hotel occupancy tax of 2.5 percent, earmarked to fund the program.\n\nThe ordinance to impose the tax failed on May 10 and in all likelihood is tabled until after the Aug. 2 election. The new board could revisit it then. So what does this mean for the tourism program and Tindal’s job?\n\nTown Administrator David Smoak gave this statement: “The tourism program was set to be funded in next year’s budget directly by revenues from the proposed tax.” Now that the money will not be available as expected, funding for the program will be limited and will take more time to implement.\n\nThat doesn’t discourage Tindal; “I’m marketing the town I love,” she said. A longtime resident, Tindal’s three children attended Farragut schools. She’s volunteered and directed many local events, saying, “I wanted to model community involvement for my kids. I didn’t take this commitment lightly. It’s a unique position for a unique town.”\n\nBringing businesses and the town together will mean spearheading a tourism advisory committee involving staff and officials, the Farragut Business Alliance, the Economic Development Committee and a variety of merchants, particularly the hotel owners. “It’s important to look at who the members will be and how we can all contribute,” Tindal said. “I’m looking forward to the challenge.”\n\nGIBBS\n\nTwo Gibbs players sign with colleges\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nGibbs High senior Zach Ellis signed to play baseball at Bluefield College in Bluefield, Va., next season.\n\nHe has been a member of the Eagles baseball team for one season, where he played centerfield and left field. Before coming to Gibbs, he was on the baseball team at Central High.\n\nEllis selected Bluefield College because it was a nice, quiet place where he felt he could get a lot of stuff done. He also liked the coaching staff for the baseball team. While at Bluefield he plans to study education. He wants to become a physical education teacher and a coach in the future.\n\nCoach Geff Davis called Ellis a \"stabilizing force in the outfield\" and commented that he contributed well at the plate for the Eagles. \"Zach does a great job running bases and owns the bat well.\"\n\nAttending the signing with Ellis were his mom, Brandy Ellis, his brothers Nicholas and Austin, his grandparents Ronald and Faye Ellis, friends and teammates.\n\nWill McSwain signed to play baseball at Roane State Community College next season. He liked that RSCC was close to home and feels that it will give him his best opportunity to advance. While in college he plans to study to be a physical therapist.\n\nHe is a utility catcher, infielder and outfielder for the Eagles. Davis said Will \"has had a great run at Gibbs\" and added that he is currently leading the team in hitting and was Offensive Player of the Year in the district this season.\n\nMcSwain said playing for Davis and the Eagles has prepared him to expect to win. He called his teammates a \"good group of guys that are always ready to play\" and said that he loved his time at Gibbs.\n\nAttending the signing with Ellis were his parents, John and Christina McSwain, and his grandfather Samuel Burchfield. His sisters Mary Claire and Morgan Grace were unable to attend, but he was surrounded by his teammates and friends at the event.\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nSOUTH\n\nItch, sting, hurt? Herbalist has healing solutions\n\nHeather Robinson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nIt's summertime and the bugs are biting! But never fear, a local herbalist has remedies for all that ails you this summer!\n\nStay Away Bug Spray will keep the pests away, and a nice glass of A Midsummer Night’s Tea will keep you hydrated with lemongrass and hibiscus.\n\n“It's tart, tasty, cooling, refreshing and high in electrolytes to keep you hydrated!” explains Big Bright Circle Botanicals owner Kat Itz of her summer tea.\n\nItz became interested in living a more balanced and healthy lifestyle after studying to become a Licensed Massage Therapist and yoga teacher. Those practices empowered her to discover as much as she could about her own health and well-being.\n\n“The more I uncovered about holistic health and well-being, the better I felt and the more I wanted to learn,” says Itz.\n\nIn 2012, Itz took a class at the University of Mexico to continue her education and further her knowledge about herbal medicine.\n\n“It was all about medicine-making methods, how to make tinctures and herbal infusions, salves, etc.” says Itz. “I loved how hands-on it was!”\n\nItz has also studied at a Denver herbalist school named Herbalism Roots, where she found herself delving deeper into physiology and body systems. She studied the healing properties of plants and learned more about how they related to human pathologies. There, she also learned how to be an ethical steward of the land while working with plants as medicine.\n\nAfter gaining so much useful knowledge, she launched her own line of products named Big Bright Circle Botanicals. The items she makes are 100 percent handcrafted herbal medicine and plant-based skin care that contain “no scary ingredients you can't pronounce”.\n\n“The name Big Bright Circle alludes to the many circles around us in nature, like the sun and moon, the center of a flower, the iris of an eye, but also the changing of seasons,” says Itz. “Really I could go on forever about circles!”\n\nIn addition to her teas and sprays mentioned previously, Itz offers items like her Skin Saving Salve, which is great for dry skin and scrapes, and her Oxymel products that include turmeric to combat a variety of issues.\n\n“It is excellent for so many diverse complaints, like a muscular strain or joint pain, lousy digestion, a sore throat, or just a pick me up if you're already feeling groovy and want to keep it that way!” says Itz.\n\nHer business takes the concept of being a steward of the land to heart. She works hard to stay in balance and wanted her business to reflect that commitment to the Earth and the role she plays interacting with it.\n\n“If you peel back a layer, though, Big Bright Circle is more than herbal medicine and holistic healing. It is a way for me to support the kind of community I want to be a part of, to share knowledge, give back, and also listen, learn, grow, to honor the many sources of inspiration,” says Itz.\n\nItz came to Knoxville almost two years ago and has found South Knoxville to be a welcoming community that has helped support her efforts of healing and balance through herbalism.\n\n“South Knox has embraced me,” says Itz. “I'm so happy to call it home! One of the main draws for me has always been the kind, supportive and collaborative folks in my community. I felt that especially at Vestival last weekend!”\n\nFor more information regarding services offered by Itz, visit www.bigbrightcircle.com or find Big Bright Circle on Facebook for regular updates.\n\nKARNS\n\nHALLS\n\nA game-changing fun run at Sterchi Elementary\n\nAli James, Shopper News correspondent\n\nSterchi Elementary school’s PTA decided to put a little twist on the usual fun run last year. When it was the fourth- and fifth-graders’ turn, they added color stations and a dance party at the end. It proved to be so popular that it has become one of the most eagerly anticipated school events for both students and teachers.\n\n“It is our second year,” said principal Lynn White. “The fourth- and fifth-graders really look forward to it. We kick it off with a pep rally on May 2. Then there are daily reminders to make pledges per lap.”\n\nBoosterthon Fun Run takes care of all of the details. The national fundraising program is used at more than 1,600 schools across the country and promotes fitness, leadership and character.\n\n“Every day there’s a character trait,” said Leslie Marmorstein, PTA president. “After the pep rally, they show documentary-style videos teaching students how to develop positive attributes. They talk about character traits, such as, trustworthiness, self-awareness, creativity, focus and it ends with a life learner.” As part of the interactive character program, the traits tie into the \"Castle Quest\" story about a character who will inherit a castle if he or she passes each character test.\n\nThere are three levels of Boosterthon events. Sterchi chose to have the Boosterthon team visit for the pep rally and set up and supervise the entire color run.\n\nAfter just nine days of fundraising, the booster culminated in a day of fun runs on the school field. Classes assembled in their homerooms before running through an inflatable tunnel. Once on the field, the organizers played the national anthem, talked about good character traits and got the crowd excited.\n\nTo start, the organizers led a pacer lap behind a checkered flag. Then as the students completed each lap, they passed through a group of volunteers, who added a check mark to the back of their race T-shirt.\n\nEvery few minutes there was an airhorn sound signaling the time to run past one of the four color stations. That was when teachers and volunteers threw colored powder over their white T-shirts.\n\nEvery student gets to participate in the fun, regardless of financial participation. Throughout the 30-minute run, students can skip, dance, walk and run to upbeat themed music. After the laps were completed, the dance party got started with a big cloud of colored powders covering the kids and adults alike.\n\n“It’s really a positive group of kids,” said Marmorstein. “This is my favorite event. It promotes leadership, fun, fitness and, of course, character.” With parent participation on the decline, contracting a full-service fundraising program made sense for the PTA. Families can gather pledges from people they know, students run the laps around the track that Boosterthon sets up and sponsors can easily pay their pledge online or by check.\n\nThis year’s fun run raised $7,000 for Sterchi Elementary School. Proceeds are earmarked to assist with both technology needs or to purchase items for the playground. If they meet their fundraising goal, the PTA also hopes to contribute to the Accelerated Reader program.\n\nGIBBS\n\nGibbs High Eagles of the Month for April\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nGibbs High School recently announced the students selected as April Eagles of the Month.\n\nSelections are made by staff members and are awarded for good grades, participation in the classroom and positive attitude. On occasion, the honor is given to a student who may have fallen on rough times but chose to work hard and make improvements in grades and attitude.\n\nRepresenting the senior class are Casey Atkins and Mason Robinson. Casey has been called \"a wonderful addition to any classroom\" and recognized for her hard work, helpfulness and sweet personality. Mason is known for being willing to help when needed with a smile on his face and positive attitude, regardless of the difficulty of the task.\n\nJunior class representatives are Zachary Bowlin and Randi Brown. Zachary is recognized for being prepared for class and going above and beyond as a student. Randi has been called a hard worker, always having her work done early and a joy to have in class.\n\nSelected from the sophomore class are Troy Davis and Sara Salmons. One of Troy's teachers said he is \"the kind of person whose positive attitude permeates through everything he does\" and said that Troy is a role model for other students. Sara is known for being prepared for class and having her work complete on time. She asks great questions in class and makes a wonderful addition to the classroom.\n\nNinth-grade students selected are Jaklyn Rutter and Zachary Sprague. Jaklyn is a creative student who always strives to do her best and is very conscious about making sure expectations from her teachers are met. One of Zachary's teachers said it simply, \"Zachary works hard every day in class.\"\n\nKNOXVILLE\n\nWUOT's Garrett McQueen is tapped by American Public Media\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News correspondent\n\nWe can say “we knew him when.”\n\nFans of WUOT-FM 91.9 have long known what a gifted announcer Garrett McQueen is. As host of The Afternoon Program, McQueen has shared musical insights from his own world as a professional bassoonist, and has introduced listeners to a variety of music by regional orchestras, people of color, women, and other composers and performers who aren’t heard very often in the classical music realm. And now he’s on his way to Saint Paul, Minn., as a hand-picked member of American Public Media (APM.)\n\nMcQueen didn’t set out to be a radio announcer. The Memphis native came to Knoxville in 2013 when he won the position of second bassoon in the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra. He says he’s loved his time here, and credits Knoxville and Knoxvillians with much of his developmental success as a musician and a person. But early on he was met with a less-than-welcoming sight: scores of Confederate flags at his very first outing with the orchestra, a Veterans Day Concert. “I didn’t even know that was a thing,” he says. That memory, coupled with a few unpleasant incidents in which he was harassed, informed his future programming at WUOT, and his subsequent rise in the public media world.\n\nA year and a half ago, he answered an ad for a sub at WUOT; soon, he was a regular. He says, “I felt it was important to expose my listeners, as much as possible, to ideas that weren’t being explored. One of the big things for me was the relationship between race and classical music.\n\n“You know, I don’t expect people to constantly think about the fact that I’m the only black musician in the KSO, but it’s something I think about. I think it’s important to show equity toward composers and genres of music that aren’t represented. I also love talking about the music of the 17th, 18th, 19th centuries – music that doesn’t necessarily have to do with race. But when I look at myself as a whole person I can’t not acknowledge those issues.”\n\nMcQueen’s programming and presence got him noticed.\n\nTodd Steed of WUOT submitted him for consideration as “a black talent in public media that you may not know, but should” to Current, a public media industry publication, and McQueen’s focus on inclusivity got him invitations to speak at the Sphinx Conference in Detroit and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. When he was invited to play with the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra last November, representatives from APM reached out.\n\nHe’ll be leaving in June to join them as host of the nationally syndicated public radio service “Classical 24.”\n\nHe’s already guest-hosted “Performance Today” for APM. He chose “music from the South” as his focus and featured the KSO in the nationally aired program. “A big thanks to Visit Knoxville for footing the bill to make that happen!” he says.\n\n“You know, when we talk about music, civil rights, women’s rights – anything – we’re so great at lauding long-dead people. And we forget that things are going on right now. Music is being written right now. And we need to pay attention to that. I’m proud to have brought that to WUOT.”\n\nBEARDEN\n\nKARNS\n\nAll Saints hosts 'The Good, the Bad, and the Holy'\n\nNancy Anderson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nIt was an evening of good food, good fun and good fellowship at Knoxville Catholic High School as nearly 400 guests gathered for the All Saints Catholic Church Annual Adult Social.\n\nThe Western themed event, “The Good, the Bad, and the Holy,” is an annual fundraiser with proceeds going to fund a variety of adult social gatherings held throughout the year.\n\nThe majority of guests attended wearing western wear with cowboy hats\n\nThe event featured a large silent auction with more than 230 items including a live bee hive with worker bees, a queen, and plenty of coaching for success.\n\nRay and Anita Muratore head a team of volunteers who took four months gathering the items.\n\n“We are very fortunate to have a very generous congregation,” said Anita. “Plus, we have a great deal of community support as well. It took us four months to make phone calls and follow up with people to gather all the items. There are 238 items and I don’t even know how much money is out there ... a lot.\n\n“There are a number of wonderful and unusual things to bid on including a golf outing with Father Michael, several trips, and a live bee hive which already has several bids.”\n\nItems not receiving a bid are donated to a number of charities including Catholic Charities of Knoxville, which helps individuals and families in need.\n\nThe Mount LeConte Jug Band from Spring City provided toe taping music. Their rendition of “The Tennessee Waltz” brought a crowd to the dance floor including Father Michael.\n\nEvent chair Chris Kite said the event is the one annual fundraiser held to underwrite an entire year’s worth of adult social gatherings.\n\n“We hold the event to fund our outings for the remainder of the year, but we fundraise so that everyone can attend. No one has to avoid coming to an event because they can’t afford it. Everyone is welcome. We have an ethnic night, this year it was Polish night, we have a Christmas party, a dance, just all kinds of things that gives us a chance to socialize with each other.\n\n“Our parish is like a very large family in part because of events like this where we can get together with people we see at church and get to know them better having a little fun.”\n\nWORDS OF FAITH\n\nGod's grace is bigger than our 'fails'\n\nTom Ogburn, Shopper News columnist\n\nWhen my family and I lived in Penang Island in Malaysia, one of the places we liked to visit was Fort Cornwallis. The old fort had its historical foundations in the late 1700s as a wooden stockade designed to help repel active pirates in the area. By the beginning of the 1800s, it had been converted to the permanent brick and stone structure that stands today.\n\nAt some level it is like a lot of island forts that dot the old British Empire. For my young son and daughter, it was grand place to play and imagine pirates of another era. Its parade grounds now play home to a huge swing set where my children loved to soar in the wind.\n\nWhat fascinated me was not the structure, but its name.\n\nThe fort was named for Gen. Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis. The name might not strike you at first, but think back on your American history. This fort was named for the same Gen. Cornwallis who surrendered to George Washington at Yorktown.\n\nIt was hard for me to believe that they would name a fort for a failed general, so I did some additional research. I discovered that Gen. Cornwallis had a marvelous military career prior to the American Revolution. That was why he was assigned the task to deal with the uprising. After his surrender to Washington he returned to England, but remained well regarded. In 1786 he was appointed Governor of India. He later served as Viceroy of Ireland. When you look back over the whole of his life, his defeat to the colonist was a small part of a distinguished career. That moment did not define his story.\n\nIn the Gospel, Peter found himself consumed by shame. Jesus had told Peter that he would deny him three times before the cock crowed on that night of pain. Peter protested, but now, as the cock crowed he had done it. He had denied Jesus and it seemed that there was no way to undo it.\n\nJohn 21 invites us to the seaside some days later. The disciples were back in their boats but had caught nothing. In a scene reminiscent of an early encounter with Jesus, the disciples heard a familiar voice telling them to cast their nets off the other side of the boat. When they came to shore, they shared a breakfast with Jesus. Then, Jesus did the unthinkable. In three questions, he restored Peter. Peter had been faithful before the denials and would now again lead the disciples. The denials would not define his story.\n\nSometimes it can seem like pain or sorrow or struggle will overcome us and define us for the rest of our lives. Grace is bigger than a moment, and our God is bigger than our failures. This moment or your current struggles do not have to define you. Through faith and grace, there can be more to your story.\n\nTom Ogburn is senior pastor at First Baptist Church in downtown Knoxville.

Gold Medal math facts.\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nThird-grade students at Mooreland Heights Elementary have spent this school year learning 0-12 multiplication facts (at a rate of 25 per minute) and they gathered May 11 at Charter Doyle Park to show off what they knew and to compete for the gold medal in the Gold Medal Math competition.\n\nThe park was set up to resemble an Olympic-style course, complete with torch and five colored rings hanging behind the winners podium. Students competed in events for which they qualified and had to master the math facts the quickest to win points. Games such as \"Dressed to the Nines\" and \"Doughnut Dash\" made the event a fun competition with students racing to the finish line feeling successful. The end game – where students had to remember random facts – proved to be tough, but each team covered their game board (45 squares) with the team's representative colored squares.\n\nThe results: Gold medal went to Team Resourceful; silver medal was awarded to Team Tenacious; the bronze medal went to Team Amicable and fourth-place honors were given to Team Steadfast. Each team was a true winner as they used teamwork to complete their goals.\n\nHALLS\n\nTwo lifeguards to be honored\n\nSarah Frazier, Shopper News\n\nHunter Woods and Joseph Shepperd, two Northside YMCA lifeguards who saved a heart attack victim recently, will be honored by the Red Cross.\n\nAccording to Ray Kitts, the Y's vice president of outreach, a man suffered a heart attack while working out on the treadmill. The two young men administered CPR and AED (Automatic External Defibrillator), working for about seven minutes before paramedics arrived, said Julie Walker, supervisor of lifeguards.\n\n\"Their training kicked in, and the paramedics who came said they saved his life,\" Kitts said. Kitts said he has been in touch with the victim's family, and he is \"doing well.\"\n\nWoods, a North Side Y lifeguard for six months, and Shepperd, a lifeguard for 11 months, are trained and certified by the Red Cross and do monthly in-service training to be \"prepared for any situation,\" Kitts said.\n\nWoods is a 2018 graduate of Halls High School, where he played football, and Shepperd is finishing his junior year at Powell High School.\n\nIn these days when some teenagers get a bad rap, it's good to see something like this, Kitts said. \"These two young men are really great, very humble, very dependable and very responsible.\"\n\nCARTER\n\nGIBBS\n\nGibbs Foundation stays busy enhancing school\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nThe Gibbs High School Foundation (GHSF), established in April 2016, has been busy for the past two years in an effort to \"build a better Gibbs.\"\n\nThe foundation was created to help support the administration and teachers as they prepare their students to become well-rounded and ready to go forth and serve.\n\nThe Brick Foundation Walk was the initial fundraising effort for the GHSF. The walk is at the front of the school and featured personalized bricks from Gibbs alumni and community members.\n\nA classroom set of (30) Chromebooks and a charging station were purchased for use by students in the library or may be checked out as a whole set by a teacher. Several of the feeder schools to Gibbs High (Holston Middle and Corryton Elementary) are technology schools, and the foundation thought it important to have the high school they feed into also have technology available for the classroom.\n\nFairview Baptist Church donated over $26,000 for lighting improvements and other needed items in the school auditorium. Guests visiting the auditorium will notice two recently installed large-screen televisions on the sides of the stage.\n\nBoard member Don Ogle and A.C.E. Electric donated and installed outdoor lighting at the school entrance to enhance safety during evening events. Donations from the community through the foundation's barbecue luncheon, County Commissioner Dave Wright and board member Gary Acuff allow the foundation to give back to the school when needs arise. Acuff's mother, Mabel Acuff, was a longtime teacher and guidance counselor at the school.\n\nIn addition to the enhancements, the foundation was able to donate to the choral department trip to New York, where they performed at Carnegie Hall; established three $500 teacher grants for next year; and provided teacher appreciation and student recognition activities during the year.\n\nThe foundation is working toward purchasing additional computers for the students to use; updating the library furniture; purchasing needed media center equipment such as computers and cameras; supplying equipment and desktops for the robotics class and upgrading auditorium seating.\n\nAnyone interested in supporting Gibbs High through the foundation may visit the website www.gibbshighfoundation.org; visit Facebook @ GibbsHighFoundation or email gibbshighfoundation@gmail.com.\n\nNORTH\n\nHALLS/POWELL\n\nBrickey’s Robbie Norman will miss the daily joys\n\nAli James, Shopper News correspondent\n\nIt is 7:15 a.m. and excitement fills the Brickey-McCloud Elementary hallways. It is field day for kindergarten and first grade, while the fourth-graders are headed to a Smokies baseball game. Principal Robbie Norman is at the epicenter, and has been for 14 years – greeting students, listening to stories and \"wrapping my arms around my students and staff.\"\n\nNorman pauses to sing “take me out to the ballgame” with a student, fixes a backpack zipper, listens to bug facts from a first-grader and “giggles for no real reason” with a fourth-grader. All while dispensing hugs.\n\n“I came from Mooreland Heights Elementary, where we had 350 students, to Brickey, where there were 900,” said Norman. “I needed to wrap my arms around them still. I can see them every morning, and it is a way to be visible to all my students. I can look at their faces and see if something is not quite right or if they are excited.”\n\nNext up are school announcements, and Norman heads to the media center. A fifth-grade team films and broadcasts the daily updates to every classroom. “This way every student feels like they get to see me every day,” she said.\n\nAfter graduating from Carter High and the University of Tennessee, Norman taught first-grade at Carter Elementary. “I definitely felt drawn to this calling: 'Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart,' said Norman. “I loved being a first-grade teacher and felt it would be all that I would do.”\n\nNorman taught for 20 years and earned her master's in administration and supervision.\n\n“The passion for becoming a principal just grew, but I was not quite ready,” she said. “I applied to be a curriculum coach.” Working at five schools in three years, Norman was able to watch five principals at work and see the things she did and didn’t want to add to her principalship.\n\nNorman decided she was ready to “make a difference in the lives of a whole school full of children.\" She accepted the position of principal at Mooreland Heights. In Norman’s fifth year at the school, she was recognized as Principal of the Year. “It was a highlight; the staff and I had worked so hard to have the highest gains that year in Knox County,” she said.\n\nFifteen years ago, the new Brickey Elementary building was built, with input from former principal Susan Turner. “She made the decisions and enjoyed it for a year before she turned it over to me,” said Norman. “We know what a gift we have with the whole school on one level and the different wings; it’s three acres under one roof.”\n\nNorman is set to officially retire on June 29, after she helps transition the new principal (who has not yet been named).\n\n“It’s a huge decision, this is 42 years and I wasn’t sure how I could stop, because I love what I do,” said Norman. “For the last three years I thought about it, but never felt completely at peace; I still felt so excited about coming to school. Everything came together in my heart and mind when I finally made my decision, I was at peace. Once again I am following my heart and that says it’s time.”\n\nPOWELL\n\nKARNS\n\nGirl Scouts build robots, go for STEM badges\n\nNancy Anderson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nGirl Scouts aren’t just about the cookies. The organization recently rolled out 23 new badges for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) related subjects including Earth science, Leap Bot engineering, and robotics.\n\nThis fall another series, or Journey, will roll out. “It’s Your Planet – Love It!\" The girls will explore the natural world by learning about the water cycle, completing energy audits, assessing air quality, calculating their \"food print,” and figuring out how much trash is created and how to reduce it.\n\nFor now, the girls of Beaver Ridge Troop 22045 are working on their Robotics Journey. They gathered at the Karns Youth Center to build a tin can robot with movable arms and googly eyes Monday, May 14.\n\nThey had to assemble the robot, wire it and insert the motor so that it could move. While the girls had plenty of can do attitude, no one finished the robot in one meeting. It typically takes three to five meetings to complete a badge. A Journey contains several badges.\n\n“We let them take as long as they need and they do everything on their own. We’re here to help, but we don’t take over. It’s trial and error for them. That’s the way they learn and they’ll be happy with themselves in the end,” said troop co-leader Jennifer Contreras.\n\nTo get all the badges in the Robot Journey the girls learn what robots are, how robots move, build a robot, design a robot, and showcase robots where they teach others what they learned in order to instill leadership.\n\nAfter learning what a robot is, the girls visited the Apple store to learn how to make a robot move using a simple program.\n\nEach level of Girl Scouts, from Daisies to Juniors to Ambassadors, takes a Journey working age-appropriate projects.\n\nIn Troop 22045, a multilevel troop, while the Brownies were assembling a tin can robot, the Daisies were learning about circuit boards. The Juniors recently learned how to assemble an EV-2 robot, which is more advanced than the tin can robot.\n\n“The girls really love going after the STEM badges, they learn that they can do anything the boys can do,\" said Contreras. \"They aren’t the easiest badges in the world to earn; there are some struggles. The girl learn that they can do anything they set their minds to, even if it’s a male-dominated field. They can go into the field their Dad is working in.\n\n“I think there are far more males in STEM related fields than females. Earning the STEM badges gives them a leg up and a step forward into gaining an interest in STEM fields and it happens at a very young age. They get exposure to STEM fields they might otherwise never be exposed to, or at least not at this young and impressionable age.\n\n“Girl Scouts are almost twice as likely as non-Girl Scouts to participate in STEM fields.\n\n“We had a Brownie, a second-grader, have an 'aha' moment when she learned that she could be a computer programmer just like her dad. She learned she can do anything a boy can do, and she’s farther ahead on building the tin can robot than anyone else.\n\nTroop 22045 meets every other Monday and every other Thursday at the Karns Youth Center.\n\nInfo: email Jennifer Contreras at abbysmom5@yahoo.com\n\n'Wilder Day' at A.L. Lotts: a unique look back\n\nJohn Shearer, Shopper News correspondent\n\nWhen Kathy Alexander was young, she was at her great-grandmother’s Knoxville home and was reading the Laura Ingalls Wilder book “Little House in the Big Woods” with much interest.\n\nBut then her great-grandmother, Merle Lloyd, added a realistic twist to the autobiographical children’s novel – she had also grown up as a pioneer in Wisconsin and had some experiences similar to Wilder's.\n\n“I thought that was the coolest thing,” Alexander recalled. “She took an interest in what I was reading and said, ‘This is real.’ ”\n\nAs a schoolteacher, Alexander has tried to add some real experiences as well to inspire her students and enhance their learning. What has resulted has been a quarter-century of Laura Ingalls Wilder Day programs at A.L. Lotts Elementary.\n\nFor her, this unique tradition for the fourth-graders at the Westland Drive school has never become burdensome, despite all the work involved.\n\n“I live for this day, and the children enjoy it,” she said while taking a brief break during this year’s special day on May 11. “I meet people in the grocery stores who were in this 20 years ago, and they say something like, ‘I was Nellie in the play.’ This is a rite of passage for fourth-graders here.”\n\nDespite all the fun had once again at this year’s special day – complete with dances and games, a play, old-fashioned craft demonstrations, a wagon ride and a family picnic – it was also likely a little melancholy for Alexander.\n\nThe reason is that she is retiring at the end of the school year, and this was her last year to coordinate the day as a full-time faculty member. However, she hopes the school keeps the tradition going and she will be glad to help as a retired volunteer, especially because her granddaughter attends the school.\n\n“Many parents and their children have approached me about the continuation of this special day in years to come,” she said. “It has yet to be decided as to what form that may take. I am certainly willing to help after I retire, as long as the students read the Laura Ingalls Wilder books.”\n\nWhile its future is uncertain, the past was an obvious part of the special day that Friday. Students and teachers were dressed in 19th century pioneer clothing and enthusiastically took part or watched the various activities inspired by Wilder’s books based on her childhood experiences.\n\nA highlight was a somewhat surprise appearance via Skype by Alison Arngrim, who played Laura’s friend, Nellie Oleson, in the 1970s and '80s NBC TV series “Little House on the Prairie.”\n\nAlexander said the youngsters had written out questions, but they did not know until that day that she would appear remotely from Philadelphia, where she was appearing at a comedy show.\n\n“She answered questions, like how it was to play somebody mean when you are not mean, and did she and Laura get along in real life,” Alexander said. They also wanted to know if a needle was really stuck in her foot in the episode titled “Bunny,” when she becomes paralyzed, she added.\n\nGoing that extra step to bring the past even more to life through the special programs is certainly not new to Alexander. In 1986, when she had her first Laura Ingalls Wilder Day while teaching at Sequoyah Elementary, actress Melissa Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the TV series, made a special appearance in person.\n\n“She came that day and answered questions,” Alexander recalled. “She was gracious and wonderful and talked to children on their level.”\n\nAlexander continued to have some sort of special day or event to help the students, including in a modified form at PTA meetings when she was at Sarah Moore Greene Elementary from 1991-93.\n\nWhen A.L. Lotts opened near Pellissippi Parkway in 1993 and she began teaching there, the event really took off.\n\n“It goes with the curriculum,” she added in explaining a big reason why she coordinates the program every year. “We study pioneer life, and I want something real for my children with family values.”\n\nWhile the offerings have changed over the years, including going from having a covered-dish picnic to students bringing their own food or purchasing a pioneer-style meal in the cafeteria, the fun enjoyed by the students has not changed.\n\nFor example, fourth-graders Bryce Coulter, Natalie Newman and Landry McMurray were wearing big smiles along with their 19th century-style clothing.\n\nBryce said he enjoyed the dances, enthusiastically adding, “It was probably the best thing I ever experienced in my life. It was really fun.”\n\nNatalie said she enjoyed the play and portraying Laura Ingalls, while Landry liked the play and finally getting to take part as a fourth-grader. “They only do it in the fourth grade, and it is a really big thing for me,” she said.\n\nIt has been a pretty big event for Alexander, too.\n\n“I love this day because it brings to life what the students have studied about in social studies class,” she said. “The stories are real. Any time you can encourage children to do hands-on activities, sing songs, get up and move, or act something out, it makes what they have read become a part of them.”\n\nBEARDEN\n\nOPINION\n\nContouring the body, bending the mind\n\nLeslie Snow, Shopper News columnist\n\nOn the day I learned that Jada Pinkett Smith’s 64-year-old mother has chiseled abs and a rockin’ bikini bod, I bought my first pair of Spanx. The irony hit me like a ton of bar-bells. I thought about Jada’s mom while I was driving to West Town Mall to purchase my new undergarment.\n\nI wondered what her life was like. Does she work out six hours a day? Does she live on chia seeds and iceberg lettuce? Does she stare at her naked body in awe or is her inner voice cruel and judgmental despite those impressive abs. Mostly I wondered if she was happy.\n\nStill deep in thought, I browsed the racks of intimate apparel until I found a 20-something saleslady willing to talk me through the endless iterations of Spanx.\n\nIn case you don’t know the term, Spanx is a modern-day girdle designed by a woman for women. (Should we say thank you?) In the continuum of female undergarments, first come corsets, then girdles, and then Spanx. If you Google corsets, and I did, you might be surprised to discover they originated in Italy and were introduced to the French court in the 1500s. They spread in popularity and were a big hit during the Victorian era when a minuscule waist was all the rage.\n\nThat means that for over 500 years, women have been binding themselves to perpetuate a fantasy of what women should look like. And there I was, at the mall, becoming one of those women by squeezing into what is essentially a Spandex sock.\n\nWhen I mentioned the tight fit to the saleslady, she chuckled softly. “If it’s comfortable,” she said, “it’s probably not doing its job.” Well I can tell you, my Spanx was doing a great job. Talk about an overachiever.\n\nClad in my Spanx, I stared at my body in the mirror and thought of Jada Pinkett Smith’s mom and her rockin’ bikini bod. And I realized, it’s either Spanx or sit-ups. So, I grabbed the Spanx and headed for the checkout counter.\n\nThe sales lady and I shared a moment. I mentioned that the Spanx was about the same price as the dress I just bought, and she laughed. Then she said something amusing like “At least it will always be in style.” I chuckled, heartily. But I wanted to have a deep conversation about corsets and body image and the role of women in society. “Can you be a feminist,” I asked her, “and still wear Spanx?” “Get over yourself,” she said with a wry smile. “Everyone you know wears them.”\n\nI wondered about that as I handed her my credit card. And I wondered about it again as I was walking out of the department store. I was so deep in thought that I almost didn’t hear the saleslady call out to me. “Ma'am! Ma'am!” she yelled. “Come back!”\n\nI turned to face her. I thought she wanted to continue our conversation about gender roles and the objectification of women. I thought she might tell me I was right to question my Spanx purchase.\n\nBut what she said was, “Your dress is tucked into your underwear.” I reached back and confirmed her assessment. “Why, yes, it is!” I said in surprise. And I laughed all the way to my car.\n\nSpanx or no Spanx, I am what I am. I am a 54-year-old woman walking through the mall with her dress tucked into her underwear. That’s who I am. I am gloriously imperfect. And I think I’m OK with that.\n\nLeslie Snow may be reached at snowcolumn@aol.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/953334/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-30-june-2021", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 30 June 2021 | The Week", "text": "1. ‘Jaw-dropping’ fall in life expectancy\n\nA public health expert has found that the Covid death rate in Greater Manchester was 25% higher than the average for England during the year to March, leading to “jaw-dropping” falls in life expectancy.

The study team tracked participants’ electrolyte levels until 2020 and noted how many were diagnosed with eating disorders, according to the study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.\n\nThe results showed that people who experienced electrolyte abnormalities were twice as likely as those who didn’t to be diagnosed with an eating disorder — sometimes more than a year later. And people with severe abnormalities were more than five times as likely to be diagnosed, the study showed.\n\nAbnormal electrolyte levels are common when a person is diagnosed with an eating disorder, said lead study author Dr. Gregory Hundemer, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa and a nephrologist at the Ottawa Hospital.\n\nElectrolytes — important minerals such as potassium, phosphate and magnesium — can be thrown off by dehydration, restrictive diets, vomiting and use of laxatives, all of which may be symptomatic of an eating disorder, said Dr. Jason Nagata, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. Nagata was not involved in this study.\n\nDisordered eating patterns are often present well before a person is diagnosed, which is why the researchers hypothesized that electrolyte levels might be a good indicator of who might develop an eating disorder, Hundemer said.\n\n“This study raised the concern that electrolyte abnormalities may be a red flag for more screening much earlier into the course of an eating disorder than we might think,” said Dr. Sydney Hartman-Munick, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School. Hartman-Munick was not involved in the study.\n\n“We know that timely screening, diagnosis and treatment predict better prognosis for patients with eating disorders, and the study introduces the idea that electrolyte abnormalities may be a red flag that could lead to further evaluation, especially in the primary care setting,” Hartman-Munick added.\n\nEarly signs of eating disorders\n\nAbnormal electrolyte levels can be life threatening, and eating disorders have risen since the pandemic started, Nagata said. From the spring of 2020 — when most Covid-19 restrictions/lockdowns were first put in place — through spring 2021, the number of eating disorder inpatient admissions in young adults and adolescents about doubled, according to a recent study.\n\nThis latest study on electrolyte abnormalities shows there is a potential for faster intervention, Hundemer said.\n\nMany of the abnormalities were noted more than a year before diagnosis, and in that time, patients might be directed to more targeted screenings for eating disorders, he added.\n\n“There is still so much we don’t know about the best methods for prevention and early detection for eating disorders, and this study offers new insight into future study in this area,” Hartman-Munick said.\n\nEating disorders are underrecognized and undertreated, especially among men, the LGBTQ community, people of color, older adults and those with larger bodies, Nagata said.\n\nHealth care providers should be aware of the risk that may come with abnormal electrolyte levels and the warning signs of an eating disorder — which include fasting, severe caloric restriction, vomiting, or using laxatives or diuretics to lose weight, he said.\n\nIf you are concerned about your weight loss behaviors — including vomiting, laxatives or diuretic use — you should talk with your health care provider about checking electrolyte levels, Nagata added.\n\nFamilies of teens and adolescents who are showing signs of eating disorders should raise concerns with a health care provider, Nagata said. The professional can assess for an eating disorder and refer families to helpful resources, he added.\n\nIf you think someone you know might be struggling with an eating disorder, you can also call the National Eating Disorders Association helpline (800-931-2237) for guidance on how to provide support.", "authors": ["Madeline Holcombe"], "publish_date": "2022/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/uk/uk-plants-flowering-early-climate-change-intl-scn", "title": "Climate change: UK plants are flowering a whole month earlier than ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSpring has sprung early in parts of the UK this year, and while British people are celebrating the unseasonal warm weather, there’s actually cause for concern.\n\nClimate change is making plants across the British Isles flower, on average, a month earlier than they used to, a new study shows. And that might set off a chain of events that could disrupt ecosystems and potentially cause entire species to collapse.\n\nIf global temperatures continue to rise at their current rate, spring could eventually start in February on a regular basis, according to the study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\n\n“The results are truly alarming,” said Professor Ulf Büntgen, lead author of the study, from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Geography.\n\n“When plants flower too early, it is expected to have detrimental consequences for wildlife, agriculture and gardeners.”\n\nDuring winter, plants are able to protect themselves from frost because they put themselves in a dormant “winter sleep” mode, Büntgen told CNN.\n\nHowever, an early spring brings forward the “vegetation period,” the phase when plants begin to grow. If a frost occurs during this time, the plants will suffer, and some may die.\n\nPlants may die if there is a late frost during their \"vegetation period.\" Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nFruit trees are particularly at risk of a late frost, which could bring serious consequences for fruit farmers, who stand to lose entire crop yields.\n\nWhile the study speaks to a long-term trend, other parts of the world have reported recent early flowering seasons. Last March, Japan recorded its earliest cherry blossom bloom in 1,200 years. In 2019, a heat wave in the United States caused sunflowers to bloom earlier than usual, because they are susceptible to temperature changes. While people enjoyed the early blooms, the overenthusiastic flowers made it harder for farmers to plant other crops in those areas.\n\nAnother cause for concern is something researchers call “ecological mismatch.”\n\nPlants, insects, birds and other wildlife have evolved over time to coordinate the way they develop. A change to this cycle can initiate a chain reaction, causing damage to ecosystems.\n\n“A certain plant flowers and attracts a particular type of insect, which attracts a particular type of bird, and so on,” Büntgen said.\n\n“But if one component responds faster than the others, there’s a risk that they’ll be out of sync, which can cause species to collapse and lead to biodiversity loss if they can’t adapt quickly enough.”\n\nThe study is based on the analysis of more than 400,000 observations of over 400 plant species dating back to the mid-18th century until 2019. The database relies on citizen reporting, or crowd sourcing.\n\nResearchers looked at the first flowering dates of trees, shrubs, herbs and climbers in locations from the Channel Islands to Shetland in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and classified their findings by location, elevation and whether they were from urban or rural areas.\n\nThe first flowering dates were compared with monthly climate records, which showed that the average first flowering had advanced by an entire month and is strongly linked to rising global temperatures.\n\nThis data is stored by the Woodland Trust in what’s known as Nature’s Calendar, a database with 3.5 million entries that date back to the 1730s.\n\nRather than breaking the data down to look at individual species, which can become “too noisy” and inconclusive, the study focused on a bigger sample size to ensure the data is robust, Büntgen said.\n\n“To really understand what climate change is doing to our world, we need these much larger datasets that look at whole ecosystems over a long period of time.”\n\nHe added that Nature’s Calendar was a rich data source with high scientific value.\n\n“Alongside temperature records, we can use it to quantify how climate change is affecting various ecosystems across the UK.”", "authors": ["Isabelle Jani-Friend"], "publish_date": "2022/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/world/china-overseas-police-stations-intl-cmd", "title": "Exclusive: China operating over 100 police stations across the world ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBeijing has set up more than 100 so-called overseas police stations across the globe to monitor, harass and in some cases repatriate Chinese citizens living in exile, using bilateral security arrangements struck with countries in Europe and Africa to gain a widespread presence internationally, a new report shared exclusively with CNN alleges.\n\nMadrid-based human rights campaigner Safeguard Defenders says it found evidence China was operating 48 additional police stations abroad since the group first revealed the existence of 54 such stations in September.\n\nIts new release – dubbed “Patrol and Persuade” – focuses on the scale of the network and examines the role that joint policing initiatives between China and several European nations, including Italy, Croatia, Serbia and Romania have played in piloting a wider expansion of Chinese overseas stations than was known until the organization’s revelations came out.\n\nAmong the fresh claims leveled by the group: that a Chinese citizen was coerced into returning home by operatives working undercover in a Chinese overseas police station in a Paris suburb, expressly recruited for that purpose, in addition to an earlier disclosure that two more Chinese exiles have been forcibly returned from Europe – one in Serbia, the other in Spain.\n\nWho runs the police stations?\n\nSafeguard Defenders, which combs open-source, official Chinese documents for evidence of alleged human rights abuses, said it has identified four different police jurisdictions of China’s Ministry of Public Security active across at least 53 countries, spanning all four corners of the globe, ostensibly to help expatriates from those parts of China with their needs abroad.\n\nBeijing has denied it is running undeclared police forces outside its territory, with its Ministry of Foreign Affairs telling CNN in November: “We hope that relevant parties stop hyping it up to create tensions. Using this as a pretext to smear China is unacceptable.” Instead, China has claimed the facilities are administrative hubs, set up to help Chinese expatriates with tasks like renewing their driver’s licenses. China has also said the offices were a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which had left many citizens locked down in other countries and locked out of China, unable to renew documentation.\n\nWhen approached by CNN last month about Safeguard Defenders’ original allegations, China’s foreign affairs ministry said the overseas stations were staffed by volunteers. However, the organization’s latest report claims one police network it examined had hired 135 people for its first 21 stations.\n\nThe organization also sourced a three-year contract for a worker hired at an overseas station in Stockholm.\n\nUndeclared consular activities outside of a nation’s official diplomatic missions are highly unusual and illegal, unless a host nation has given their explicit consent, and the Safeguard Defenders report claims China’s overseas offices predate the pandemic by several years.\n\nTheir reports have prompted investigations in at least 13 different countries so far and enflamed an increasingly heated diplomatic tussle between China and nations like Canada, home to a large Chinese diaspora.\n\nChina isn’t the only superpower to be accused of employing extrajudicial means to reach targets for law enforcement or for the purposes of political persecution abroad.\n\nRussia, for instance, has on two occasions been accused of deploying lethal chemical and radioactive substances on British soil to try to assassinate its former spies – allegations Russia has always denied.\n\nIn the United States, the CIA was embroiled in a scandal over the extraordinary rendition of terrorism suspects from the streets of Italy to Guantanamo Bay after 9/11.\n\nYet the suggestion of widescale repression of Chinese citizens in foreign countries comes at a pivotal time for a nation contending with its own unrest at home, amid fatigue at the country’s restrictive zero-Covid policy, as leader Xi Jinping’s third term in power gets under way. Last week, China indicated it would loosen some of its pandemic restrictions, three years after the onset of Covid-19.\n\nAs the second largest economy in the world, China has developed a deepening relationship with many of the countries where the new police stations have been allegedly found, raising awkward questions for national governments balancing commercial interests against national security.\n\nChina signs police patrol agreements with nations\n\nItaly, which signed a series of bilateral security deals with China over successive governments since 2015, has kept largely silent during the revelations of alleged activities on its soil.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018 Italian police conducted multiple joint patrols with Chinese police – first in Rome and Milan – and later in other cities including Naples where at the same time, Safeguard Defenders says, it has found evidence that a video surveillance system was added to a Chinese residential area ostensibly “to effectively deter crimes there.”\n\nIn 2016, an Italian police official told NPR that joint policing would “lead to a wider international cooperation, exchange of information and sharing resources to combat the criminal and terrorist groups that afflict our countries.”\n\nThe NGO determines Italy has hosted 11 Chinese police stations, including in Venice and in Prato, near Florence.\n\nOne ceremony in Rome to mark the opening of a new station was attended by Italian police officials in 2018, according to videos posted on Chinese websites, demonstrating the close ties between police forces in the two countries.\n\nA Chinese national flag is flown at half-staff to mourn the death of former leader Jiang Zemin at the Chinese Embassy in Italy on November 30, 2022. The NGO determines Italy has hosted 11 Chinese police stations, including in Venice and in Prato, near Florence. Jin Mamengni/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, the Italian newspaper La Nazione reported local investigations into one of the stations had not unearthed any illegal activity. Il Foglio quoted police chiefs as saying recently that the stations did not present any particular concern as they appeared to be merely bureaucratic.\n\nItaly’s foreign and interior ministries did not reply to questions from CNN.\n\nChina also struck similar joint police patrol agreements with Croatia and Serbia between 2018 and 2019 as part of the nation’s increasing strategic footprint along the path of Xi’s defining foreign policy, dubbed the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nChinese officers were seen on a joint patrol with their Croatian counterparts on the streets of the capital Zagreb as recently as July of this year, Chinese media reported.\n\nA Zagreb police official interviewed by Xinhua said the patrols were essential for “protecting and attracting foreign tourists.”\n\nA 2019 report from Reuters said Chinese officers had joined Serbian officers on patrol in Belgrade to help address the influx of Chinese tourists. One Serbian officer noted the Chinese didn’t have the power to make arrests.\n\nSafeguard Defenders also says Chinese stations were able to get a toehold in South Africa, and in nearby nations thanks to a similar accord with Pretoria, in place for years.\n\nChina began laying the foundations for closer policing ties with South Africa’s law enforcement agencies almost two decades ago, later setting up a network of what are officially called “Overseas Chinese Service Centers” in cooperation with the government of South Africa thanks to successive bilateral security agreements.\n\nChina’s consulate in Cape Town has said the plan “unites all the communities, both South Africans and foreign citizens in South Africa.”\n\nSince its establishment, the framework “has been actively preventing crimes against the community and reducing the number of cases significantly,” the consulate has said while noting that the centers are non-profit associations with no “law enforcement authority.”\n\nSouth African government officials have frequently been featured by Chinese media expressing support for the centers and saying their work has helped police deepen their relationship with Chinese expatriates who live there, according to a 2019 report from the Jamestown China Brief.\n\nCNN reached out to the South African Police Service, but it has not yet received comment.\n\nChina tries to return people against their will\n\nSafeguard Defenders stumbled on the police networks while trying to assess the scale of China’s efforts to persuade some of its people to return to China even against their will, which, based on official Chinese data, could number almost a quarter of a million people around the world during the time Xi has been in power.\n\n“What we see coming from China is increasing attempts to crack down on dissent everywhere in the world, to threaten people, harass people, make sure that they are fearful enough so that they remain silent or else face being returned to China against their will,” said Safeguard Defenders Campaign director Laura Harth.\n\n“It will start with phone calls. They might start to intimidate your relatives back in China, to threaten you, do everything really to coax the targets abroad to come back. If that doesn’t work, they will use covert agents abroad. They will send them from Beijing and use methods such as luring and entrapment,” Harth said.\n\nThe French interior ministry declined to comment on the allegation that a Chinese citizen was coerced into returning home by a Chinese police station in a Paris suburb.\n\nReports spark anger and investigations\n\nThe revelations have prompted vocal outrage in some countries and a conspicuous silence in others.\n\nLast month, FBI Director Christopher Wray told a Homeland Security Committee he was deeply concerned about the revelations. “It is outrageous to think that the Chinese police would attempt to set up shop, you know, in New York, let’s say, without proper coordination. It violates sovereignty and circumvents standard judicial and law enforcement cooperation processes,” he said.\n\nIreland has shut down the Chinese police station found on its territory, while the Netherlands, which has taken similar measures, has a probe underway, as does Spain.\n\nHarth told CNN the organization will likely find more stations in the future. “It’s the tip of the iceberg,” she said.\n\n“China is not hiding what it is doing. They expressly say that they are going to expand these operations so let’s take that seriously.\n\n“This is a moment when countries have to consider that it’s a question of upholding the rule of law and human rights in their countries as much for people from China, as for everyone else around the world,” she said.", "authors": ["Nina Dos Santos"], "publish_date": "2022/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/952290/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-19-march-2021", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 19 March 2021 | The Week", "text": "1. Oxford vaccine ruled safe\n\nBritish and European regulators have declared that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and its benefits “far outweigh any risks”. Boris Johnson, who will get the vaccine today, said: “The Oxford jab is safe and the Pfizer jab is safe. The thing that isn’t safe is catching Covid, which is why it is so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes.”\n\nWhy has the Oxford vaccine faced so much scrutiny?\n\n2. Jabs alone ‘won’t stop Covid‘\n\nVaccinations “won’t be enough” to contain the spread of Covid in the UK, according to a new study. The University of Warwick said measures such as test, trace, and isolate, hand hygiene and mask-wearing “may also be necessary for some time”. However, it also said that “gradually easing measures over a period of many months could reduce the peak of future waves”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Paris to enter new lockdown\n\nParis is set to go into a month-long lockdown as the country tries to fend off a new wave of Covid-19. France has recorded more than 35,000 new infections within the past 24 hours and the prime minister, Jean Castex, said a “third wave” of infections in the country was looking increasingly likely. There are 1,200 people in intensive care in the capital, more than at the peak of the second wave in November.\n\n4. Sun paid for Meghan info\n\nA private investigator employed by The Sun has admitted he illegally accessed the Duchess of Sussex’s private information. Dan Hanks said that he compiled a 90-page report on the future member of the royal family in 2016, shortly after the media became aware of her relationship with Harry. The information included relatives’ phone numbers, background information on her ex-husband, and Meghan’s personal social security number.\n\nMeghan Markle challenges Royal Family to offer evidence of bullying\n\n5.

Climate change is having “direct consequences” for Nato’s security, he added, as melting sea ice is “heating up the strategic competition”.\n\nPodcast: French sperm, reparations and the Arctic\n\n6. Ex-mayor denies taking bribe\n\nJoe Anderson, the former mayor of Liverpool, has said his arrest for bribery and witness intimidation was “bizarre”. He told The Daily Telegraph: “I have never taken a bribe in my life.” Lawyers for Anderson, who stepped aside after the allegations emerged, have launched a judicial review against the chief constable of Merseyside Police, arguing that the arrest was “unnecessary and therefore unlawful”.\n\nLabour Left accuses party of mayoral ‘stitch-up’\n\n7.

Kay Ivey said Tuesday that the state must reinvent its corrections system as it grapples with a prison crisis and also called for borrowing $1 billion to fund improvements at public schools. The Republican governor detailed a wide-ranging agenda in her annual State of the State address, given on the opening night of the legislative session. Ivey said she is creating a group to study a lottery or casinos as a revenue source for the state, a move that could press the pause button on anticipated gambling debate in the Legislature. Prisons are expected to be a central focus on the legislative session after the U.S. Justice Department last year said violent and crowded conditions in Alabama prisons violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Ivey’s administration is exploring a plan to lease three new prisons and close most existing facilities.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: State highway officials are looking for mechanics and using department assets to find them. Electronic message boards set up along roads around Anchorage are displaying help-wanted messages calling for heavy-duty mechanics to apply to the state Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, KTVA-television reports. The department has three heavy-duty mechanic positions open in Anchorage, says spokesperson Shannon McCarthy, and maintenance shops in Fairbanks, Valdez and Healy also have vacancies. McCarthy says it’s sometimes tough to attract and retain mechanics who can maintain construction equipment. The electronic signs urge potential applicants to call the department for more information.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A federal judge in Tucson has reversed the misdemeanor convictions of four activists, saying members of the humanitarian group No More Deaths were led by “sincere religious beliefs” when placing water and food for migrants in Arizona’s protected Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge near the U.S.-Mexico border. Judge Rosemary Marquez wrote in the opinion filed Monday that Natalie Hoffman, Oona Holcomb, Madeline Huse and Zaachila Orozco-McCormick met the guidelines for establishing they acted on their beliefs. The four had appealed another judge’s ruling a year ago finding them guilty of federal misdemeanors. They were cited by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services officers in 2017 after driving a truck into the wilderness area and leaving bottles of water and other supplies for migrants who cross the region.\n\nArkansas\n\nBentonville: Benton County plans to appeal the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s decision not to help pay for the costs to clean up damages from two tornadoes that struck in October, officials said. The county was notified of the decision by letter Jan. 24, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The county has 30 days to appeal. The letter did not specify why the county was denied. But Robert McGowen, county public safety administrator, said it was because the county was short $124,134 of the threshold for assistance. Damage assessments from the October tornadoes totaled $6.5 million for uninsured public property, McGowen said. Most of the damage – $5.5 million worth – involved two electric companies. “For some reason, FEMA did not accept the preliminary damage assessment numbers we provided them and reduced the amounts that were submitted by the entities,” McGowen said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The governor revealed a plan Tuesday that would keep more water in the fragile San Joaquin River Delta while restoring 60,000 acres of habitat for endangered species and generating more than $5 billion in new funding for environmental improvements. The framework announced Tuesday by Gov. Gavin Newsom is a unique approach to managing the state’s scarce water resources. Historically, California has governed water usage by issuing rules – often challenged in court by farmers or environmental groups. Those lawsuits can drag on for years and prevent programs designed to boost sagging salmon populations and other threatened species that live in the delta. Instead of issuing new rules, for the past year the Newsom administration has been negotiating with water agencies to come up with “voluntary agreements” between the two sides with “partnership and oversight from environmental groups.”\n\nColorado\n\nSteamboat Springs: A school district hired a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent to conduct an investigation into a high school’s culture related to student claims of sexual harassment or sexual assault. The Steamboat Springs School District hired Jane Quimby of Quimby and Associates in Grand Junction to investigate complaints that female students were not being heard or protected by administrators, The Steamboat Pilot & Today reports. District officials also announced Steamboat Springs High School Principal Kevin Taulman has been placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation. Quimby served as an FBI special agent for 20 years and is an attorney and a former high school and college teacher, officials said. Quimby will report to the school district’s attorneys, Caplan & Earnest, and not to Superintendent Brad Meeks in order to strengthen the integrity of the investigation, officials said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A federal judge has dismissed nearly all claims in a lawsuit that sought to force all-male fraternities at Yale University to admit women, saying fraternities and sororities are specifically excluded from a federal law that bans discrimination based on gender in education. U.S. District Judge Victor Bolden in Bridgeport issued the ruling Jan. 30 in the lawsuit filed last year by three women who attend Yale. They sued nine fraternities and Yale in response to alleged sexual assault, harassment and discrimination at the all-male social organizations. The judge allowed only one claim against Yale to continue forward toward trial: an allegation that school officials failed to act when informed by one of the plaintiffs that she and other women had been groped against their will at a fraternity party in 2016.\n\nDelaware\n\nBridgeville: A year after moving the World Championship Punkin Chunkin from Delaware to Illinois, event organizers have made a plea to their fans here: “Bring us home.” “The biggest thing is to create the buzz. It’s a great tradition to try to keep continuing,” says Frank Payton, president of the World Championship Punkin Chunkin Association. While organizers said Illinois had better state protections against liability – a special focus after a 2016 malfunction left a person critically injured – it drew a much smaller crowd than back home. Payton estimates fewer than 15,000 people attended last year’s event in Rantoul, Illinois, over two days, down from the estimated 30,000 in 2016. At its height, the nonprofit Punkin Chunkin drew up to 100,000 wide-eyed spectators to Sussex County, raising more than $1 million through the years for local charities. Last year it managed to pull in just $1,500.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A thief caught on surveillance video stole a mother’s vehicle while she was pumping gas and her child was sitting in the back seat. The mother was dragged Tuesday morning while trying to stop the thief, news outlets report. Video appeared to a show a man sneak into the SUV and drive away as the mother tried to stop the thief. Elroy Jacobs told news outlets he witnessed the woman being dragged for about a block before she was run over. He said he chased the vehicle and found the child still inside after the SUV was abandoned. “I saw this woman hollering, ‘My baby, my baby, they’re taking my baby,’ ” Jacobs said. “I’m not thinking about no weapon, if they have any weapon. I’m just thinking about the child.” It’s unclear whether the mother was injured. Police had not announced any suspects or arrests, news outlets report.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Two men charged with drug trafficking could have done a better job hiding their wares than using a package labeled “Bag Full of Drugs,” authorities say. Ian Simmons and Joshua Reinhardt, both 34, were pulled over Saturday after a trooper clocked them going 95 mph on Interstate 10 in the Panhandle, according to a Florida Highway Patrol arrest report. The trooper determined Reinhardt was the subject of a felony warrant for violation of probation and requested backup. A Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s deputy arrived, and a K-9 alerted them to the presence of contraband in the vehicle, the report said. Authorities found about 75 grams of methamphetamine, 1.36 kilograms of the date-rape drug GHB, 1 gram of cocaine, 3.6 grams of fentanyl, 15 MDMA tablets and drug paraphernalia. “Note to self- do not traffic your illegal narcotics in bags labeled ‘Bag Full Of Drugs,’ ” deputies wrote on Facebook. “Our K-9’s can read.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp and state Superintendent Richard Woods announced a plan Tuesday to cut five mandatory standardized tests for public school students, including four in high school. The Republican officials are also trying to cut the length of state tests and evaluate local tests that Georgia’s 181 school districts give to evaluate student progress. Both Woods and Kemp oppose the current amount of testing, part of a national backlash to a system largely built by Republicans in Georgia. “When you look at the big picture, it’s clear Georgia simply tests too much,” Kemp said at a news conference. “On test days it’s making students physically sick because they’re worried they will not do well.” The biggest changes would come in high school. The economics test would be dropped, and the state Board of Education would decide which others would go – possibly geometry, physical science and American literature.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A sick Hawaiian monk seal under the care of wildlife scientists is suffering from a parasitic infection often spread via feral cat feces, officials say. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials determined the seal was suffering from toxoplasmosis, The Honolulu Star-Tribune reports. The female seal, known as Pohaku, was taken from Ko Olina on Oahu to the agency for monitoring after reports she was “logging,” or lethargically floating on the water. There are an estimated 50,000 to 300,000 feral cats on Oahu, and they are a primary source of toxoplasmosis, a parasite that reproduces in the digestive system of cats, the agency says on its website. Hawaiian monk seals are exposed to the parasitic eggs when they consume contaminated prey or water, the NOAA says. Toxoplasmosis can destroy muscle, liver, heart and brain tissue and cause organ failure. Treatment options for infected seals are extremely limited.\n\nIdaho\n\nBonners Ferry: A long-closed road built through grizzly bear habitat in northern Idaho will reopen following national security concerns, federal agencies said. The U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced the plan to reopen more than 5 miles of Bog Creek Road after years of discussion, The Spokesman-Review reports. The road was closed in the late 1980s to protect endangered grizzly bears roaming the area between Upper Priest Lake in Idaho and the Canadian border, officials said. The U.S. Border Patrol has asked the Forest Service since 2013 to reopen the road because of threats to border security. Neither agency specified those threats. The Forest Service is expected to install and repair culverts along the road and to cut back trees and other vegetation that has come close to or obstructed the road, officials said. The road will “not be open for public motorized use,” Forest Service officials said.\n\nIllinois\n\nJoliet: Police are searching for a man who caused thousands of dollars of damage in a Walmart in suburban Chicago by spraying disinfectant inside the store while wearing a surgical mask and a sign on his back declaring that he has the deadly coronavirus. Two men apparently in their 20s walked into the store in Joliet on Sunday. One of them put on the yellow surgical mask and started spraying Lysol on clothing, produce and health and beauty items, causing nearly $10,000 in damage, police said. “He was telling everyone the same thing, that he was protecting them from the virus,” Tony Prokes, a customer, told WLS-TV in Chicago. The man wore a homemade sign on his back that read, “Caution I have the Coronavirus.” The apparent prank comes amid growing worldwide concern about the virus that has killed hundreds of people, most of them in mainland China, and sickened more than 20,000 around the world.\n\nIndiana\n\nGary: A local man testified that a now-dead man gave him a video recording of his confession to killing five people in 2000, a crime for which another man is serving 300 years in prison. Cleveland C. Bynum, 37, was convicted of murder in 2001 for the shooting deaths of sisters Angela Wallace, 24, and Suzanne Wallace, 34, who were both from Gary. Bynum, then 22, was also convicted of killing 37-year-old Sheila R. Bartee and 24-year-old Anthony Jeffers, also from Gary, and Elizabeth Daily-Ayers, 37, of Hobart. Bynum’s attorney, Frances Watson, filed a successive petition for post-conviction relief in 2016 for Bynum, who maintains his innocence and is seeking to overturn his conviction. Lake Criminal Magistrate Natalie Bokota on Monday heard testimony for the relief, The Times of Northwest Indiana reports. Roger Shannon testified Gerald Mathews gave him a cellphone that contained a video recording of Mathews confessing to killing the five people.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Griff the bulldog, Drake University’s live mascot, will retire this summer, the university announced Wednesday. Drake anointed the former champion show dog as its live mascot in fall 2015. Now 7, Griff has since been a constant staple at thousands of Drake events, the Drake Relays and other sporting events, and graduations. Over the past year, he tried to meet as many presidential candidates as he could in the run-up to the 2020 Iowa caucuses. “Griff has been such a special part of our campus community,” Drake President Marty Martin said in a statement. Drake anticipates having Griff’s successor, Griff II, in place by July 1, the day after Griff is set to retire. Future live mascots will be christened Griff with an additional nickname. The school said Griff intends to enjoy long naps in retirement, mostly on his favorite oversized chair.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A collaborative effort is underway to preserve and make accessible historic television and radio programs produced by public media stations in the state. KMUW-FM and the American Archive of Public Broadcasting said in a news release Wednesday that the online collection will be digitized from deteriorating and obsolete formats. It will showcase statewide coverage of social issues, commentary, public reporting and history from more than 70 years of archival collections in the state. The Kansas collection consists of programs produced by KMUW, High Plains Public Radio, KPR, KPTS, KRPS, KHCC and Vietnamese Public Radio. These programs will be the first from Kansas contributed to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, a collaboration between the Library of Congress and Boston public media producer WGBH.\n\nKentucky\n\nHodgenville: The town where President Abraham Lincoln was born will host activities this month to commemorate his 211th birthday. Ceremonies will be held Feb. 12 in downtown Hodgenville and at the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Park, officials say. Local officials plan to attend the first ceremony, which will include a flag raising and wreath laying, according to the statement from Lincoln Days Celebration. The event at the national park will include a procession from the visitor center to the Memorial Building and a wreath laying. Afterward, a luncheon at the LaRue County Extension Building will feature Centre College President John Roush, who will speak about Lincoln’s leadership style and legacy.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A group that was denied permission to march in the city of Natchitoches’ Christmas parade when it insisted on carrying Confederate battle flags asked a federal appeals court Tuesday to revive its lawsuit alleging constitutional violations. The permit for the Louisiana Sons of Confederate Veterans was denied in late 2015, months after the slayings of nine black worshippers at a South Carolina church by white supremacist Dylann Roof. Pictures on social media of Roof posing with Confederate battle flags led to renewed opposition to public displays of Confederate iconography around the nation. In Natchitoches, a nonprofit group that organized the annual parade denied a permit to the SCV after city officials expressed concerns that some in the city would be offended by the display of Confederate battle flags and that protests might disrupt the procession.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s two U.S. senators are among a group of lawmakers pushing for the federal government to crack down on the use of dairy terms on plant-based products. Republican Sen. Susan Collins and independent Sen. Angus King want U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn to work with Congress to prevent what they see as misuse of dairy terms on products that contain no dairy. Collins and King joined a bipartisan group of seven senators in asking for Hahn’s help in late January. The senators said the use of dairy terms such as “milk” on “imitation products in the marketplace” is confusing for consumers. The International Food Information Council Foundation released survey results in 2018 saying that “three-quarters of Americans understand that plant-based ‘milk’ products do not actually contain cow’s milk.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Democrat Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik won special primaries Tuesday for the U.S. congressional seat that was held by the late Elijah Cummings. In a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 4 to 1, the Democratic nominee will be the heavy favorite heading into the April 28 special general election. The majority-black district includes parts of Baltimore’s inner city that have struggled with drugs and violent crime, as well as more well-to-do communities in the suburbs. Whoever wins the special general election will serve the rest of Cummings’ term through Jan. 3, 2021, and have to stand for reelection in November to keep the seat. For Mfume, who in 1996 stepped down to lead the NAACP after serving five terms as a district’s congressman, it’s a chance to regain the seat he held more than 20 years ago.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Commuters can expect several years of station gridlock at one of the city’s busiest train stations once major construction kicks off in late summer. Boston transportation officials have warned commuters who use South Station that they should add 5 to 10 minutes to their daily commute in anticipation of delays caused by the construction of an office tower and installation of fare gates. The number of doors that commuters use to get from the lobby to the platforms and back will be limited to five, down from the typical eight to 10, and a large area of the concourse will be cordoned off. The new configuration could come as early as July, The Boston Globe reports. A concrete extension will be added to the platform to allow more room for riders under the new construction configuration. New fare gates will also be installed on the outside area near the platforms.\n\nMichigan\n\nSaline: A public meeting called to address racist social media posts by students at a suburban Detroit high school turned volatile when a white parent asked a Hispanic parent, “Why didn’t you stay in Mexico?” The exchange Monday shocked many who had gathered for a community meeting at the Saline Area Schools district office. Parent Adrian Iraola said his son had endured racist name-calling by students in the district and described the impact it had on him, ultimately fueling him to earn a master’s degree from Johns Hopkins University. As Iraola described “the abuse that he was enduring in this school system,” another parent, Tom Burtell, interjected, “Then why didn’t you stay in Mexico?” Iraola responded that he lives in America because it is “the greatest country in the world.” In an MLive.com interview, Matthew Burtell, a 2014 Saline High School alumnus and Tom Burtell’s son, spoke out against his father’s “racist and xenophobic behavior.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: There’s time to protect the privacy of Minnesotans who vote in the Super Tuesday presidential primary March 3, Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon and a bipartisan group of lawmakers said Wednesday. Under current law, the state must provide the names and party preference of primary voters to the four parties with major-party status in Minnesota – Democrats, Republicans and two pro-cannabis parties. A bill rolled out Wednesday by Democratic Sen. Ann Rest, of New Hope, and Democratic Rep. Ray Dehn, of Minneapolis, would tightly restrict that data. The bill, which has some Republican support, would restrict the sharing of party preference data to the national party committees, and only for verification purposes. Otherwise the data would be private, with penalties for making it public. And voters could opt out of sharing their data.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A plan to give teachers at least a $1,000 pay raise won state Senate approval Wednesday, and now it goes to the House. The pay bill easily passed the Senate with bipartisan support. Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann said last week that he wants it to be part of a multiyear plan to increase some of the lowest salaries in the nation. Senate Bill 2001 would give $1,000 across-the-board raises to most teachers and to all teachers’ assistants. Teachers in the first two years of their careers would receive raises of $1,100 in an effort to boost the beginning salaries. The National Education Association says the average teacher salary in the U.S. was $60,477 for the 2017-18 school year. Mississippi had the lowest average that year, at $44,926. The average teacher salary in Mississippi for the 2018-19 school year – the most recent data available – was $45,105, according to the state Department of Education.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Lawmakers on Tuesday voted to make grants available for potential builders of an ultrafast Hyperloop test track in the state. House members in a voice vote gave initial approval to a bill that would make a 10- to 15-mile test track eligible for public-private partnership grants. Hyperloop technology involves a tubular track through which a train-like pod carries passengers at speeds up to 640 mph. Missouri supporters envision connecting Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis with a system that could cut a roughly 4-hour drive across the state down to a 30-minute commute. They’re now advocating for a test track to be built in Missouri. “It would bring in investment dollars from around the world to make Missouri an innovative state,” bill sponsor Rep. Travis Fitzwater told colleagues on the House floor. It’s not cheap. Some estimates have put the cost at $25 million to $27 million per mile, excluding land acquisition.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: The Environmental Protection Agency has announced it is removing a portion of a former wood-treatment facility in the state from its list of Superfund sites, despite concerns. The agency and the state Department of Environmental Quality determined that all the required cleanup of the facility is complete and that no additional work is needed to protect human health and the environment in the area, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. The Idaho Pole Company operated the facility near Cedar Street until 1997 and contributed to soil and groundwater contamination, officials said. It was designated a Superfund site in 1986. The Gallatin City-County Board of Health and the Gallatin Local Water Quality District have repeatedly voiced concerns and have said the federal agency did not adequately work with local government officials to ensure redevelopment is safe.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: American evacuees from the growing coronavirus outbreak in China will be flying into Omaha as soon as Thursday and be quarantined at a nearby Nebraska National Guard training base, officials said Wednesday. The plane will be landing at Eppley Airfield and park at a remote spot. The passengers will not go inside the terminal, said a news release from Nebraska Medicine, and they’ll be taken to Camp Ashland, which sits about 30 miles southwest of the airport. Nebraska Medicine spokesman Taylor Wilson said he couldn’t yet say how many evacuees were headed to Omaha or when the flight was expected to land. Nebraska National Guard officials have been preparing to house evacuees in three buildings with 85 hotel-style rooms at the camp. Guard officials have said the evacuees won’t interact with guardsmen or employees there.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The entry point to about 13,000 acres of scenic backcountry in the Lake Tahoe Basin will get an upgrade. The Tahoe Fund announced this week that it landed a $100,000 donation from the E.L. Cord Foundation among other gifts to jump-start the work in the Spooner Lake area of Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park. The fund raised $300,000 through private donations for an amphitheater that is part of the project. But the fundraising is more important than the amount suggests because the money from private sources will be used to leverage $2.9 million in public funds, Tahoe Fund CEO Amy Berry said. The project by the Nevada Division of State Parks could break ground as soon as spring 2020, with phase one complete by the end of 2021.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: A University of New Hampshire expert on kiwiberries will give a crop overview and discuss best production practices and information on market potential on the grape-sized fruit in an event this weekend. The Kiwiberry Breeding and Research Development program is the first of its kind in the nation. Will Hastings, vineyard manager and research technician of the New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station’s program, will give a discussion Saturday at the NOFA-NH Winter Conference at Kearsarge Regional High School in North Sutton. The tropical-tasting, smooth-skinned relative of the fuzzy supermarket kiwi has been grown in backyards and private gardens in the region for more than 140 years. Despite its long history, though, virtually no commercial production exists. Hastings is co-author of “Growing Kiwiberries in New England, a Guide for Regional Producers.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration has restored funding to one of two public assistance programs that help Ocean County senior citizens maintain their independence, Freeholder Director Joseph H. Vicari says. The county government is to receive $1.47 million for the Jersey Assistance for Community Caregiving program, up about $400,000 for the state fiscal year 2020, Vicari says. The program, which will serve about 225 seniors each month, offers an array of services for those who would otherwise be forced to reside in nursing homes. Those services include respite care, housekeeping, home delivered meals, personal emergency response plans, transportation, adult day care, special medical equipment or supplies, caregiver training and home health aide services. Applicants must meet certain income requirements, all according to county officials.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state House of Representatives approved a budget plan Wednesday to increase annual state spending by more than a half-billion dollars to expand early childhood education programs, boost teacher salaries and shore up health care for the poor. The House voted 46-24 along party lines with Democrats in support of the $7.6 billion general fund spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The bill now moves to the Senate, where a variety of amendments are likely. State economists are forecasting an $800 million surplus in state government income for the coming fiscal year that is linked closely to record-setting oil production in the state. Republicans in the House minority criticized the proposed $530 million, 7.5% increase as irresponsible and unsustainable in the event of an oil-sector downturn. They outlined their own plan that would increase spending by 4.3% and called for giving every New Mexico resident a $200 rebate.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state could ban retail pet shops from selling dogs, cats or rabbits as soon as mid-2021 under a Democratic state senator’s bill. The state would join Maryland and California and hundreds of municipalities nationwide that have taken a stand to outlaw sales of those pets, Deputy Senate Leader Mike Gianaris said Monday. Supporters including The Humane Society of the United States and the New York State Animal Protection Federation say the vast majority of New York pet stores already don’t sell cats, dogs or rabbits. But Libby Post, the executive director of the federation, says the proposal is an “opportunity for pet stores to rebrand themselves as compassionate businesses that put puppies over profits.” New Yorkers could still buy cats, dogs and rabbits directly from breeders.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Officials in the capital city approved the creation of a citizen advisory board Tuesday charged with reviewing the police department’s policies. Activists have called for greater oversight of the Raleigh Police Department’s procedures for years, despite pushback from some department employees and leaders, news outlets report. The calls were renewed following the fatal shooting of a man Raleigh police said was armed and “acting strangely” last week, as well as a traffic stop last month that prompted a use-of-force investigation, the outlets say. The board will consist of five members, but those people have not been announced, according to Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin. She asked for people interested in serving on the board to reach out to their council member.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A group is seeking to oust Burleigh County Commissioner Kathleen Jones through a recall petition due in part to her support for resettling refugees in the county. The petition against her, which lists a five-person sponsoring committee, calls for Jones to be recalled for “the reasons of contempt of the voters and negligence in office.” The county commission voted 3-2 in December to allow Lutheran Social Services to continue resettling refugees in Burleigh County. The meeting was prompted by an executive order from President Donald Trump that left the question up to states and counties. In January, the commission voted 3-2 not to put the question of future refugee resettlement before voters in the form of a nonbinding straw poll. State law limits recall petitions to one official. Recall organizer Robert Field said Jones “was the easiest target.” Jones, who has served since 2014, believes she is being targeted because of her gender.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame is seeking nominations to honor people who have continued to contribute to their communities after their military service. Nominees must be current or past Ohio residents who have been outstanding in volunteerism, advocacy, professional distinction, public service or philanthropy. Each year, the Hall of Fame inducts up to 20 former members of the U.S. Armed Forces based on recommendations from a statewide executive committee of veterans and approval by the governor. Nearly 900 veterans have been inducted since the hall’s 1992 inception. They include astronaut Neil Armstrong, actor Paul Newman and fast-food entrepreneur Dave Thomas. The state Department of Veterans Services encourages people to submit nominations before a deadline of June 1, 2020.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The city will conduct a test excavation at an area cemetery as part of an ongoing effort to find remains of victims of a 1921 race massacre, officials say. The test excavation at Oaklawn Cemetery, planned for April, was announced during the city’s Mass Graves Investigation Public Oversight Committee meeting Monday, the Tulsa World reports. The meeting came a little more than a month after investigators announced that geophysical surveys conducted in October had found anomalies consistent with possible graves. “We would see this as an intermediate step,” says Kary Stackelbeck, a state archaeologist. The massacre happened over the course of 16 hours, from May 31 to June 1, 1921, when mobs of white residents attacked black residents and businesses. As many as 300 people were killed, hundreds more injured and thousands left homeless. Tulsa’s prosperous black business district known as Black Wall Street was destroyed.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A state senator told demonstrators opposed to a plan to build a natural gas pipeline and marine export terminal in Oregon that he expects the battle to go to the courts if the Trump administration tries to ram the project through despite a lack of state permits. Gov. Kate Brown’s office said late Tuesday that she “would consider all available options” if the federal government tried to preempt state permitting processes. Demonstrators gathered outside the Department of State Lands on Tuesday to thank its director, Vicki Walker, for refusing to grant another extension to Pembina, an energy company based in Calgary, Canada, for a decision on a removal-fill permit. The permit is required to dredge sediment out of Coos Bay, on Oregon’s southern coast, for the marine export terminal and to construct a 230-mile feeder pipeline through and under waterways in southern Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A bill that would provide millions in tax breaks for new construction of facilities to use natural gas extracted in the state to make fertilizers and other chemicals will be vetoed by the governor, his spokesman said Wednesday. The bill, which passed both legislative chambers this week by veto-proof majorities, authorizes the “energy and fertilizer manufacturing tax credit” for projects that require at least $450 million in construction and startup costs and create at least 800 jobs. The Revenue Department estimates the tax credit would be worth about $22 million annually, per plant. The tax break would expire at the end of 2050. Wolf “believes such projects should be evaluated on a specific case-by-case basis,” said his press secretary, J.J. Abbott. “However, if there was a specific project, he would be open to a conversation.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Inspectors found no evidence of black mold days after a General Assembly office was evacuated. The Joint Committee on Legislative Services offices were cleared after an employee reported finding mold under her desk, and aides to House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello said last week that renovations began as a result. The work, which included the removal of filing cabinets, raised concerns because it coincided with a lawsuit involving the committee and a state police investigation. When the committee revealed that no official test had been done to check for black mold before the work began, state officials ordered one. The report, which was released Monday, found no black mold. The report did find a “moderate” level of mold spores in air samples from the office, but the technician who conducted the test told WPRI-TV it did not indicate a cause for concern.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Several downtown streets were closed Wednesday after construction crews found a Civil War artillery shell, police said. The crew called 911 about 10 a.m. to report the shell in downtown Charleston, just over a block from the Old Slave Mart where dozens of vendors sell merchandise, Charleston police said. The police department called the U.S. Air Force to dispose of the shell and closed several nearby roads for about three hours as a precaution. Investigators initially said the shell appeared to be newer than the Civil War, but after further investigation, they concluded it was left over from the war between the Union and the Confederacy between 1861 and 1865, police spokesman Charles Francis said in a statement. No injuries were reported.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Small towns in the state say they are strapped for cash after historically bad flooding last year and are asking the Legislature to let them use money from gas taxes for road repairs. A bill from Sen. Brock Greenfield, R-Clark, would use money from the state’s motor fuel tax and the Department of Transportation to create a $2.4 million fund that townships could tap for road repairs. But cities, counties, the Department of Transportation and other programs argue that it would take money away from repairs they need to make. The Senate Local Government Committee passed the bill on a 4-3 vote Wednesday. The bill would designate the funds for repairing culverts and small structures like bridges. Lawmakers said they want the full Senate to consider the proposal, hoping it would spark further discussion on how to help towns fund road repairs.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A Republican-led legislative panel has decided not to decide, for now, whether it thinks a bust of a former Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader should be removed from the Capitol. The House committee on Naming, Designating, & Private Acts voted Tuesday to delay consideration of the nonbinding resolution that favors removing the statue of Nathan Bedford Forrest until the panel’s last meeting, likely months away. Republicans said the delay allows Tennessee’s Capitol Commission to weigh in first. The commission meets Feb. 20 and will allow public testimony on the bust, but officials don’t plan to hold a vote at that meeting. Removing the bust would require approval from the Capitol Commission and then the state’s Historical Commission, as laid out by the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: An appeals court heard arguments Tuesday in the case of a mother who does not want a hospital to end life-sustaining treatment for her 1-year-old daughter. Texas’ Second Court Court of Appeals in Fort Worth is considering the case after a lower court said Cook Children’s Medical Center could remove Tinslee Lewis from life support. The appeals court has said the child will remain on life support until it makes a final ruling in the case. Doctors at the Fort Worth hospital have said Tinslee is in pain and will never recover. Her 20-year-old mother, Trinity Lewis, has said she doesn’t think Tinslee, who turned 1 on Saturday, is suffering. Lewis’ attorney, Joe Nixon, told the three appellate judges that Lewis has the right to decide whether her daughter lives or dies. Amy Warr, an attorney for Cook Children’s, said doctors have a right to decline care for a patient if that care “causes suffering without medical benefit.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A resolution encouraging consideration of later high school start times has earned unanimous support from a state legislative committee. The nonbinding resolution was presented to the House Health and Human Services Committee by Democratic Rep. Suzanne Harrison, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. The resolution will proceed to the full House for a vote. Harrison, a physician, offered research at the hearing showing the circadian rhythms that regulate the waking and sleeping cycles of teenagers are different from those of children and adults. While adults typically begin winding down about 9 p.m., the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin is released about two hours later in teenagers, which is why their most productive sleep period is between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m., Harrison testified.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Democratic-led state House failed by one vote Wednesday to override a veto by Republican Gov. Phil Scott of a bill that would have established a paid family leave system in the state. The vote of 99 in favor of overriding the governor to 51 against came less than a week after Scott vetoed the bill because the plan included a $29 million payroll tax. Scott prefers a voluntary program. The bill would have guaranteed up to 12 weeks of paid parental or bonding leave and up to eight weeks of paid family care leave. Proponents have said the bill was needed to help recruit and retain workers in Vermont. When the bill passed the House last week, it was 11 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to override the governor’s veto. But some of those who voted “no” before changed their votes Wednesday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The capital city recorded a 10% increase in its homeless population during a winter survey, according to preliminary data from the count. The number of people sleeping in shelters or outside grew from 497 people in January 2019 to 549 last month, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports, citing a regional survey conducted biannually. It’s the first such increase since 2011, the newspaper says. “The focus on serving households with more complex needs and higher barriers to housing is the primary driver of this increase,” Kelly King Horne, a director of the region’s homeless services, told the newspaper. Still, the numbers are a little under half of what was recorded a decade ago, when 1,150 people were counted as homeless, according to data from 2009.\n\nWashington\n\nSeaTac: The city will no longer issue exorbitant bills for free-speech demonstrations. An immigrant rights group called Families Belong Together-Washington Coalition sued SeaTac in 2018 after the city sent it a $37,000 bill for public safety costs related to a protest of President Donald Trump’s separation of migrant families along the U.S.-Mexico border. The official who issued the bill said the city code required him to charge Families Belong Together for the actual costs of the event, which drew about 10,000 people June 30, 2018. Dozens of mothers who had been separated from their children were detained at the Federal Detention Center in SeaTac at the time. But organizers said such a policy unlawfully chilled free speech rights under the U.S. and Washington Constitutions. The new policy says the city will not charge more than $500 for public safety costs and will waive the fees entirely if organizers demonstrate they are not able to pay.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A resolution to prohibit the state’s court system from interfering in ongoing legislative action failed in the state Senate on Wednesday, the latest unsuccessful attempt to address a 2018 ruling that halted impeachment proceedings against several Supreme Court justices. The vote in the Senate was 20-13, but the resolution did not receive the required two-thirds support for passage. If it had passed both houses, the resolution would have gone before voters. Last October the U.S. Supreme Court left in place a decision by five acting state Supreme Court justices that prosecuting then-Chief Justice Margaret Workman in the state Senate would violate the state constitution’s separation of powers clause. That ruling was later applied to also halt impeachment proceedings against two other sitting justices who have since left the court: Robin Davis and Allen Loughry.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul and advocates for victims of sexual assault made a last-ditch effort Wednesday to save a pair of bipartisan bills intended to prevent a backlog of untested rape evidence kits, blasting Republicans’ divisive substitute proposal as a partisan attempt to ensure nothing becomes law this session. The Republican-backed bill adopts the same kit submission and tracking protocols laid out in the original bills but contains provisions requiring police notify immigration officials if attackers are in the country illegally and allowing students assaulted by other students or teachers to enter the state’s school choice programs. Both proposals are nonstarters with Democrats. Gov. Tony Evers would almost certainly veto the legislation if it reaches him. “This bill is a mess,” Kaul told Republicans on the Assembly Health Committee during a hearing on the measure.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Project leaders are seeking names to include in a new memorial honoring military veterans from within the Wind River Indian Reservation. All military veterans who have lived within the boundaries of the Wyoming reservation could have their names included, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. That includes veterans from Riverton, a city of about 11,000 people that is encircled by the reservation but is not part of it. The “Path of Honor” memorial will be located outside the Frank B. Wise Business Center building in Fort Washakie and include a garden walkway and four massive stones listing the names of the veterans, organizers said. The four stones will form the shape of a buffalo, organizer and Eastern Shoshone Vietnam War veteran Scott Ratliff said. Organizers hope to complete the memorial sculpture garden by the summer. The deadline for submitting veterans’ names is Friday.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/07/anti-pipeline-push-lynyrd-skynyrd-gopher-frogs-news-around-states/118674524/", "title": "Anti-pipeline push, Lynyrd Skynyrd: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday reallocated $12.3 million of the state’s coronavirus relief funds to hire travel nurses to help hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. The Republican governor announced the move as the state continues to see a surge in virus cases, straining hospital resources and staff. “I’m pleased to see more folks getting vaccinated, but we are still in the thick of COVID-19 and our hospitals are overwhelmed,” Ivey said in a statement. “The money is coming from the state’s share of CARES Act funds. Until our vaccination rates rise and our COVID-19 hospitalization rates fall, we will need the extra support these nurses provide.” The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated a nurse staffing crisis, sending U.S. hospitals into a competition for travel nurses and staff to handle the crush of patients this summer. Hospitals need more staff to handle the patient loads, while some nurses have left because they are exhausted, taken lucrative travel jobs or are out sick because they themselves are sick with COVID-19. Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery, like hospitals across the country, has turned to travel staff to fill positions. “It’s a national arms race for clinical talent,” CEO Peter Selman, said. He said the hospital is paying up to $155 an hour to national staffing firms.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Residents in Wrangell and Petersburg now have the ability to text 911 for help when calling isn’t an option. “It’s been working out excellent,” Petersburg Police Department Chief James Kerr said. “It’s designed for the hearing impaired or domestic violence situations. If you can’t talk to the dispatch but you need help, you can text.” A third-party provider helped implement the technology with the two police departments. “One of the really big benefits I see with this is for search and rescue,” Kerr said, noting Alaska’s rugged terrain can make it difficult to get a call signal. “But you can send a text through. It gives us GPS coordinates and everything else.” The Juneau Police Department is also investigating a similar system, Lt. Krag Campbell said in an email to the Juneau Empire. He noted texting 911 could be useful in active shooter situations or other times when speaking into the phone would put a caller at risk, betraying their position. Currently, the option is only available to AT&T and GCI customers, Kerr said. Texters using other providers get a message that the service is not available. No one has texted police yet with it, other than kids trying to play a prank. But the text sent to emergency services also comes with the texter’s location, allowing police to arrive at the kids’ location and caution them not to misuse the service.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The father of an elementary school student was arrested after he and two other men showed up to the campus with zip ties, threatening to make a “citizen’s arrest” on the principal over a coronavirus quarantine, school officials said Friday. Diane Vargo, principal of Mesquite Elementary School in Tucson, said the parent came to her office Thursday with his son in tow. The father was upset the child would have to isolate and miss a school field trip because of possible exposure to someone with COVID-19. She said two other men also “barged in.” One was carrying “military, large, black zip ties and standing in my doorway.” Vargo said she tried to deescalate the situation while explaining the school had to follow county health protocols. “I felt violated that they were in my office claiming I was breaking the law and they were going to arrest me,” a visibly shaken Vargo said in a video statement released by the Vail Unified School District. “Two of the men weren’t parents at our school, so I felt threatened.” In a video posted on social media, Vargo can be heard calmly asking them to leave. One of them replies they aren’t leaving because they’re not going to let her control the situation. The principal called Tucson police. School officials said the man arrested was the father. Vargo said they are pursuing charges against the other two men.\n\nArkansas\n\nParis: The Frontier’s Day festival returns to town Oct.2. Tonya Fletcher, executive director of the Paris Area Chamber of Commerce and organizer of the festival, described Frontier’s Day as “where yesterday meets today for today.” This year marks the 43rd year Paris has celebrated Frontier’s Day. Typically, the festival draws 3,000 to 4,000 people each year, but Fletcher said it is hard to say how many people the pandemic will keep at home. “I still think we’ll have a good crowd,” she said, allowing that it will likely be a smaller gathering than in the past. Frontier’s Day will officially begin at 9 a.m. and end at 4 p.m., but Paris will celebrate its monthly “First Fridays” music night the evening prior, wrapping at 11 p.m. For the festival, the city will block off three sides of the square, only leaving Highway 22 open to traffic. Frontier’s Day has fun activities lined up for all ages, Fletcher said. Children can roam the free pumpkin patch, where they can pick out pumpkins to decorate. There will be live music, and the day will begin with a parade and end with a pageant. During opening ceremonies, area historian Curtis Varnell will discuss the legacy of the Paris Courthouse, which turned 150 this year.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The mysterious deaths of a Northern California family of hikers and their dog have led federal officials to close 28 miles along the Merced River, where high levels of toxic algae were detected. The Bureau of Land Management closed campgrounds and recreation areas along the river, between the towns of Briceburg and Bagby, on Friday after receiving test results of water samples downstream from where the family died. Algal blooms can form in waterways that are shallow and warm. “These algal blooms can produce toxins that can make people and pets extremely sick,” Elizabeth Meyer-Shields, a BLM field manager, said in a statement. “We will continue to monitor for the algae’s presence and look forward to when the public can safely recreate in the Merced River.” The bodies of John Gerrish, his wife, Ellen Chung, their 1-year-old daughter, Miju, and their dog were found Aug. 17 on a hiking trail close to the river in the Sierra National Forest. A family friend had reported them missing. A cause of death has not been determined, and investigators are considering whether toxic algal blooms or other hazards may have contributed to the deaths. Toxicology reports are still pending, and investigators have ruled out any weapons being used or dangerous gases from a mine along the trail.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission has proposed a congressional map that would create a new swing seat in the northern Denver suburbs and lump conservative firebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert into a Boulder-based, solidly Democratic seat currently held by liberal Rep. Joe Neguse. The proposal from the commission staff Friday would rearrange the political geography as part of the once-a-decade redistricting process. It’s the first test of the commission model approved by voters in 2018. The map will be followed by a series of hearings, along with a map of state legislative districts. Both may change significantly in the weeks to come as the commission races to meet an end-of-the-month deadline to approve maps. The congressional map keeps the four Democratic seats relatively safe, as well as preserving three as solidly Republican. It would add a new swing seat running from Adams County to Greeley that voted Democratic by 1.9 percentage points in last year’s Senate election. That could make the final breakdown of the state’s congressional districts 4-4, an underwhelming split for Democrats in a state they won by 13 points in last year’s presidential election. Still, Democrats see the map as an improvement over the initial map, which had a similar partisan division.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Nursing homes will once again be allowed to hire temporary nursing aides as they deal with staffing shortages during the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont on Friday signed an executive order that revives the state’s nurses aides program that was used last year. Under the program, the temporary workers will be allowed to provide nursing-related services – but nothing that requires a license. The governor’s office said the idea is to use those aides to help serve residents who do not have COVID-19, allowing permanent staff to focus on patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus. The measure also will assure adequate staffing at long-term care facilities, which have struggled with hiring and retaining workers, the governor’s office said. Connecticut recorded 111 cases of COVID-19 among nursing home patients and 94 cases among staff between Aug. 18 and Aug. 31, according to the state Department of Health. There were 16 patient deaths related to the coronavirus during that time and none among staff. The governor on Friday also extended to Sept. 27 the deadline for nursing home workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Numerous Walgreens pharmacies across the state have been unable to process prescriptions because of flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida. The internet services vendor for the stores was affected by the historic flooding Thursday, bringing delays for people receiving vital medications. Walgreens has apologized for the inconvenience. The company said it is working to address the issues that have caused the delays. “Our internet services vendor is currently working to fully restore their operations as a result of the storms in the Northeast, which has resulted in some technical difficulties causing longer than normal wait times in several of our stores,” a Walgreens spokesperson said in an email over the weekend. “I ended up at the urgent care on Friday because my throat was starting to close due to an allergic reaction I had and couldn’t get my meds in time,” one person commented on a Facebook post about the issue from the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services. “This is an issue and delay of care that represent lives at risk.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new art exhibit in the nation’s capital is remembering the twin towers, just ahead of the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The show opened Saturday at the National Building Museum and features more than 50 years of photos of the World Trade Center, WUSA-TV reports. The images, all captured by photographer Camilo Jose Vergara, chart the history of the iconic towers from their construction to the attack that brought them down and what came next. “I closely followed the construction of the towers, watching heavy trucks bring in steel or haul away dirt amid the noise of jackhammers and clanging metal,” Vergara wrote in an essay accompanying the photographs. “As they rose to become the tallest buildings in the world, I regarded them as a wild expression of mistaken priorities in a troubled time. “Eventually, my early resentment faded, and I grew to see them as great human creations. As I traveled farther away to photograph the towers from distant boroughs, they seemed to lose their solidity and become mysterious, fantastic, and alluring.” Chrysanthe Broikos, a consulting curator at the National Building Museum, said she hopes the exhibit inspires visitors to think about what the towers and those who worked there meant to the world, as well as how the world responded when they fell.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: The store that inspired Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “The Ballad of Curtis Loew” has been demolished. Jacksonville’s Woodcrest Grocery Building, where Ronnie Van Zant allegedly met “the finest picker to ever play the blues,” was torn down late last month. The abandoned store was a hangout for generations of kids. The song, written by Van Zant and Allen Collins, tells the story of a young boy who collected bottles to raise money so the old man who hung out at the corner store could play his dobro. Curtis Loew was fictional, but the store was real. It was known as Claude’s in the late ’50s and early ’60s and was right down the street from the house where Van Zant was raised. Scott Hill, who grew up in the neighborhood, said fans started dropping by the site last week to grab cinder blocks as souvenirs after hearing about the demolition. Gene Odom, who wrote a book about the band and leads tours of Lynyrd Skynyrd landmarks for fans, said the building has been vacant for decades. The building started collapsing during the demolition of nearby trailers and had to be taken down. A real estate group said a residential home will be built there. The band is still touring but pulled out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame concert last month after guitarist Rickey Medlocke tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Morehouse College announced Friday that it has canceled this year’s homecoming festivities due to a surge of COVID-19. Events were scheduled to occur Oct. 10-17 and will not be rescheduled. The Oct. 16 football game against Fort Valley State University will still be played but without the “homecoming” designation and with fewer tickets available to the game to implement social distancing. University officials said they made the decision last week as Georgia broke its record for COVID-19 hospitalizations. “The state has the sixth-highest per capita infection rate in the nation, and an unprecedented number of young people have become ill with the virus,” Morehouse President David Thomas said. “Given the circumstances, a massive in-person gathering on our campus presents a public health risk to our students which is impossible to ignore.” Thomas said nearly 100% of the students and employees on campus have met the school’s vaccination requirement. With “aggressive” masking requirements and other safety protocols, Morehouse has limited the spread of the coronavirus on campus, he said. But he had to consider the broader community. “Keeping our students safe is our top priority,” he said. In place of homecoming, the school will host a students-only fall festival.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: President Joe Biden’s appointment of two Native Hawaiians to the U.S. Department of the Interior could influence federal policy for the state’s Indigenous people and other Pacific Islanders. Summer Sylva, who is currently head of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation, was appointed last week as senior adviser for Native Hawaiian affairs. Keone Nakoa, the Washington, D.C., bureau chief for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, has been appointed deputy assistant secretary for insular and international affairs. The positions carry a great deal of influence over federal policy involving Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, Hawaii Public Radio reports. Sylva will report directly to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to lead the agency. “She’s in a critical role to be in the secretary’s inner circle,” said Esther Kia’aina, a Honolulu City councilwoman who led the department’s Office of Insular Affairs under former President Barack Obama’s administration. Sylva’s appointment signals the agency’s desire to tackle Native Hawaiian issues, including homelands and self-governance, Kia’aina said. Nakoa will be serving in an office that oversees the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials are boosting pay and offering bonuses to try to attract and maintain correctional officers. About 24% of correctional officer positions at the Idaho Department of Correction were vacant last month, including 190 vacancies at the agency’s prisons in Kuna, south of Boise. “Attracting and hiring the right people to our security ranks is only one part of the equation,” Jeff Ray, the department’s public information officer, told the Idaho Press. “We’re putting an equal amount of emphasis on retaining the staff who have and continue to admirably serve the people of Idaho.” New correctional officers will receive $19 an hour, up from the previous $16.75. New hires will also get $1,500 bonuses and be eligible for $1,500 yearly retention bonuses during their first five years. Current employees will see hourly raises ranging from $0.75 for wardens to $2.25 for correctional officers starting Sept. 5. Also, on Oct. 15, all current correctional officers will receive a one-time retention bonus of $1,500. Correctional officers often must work mandatory 16-hour shifts because there aren’t enough workers. Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt said the pay Idaho offers correctional workers isn’t competitive with surrounding states, such as an Oregon prison paying new correctional officers $22.64 an hour.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Years in the making, the visitor center and state historic site grounds at the Pullman National Monument have officially opened to the public. Chicago’s first national monument marks the site where Pullman passenger railroad cars were built. Employees lived nearby in the neighborhood on the city’s South Side. The sprawling Pullman company factory closed in 1982. The National Park Services’ visitor center features exhibits on worker demonstrations that helped plant the seeds of the modern labor movement. For instance, Black railroad workers won a significant labor agreement in the 1930s that helped lead to worker protections. Robert Bushwaller, a Historic Pullman Foundation board member, said he was encouraged by the crowd Saturday. Some drove vintage cars to mark the opening day during the Labor Day weekend. “The public support has been better than expected,” Bushwaller told the Chicago Sun-Times. “The turnout is tremendous. They remember so much from how it used to be and want to see if it still tasted that way, and they’ve been satisfied.” Former President Barack Obama designated the factory and surrounding area a national monument in 2015. Restoration and revitalization at the site has been ongoing for years.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb issued seven pardons to convicted criminals during his first year in office but hasn’t granted any more pardons in the past 31/ 2 years, with officials saying the number of applications for the governor to clear criminal records has declined to a trickle, The (Fort Wayne) Journal Gazette reports. Indiana’s expansive expungement law – first passed by the Legislature in 2013 – has meant fewer people seeking pardons, as that process of asking a judge to clear past convictions is both simpler and more private, said Charles Miller, vice chairman of the Indiana Parole Board. “Quite frankly, I knew the numbers were way down, but even I was shocked by just how low they were,” Miller said. “Speaking personally, pardons are the best part of my job, as you get to the good things people accomplish after what is usually just an unfortunate mistake.” The pardons Holcomb issued in 2017 were largely holdovers from when Mike Pence was governor. The most prominent case was that of Keith Cooper, whose pardon request over his conviction for a 1996 robbery in Elkhart languished under Pence even as the state parole board, the local prosecutor and witnesses supported his exoneration.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The University of Iowa’s graduate student workers union is calling for stronger on-campus mitigation protocols against the coronavirus. The union members sent a list of demands to the UIowa administration and state’s Board of Regents in a letter dated Sept. 1 and followed that up Thursday morning with a “die-in” protest on the Pentacrest to draw attention to their plea. Demands include more remote work options, a mask mandate inside campus buildings, and required COVID-19 vaccinations or mandatory weekly virus testing of unvaccinated people, none of which are currently in place. The union represents about 250 members and 1,800 in the collective bargaining unit. Members hold a unique position at the university, as they are there not only to learn but to teach classes. Members of the organization approved the list of demands before it was sent out. “We are very concerned for our health and safety this fall,” the letter said. “We are deeply disturbed by the obligation we face to share spaces with others who may be putting us at risk, or whom we may be placing in danger, because of inconsistent vaccination and the optional status of mask wearing and social distancing on campus.” About two dozen people gathered on campus at 10 a.m. Thursday for the “die-in.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has placed 87 of the state’s 105 counties under a drought watch or warning. Kelly said Thursday that most of the state has been in drought or abnormally dry conditions for several weeks, and she encouraged residents to do what the can to minimize the risk of fire. Fourteen counties were placed under a drought warning and 73 under a watch. The 18 counties not included in the declaration are all in southeast Kansas. The action was recommended by Connie Owen, director of the Kansas Water Office and chairwoman of the Governor’s Drought Response Team. Kelly said in a statement that while some areas have had normal or higher amounts of rain so far this year, counties in the northwest, central and south-central have received less than 60% of their normal precipitation. Owen said future outlooks call for the drought-like conditions to continue into the fall, particularly in the northwest counties.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Tucked into the pandemic-heavy agenda for a special legislative session is a request to strengthen Kentucky’s negotiating hand in trying to reel in mega-sized economic development projects. Gov. Andy Beshear said Saturday that he will ask the GOP-led Legislature to give the state’s recruiting team more flexibility in offering incentives for investment projects topping $2 billion. “As we sit here today, we have at least five potential projects that would be that size,” Beshear told reporters. “In other words, the largest in our commonwealth’s history.” The Democratic governor announced Saturday that he’s calling lawmakers back to the statehouse for a special session that begins Tuesday and will be dominated by coronavirus-related issues. After winning a legal battle against Beshear, lawmakers will take the lead in crafting policies to respond to a recent surge of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations, fueled by the delta variant of the virus. But Beshear is hoping the work on economic development policy helps put the state at the front of the pack in trying to land $2 billion-plus projects. Such a massive development would be certain to create loads of new jobs, with plenty of spin-off opportunities for even more job growth.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Families looking for their loved ones who evacuated from Hurricane Ida to a state shelter are getting help from the state. The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services on Saturday launched “Connect,” a tool that will help families connect with each other. The number to call is 225-342-2727. Families can also fill out a form online to reach out to loved ones who may be in state-run shelter. The department said people will be required to provide the name, address and date of birth, if known, of the person they’re trying to find, as well as their name and contact information. DCFS will then determine whether the person is in one of the state’s congregate shelters and, if so, pass along the caller’s message. Individuals looking for loved ones evacuated from one of seven nursing homes linked to an evacuation warehouse site in Tangipahoa Parish should call 211, the department said.\n\nMaine\n\nOxford: The state is continuing to try to slow the spread of the invasive emerald ash borer with new restrictions. The Maine Forest Service has issued an emergency order preventing the movement of ash trees and products from areas including Norway, Oxford and Lovell in Oxford County. The order limits the movement of ash trees for planting and ash tree products such as logs, pulpwood, lumber and firewood from areas that are considered likely to harbor the pest. The new areas are in addition to areas already covered by a quarantine. The state’s ban on untreated firewood from outside Maine remains in effect as another way of preventing the pest’s spread.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Nursing homes in the state are seeing another rise in coronavirus cases, leading facilities to suspend visits from loved ones. The Washington Post reports the halt to visitations has led to a new wave of despair in facilities that were struck hard by COVID-19. The impact of loneliness on the health of the elderly has been extreme. Maryland has 227 nursing homes. Gov. Larry Hogan had ordered that all nursing home employees receive at least one vaccine dose by last week. Facilities that fail to comply will be subject to fines. The percentage of employees who have received a vaccine dose is 82%. At the same time, nearly 90% of all nursing home residents have had at least one vaccine dose, and 86.1% are fully inoculated. Meanwhile, outbreaks are rising in Maryland’s nursing homes. Outbreaks are defined by the federal government as at least one COVID-19 case. In July, fewer than 10 facilities had an outbreak. But by early August, there were 33. On Friday, there were 92.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: What started as a project to restore the gravestones of three Black men and women who played a role in the abolitionist movement on the North Shore is evolving into a larger effort to find and restore the final resting places for other African American families, officials said. In Salem’s Howard Street Cemetery, two of the stones marking the burial sites of Venus Chew, Prince Farmer and Samuel Payne, all of whom died in the 1850s, are broken into pieces, The Salem News reports. The graves to be restored are in what Rachel Meyer, a stone conservator with Epoch Preservation, described as a corner of the cemetery, effectively segregated from the main cemetery. They occupy a square piece of land the city donated to expand the cemetery to bury African Americans. The three stones in question have fallen over in time and were sinking into the ground when an area resident contacted Meyer about fixing them. Doreen Wade, president of Salem United, said she’s enthusiastically behind the project because of what it represents – more than just repairing fragmented gravestones, it’s repairing a fragmented story of Salem’s past.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlat Rock: A Ford plant is the source of benzene vapor in sewers that forced the evacuation of 10 homes and a school in the Detroit suburb of Flat Rock, according to state and company officials. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy confirmed Friday that the source of the flammable vapor is a fuel leak at the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant. “HAZMAT technicians will begin mitigating flammable vapors in the municipal sanitary system by injecting fire suppressant foam. These activities will take place at various locations where levels of benzene have been detected in a 4-square-mile perimeter of Flat Rock,” the department said. Ford on Wednesday discovered “what originally looked to be a relatively small leak in a pipe that carries gasoline used to fuel vehicles built at the plant,” said Bob Holycross, Ford’s vice president of sustainability, environment and safety engineering. But on Friday, the company “determined that the scale of the fuel leak was much larger and that Ford is the likely source of the problem in Flat Rock, for which we apologize,” he said. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said in an email late Friday that an estimated 1,000 to 3,000 gallons of unleaded gasoline spilled into the sewers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBemidji: Four congressional Democrats who are part of the progressive “Squad” and want President Joe Biden to stop construction of the Enbridge Line 3 oil pipeline traveled to the shores of the Mississippi River to make their plea. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Cori Bush of Missouri, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan spent the holiday weekend visiting Bemidji and other parts of northern Minnesota to speak with members of Indigenous communities and others who have been protesting the project. Line 3 starts in Alberta and clips a corner of North Dakota before crossing Minnesota en route to Enbridge’s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin. The 337-mile line in Minnesota is the last step in replacing the deteriorating pipeline that was built in the 1960s. “We have been encouraged by Joe Biden’s boldness so far,” Omar said, referencing his January decision to cancel a border-crossing permit for the Keystone XL pipeline that would have carried oil from Canada to Nebraska. “Now we have another chance to reject a moving pipeline. We hope you will act.” Minnesota Republican legislators condemned the visit, which they said “will only serve to incite the obstructionists,” the Star Tribune reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nMoney: A historical marker describing the events leading up to the killing of Emmett Till was knocked down just days after the 66th anniversary of his death. The black Mississippi Freedom Trail marker with gold writing typically stands in front of the remains of Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market, where, in 1955, the Black 14-year-old was accused of whistling at a white woman. Till was later kidnapped, beaten and killed. The sign is part of the Mississippi Freedom Trail, a route dedicated to honoring people and places in the state that had a significant role in the civil rights movement. Allan Hammons, president of Hammons and Associates, which manages the Freedom Trail, said a large vehicle like a tractor-trailer likely accidently knocked the marker from its post. The area is under construction, and Hammons suspects the driver of the vehicle may have not even realized they hit the sign. The marker was picked up by workers with the LeFlore County road department and stored in a storage facility until Hammons can inspect it. The Emmett Till Interpretive Center tweeted Thursday that it believes someone ran the sign down with a vehicle and removed it. The sign details how Till stopped by the store for candy before his abduction and death.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft is urging the General Assembly to prohibit local election workers from helping absentee voters correct mistakes, a move that would mean some votes aren’t counted. “We would like to see legislation that does not allow for curing of absentee ballots,” Deputy Secretary of State Trish Vincent told the House Elections Committee last week. “Curing” is a common term for fixing errors. The Kansas City Star reports the request adds to a growing list of measures advanced by Republicans to alter the state’s elections, including restoring a photo ID requirement and making it harder to amend the state constitution through voter-initiated ballot measures. Some similar proposals failed this year but could be considered again in the 2022 session. During the COVID-19 pandemic last year, Missouri lawmakers temporarily made all voters eligible to cast a ballot by mail but required most to have their ballot notarized. Missouri previously required an excuse for voting absentee. More than 28% of Missouri voters cast ballots by mail in November, up from 8% in 2018. “I don’t think we’re going to go back to the mail-in like we did during COVID,” said Republican Rep. Dan Shaul of Imperial, chairman of the House Elections Committee.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Wildlife workers at Glacier National Park trapped and killed a black bear that officials said became a public safety risk after it lingered around a campground. The bear took apples from an open vehicle trunk while visitors were nearby at the Many Glacier Campground, officials said. It kept returning despite park staff attempts to scare it away. It was later trapped near a housing area in a large trap made out of a culvert and was euthanized Thursday. The female bear was about 4 years old and 120 pounds, park officials said. It’s believed to be the same bear that had been approaching people near Glacier’s Grinnell Lake the week prior, prompting the closure of a trail. A necropsy showed the animal had been in healthy condition. But officials said it had become used to getting human food and was unlikely to break the habit. They said it could not be relocated due to safety concerns.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State education officials halted their plans Friday for new health education standards after criticism from some parents and conservative family-values groups that the content was sexually inappropriate. The State Board of Education voted 5-1 to indefinitely postpone the standards, with one member abstaining, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The standards were nonbinding recommendations, so local schools could simply have ignored them, but opponents still railed against the proposal. The new resolution the board passed says members will determine an appropriate time to address health education standards after considering the status of the pandemic and the needs of local children, schools and communities. Under board rules, any member can attempt to revive the process with support from the majority. The first draft released in March faced strong opposition, as did a second draft released in July, despite removal of many topics opponents disliked. The initial draft called for teaching children as young as first grade about gender identity and gender stereotypes and older children about homophobia, transphobia, and vaginal, oral and anal sex. Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts blasted the draft, saying it was developed with input from activists and promoted “gender ideology.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A federal judge has denied tribal leaders’ bid to temporarily block digging for an archaeological study required before construction can begin for a lithium mine on what they say is sacred land where their ancestors were massacred more than century ago. U.S. District Judge Miranda Du refused three tribes’ request for a preliminary injunction blocking the trenching planned to collect samples near the Oregon state line at the site of the largest known lithium deposit in the United States. The tribes say their ancestors were massacred in the late 1800s at the proposed Thacker Pass site. Du emphasized in the ruling late Friday in Reno that she has pledged to hear and rule on the merits of the case before Lithium Nevada Corp. hopes to begin construction early next year on the mine the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved in January. She rejected a similar request in July for a preliminary injunction sought by environmentalists who claim the digging would destroy critical habitat for greater sage grouse. Du said Friday that she was “not unpersuaded by the tribes’ broader equitable and historical arguments.” But she said that there was no evidence the bureau acted unreasonably, nor that the mine was planned on an actual massacre site, and the agency has contingency plans if “human remains are unexpectedly discovered.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu was released from the hospital Saturday after tests confirmed Friday that a bleeding ulcer was the cause of his flu-like symptoms. The Republican will continue to recuperate at home, according to a statement from his office. “New Hampshire is blessed with amazing health care staff and generous blood donors,” Sununu said in the statement. “Valerie and I can’t thank them enough and are grateful for everyone’s prayers and positive outreach.” Sununu was admitted to Portsmouth Hospital on Friday after experiencing the flu-like symptoms since Wednesday. He had tested negative three times for the coronavirus. Sununu said Wednesday that he tested negative, hours after his office said he wasn’t feeling well, postponed a meeting and began isolating. Sununu, 46, is fully vaccinated against COVID-19. He received the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine April 10.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMullica Hill: One of the most intense tornadoes recorded in New Jersey history all but demolished the state’s largest dairy farm. When Marianne and Wally Eachus, the owners of Wellacrest Farms, came out of their basement along with other family on their homestead, they saw that two of their massive grain silos had toppled over. Some barns were completely reduced to concrete, with roofs ripped off others, equipment demolished and uprooted trees crashed into the old farmhouse. “There was just metal, wood, debris, everywhere,” Marianne Eachus said. Hundreds of cows were trapped under collapsed barns. Thirteen have died; a couple dozen more suffered injuries. A crew was milking when the twister ripped through and had only seconds to hide and hold on. They saw several cows swallowed by the funnel. Up to 100 cows were still missing Monday. Somehow, there were no more deaths on the dairy farm from the EF3 tornado spawned by the remnants of Hurricane Ida. But the storm produced historic rain and massive flooding. Wellacrest Farms produces more than 17 million pounds of milk annually and works with other farmers to share and sell crops. There are 1,400 cows on the property. In the days after the destruction, the Eachus family has seen an outpouring of support and help, both physical and financial.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A group of Democrats in the state House has outlined a package of criminal justice bills intended to combat crime that includes penalties for failing to safely store guns, enhanced pay for police, and changes in the pretrial supervision and bail system. A record-setting number of homicides in Albuquerque this year is spurring concerns about violent crime and shortcomings of the police and justice system. In a statement Thursday, 17 House Democrats announced a lengthy list of goals for the next regular legislative session in January. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said she’ll put criminal justice initiatives on the agenda for the 30-day session that is confined to budget negotiations and a few additional governor-picked topics. Republican lawmakers are asking the Legislature to reconsider a long list of their recent crime bills that were rejected. House Democrats listed legislative goals in 16 bullet points. To address gun violence, the legislators want to place new restrictions on high-capacity magazines and establish an office of gun violence prevention. Enhanced penalties are part of the plan. Democrats want a longer statute of limitations on second-degree murder charges and tougher sanctions. A crackdown is proposed on property damage in the theft of copper and catalytic converters in automobiles.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A staff shortage at Rikers Island left two units without corrections officers for more than 24 hours last Tuesday and Wednesday, a prisoner reported, and a city oversight board said ongoing personnel problems factored in a wave of suicides in the jails since December. Two Rikers units were without corrections officers through at least through noon Wednesday, leaving inmates in the strange position of helping other inmates get to court transport and video conferences, said Terrence Ferguson, the hip-hop artist known as 2 Milly. “We are really running the dorm by ourselves. I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Ferguson, who is serving a sentence for gun possession. He said Wednesday that there had been no officer on his floor since 6 a.m. Tuesday. “I’ve been answering the phones,” he said. The two unmanned units together house about 80 prisoners. Department of Correction officials declined comment on whether parts of Rikers have gone unguarded for longer than 24 hours. But the department has acknowledged a personnel shortage. Officials have said that in July, about 3,500 of Rikers’ 8,500 officers either called in sick or were medically exempt from working with detainees. Another 2,300 just didn’t come in to work at some point. Rikers’ population has roughly doubled since July 2019.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A gay substitute teacher was wrongfully fired by a Roman Catholic school after he announced in 2014 on social media that he was going to marry his longtime partner, a federal judge has ruled. U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn ruled Friday that Charlotte Catholic High School and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Charlotte violated Lonnie Billard’s federal protections against against sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Cogburn granted summary judgment to Billard and said a trial must still be held to determine appropriate relief for him. “After all this time, I have a sense of relief and a sense of vindication. I wish I could have remained teaching all this time,” Billard said in a statement released Friday by the ACLU, which represented him in court. “Today’s decision validates that I did nothing wrong by being a gay man.” Billard taught English and drama full time at the school for more than a decade, earning its Teacher of the Year award in 2012. He then transitioned to a role as a regular substitute, according to his 2017 lawsuit. The defendants said they fired Billard not because he was gay but because “he engaged in ‘advocacy’ that went against the Catholic Church’s beliefs” when he publicly announced his engagement to another man, the ruling said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The idea to split the state’s legislative districts in half for House seats hasn’t gained traction with lawmakers, but some voters groups say the concept would benefit tribal nations that don’t have enough residents to stand alone as legislative districts. The Legislature’s Redistricting Committee meets Wednesday in Fargo as the state continues to examine redrawing legislative districts. Sen. Ray Holmberg, R-Grand Forks, who has served on redistricting committees since 1981, told the Bismarck Tribune splitting legislative districts would have to take into account tribal nations, and “that would make a difference according to how the Department of Justice views taking care of minority populations ... so we need to explore that, and it may happen,” Holmberg said. North Dakota Native Vote Executive Director Nicole Donaghy said subdistricts would allow “people on reservations to elect candidates of their choice.” She said in the past decade there have been elections encompassing the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in which “we’ve had several Native Americans run for county commission, run for a legislative seat for that district, and they were not able to be elected because of the dilution of the populations with the non-Native population that surrounds the reservation.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A Butler County judge has ruled that West Chester Hospital cannot be compelled to administer ivermectin to a COVID-19 patient. Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Oster Jr. issued the ruling Monday morning as a 14-day temporary injunction granted by another judge expired. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic treatment commonly used for livestock and recommended by the FDA to treat “infections caused by some parasitic worms” in humans, as well as head lice and rosacea. Interest in the drug as a COVID-19 treatment has spiked, fueled by endorsements from allies of former President Donald Trump and some Fox News personalities. While some studies are underway, none of the major medical organizations recommend the drug as a treatment for COVID-19, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has warned that reports of poisoning related to ivermectin have increased threefold this year. The judge said it is “impossible not to feel sympathetic” for Julie Smith, the guardian for her husband, Jeffrey Smith, 51. He’s been in the hospital since July 15, according to court documents. But the judge wrote that he must leave emotions out of the decision and must also consider the rights of the hospital and the impact that forcing a hospital to give a drug could have.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city is paying $2million to settle a former death row inmate’s federal lawsuit over his 1988 conviction for two murders. Robert Lee Miller Jr. was set free in 1998 after DNA tests implicated a convicted rapist in the deaths. Miller sued in 2019 after an Oklahoma County judge ruled he had presented sufficient evidence to establish “a prima facie case of actual innocence of the crimes.” He had sought $95 million in compensatory and punitive damages. A jury trial had been set for January. He dismissed the case Friday after the Oklahoma City Council agreed 6-0 to the $2 million settlement. The city did not admit wrongdoing. “It was a tragedy from Day One,” said his attorney, Mark H. Barrett, of Norman. “If they had got DNA done before he got tried instead of afterward, all this would have been a very different story.” Miller, 62, has talked about using the settlement to start his own house-building business, Barrett said. In the lawsuit, the attorney complained that Oklahoma City police detectives used “bizarre, unreliable and coercive techniques” in their interrogations to fabricate a case against Miller. His attorney also blamed disgraced police chemist Joyce Gilchrist for Miller’s conviction and accused the city of condoning her shoddy, unreliable and fraudulent work.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to take immediate action to improve fish passage at dams in the Willamette Basin. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that in a final opinion and order issued last week, U.S. District Judge Marco Hernandez said the Corps had for years failed to provide adequate passage for threatened chinook salmon and winter steelhead trout at dams it operates in the basin. “As evinced by the listed species’ continuing decline, the Corps’ failure to provide adequate fish passage and mitigate water quality issues is causing substantial, irreparable harm to the salmonids,” Hernandez wrote in the opinion. The order comes after the court decided in favor of three environmental organizations that sued the Corps and the National Marine Fisheries Service, arguing the agencies weren’t doing their part to protect the species. Chinook salmon and steelhead in the Upper Willamette River system are both listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Dams on the Willamette and its tributaries have blocked access to spawning grounds for the fish, contributing to population declines.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The Republican leader of the state Senate and a group of parents filed a lawsuit Friday seeking to overturn the Wolf administration’s new mask mandate for schools. The governor’s spokesperson dismissed what she called the GOP’s “effort at undermining public heath.” The suit, filed in Commonwealth Court, asserts that Acting Health Secretary Alison Beam failed to comply with state law when she ordered masks to be worn in all Pennsylvania public and private schools, as well as child care facilities. The masking order isn’t valid because it didn’t go through the state’s regulatory review process, the lawsuit said. It also accused the Wolf administration of trying to circumvent newly approved constitutional amendments limiting a governor’s emergency powers. “The Secretary of Health’s order subjects healthy, non-infected teachers, children, students, staff, and visitors ... to the wearing of face coverings,” the suit said. The plaintiffs, it said, are “not patients, they are heathy, non-infected children.” The parents said in affidavits that they intend to send their children to school without masks, claiming Beam’s order is illegal. The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the masking order. The court scheduled a hearing for Sept. 16.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nineteen fire departments are getting a total of $5.5 million in federal grants that can be used to buy new equipment and upgrade training to enhance public safety, the state’s congressional delegation said. “These grants will help lift the budgetary burden on local governments and better protect the health and safety of the public and firefighters,” Sen. Jack Reed said in a statement Friday. The Warwick Fire Department is getting the largest chunk of the grant money, including almost $900,000 for an aerial ladder truck and more than $100,000 for portable radio equipment. The East Providence Fire Department is getting more than $800,000 for paramedic training. The Newport Fire Department is receiving more than $400,000 for portable radio units, mobile repeaters and associated communications equipment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency grants are also going to departments and fire districts in Bristol; Central Falls; East Greenwich; Johnston; Lincoln; Narragansett; North Kingstown; Pascoag; Portsmouth; Providence; Prudence Island; the Rhode Island Firefighting Academy in Exeter; West Warwick; and Woonsocket.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Wildlife scientists and Riverbanks Zoo are teaming up to save endangered gopher frogs. The survival rate of the eggs and tadpoles for the frogs is extremely low, so the Department of Natural Resources finds the eggs in Lowcountry wetlands, and the zoo raises them in captivity. “It’s a matter of how we can best use our strengths for species conservation,” Natural Resources herpetologist Andrew Grosse said in a statement. Wildlife scientists are also working to restore habitat for gopher frogs so that the eggs and tadpoles have a better chance at survival when they are returned to the wild, Grosse said. The frogs live in longleaf pines and are a good indicator at the health of that environmental system. “They have a very complex life history and highly specialized habitat requirements,” Grosse said. “All of the pieces must be in place and functioning at a high level to support these fragile populations.” Several hundred frogs have been saved through the South Carolina program and similar efforts in North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia, officials said. The project is attempting to keep the frogs off the federal endangered species list. Scientists are calling it “Head Start” since it gives the frogs a head start at surviving.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem wants to pass tougher abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a Texas law banning most abortions in that state to go forward. The Texas law, which took effect Wednesday, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before many women know they’re pregnant. “Following the Supreme Court’s decision to leave the pro-life (Texas) law in place, I have directed the Unborn Child Advocate in my office to immediately review the new (Texas) law and current South Dakota laws to make sure we have the strongest pro life laws on the books in (South Dakota),” Noem said in a statement on social media Thursday. Women in South Dakota are currently barred from terminating a pregnancy after 22 weeks. Noem has previously said she wants to ban abortions completely, with no exceptions in cases of rape or incest. The Texas law authorizes private citizens to sue abortion providers and anyone involved in aiding an abortion, including someone who drives a woman to a clinic. The law is being challenged by Planned Parenthood and other groups. The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota has vowed to push back against more abortion restrictions.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order late Friday blocking Gov. Bill Lee from allowing parents to opt out of school mask requirements in Shelby County. U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman issued the temporary restraining order for the county’s schools after it was sought by the parents of two children with health problems. The parents argued in a federal lawsuit filed the week prior that the Republican governor endangered students with health conditions and hurt their ability to attend in-person classes by allowing parents to opt out of a mask mandate via an executive order. The temporary restraining order remains in effect until Sept. 17. The students attend school in the Memphis suburbs of Collierville and Germantown, which began classes Aug. 9 under a universal mask requirement issued by the Shelby County Health Department. Lee resisted implementing a statewide mask mandate for schools, and he had initially left the decision to local officials. But on Aug. 16, he signed a statewide order allowing parents to opt out of the requirement for nonmedical reasons. Hundreds of students have been attending classes without masks ever since. The parents’ lawsuit claims Lee’s order violates the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A judge has temporarily shielded some abortion clinics from being sued by the state’s largest anti-abortion group under a new law banning most abortions. The temporary restraining order was issued Friday by District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble in Austin in response to a Planned Parenthood request. Although the law remains in effect, the judge’s order shields Planned Parenthood’s clinics, specifically, from whistleblower lawsuits by the nonprofit group Texas Right to Life, its legislative director and people working in concert with the group. A hearing on a preliminary injunction request is scheduled for Sept. 13. The law, which took effect Wednesday, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around the sixth week of pregnancy and before some women realize they’re pregnant. The law also leaves enforcement to private citizens through lawsuits instead of to prosecutors through criminal charges. Planned Parenthood said in a statement Friday that the law was “already decimating abortion access in the state, as providers are forced to turn people away” once cardiac activity can be detected. It said historically, 85% to 90% of women who have gotten abortions in Texas were at least six weeks into their pregnancies.\n\nUtah\n\nFarmington: A paraplegic man who was injured on a roller coaster is now suing an amusement park, saying his paralyzed leg wasn’t properly secured while he was on the ride, and his foot was shredded. The Salt Lake Tribune reports Matthew Christensen filed the lawsuit against Lagoon Amusement Park on Thursday in Davis County’s 3rd District Court. The lawsuit said Christensen’s ligament in his big toe was “irreparably shredded,” and he suffered fractures to his lower leg, toe, and two other foot bones. A spokesman for the theme park in Farmington, north of Salt Lake City, said he couldn’t speculate on the facts of the incident, which are under investigation. “The ride in question has a lap restraint similar to others used throughout the amusement industry,” Adam Leishman said. Christensen is paralyzed from the waist down and was using a wheelchair at the park during an October 2020 visit with his family and a friend. Christensen’s son and friend helped transfer him from the wheelchair to the roller coaster car. According to the lawsuit, Christensen had the lap restraint secured correctly, but his right leg was not secured properly by the leg restraint, which caused the man’s paralyzed leg to dangle below, and he was injured when it got caught in the platform.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The first two years of a state program set up to keep patients healthier while reducing costs saved money on Medicare patients and kept more people out of the hospital, an evaluation of the program has found. The report commissioned by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and released last week looked at the first two years of Medicare participation in Vermont in what is known as the all-payer model of health care. The report found that in 2018 and 2019, the costs for Medicare patients in the system being studied saved about 4.7% from the previous year. For all of Vermont’s Medicare patients, the system saved about 6.5% over the previous year. In 2019 the system reduced by almost 18% acute care hospital stays by people in the system. It reduced the acute care days patients stayed in the hospital by 14.7% and reduced the number of people being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days by 12.4%. “Those declines are very encouraging,” Ena Backus, Vermont’s director of Health Care Reform, said Friday. The same report found the project run by the organization OneCare Vermont has not signed up as many people to participate in the system as had been hoped. In 2019 it had been hoped the program would be covering 75% of eligible Medicare patients, but it reached only 47%.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Curbside recycling pickup for some in the area has been delayed by labor shortages exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and the hot weather. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the Central Virginia Waste Management Authority has warned customers that shortages of drivers and other waste workers could cause delays. The authority oversees waste and recycling collection in 13 local jurisdictions. The authority said Friday that residential recycling pickups that normally occur on Thursdays in a number of areas have been delayed for at least a week. TFC Recycling, a Chesapeake-based company that performs collections for about 265,000 residences in the authority’s jurisdiction, said pandemic-related labor shortages also affecting other businesses have made it harder to hire and retain drivers and other workers. The summer heat has made it even harder to find people to do the hands-on work. “In the last several months, we have had some real issues trying to recruit and maintain drivers – not only drivers but helpers, too,” said Tad Phillips, general manager of TFC’s Richmond-area operations, told the newspaper. Hiring has also become harder as package delivery companies compete for some of the same workers for their trucks as people turn to online ordering during the pandemic.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Days after suing to block what is believed to be among the nation’s strictest COVID-19 employee vaccine mandates, Washington’s largest state labor union has announced a tentative agreement for Gov. Jay Inslee’s order for state workers. The Northwest News Network reports the Washington Federation of State Employees has negotiated terms for Inslee’s mandate that all 46,000 of its union members be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or lose their jobs. The Democratic governor issued the order in August, citing the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The union countered with a labor complaint, claiming Inslee’s administration was bargaining in bad faith. The new agreement, which still needs to be ratified, was announced Saturday and defines the exceptions and religious and medical exemptions process for employees who can’t or won’t get their shots. “This agreement is a victory for both public health and due process,” WFSE said in a statement. “It puts in place a fair, equitable and consistent process for members seeking a legitimate exemption to the mandate.” Anyone who is eligible to retire by the end of the year can forgo the vaccine if they use accrued or unpaid leave until they reach their retirement date.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state had one of its worst weeks of the coronavirus pandemic as the number of newly confirmed cases neared a seven-day record. The 6,705 confirmed statewide cases for the six days ending Saturday already surpassed the previous week’s total and were the fourth-highest for any week since the first case was reported in the state in March 2020, according to state health data. The record is nearly 8,200 confirmed cases for the week ending Jan. 10, followed by about 7,600 cases the week ending Jan. 3. The number of COVID-19 patients in hospital intensive care units was 216, just shy of the record 219 set on Jan. 6. On July 4, there were only 17 virus patients in hospital ICUs across the state. And the number of patients on hospital ventilators has surpassed the previous high of 104 set Jan. 10.\n\nWisconsin\n\nJunction City: The state’s cranberry crop is expected to end up being about average – or maybe even above average – by the time harvest begins in about a month. The U.S. Cranberry Marketing Committee forecast in August that Wisconsin growers will produce 4.92 million barrels this year. But Wisconsin Cranberry Growers Association Executive Director Tom Lochner said this year’s estimated crop is closer to the state’s average of 5.5 million barrels. “We still have a few weeks to go before we start harvesting, and the continued warm weather might help the fruit size up a little bit,” Lochner told Wisconsin Public Radio. Dave Hansen, manager of DuBay Cranberry Company in Junction City, said this summer’s weather was warmer and drier than he prefers, but the crop ended up looking good. Lochner said the COVID-19 pandemic has helped boost domestic sales of the fruit, with more people consuming cranberry juice and dried fruit at home, while international sales tapered off during the pandemic, perhaps due to tariffs. The European Union has maintained a 25% tariff on U.S. cranberry products. The pandemic has also created labor issues for the cranberry industry. Lochner said some growers have been working to bring in migrant workers from Southern states to help this fall.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Cheyenne-based Big Boy No. 4014 returns home Tuesday from a monthlong tour of the nation. Led by Ed Dickens, the Union Pacific Heritage Steam program’s showpiece is the massive locomotive that concluded its restoration in 2019 with a tour that marked the 150th anniversary of the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, which became known as the “overland route” that linked the nation. The steam locomotive, along with 15 support and vintage railcars, is expected to arrive at the Steam Shop in Cheyenne about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday. It should be visible on track on the east end of town starting about 1 p.m, arriving from Greeley, Colorado, its last official stop before arriving home in Cheyenne. Dickens runs the Steam Shop and the UP’s Heritage program, and he is usually found in the engineer’s seat on Big Boy while it is en route. “It’s been excellent,” he said of the 2021 tour. “Our collaboration with our colleagues across the Union Pacific has ensured that we’re consistently running on time, much to the delight of the huge crowds that have greeted us everywhere we’ve been.” The completely rebuilt vintage steam engine has performed outstandingly throughout the trip,” Dickens said. “All of the long hours we put into its restoration and continuing maintenance are paying off.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/07"}]}

Jeff Landry on June 19.\n\nIn Tuesday's decision, U.S. District Judge John deGravelles said the law conflicted with U.S. Supreme Court precedent, and violated the religious rights of people who opposed the displays, Reuters reported.\n\nThe law was challenged by parents and several groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union. They said the measure was unconstitutional and filed a lawsuit against it.\n\nJudge deGravelles was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama. Louisiana could appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, widely considered to be among the most conservative federal appeals courts, Reuters said.\n\nWhile Louisiana has drawn national attention by passing the law, it’s not the first to attempt it.\n\nOver decades, more than a dozen states have tried similar bills, including Kentucky’s landmark Stone v. Graham case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1980. Here are a few examples:\n\nWhich states have tried – or are trying to pass – Ten Commandment bills?\n\nKentucky: \\'Durable, permanent copies\\'\n\n◾ State law passed: June 1978.\n\n◾ What did the law say? A \"durable, permanent copy\" of Ten Commandments \"shall be displayed on a wall in each public elementary and secondary school classroom in the Commonwealth.\"\n\n◾ Reason for the law: A note on copies of the commandments read: \"The secular application of the Ten Commandments is clearly seen in its adoption as the fundamental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States.\"\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies? Voluntary contributions.\n\n◾ Law status: A Kentucky state trial court and the state supreme court upheld the law. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against it in a 5-4 decision in November 1980.\n\nOklahoma: \\'One of the foundations of our nation\\'\n\n◾ Introduced: Jan. 22.\n\n◾ What does the bill say? All public classrooms in Oklahoma would be required “clearly display a poster or framed copy of the Ten Commandments.”\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: \"The Ten Commandments is one of the foundations of our nation,\" said Rep. Jim Olsen, R-Roland, the bill’s sponsor. \"Publicly and proudly displaying them in public school classrooms will serve as a reminder of the ethics of our state and country.\"\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies? Not specified.\n\n◾ Bill status: Referred to the state's Appropriations and Budget Education Subcommittee on Feb. 6, where it remains.\n\nArizona: \\'We have taken the Ten Commandments away from our schools\\'\n\n◾ Introduced: Jan. 22.\n\n◾ What does the bill say? The measure adds the Ten Commandments to a list of historical documents that “a teacher or administrator in any school in this state may read or post in any school building.”\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: \"The progressive slide down in our country right now is because we have taken the Ten Commandments away from our schools,\" said bill sponsor Sen. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale, during a Feb. 22 Senate floor session.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: Not specified.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies: Not specified.\n\n◾ Bill status: The bill passed the Senate on Feb. 21 and the House on April 2. Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed the measure on April 16.\n\nUtah: \\'It is a very historical document\\'\n\n◾ Introduced: Jan. 15.\n\n◾ What the bill says: As originally filed, the measure would have required schools to post a framed copy or a poster of the Ten Commandments in “a prominent location” in every building.\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: “The Ten Commandments, while it is a religious document, is a very historical document in that it colored the way our founders wrote the Constitution, wrote the Declaration (of Independence),” said Rep. Michael Petersen, R-North Logan, the bill’s sponsor.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies: Schools would be required to “accept and display a donation of \"The Ten Commandments\" if a copy is not already on display.” No money was appropriated in the bill.\n\n◾ Bill status: The measure was changed in February. The requirement to post the Ten Commandments was dropped, but the commandments and the Magna Carta were added to a list of historical documents that educators have the option to use in curricula. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed the bill on March 20. It’s scheduled to take effect on July 1.\n\nTexas: \\'The importance of a fundamental foundation of America\\'\n\n◾ Bill passed: April 20, 2023.\n\n◾ What did the bill say? The measure would have required Texas classrooms to display a poster or framed copy of the Ten Commandments “in a conspicuous place” in every classroom.\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: Sponsor Republican state Sen. Phil King, said it would help restore lost religious liberties and remind students “of the importance of a fundamental foundation” of America, reported CNN.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: At least 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies? Public funds or private donations.\n\n◾ Law status: The Texas House did not vote on the bill before a deadline, in effect killing it.\n\nSouth Carolina: \\'Shall display in a conspicuous place\\'\n\n◾ Bill passed: May 16, 2023.\n\n◾ What did bill law say? Each public elementary, middle school, and secondary school in South Carolina “shall display in a conspicuous place in each classroom of the school a poster or framed copy of the Ten Commandments.”\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: The measure was sponsored by Republican representatives Thomas Beach, 10th District; Donald McCabe, 96th District; and Joseph White, 40th District.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies? Public funds or private donations.\n\n◾ What happened? The bill was referred to the House Committee on Education and Public Works where it remains.\n\nMonuments have also been challenged...\n\nOklahoma: \\'Symbol of historic significance for Oklahoman and American history\\'\n\n◾ Introduced: Jan. 30.\n\n◾ What does the bill say? A state senator introduced the bill to return a privately funded, 6-foot-tall, 2,000-pound red granite monument bearing Ten Commandments to the Oklahoma State Capitol “as a symbol of its historic significance for Oklahoman and American history.” The monument, installed in 2012, was ordered removed by the Oklahoma Supreme Court in 2015 because it was religious in nature and violated the state constitution’s prohibition on using state funds or property to promote religion.\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: The bill’s sponsor, Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, said Oklahoma has a strong Christian heritage and it’s important to honor it. Bullard said a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling favoring a high school football coach who prayed on the field after each game would help the bill become law.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: Not applicable.\n\n◾ Who paid for the monument: Privately funded.\n\n◾ Bill status: The measure was not assigned to a committee and was declared dead on March 1.\n\nArkansas: \\'An important component of the moral foundation of the laws and legal system\\'\n\n◾ Law passed: April 7, 2015.\n\n◾ What did the law say? The measure called for “the placing of a monument to the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Arkansas State Capitol,” with design and site selection later determined.\n\n◾ Reason for the law: The Ten Commandments are “an important component of the moral foundation of the laws and legal system of the United States of America and of the State of Arkansas,” the bill said.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments monument size: The 6-foot-tall granite monument weighed three tons.\n\n◾ Who paid for it? Private donations.\n\n◾ What happened? The monument was placed at the state capitol in June 2017 but was knocked over and broken by a protester in a car a day after installation. A replacement was installed in April 2018.\n\n◾ Law status: A lawsuit challenging the monument on First Amendment grounds of separation of church and state was later filed. A federal judge will decide if the case should be decided by the Arkansas Supreme Court.\n\nNew Mexico: \\'A historical perspective\\'\n\n◾ Monument installed: 2011.\n\n◾ Why? The city council of Bloomfield, New Mexico, approved installing a Ten Commandments monument in front of city hall in 2007. Other monuments, including those for the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, and Gettysburg Address, were installed later.\n\n◾ Reason: Bloomfield City Manager Eric Strahl said the monuments had nothing to do with religion. “It’s the Ten Commandments from a historical perspective,” he said.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments monument size: The 5-foot-high stone monument weighed 3,400 lbs.\n\n◾ Who paid for it? Private donations.\n\n◾ What happened? A lawsuit was filed against the monument on First Amendment grounds. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled in November 2016 that the monument violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and ordered it removed.\n\n◾ Monument status: The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in October 2017, in effect letting the appeals court ruling stand.\n\nWhere else have Ten Commandments displays been disputed?\n\nOhio, 2019: A middle school in New Philadelphia removed a 1920s-era plaque that contained the Ten Commandments after objections from the Freedom From Religion Foundation on grounds of separation of church and state in 2019.\n\nTennessee: 2004: Rutherford County was sued by the ACLU for displaying the Ten Commandments in the lobby of a county courthouse. A judge ordered their removal, but a county sheriff was allowed to keep them in his office.\n\nMississippi, 2003: A Senate bill that would have allowed the Ten Commandments to be displayed on school district properties across the state was introduced in 2003. It later died in an education committee.\n\nAlabama, 2003: A federal appeals judge ordered the removal of a 2.5-ton Ten Commandment monument from the state's Judicial Building grounds after ruling it violated the Establishment clause of the First Amendment.\n\nIndiana, 2002: The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Gov. Frank O'Bannon on the proposed installation of a 7-foot monument bearing the Ten Commandments on statehouse grounds. That let stand an appeals court decision that prohibited the monument.\n\nContributing: Barbara Hoberock, The Oklahoman\n\nSource: USA TODAY Network reporting and research; Reuters; Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute; supreme.findlaw.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/06/23/louisiana-ten-commandments-law-constitution-supreme-court/74162388007/", "title": "Why Louisiana wants Ten Commandments law to reach Supreme ...", "text": "Spend enough time listening to politicians, and eventually, one of them will tell you the truth.\n\n\"I can't wait to be sued,\" Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry declared four days before signing a law last week mandating that all public school classrooms – from kindergarten to college – display a Protestant Christian version of the Ten Commandments.\n\nLandry made that declaration not in his state's Capitol but nearly 600 miles away in Nashville, Tennessee, where he was the keynote speaker at a fundraiser for the Tennessee Republican Party.\n\nCourting his party's Christian nationalists with controversy is an excellent way to boost a fella's national profile. Getting sued and maybe having that case go to the U.S. Supreme Court, where a few justices might be willing to toss overboard decades of precedent, is even better.\n\nLandry was so giddy about those prospects that he didn't even notice when a young girl standing behind him during Wednesday's signing ceremony fainted and collapsed to the floor.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses,\" Landry said as others rushed to the girl's aid and an analogy about priorities was born.\n\nWhat's the takeaway? This has nothing to do with children or education and everything to do with rolling back constitutional protection of and from religion.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry doesn't seem to care about the hypocrisy of his Ten Commandments law\n\nThe first 10 words of the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights in America's Constitution are about protecting us from the kinds of laws Landry just signed.\n\n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" it starts, before adding \"or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\n\nThe Bill of Rights is a list of priorities. Most people put the most important stuff at the top when drawing up a list.\n\nThe Supreme Court since 1947 has held that the First Amendment guaranteeing for freedom from religion and freedom of religion – known as the establishment clause – applies to state governments.\n\nLandry may very well get that lawsuit he's so excited about\n\nHeather Weaver is as eager to sue Landry as he is to be sued. A lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, Weaver told me that a lawsuit is coming this week – because this issue was already settled by the Supreme Court 44 years ago when it struck down a Kentucky law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in classrooms.\n\nThe nation's highest court also ruled in 2005 that three Kentucky counties violated the establishment clause by displaying the Ten Commandments in courthouses and public schools.\n\nBoth cases were 5-4 rulings, with conservative justices on the losing side.\n\nThis is a different Supreme Court, with a conservative supermajority stocked with justices – Samuel Alito comes to mind – convinced that Christians in America are somehow under threat. Alito made that claim in a college speech in May and was secretly recorded this month agreeing with an undercover liberal activist who told him that America should return to a \"place of godliness.\"\n\nRichard C. Schragger, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, said some justices have been open in recent rulings to personal displays of religiosity in secular public spaces. The court in 2022 sided with a public high school football coach who lost his job for praying on the field after games.\n\nProtecting elections: Republicans wail about secure elections while slashing funding for election security\n\nThe Louisiana law could bridge those individual actions to institutional displays because it leans into a legal test favored by some justices about religion reflecting not just faith but history and tradition.\n\n\"I think they are leaning in the direction of permitting these kinds of religious practices in school and elsewhere,\" Schragger told me. \"I think that test is designed to be more sympathetic to those kinds of practices.\"\n\nWould the Supreme Court upend precedents?\n\nRachel Laser, who leads Americans United for Separation of Church and State, will join the ACLU in the lawsuit. She agrees that Landry is eager to have that fight at the Supreme Court.\n\n\"It's no secret that the Supreme Court is sympathetic to the Christian nationalist agenda with the way they've been ruling in many cases,\" Laser said. \"The court's rulings are emboldening Christian nationalists to try to get cases before them that upends long-standing precedents in ways that favor conservative Christianity over America's commitment to religious freedoms for all.\"\n\nAnnie Laurie Gaylor, co-founder of the Freedom from Religion Foundation, is also joining the lawsuit and thinks the coalition has a good chance of winning. She noted that the high school football coach case involved players the court saw as voluntarily joining him in prayer. The Louisiana law mandates the Ten Commandments in a \"coercive\" environment because students have to attend class.\n\nBut Gaylor expects more to come. States controlled by conservative Republicans are rushing to push religion into public spaces. A similar proposal in Texas failed to become law last year.\n\n\"Christian nationalists have never seen a bad idea they didn't want to replicate,\" Gaylor told me.\n\nThe hope is that the Supreme Court justices will follow the established laws despite their own beliefs\n\nNelson Tebbe, a professor at Cornell University's Law School, also told me he thinks a majority of the Supreme Court will reject the Louisiana law, even if some justices want to embrace it.\n\n\"Under current law and current precedent that's binding on Louisiana and binding on the Supreme Court itself, this Louisiana law is flagrantly unconstitutional,\" Tebbe said.\n\nI hope he's right. I hope a majority of justices, many of whom claim to value the original intent of the men who wrote the Constitution, stick with the guiding principles in the establishment clause.\n\nThat calls for faith in our government, which lately seems more interested in testing that faith than in living up to it.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Chris Brennan on X, formerly known as Twitter: @ByChrisBrennan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/12/flag-ladies-bees-vets-hovenweep-news-around-states/40116369/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: The state had already spent almost $60 million on a toll bridge project before the governor pronounced the project “dead.” Alabama Department of Transportation spokesman Tony Harris says the department spent about $40 million since 1997 on alignment studies, preliminary engineering and other costs. He says the state also spent another $19.6 million to buy land for the bridge. The proposed bridge across Mobile Bay would have had tolls of up to $6. Gov. Kay Ivey’s pronouncement late last month that the project was “dead” came after the Eastern Shore Metropolitan Planning Organization removed the bridge from the area’s transportation plan. The project must be in the plan detailing the region’s transportation priorities to qualify for federal funding.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A new group hopes to overhaul the state’s oil and gas tax credit system through a ballot initiative called the Fair Share Act. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports the group hopes to enact the proposal into law in 2020. The group includes former Democratic state Sen. Joe Paskvan, who previously served as Senate Resources Committee chair. Group steering committee member Robin Brena says the initiative would only apply to three of the state’s large oil fields. Brena says Prudhoe Bay, Alpine and Kuparuk produced an average daily minimum of 40,000 barrels of oil in the last calendar year. The initiative would increase the gross minimum production tax for those fields from the current 4% to 10%. The measure would also increase net production tax.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Thirsty wildlife are getting help from the state. The Arizona Game and Fish Department has hauled more than 1.5 million gallons of water to 3,000 catchments around the state this year. Hot temperatures and a dry monsoon season are fueling the need. A fourth of the state is in moderate drought, and almost all of it is abnormally dry. The Game and Fish Department has collected more than $72,000 in donations since June to help with the water deliveries. They say the water keeps animals alive and away from urban areas. The donations have been used to replace tires on water trucks, rent water trucks and offset the cost of a water trailer. Officials also airlifted water to catchments near Kingman for bighorn sheep.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The legislator who sponsored a measure requiring a Ten Commandments statue at the state Capitol is asking that video from his deposition in a lawsuit challenging the monument only be available to attorneys in the case, citing concerns that it could be used to harass him. An attorney for state Sen. Jason Rapert asked a federal judge Wednesday to issue an order limiting the use of any deposition video in the lawsuit challenging the display’s constitutionality. The Republican sponsored the 2015 law requiring the privately funded monument on Capitol grounds. The monument was installed at the Capitol last year, less than a year after a man crashed his car into the original statue. Rapert’s attorney cited concerns that an edited version of the video could distributed online to embarrass the lawmaker.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state Senate has passed a bill that would give new wage and benefit protections to workers at so-called gig economy companies like Uber and Lyft. The 29-11 vote late Tuesday sends the bill back to the state Assembly for final approval over strident Republican opposition. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has said he supports it. The proposal has drawn staunch opposition from on-demand delivery and ridesharing companies while winning support from many of the Democratic presidential contenders. It puts into law a California Supreme Court decision making it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors. The bill would make those companies classify their workers as employees instead. While its impact on gig economy companies has drawn most of the attention, it would affect a wide array of industries.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An effort to recall two state senators has ended after backers informed the secretary of state’s office that they will not be turning in the signatures they collected to force special elections to remove the pair. The recall effort involved Democratic Sens. Pete Lee, of Colorado Springs, and Brittany Pettersen, of Lakewood. The failed effort comes after the backers of a campaign to recall Democratic Gov. Jared Polis last week didn’t collect enough signatures to seek removing him from office. An effort to remove Rep. Tom Sullivan, D-Centennial, from office also was abandoned this summer. There is still one active legislative recall campaign in the works. An effort to oust Senate President Leroy Garcia, D-Pueblo, has until Oct. 18 to collect 13,506 signatures.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Connecticut’s state parks saw an increase of hundreds of thousands of visitors this season. State park officials and advocates believe that’s due in part to sunny weekends and a 2-year-old program that provides free admittance for vehicles with a Connecticut license plate. Rough estimates indicate there’s been a roughly 10% percent increase in traffic to the parks this season compared to last season, which was the first year of the Passport to Parks initiative. There was also an estimated 10% jump in attendance in 2018. State Parks Director Tom Tyler says there has also been an approximate 10% increase in out-of-state parking fees. Connecticut’s parks receive roughly 10 million visitors annually. The passport program is being credited with encouraging people to make shorter visits, freeing up space for other visitors.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A woman who thought she couldn’t have children says she unexpectedly gave birth in her sister’s bathroom without showing any symptoms before delivering. Wilmington resident Carla Collazo says pregnancy tests came back negative, and she hadn’t experienced weight gain or nausea ahead of self-delivering a baby girl in the toilet last month. As the ambulance arrived, her sister tied off the umbilical cord with a shoestring. The women say the baby was born about six weeks early and weighed under 3 pounds. She’s recovering in the hospital, but Collazo says she’s healthy. Collazo says she always wanted a child but thought a medical condition would prevent her. Now, the new mom says she’s shocked and happy to have her “miracle baby.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: For the first time, the Metropolitan Police Department has publicly released detailed stop-and-frisk data, WUSA-TV reports. In its “Stop Data Report” released Monday, Metro Police admits that a disproportionate number of the people stopped by D.C. police officers are black. April Goggans of Black Lives Matter DC says the significance of the department’s admission is important. “They can’t hide it anymore,” Goggans says. D.C. police studied a recent four-week period from July 22 to Aug. 18 and found that 70% of people stopped by its officers were black. As of July 2018, D.C.’s population was 46.4% African American and 45.6% white, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: One of only a handful of orange juice processing plants left in the state stopped processing fruit Tuesday in yet another sign of the havoc that imported juice, diseases and Hurricane Irma have had on the fortunes of the state’s signature crop. Officials at U.S. Sugar-owned Southern Gardens Citrus announced the end of processing at its plant in southwest Florida a month before the start of the next growing season in Florida. Southern Gardens will have its fruit processed at other plants. It will bring the juice back for storage and then distribution to its customers. Shipping, growing and research operations also will continue at the plant, company officials said. Company officials said the plant was built a quarter-century ago to process 20 million boxes of fruit, but it only processed 6.5 million boxes of citrus last year.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Public universities could see overall state funding increase next year, despite guidance from Gov. Brian Kemp to trim budgets this year and next. The state Board of Regents voted Tuesday to recommend a $75 million increase in the system’s budget for the year that will begin next July. The increase points to one aspect of Kemp’s call for 4% budget cuts this year and 6% next year: Many expensive education and health programs are exempted. Regents set $11 million in cuts this year and $16.5 million next year, some from agencies that don’t touch students. Decreases are outweighed by increases requested next year because of rising enrollment and expanding campuses. Of $27.5 billion the General Assembly appropriated this year, more than $15 billion is budgeted for education.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A senior University of Hawaii official says losing the Thirty Meter Telescope could mean losing billions of dollars in research funding over the next few decades. University of Hawaii Vice President for Research and Innovation Vassilis Syrmos tells the Honolulu Star-Advertiser not building the advanced telescope on the summit of Mauna Kea could impair the school’s ability to attract research dollars. He says the university is expecting to receive billions for TMT-related astronomy research and instrumentation development from the National Science Foundation. Syrmos says the funding will go elsewhere if the telescope isn’t built in Hawaii. Some Native Hawaiians oppose building the telescope on Mauna Kea because they believe its summit is sacred. Protesters have been blocking the road to the summit since mid-July to prevent construction from getting underway.\n\nIdaho\n\nAlmo: A daredevil sport in which an individual attempts to walk across a rope or nylon strap suspended high above the ground has been banned at a national reserve and state park in south-central Idaho. Officials at the state-managed City of Rocks National Reserve and Castle Rocks State Park say the ban took effect Aug. 28 after several highlining episodes among the towering, rocky outcrops. Superintendent Wallace Keck tells The Times-News that officials want to analyze the potential effects of the sport before possibly allowing it to continue. Keck says some potential considerations include views being marred by ropes stretched between pinnacles, damage to the area and illegally anchoring ropes on federal land within the reserve.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The wife of a powerful city alderman facing federal corruption allegations will become the Illinois Supreme Court’s next chief justice. The state’s highest court selected Anne Burke this week. The 13-year veteran of the court will start her three-year term Oct. 26. A court statement says she’ll be the third female chief justice on the 200-year-old court, following current Justice Rita Garman and late Justice Mary Ann McMorrow. She’ll succeed Chief Justice Lloyd Karmeier. Burke’s husband, Ed Burke, has been on Chicago’s City Council for 50 years. He was charged this year with trying to extort executives seeking city remodeling permits. He has pleaded not guilty. Because it is a federal case, no appellate issues related to it would come before the state Supreme Court.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Bureau of Motor Vehicles says the state’s attorney general has stalled a measure that would allow people to change their gender on driver’s licenses and IDs. Bureau spokeswoman Susan Guyer tells The Journal Gazette that Attorney General Curtis Hill declined to sign off on the rule because the public wasn’t sufficiently informed of the plan. The bureau proposed the rule that would require a birth certificate or a special state Department of Health form to change gender on licenses and IDs. It was slated to become effective in October. Hill’s decision last week jeopardizes the department’s plan to allow gender change on a birth certificate with a physician’s statement. The move isn’t a formal rejection, but it puts the rule on hold while changes are considered.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Secretary of State Paul Pate has launched a drive to get schools involved in registering young voters. The Legislature passed a law in May 2017 that lowered the voter registration age to 17 as of Jan. 1 of this year. Under the new law, those who will be 18 in time for the next general election also may participate in primary elections. Pate on Tuesday announced plans to award schools that register at least 90% of their eligible students to vote with the Carrie Chapman Catt Award, named after the Iowan who was a national leader in the women’s suffrage movement. He encouraged schools to organize voter registration events on Sept. 24, which is National Voter Registration Day.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The state’s farmers have begun planting their next year’s winter wheat crops. The National Agricultural Statistics Service reported Monday that 1% of the winter wheat has now been planted in Kansas. That is near the average for this time of year. The agency also reports that 4% of the corn in the state has now been cut, near the 8% average for this point in the season. About 28% of the corn has matured. Other major field crops also are making progress as harvest nears in Kansas. About 89% of soybean crops are setting pods, and 7% are dropping leaves. The government is also reporting that 3% of the sorghum in the state is now mature.\n\nKentucky\n\nElizabethtown: Officials with Kentucky State Police say a new Victim Advocacy Program will provide needed support for crime victims. A statement from the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet says details of the statewide initiative are being announced Thursday at the Kentucky State Police post in Elizabethtown. Officials say 16 advocates are being hired and trained to assist crime victims and those involved with critical incidents by providing support during and after a crisis. The statement says funding will come from the Victims of Crime Act and partnerships with statewide agencies.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Visitors to the Big Easy who want to learn more about cocktails will soon have a new place to go. The Sazerac Co., a Louisiana-based spirits maker, is opening the Sazerac House on Oct. 2. The six-story building houses multiple floors of exhibits as well as a gift shop and the company’s headquarters. Visitors can walk through and learn about the city’s cocktail culture and the various spirits the Sazerac Company makes, especially those used in the signature New Orleans drink called the Sazerac. Rye whiskey – a key ingredient in the cocktail – will be made on site. But the first batch won’t be ready for six years. Tasting is encouraged. Free samples will be given to visitors, and there will be special classes and tastings daily.\n\nMaine\n\nFreeport: Three women who’ve been waving the Stars and Stripes each week since the 9/11 attacks are folding up their flags. The tradition started after the terrorist attacks 18 year ago. With the nation reeling, Elaine Greene wanted to do something to help. She grabbed a flag and began waving it. Motorists honked their approval. The simple patriotic act has played out weekly ever since then. But JoAnn Miller, Carmen Footer and Greene did more than wave flags. They mailed care packages to troops deployed in the war on terror. They visited the wounded and attended funerals. Greene, who’s the youngest at 74, says age is taking a toll. She said Wednesday marked the end of the weekly tradition, but the women will remain active.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Baltimore Symphony Orchestra musicians have filed a complaint with a federal agency accusing orchestra management of unfair labor practices. News outlets report the charge was filed Tuesday with the National Labor Relations Board. The musicians say the orchestra hasn’t bargained in good faith regarding wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. A bargaining session between the musicians and management ended without an agreement Monday. Musicians picketed with their instruments Tuesday. The first performance of the 2019-2020 season is scheduled for Saturday. The orchestra canceled its summer programming earlier this year, and musicians said they were losing 12 weeks of pay. The orchestra locked out its musicians in June when contract and salary negotiations stalled.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A man who pulled four people from a burning car has been honored with a civilian bravery award named for a flight attendant on a hijacked jetliner that was flown into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. Ross Dugan received the Madeline Amy Sweeney award on Wednesday, the 18th anniversary of the attacks. Dugan, a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority electrician, was on Route 24 in West Bridgewater in February when he saw the burning vehicle. Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said that “without regard for his own life,” Dugan pulled four people to safety. Dugan, who suffered burns, said he was “incredibly humbled.” Sweeney, of Acton, was a flight attendant aboard American Airlines Flight 11. She was credited with quietly providing authorities on the ground with key details about the unfolding attack.\n\nMichigan\n\nMackinac Island: The owners of the iconic Grand Hotel say they’ve reached a tentative deal to sell it to a private equity firm. The Musser family announced the deal with KSL Capital Partners on Tuesday. They are expected to close within 30 days. Terms were not disclosed. The 397-room hotel was built in 1887 on the island in the Straits of Mackinac that separates Michigan’s Upper and Lower peninsulas. The Mussers have owned it since the 1930s. Dan Musser III said in a release that the decision to transfer ownership was not taken lightly. KSL principal Michael Mohapp said the firm “understands the importance of Grand Hotel to Mackinac Island, the state of Michigan and beyond, as well as its history, charm and traditions.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nUlen: Classmates of a teenager recently killed in a car crash have honored her memory in a special way. Alivia Mortensen was posthumously crowed homecoming queen at Ulen-Hitterdal Secondary School this week. The 17-year-old standout athlete and honor student died in a crash in Clay County on June 2, just days after finishing her junior year. KFGO reports school counselor Kim Skjold explains that last spring before school was out, Alivia was selected as a candidate for homecoming queen. Skjold says that when the senior class and senior court were making a selection this summer, the students decided there was no better person to receive the honor than Mortensen. Her family agreed. Members attended Monday night’s coronation and accepted the crown in Alivia’s honor.\n\nMississippi\n\nSeminary: A white man has received an 11-year prison sentence for his part in burning a cross near the home of an African American family. The Justice Department says 38-year-old Louie Bernard Revette was sentenced Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Keith Starrett in Hattiesburg. Revette pleaded guilty in April to one count each of interference with housing rights, which is a federal civil rights violation, and of using fire during the commission of a felony. Revette acknowledged recruiting someone to help him build a cross to burn near the home of a juvenile in a predominantly black area of Seminary in 2017. He also acknowledged building the cross to threaten, frighten and intimidate people because of their race. His accomplice pleaded guilty in August and awaits sentencing in November.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: An audit report shows taxpayers spent more than $200,000 to defend former Gov. Eric Greitens’ use of a self-deleting text message app. A 2017 lawsuit alleged Greitens’ office used the app Confide to subvert state open records laws. The case was dismissed in July. Greitens resigned last year amid allegations of sexual misconduct and campaign violations. The Kansas City Star reports that state Auditor Nicole Galloway conducted the routine audit. Her report released Wednesday says most of the money funded private attorneys to represent the governor’s office in the lawsuit. Nearly $23,000 came from the state legal expense fund administered by the attorney general’s office. The governor’s office paid the remainder.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A federal appeals court says a state law that restricts automated telephone calls about political campaigns violates the First Amendment’s free-speech protections. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that so-called robocalls can’t be regulated based on the content of their messages. The ruling that strikes down the 1991 Montana law barring political robocalls also applies to the eight other Western states within the 9th Circuit’s jurisdiction. The judges say the court has previously upheld state laws that regulate robocalls, such as those that aim to protect consumers from scams. But they say restricting a robocall based on its content is a different matter. The opinion written by Judge Richard Paez says that “prohibiting political robocalls strikes at the heart of the First Amendment.”\n\nNebraska\n\nGering: A checkout program for sensory backpacks is now available at the Wildcat Hills Nature Center in the Nebraska Panhandle. Amanda Filipi, a Nebraska Game and Parks Commission outdoor education specialist based at the center, says she learned of sensory backpacks after her nephew was diagnosed on the autism spectrum. The backpack’s contents are designed to stimulate the senses and serve as a calming kit for youths who face anxiety during field trips and other busy events at the center. The contents include sunglasses, noise-dampening earmuffs, books and a variety of sensory toys. The backpacks complement a number of quiet spaces that have been designated in the building.\n\nNevada\n\nIncline Village: The sixth annual Labor Day beach cleanup at Lake Tahoe did more than just remove 168 pounds of trash from the shoreline. It also apparently provided clues to help design new strategies to keep cigarette butts and other garbage from ending up there in the first place. Sixty-five volunteers removed 2,751 pieces of single-use plastic and 1,997 cigarette butts from Kings Beach. Maroliee Movius, the League to Save Lake Tahoe’s community engagement manager, told the Sierra Sun they used earlier data to help determine the locations where nine new cigarette canisters recently were installed around the lake. The league plans to eventually install 250 of the canisters as part of a joint program with the Tahoe Water Suppliers Association.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: A small but growing number of veterans around the country are turning to beekeeping as a potential treatment for anxiety, PTSD and other conditions. Veterans Affairs has begun offering beekeeping at a few facilities including in New Hampshire, and researchers are starting to study whether the practice has therapeutic benefits. For now, there is little hard data, but veterans in programs like the one at the Manchester VA Medical Center in New Hampshire insist that beekeeping helps them focus, relax and become more productive. While some programs are geared to helping veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, others have a broader mandate. Their main goal is to expose veterans to beekeeping, and relief from PTSD or anxiety is an added benefit.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nGlen Rock: Local pups will spend an evening at the pool next Monday to celebrate a new dog park dedicated to 9/11 search-and-rescue dogs. The Doggie Swim Day will be held at the municipal kiddie pool. The long-awaited bark park is opening on a 1-acre patch of land off Doremus Avenue. The dog park is a volunteer effort. Launched by resident Michelle Hillock in 2013, the initiative evolved into a 501(c)3 nonprofit dedicated to the construction and upkeep of the dog park funded entirely by donations. The Doggie Swim Day, open to residents only, will be at the Glen Rock municipal pool on Doremus Avenue. Registration is required, and there are two swim times: small dogs from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. and big dogs from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nFarmington: State environmental officials are working on plans to address ozone pollution as a number of counties are pushing the limit set by federal regulators. A monitor near Navajo Lake in northwestern New Mexico has met the ozone limit of 70 parts per billion set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. San Juan County is one of seven New Mexico counties that exceed 95% of the national ambient air quality standard for ozone. The others are Eddy, Lea, Dona Ana, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Valencia. The state Environment Department is holding meetings and drafting ozone attainment plans. Right now, any measures taken to lower ozone levels will be voluntary. But if a county goes into non-attainment status, the measures become mandatory.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The artist who created New York’s Charging Bull sculpture will oversee repairs to the statue after a vandal damaged it with a metal banjo. The head of a downtown Manhattan business association says artist Arturo Di Modica plans to travel from Sicily at the end of the month to supervise repairs to the bull. Police say 42-year-old Tevon Varlack, of Texas, bashed the bull repeatedly with a metal, banjo-like object Saturday. The attack left the bronze beast with a gash at the base of its right horn. Bowling Green Alliance chairman Arthur Piccolo said Tuesday that the upstate New York foundry Polich Tallix has been retained to repair the statue. Varlack was charged with criminal mischief and disorderly conduct. Legal Aid lawyers who are representing him declined to comment.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will get some much-needed money to help with mounting repair costs incurred in response to devastating hurricanes and other storms. The Federal Highway Administration said in a statement Tuesday that North Carolina would get $51 million for the cost of repairing roads and bridges. Most of the money is for damage incurred by Hurricane Florence in eastern North Carolina last year. There’s also money related to the damage from a 2018 storm that caused landslides in western North Carolina. Steve Abbott, a spokesman for the North Carolina Department of Transportation, said the money provide some relief for the storm-ravaged state. North Carolina has recently incurred hundreds of millions of unanticipated storm costs.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A federal judge on Tuesday blocked a state law enacted earlier this year that required physicians to tell women they may reverse a so-called medication abortion if they have second thoughts. North Dakota is among eight states to pass or amend laws requiring doctors to tell women undergoing medication abortions they can still have a live birth after the procedure. The North Dakota law also would require doctors to tell the patient that “time is of the essence” if she changes her mind. Tammi Kromenaker, director of North Dakota’s sole abortion clinic in Fargo, which filed a lawsuit in June, said in a statement that the law would force doctors to give false information that is not backed up by science. ‘It’s simple,” Kromenaker said. “Patients need to be able to trust their providers.”\n\nOhio\n\nAkron: A call for reading material for a jail’s newly reopened library resulted in thousands of donated books. Rebecca McCutcheon, director of inmate services for Summit County Jail, told the Akron Beacon Journal that the jail collected close to 15,000 books in a week after posting the request on Facebook. The jail is no longer accepting books, but McCutcheon says officials hope to continue to increase services for prisoners. She says the facility had struggled following a round of staff layoffs in August 2009. The implementation of recommendations from a jail advisory commission has allowed the facility to reopen the library and gym. The jail also lowered overtime costs, added hundreds of cameras and hired six full-time inmate services employees.\n\nOklahoma\n\nMcAlester: A judge has granted a prosecutor’s request to withhold the video of a fatal police shooting. Pittsburg County District Court Judge Mike Hogan on Tuesday granted District Attorney Charles Sullivan’s motion to quash an open records request for the video of the July 17 shooting of 35-year-old Mark Anson Schoggins. Police say he was shot following a police chase after he reportedly stole items from a liquor store. The officers’ names haven’t been released. Sullivan acknowledged the video is public record but said there are exceptions if it shows a death or severe violence or is part of an ongoing investigation. Sullivan told the McAlester News-Capital he hasn’t received an Oklahoma Highway Patrol report on its investigation. The newspaper and attorney Brecken Wagner requested the video.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A weekend news anchor and TV reporter is doubling down on her preference for high-waisted pants after a male viewer told her to “dress like a normal woman” in a message sent to her Facebook work account. Maggie Vespa, who works at Portland’s NBC affiliate KGW-TV, posted photos of herself wearing a different pair of high-waisted pants on five separate newscasts over the weekend because she wanted to draw attention to the pressure that women who work in the public eye face daily. Vespa also delivered an on-air commentary about the remarks on Sunday’s late-night news with the support of her managers. Her male co-workers were shocked by the content of the man’s messages, she said, but this kind of incident is not new for women who work on TV.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWest Mifflin: A Pittsburgh-area amusement park’s newest and biggest attraction has won an industry award as best new roller coaster of the year. Kennywood’s Steel Curtain won the Golden Ticket honor for best new coaster awarded by Amusement Today, an industry publication. The Steel Curtain is in the park’s new Steelers Country section, a collaboration with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The 4,000-foot-long coaster contains nine inversions, which park officials say is the most in North America, and the world’s tallest inversion at 197 feet. It also placed second as 2019’s best new attraction installation. Kennywood is in West Mifflin, about 10 miles southeast of downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A city official is proposing a 24-hour nightlife district to concentrate the capital’s nightlife in a manageable area outside residential neighborhoods. Board of Licenses Chairman Dylan Conley says clubs located within such a district would be allowed to serve alcohol and provide entertainment 24 hours a day. Conley says creating a space that is easier to police would solve problems faced by having nightclubs scattered in various neighborhoods. Regulations would change to allow bottle service and exemptions from noise ordinances. Ward 11 City Councilwoman Mary Kay Harris says she and her constituents would be disproportionately affected and were left out of the conversation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A court ruling says online retailer Amazon owes the state likely millions of dollars in sales taxes from other vendors who use the company’s website. The South Carolina Administrative Law Court ruled Tuesday that Amazon has the responsibility to collect taxes due from transactions made through its website. The State newspaper reports Amazon had argued the third-party retailers were responsible for paying the taxes. The ruling says the state Revenue Department will determine how much Amazon should pay. Lawmakers tried to clarify the situation with a law passed earlier this year specifying retailers must collect sales taxes from third-party vendors who sell to shoppers in the state. Amazon says it disagrees with the ruling but appreciates the new law in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The Game, Fish and Parks Commission is weighing whether to raise fees by nearly $3 million next year. The commission says declining revenues and the need to repair flood damage may mean visitors paying more to enter state parks and campgrounds. State Director of Parks and Recreation Scott Simpson says entrance fees and camping fees are the primary funding source for South Dakota’s nearly $40 million parks and recreation budget. Simpson says park entrance fees were last raised in 2013, and camping fees were last increased in 2014. The public has 30 days to comment on the proposal. The commission will hold a public hearing Oct. 3 as it finalizes the proposal at its next meeting in Chamberlain.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Music Pathways trail has a new stop, the Tennessee State Museum. The museum says it has been designated as a stop on the state Tourist Development Department’s trail. A sign near the Nashville museum’s Rosa L. Parks entrance marks the designation. There is also an entry on the Music Pathways website recognizing the museum’s role in preserving the state’s music legacy. “The State of Sound: Tennessee’s Musical Heritage” is on exhibition through February at the museum. The displays show the people, places and events that developed Tennessee’s music center. Included are an early parlor guitar from Pulaski, images and records connected to the Fisk Jubilee Singers, a bow tie worn by Jimmy Rodgers and a performance outfit worn by Isaac Hayes.\n\nTexas\n\nLaredo: The Trump administration is ready to open a tent court on the state’s southern border to help handle tens of thousands of cases of asylum-seekers forced to wait in Mexico, with hearings held entirely by videoconference. The court – or “soft-sided” facility, as U.S. officials call it – is scheduled to begin operations Monday in Laredo. Another is expected to open soon in Brownsville in the Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. The administration introduced its “Remain in Mexico” policy in San Diego in January and later expanded it to El Paso, but hearings there are conducted inside large buildings with normal courtrooms, and the judge usually appears in person.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The U.S. government is allowing oil and gas companies to make lease bids on lands considered archaeologically sensitive near a national monument that houses sacred tribal sites. Included in the Bureau of Land Management’s September oil and gas lease sale is about 47 square miles of land north of Hovenweep National Monument, a group of prehistoric villages overlooking a canyon with connections to several indigenous tribes throughout the U.S. Southwest. The parcels for lease are about five to 20 miles north of the monument. Hovenweep was designated as an International Dark Sky Park in 2014 for its striking night skies and star-gazing opportunities. Business owners in Bluff say the dark skies drive tourism to Hovenweep and worry the industrial light pollution, as well as the sounds and smells of energy development, could drive visitors away.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington: State Attorney General T.J. Donovan and advocates are asking residents to speak out against the Trump administration’s proposed changes to the federal food stamp program that they say will affect more than 5,000 households in Vermont, including over 4,000 children. They say the proposed changes to the eligibility for benefits would cost Vermont families about $7.5 million in food benefits. They also say the changes to Vermont’s program – 3SquaresVT – would also affect the eligibility of children to get free and reduced meals at schools. The USDA said it would close “a loophole” enabling people to be eligible automatically for the federal program. Donovan’s asking Vermonters to send comments against the proposal by Sept. 23 on Hunger Free Vermont’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: An Episcopal seminary in northern Virginia is starting a $1.7 million reparations fund to make up for its reliance on slave labor in the 19th century. The Virginia Theological Seminary announced the fund’s creation last week. The endowment will be used for a variety of purposes, including assistance to any descendants of slaves who worked there. The seminary was founded in 1823 by a group that included “Star-Spangled Banner” author Francis Scott Key. Enslaved workers helped build the campus and worked there after its creation. The money will also be used to support black clergy in the Episcopal Church, promote justice and inclusion, and support the needs of local African American congregations connected to the seminary.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has adopted a resolution acknowledging violence against indigenous women and girls and vowing to address the crisis. The Seattle Times reports the resolution says the city will hire a special liaison, invest in human services, consult with tribal governments, improve data collection and train police. It doesn’t on its own allocate money immediately, but sponsor Councilmember Debora Juarez said she believed the detailed measure would soon lead to positive changes. “We will be invisible no more,” said Juarez, who grew up on the Puyallup Reservation in Tacoma and is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation. A report last year by the Seattle Indian Health Board, using research from 71 U.S. cities, identified 506 cases of missing or murdered indigenous women and girls since 1943. It identified 45 cases in Seattle, more than in any other city studied.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWelch: A public-private group is hailing the start of construction for apartment-style housing for public school teachers in impoverished McDowell County. Officials for Reconnecting McDowell held a groundbreaking ceremony for the $8 million Renaissance Village housing project Monday. The housing project is the centerpiece of a decadelong effort to revitalize the county’s schools and economy and is an effort to attract and retain teachers. The building will have 16 apartments on two floors alongside two additional floors of retail and commercial space. Original plans called for up to five floors of apartments but turned out to be too expensive. It’s the first new multistory construction in the community of 1,800 residents in more than 50 years. Construction is expected to take about a year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration scrapped a public website created under his Republican predecessor to track compliance on public records requests, a move criticized in a report issued Monday by a conservative law firm. Doing away with the website dashboard is one example of a step backward in open record compliance that’s occurred between Scott Walker’s administration and Evers, says the report from the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty. The report accuses Evers of slow response times, disorganization and a lack of transparency on open records issues. Evers disputed many of the report’s key findings, with his spokesman Melissa Baldauff saying Evers is actually responding more quickly to requests than did Walker.\n\nWyoming\n\nGrand Teton National Park: Park officials are trying to determine if some of the park’s 11 glaciers are still moving or if they are now remnant glaciers or ice patches. The Post Register reports the park is making an effort to better understand Teton, Middle Teton, Schoolroom, Petersen and Falling Ice glaciers. National park glaciologist Simeon Caskey says it will take about a decade to gather enough information to see how the park’s glaciers fit in with climate change models. Scientists are using GPS readings from the surface of the glaciers, time-lapse photos and stakes to examine the glaciers. Experts say the park’s glaciers formed during the Little Ice Age from about 600 to 150 years ago.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/14/rock-slides-wreak-havoc-close-encounters-great-white-shark-gray-whale-news-around-states/111319834/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: Hartselle schools called off classes Thursday because water from a rising creek flooded a water pumping station, the Morgan County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement posted on Facebook. Utility officials in the town of about 14,000 people asked residents to conserve water. Elsewhere, transportation officials shut down a major highway leading to Huntsville because of a crack that developed in the road after days of heavy rain. Crews were repairing both sides of U.S. 231 near Lacey’s Springs, forcing commuters to take detours. Flood warnings cover much of north and west Alabama. Workers had to clear roads in Lawrence County after strong winds overnight knocked down trees that toppled over in saturated soil. A flood warning for the Tennessee River at Florence in northwest Alabama is in effect until Feb. 20. Parts of central Alabama have received more than 6 inches of rain since Tuesday, and rainfall totals in excess of 3 inches were common.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Police arrested the wrong person in the 2017 shooting deaths of three men at a coin and precious metals shop in Anchorage, a defense attorney said at the murder trial of the suspect, who provided security at the store. Anthony Pisano, 45, is charged in the deaths of Steven Cook, 31, an owner of The Bullion Brothers, and building tenants Kenneth Hartman, 48, and Daniel McCreadie, 31. During opening statements Wednesday, defense attorney Kevin Fitzgerald said co-owner Michael Dupree killed Cook, the Anchorage Daily News reported. When Hartman and McCreadie responded to the shots, Fitzgerald said, Pisano shot them in self-defense. Prosecutor Brittany Dunlop said only Pisano was responsible for killing the three men on Sept. 12, 2017, and his motive was robbery. Cook and Dupree opened the store in 2015. Dunlop described it as “the Cheers of gold bullion shops” where friends and customers would stay for hours to “shoot the breeze.” Dupree and Cook met Pisano through a mutual friend and police officer. Pisano was a former paratrooper stationed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. After nearly two decades in the Army, he had retired as a sergeant and was hired to provide security for the store. Pisano desperately needed money, Dunlop said, noting that the day before the shooting, security footage showed him checking how much cash was inside the store. The prosecutor displayed photos from the day of the killings showing Pisano entering the store, turning off security cameras and carrying in a black box containing flares and two bottles filled with gasoline.\n\nArizona\n\nBuckeye: A police dog is expected to recover after getting hit with a pellet gun by a suspect who was barricaded in a home. Maricopa County Sheriff’s deputies booked 61-year-old Harold Whistler into jail Tuesday on five counts of aggravated assault and one count of harming a working service animal. Authorities were called after several people reported someone was pointing a rifle and pistol in traffic. Upon deputies’ arrival, Whistler went inside his home. The suspect went in and out of the home with a firearm for several hours, according to deputies. He ignored all commands. A SWAT team negotiator attempted to facilitate a surrender. Officers then decided to enter the house with Karl, a police canine. Investigators said Whistler fired three rounds from a pellet gun at the dog, hitting him in the ear and mouth. The dog grabbed onto the suspect’s leg. Whistler tried to flee by hitting the dog in the head with the gun. Officers then took Whistler into custody, according to authorities. Whistler was transported to a Phoenix jail and treated for a dog bite. It was not immediately known Wednesday if he had an attorney. Sheriff’s officials said Karl will make a full recovery and return to “pursuing bad guys.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge has set a July trial for a lawsuit challenging a Ten Commandments display outside the state Capitol. U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker on Monday ordered the trial over the display installed on the Capitol grounds in 2018 to begin the week of July 13. Opponents of the privately funded display argue it’s an unconstitutional endorsement of religion by government and are seeking its removal. The granite monument replaces a display that was destroyed in 2017 less than 24 hours after its installation. A 2015 law required the state to allow the privately funded monument on Capitol grounds.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDana Point: A delighted passenger on a whale-watching cruise was able to pet a 35-foot gray whale that surfaced near a boat off Southern California. The curious whale approached the boat Monday near Dana Point, the Orange County Register reported. “Oh my gosh, that’s her face,” a passenger exclaimed on a video posted online by Captain Dave’s Dolphin and Whale Watching Safari. The woman splashed her hand in the water, tapped the boat’s side and blew kisses to the giant mammal. Suddenly, the whale’s head popped out of the water and the woman reached out and pet it. The up-close encounter is rare in Southern California, where whales typically keep a distance from boats as they migrate between Alaska and Mexico, the newspaper said. Steve Burkhalter, a captain with Dana Wharf Whale Watching, was the first to spot the gray whale about a half-mile from shore. “It was pretty awesome,” Burkhalter told the Register. “It was definitely the most friendly gray whale we’ve ever had.”\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: Doctors at a state psychiatric hospital released a man who pushed a snowboarder off a ski lift. Thomas Proesel, 35, was released from the state’s psychiatric hospital Tuesday to live on his own in Pueblo, The Aspen Times reported. Pitkin County District Judge Chris Seldin said Proesel appears to have made significant process at the hospital in Pueblo, but ruled against Proesel’s request to live in an Aspen condominium he owns during his supervised release. Proesel was at the Aspen Highlands ski and snowboard area in January 2016 when he pushed a 28-year-old snowboarder and photographer off the Loge Peak Lift. The reason Proesel pushed the snowboarder was unclear, but he reportedly made an innocuous comment that might have been misinterpreted by Proesel. The snowboarder fell 20 to 25 feet but landed in deep snow and was not injured. Proesel was later diagnosed with schizophrenia and another psychiatric disorder.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMiddletown: Police are looking for a masked suspect caught on surveillance video using an ax to force their way into a military museum and steal several items. Police in a Facebook post said they responded to a burglar alarm at the Greater Middletown Military Museum on Tuesday night. Surveillance video posted on Facebook showed a hooded and masked person swinging the ax several times at a rear door lock mechanism to break into the museum. Officers searched the area for the suspect with the help of a K9 unit but did not find anyone. Museum officials told WVIT-TV that the suspect took a replica .45 caliber automatic pistol from a Vietnam War display and did not get anything of value. Neighbors near the museum have been asked to check their security cameras for any images of the suspect. The museum opened last year.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:The owners of the Hercules Plaza building downtown said that because they struggle to attract tenants in a stagnant office market, they should have to pay less in property taxes to the city, New Castle County and local schools. If successful, they could reduce their city property tax bill by nearly $400,000 a year, which would be one of Wilmington’s largest revenue losses on a building in recent years. A Delaware Superior Court judge has partially sided with owner McConnell Johnson Real Estate, ruling last month that the county tax authority must consider the building’s vacancy rates when deciding whether to lower the property’s assessed value. The case is another sign of downtown Wilmington’s struggling office market, and the latest crack that Delaware’s courts have dealt to the outdated method used by all three county taxing authorities to value real estate. The Delaware Supreme Court previously ruled that a building’s depreciation must also be a factor in assessing a property’s value – before New Castle County then calculates what that value would have been in 1983, the last time the county comprehensively valued every property. Those assessment methods are on trial in a separate case before the Delaware Chancery Court, in which school funding activists and Wilmington officials claim all three counties’ three- to four-decade-old property values are so inaccurate, they violate the state constitution. The Hercules case, however, presents a revenue quandary for the city. It loses taxes when declining commercial properties get their assessments reduced, but real estate sources say in an “anemic” local office market, high taxes on those buildings hurt the local economy, too.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Neighborhood leaders are demanding that Metro not cut bus routes as part of its proposed annual budget, WUSA-TV reported. Riders are now able to submit public comments online after the transit agency announced plans to “eliminate” 22 bus routes in December. In a letter sent to Metro leaders, 12 commissioners from Advisory Neighborhood Commission 1A near Columbia Heights said they are “extremely concerned” about changes to the 54 bus route. Metro has proposed the line be absorbed by the 59 bus, which commissioners said provides fewer stops. “That this change will disproportionately affect senior residents, residents with disabilities, and residents of affordable housing developments in portions of our Commission along 14th Street and of ANC 1B to our south,” the letter said. The route connects Takoma to Metro Center using 14th Street through Columbia Heights. ANC Commissioners said the 54 bus makes 14 stops in their area but the 59 route that Metro favors stops just nine times. “This change will disproportionately affect senior residents, residents with disabilities, and residents of affordable housing developments in portions of our Commission along 14th Street and of ANC 1B to our south,” commissioners said. Any changes to Metrobus routes would need the approval of Metro’s board, the transit agency underscored in a statement. Metro spokesperson Sherri Ly said there will be “an extensive multiweek public outreach period where customers can make their voices heard.” “No decisions will be made until all public comments have been delivered to the Metro Board for their consideration,” Ly said.\n\nFlorida\n\nPalm Beach:During a dive charter trip on Walker’s Dive Charters out of Riviera Beach on Tuesday, a group of scuba divers encountered a great white shark. The encounter took place near a spot known as The Breakers Reef, a location just one mile offshore of the famous Breakers Hotel on Palm Beach. During the dive, an estimated 20-foot-long great white shark slowly drifted by near the bottom, enabling divers to get photos and brief video. Many on the trip were thrilled with the encounter. “Only need two words to describe diving West Palm with Walker’s Dive Charters today: Great White!” diver Jim Cocci of Viera wrote on his Facebook page. There was pretty good visibility during the dive, so it was easy for divers to get photos and video without spooking the shark. The shark had no visible satellite tag affixed to it’s dorsal fin so it was not a shark tagged by OCEARCH. Great white sharks are being observed by divers once or twice a year off the coast of South Florida. Last year, a group of spearfishermen saw one in 80 feet of water off Jupiter. Capt. Bill Walker of Walker’s Dive Charters said the great white shark sighting was the first for one of his charters in 27 years of operation. There were 11 divers on the trip and all were able to get a glimpse of the big shark. Walker said this time of year, his charters generally see bull sharks, lemon sharks and nurse sharks, along with an occasional hammerhead. Mutton snapper, large stingrays, spotted eagle rays and moray eels are also common.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia’s public safety chief said he’s stepping down just weeks after an entire graduating class of the State Patrol’s Trooper School was fired or resigned after being accused of cheating on an online exam. Department of Public Safety Commissioner Col. Mark McDonough announced his resignation Thursday after Gov. Brian Kemp told the commissioner he wanted new leadership. Kemp spokeswoman Candice Broce confirmed that the governor asked for McDonough’s resignation. Kemp thanked McDonough in a statement for “his dedicated service, leadership, and sacrifice. We wish him the very best in the years ahead.” McDonough said in late January that 30 troopers were fired after being accused of cheating on an online exam for the speed detection operator component of the school’s curriculum. One trooper resigned after the cheating allegations came to light. All were August graduates of the 106th Trooper School. The investigation began in October after officials learned about the allegations from the girlfriend of one of the cadets, who said she took the online test for him. McDonough said then that all the graduates signed an oath to uphold professional conduct and standards, which they violated, leading to their dismissals.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: The Coast Guard has scrapped plans to move a fishing vessel that ran aground after inspectors discovered flooding in the boat, an official said. The 63-foot ship named Midway Island was grounded Feb. 3 north of Hilo on the Big Island, West Hawaii Today reported Tuesday. Environmental impact has been minimal and there is no evidence of pollution discharge caused by water leaking into the ship, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard will continue to monitor the vessel until a new plan to move the ship is approved. Coast Guard officials previously planned to move the Midway Island to a berth outside Wailoa Boat Harbor in Hilo during Monday afternoon’s high tide. Contractors found water in the fish hold and the engine room while preparing the ship, said Chief Warrant Officer Russell Strathern, a Coast Guard pollution response expert. The Coast Guard is working with the state Department of Land and Natural Resources and other partners on plans to safely move the boat and mitigate any pollution on board. Officials said 1,352 gallons of petroleum products including marine diesel fuel, lube and hydraulic oil were safely removed along with the ship’s batteries and household cleaners. Officials estimated less than 40 gallons of liquid products remain on board. A safety zone extending 100 yards from the vessel in all directions remains in effect, authorities said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A lawmaker wants to ban transgender women athletes from participating in sports that align with their gender identity. The bill by Idaho Falls Republican Rep. Barbara Ehardt was introduced Wednesday in the House Education Committee, Boise State Public Radio reported. It must undergo a public hearing before the committee will vote on whether to send it to the full House. It could add significant complications for state colleges and universities that are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The NCAA requires its members to allow transgender athletes to participate in sports that align with their gender identity. Transgender men can do so immediately, but transgender women must undergo testosterone suppression therapy for a year before competing. Ehardt said transgender athletes are acting as a “roadblock” to girls and women who want to play sports with their peers. Her bill would prevent someone who was assigned male gender at birth but who identifies as female from playing on a sports team as a woman. Transgender men – assigned female gender at birth but who identify as male – would be exempt from restrictions. Rep. Steve Berch, a Boise Democrat, tried to block the introduction of the bill but failed. Similar legislation has been proposed in Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Washington state, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The measures are part of a national campaign backed by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative religious freedom group based in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Chicago Public Schools said it has launched an investigation after four students complained that a teacher told a Hispanic student she should go back to her own country because she didn’t stand during the national anthem. The students at Senn High School on the city’s north side said they heard the teacher make the comment to the girl, who is a U.S. citizen, during a Hispanic heritage assembly Jan. 30. If the allegations are true, the teacher’s comments would be a violation of the district’s anti-discrimination policy. “CPS is committed to fostering learning environments that embrace and support all students, and the alleged actions of the teacher in question run counter to our beliefs and priorities,” district spokesman James Gherardi said. Yesica Salazar said she and the other students stayed seated during the anthem to protest police brutality, U.S. immigration policies and anti-immigrant political rhetoric. She said the teacher asked her if her legs were broken then said she should “go back to my own country if I didn’t want to stand,” Salazar said. The four students held a sit-in at the school on Wednesday to protest what they called the school’s slow response to their complaint as well as to urge the teacher’s removal from the school. Authorities have not released the teacher’s name and the CPS has not said if any actions was taken against him.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An Indianapolis boy is asking for Valentine’s Day cards as he awaits a heart transplant at Riley Children’s Hospital. Ten-year-old William Sidebottom was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a congenital defect that left him with half a heart. He underwent three open-heart surgeries before getting a transplant when he was 6. But now doctors said that heart is failing. Although the family had lived in North Carolina for several years, they made the decision to move back to Indiana to be closer to relatives. “The family, including older brothers Jared Green, 18, and Dylan Sidebottom, 13, moved back to Indiana in January. William was admitted to Riley on Jan. 28, the day before his 10th birthday. During their hospital stay in North Carolina, a family friend suggested they ask for Christmas cards – and they ended up receiving 5 million, including messages from Poland and Australia. The family hopes to keep that momentum going through Valentine’s Day. William is a fourth-grader at Glenns Valley Elementary School, but because he’s unable to attend classes, a teacher visits the hospital for an hour every day. When he’s not doing schoolwork, he spends his time playing board games and video games. Cards can be mailed to William at the hospital or sent virtually through a patient postcard form on Riley’s website.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Dozens of schools across Polk County and the state delayed start times or closed altogether Thursday. Rapidly falling temperatures mixed with overnight snow made for dangerous conditions across Iowa. In metro Des Moines, most schools started two hours late, including Ankeny, Des Moines, Johnston, Southeast Polk, Urbandale, Waukee and West Des Moines. The National Weather Service issued a wind chill advisory for all of central Iowa, which began at midnight Wednesday and ended at noon Thursday. Temperatures hovered around 10 degrees at 10 p.m. Wednesday, and wind chills were expected to dip as low as minus-25 degrees around 6 a.m. Thursday. Temperatures should reach 20 degrees on Friday, but wind chills might be as low as minus-10. Saturday will see temperatures climb into the 40s.\n\nKansas\n\nEmporia: The Kansas Highway Patrol said several children from Wichita suffered minor injuries Wednesday when a school bus they were on rolled onto its side near Emporia. Patrol Lt. Dave Hundley said 36 students, two teachers, a chaperone and the driver were aboard the bus when it went into a ditch about 14 miles south of Emporia. He said the road was slushy from snow but it wasn’t immediately clear what caused the accident. Seventeen children were taken to a hospital in Newton for treatment and the others were transported to Emporia High School. The Emporia Gazette reported the children were fifth-graders from Park Elementary School in Wichita on a field trip to Topeka.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:A large rock slide caused a fiery train derailment Thursday morning in eastern Kentucky, briefly trapping two crew members and causing a chemical leak into a river, authorities said. Two crew members of the CSX train were initially trapped in a flaming locomotive along the river’s edge before climbing out and waiting for firefighters to rescue them by boat. They were taken to a hospital with minor injuries, officials said. There weren’t any other reports of injuries. CSX said in a statement that the train derailed into the Big Sandy River around 7 a.m. because of a rock slide over the tracks. The derailment happened in the small community of Draffin, about 160 miles southeast of Lexington. Video showed a wooded area behind homes ablaze shortly after the derailment occurred. CSX said the train had 96 cars carrying ethanol and two cars loaded with rocks. It was not clear how many cars derailed. One locomotive and an unknown number of cars caught fire. The blaze was still going nearly four hours later. Kentucky State Police spokesman William Petry said authorities were not sure whether diesel fuel or ethanol was fueling the blaze, but authorities decided to let the fire burn itself out since it did not pose a public safety threat. No homes were damaged in the sparsely populated area and residents who were briefly evacuated have been allowed to return. CSX said it had mobilized its emergency teams and were working with local authorities. Petry said the slide that caused the derailment was large. Heavy rains have caused flooding and multiple rock slides in the region since last week. Pike County got 3 to 4 inches of rain last week and probably another inch over the last 48 hours, said Dustin Jordan, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending team of six to investigate the derailment. The public is being asked to avoid the area if possible, police said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport:Canadian manufacturer E.I. Williams Industries will create 100 jobs in Sarepta in the North Webster Parish Industrial Park, the company’s president and Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Thursday. The company will locate in an existing building and invest $700,000 there, where it will manufacture industrial sound control equipment. Edwards said Louisiana Economic Development provided an incentive package that includes a $250,000 grant and access to the state’s workforce training program FastStart. The company will create 100 direct jobs over five years with an average annual salary of $37,400 plus benefits. E.I. Williams will begin installing its manufacturing equipment during this quarter. The company designs and manufactures vent silencers, fan silencers, industrial silencers and noise enclosures. It’s E.I. Williams’ first manufacturing site in the United States.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The number of flu cases in Maine shot up by nearly a quarter over the course of a week. There were almost 1,000 new cases reported for the week that ended Feb. 8. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that increase brought the total confirmed cases of influenza to nearly 5,000 for the season. More than 275 people have been hospitalized and 17 have died, the Portland Press Herald reported. Flu cases are above last year’s pace. The state had 3,056 cases through early February last year, but a surge in March helped bring the total to more than 10,000. The flu season has not yet peaked in Maine. Every week since November has brought more cases statewide than the previous week. Public health authorities recommend hand washing, vaccination and staying home when ill.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state Senate has approved a measure that would create a statewide ban on the intentional release of balloons into the atmosphere. The Senate voted 38-8 on Tuesday for the measure. The bill creates a civil penalty of up to $250 per violation by an organization or a person who is at least 13 years old. Supporters of the measure said it’s needed to stop littering. Last year, researchers in Virginia released a study about the local problem of balloon litter in the marine environment. In August, Queen Anne’s County became the first county in Maryland to ban the intentional release of nonbiodegradable balloons.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNewburyport: Several explosions rocked a chemical plant Thursday morning, blowing a hole in the roof and leading to an evacuation but injuring no one, authorities said. Firefighters responding to a fire alarm went to the PCI Synthesis building in Newburyport, Massachusetts, around 4:30 a.m. They evacuated the building after hearing three explosions, Deputy Fire Chief Stephen Bradbury said. There were three more explosions about 15 minutes later, including one that blew an 8-foot-wide hole in the roof, he said. There were workers in the building at the time but no reports of injuries, authorities said. A hazmat team was sent to the scene, a spokeswoman for the state fire marshal said. The cause of the explosions is under investigation. Three nearby businesses were closed for the day as a precaution, Bradbury said.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing:City officials have approved a lethal option to manage the growing number of deer. The city council voted this week to authorize culling as a way to reduce deer herds, the Lansing State Journal reported. East Lansing’s city manager would have to initiate a cull and partner with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s wildlife services to bring in sharpshooters to target deer in city parks. Residents would be given advance notice of the hunts, according to the newspaper. Environmental Services Administrator Catherine DeShambo told city officials that December is the earliest a deer cull could be held because the Agriculture Department is “completely booked up.” The cost would be just under $6,000, she added. But City Manager George Lahanas said East Lansing likely will budget closer to $20,000 in case the program would be needed in more areas and for a longer period of time. More than 380 deer have been killed in Ann Arbor, about 60 miles southeast of East Lansing, since 2016 when hunters first were hired to cull the animals. East Lansing’s deer population has been a growing issue since 2011 and became a bigger concern when chronic wasting disease was found in deer in nearby Meridian Township. The fatal illness first was discovered in Michigan in a free-ranging deer in May 2015.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis:Fear of frostbite kept many students home Thursday across Minnesota and the National Weather Service warned people to limit time outdoors. The arrival of arctic air has pushed wind chill readings down to minus-40 degrees across northern and western Minnesota. The Anoka-Hennepin School District notified parents classes were canceled Thursday because of “extreme winter weather conditions in the early morning hours.” Other districts canceling school include Little Falls, Osseo, St. Cloud and St. Francis. The Star Tribune reported in Elk River and Cambridge-Isanti, students will have an e-learning day, meaning instruction will be delivered online. “Proper care should be taken to cover exposed skin and limit time outdoors,” the weather service said. “Frostbite could develop in as few as 10 minutes.” Temperatures were expected to recover for the weekend with highs reaching 35 degrees on Saturday before dropping into the 20s for most of next week.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: The Mississippi Ethics Commission said a school board did not violate the state Open Meetings law when it held superintendent interviews behind closed doors, with 15 handpicked citizens allowed to attend but others from the public excluded. The Commercial Dispatch filed a complaint against the Lowndes County School District Board of Trustees in November, days after the board held the interviews during executive session. The Ethics Commission dismissed the newspaper’s complaint Friday, the Commercial Dispatch reported. The school board’s attorney, Jeff Smith, described the executive session as a “limited public forum.” Board members selected 15 people – three residents each from their respective elected districts – as a citizen panel to observe the interviews for a new superintendent and offer written feedback to the board. Mississippi law allows executive sessions during public meetings for discussion of personnel matters. Public bodies might “invite specific individuals to attend an executive session, if the members feel that individual’s presence is necessary,” with all other members of the public excluded, according to the commission’s order of dismissal. Commercial Dispatch publisher Peter Imes said he does not plan to appeal the commission’s decision. “We were concerned the hand-picking of citizens to represent the concerns of the public in an otherwise closed executive session may have pushed the limits of Open Meetings laws,” Imes said.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: Keith Wildhaber , a gay St. Louis County police lieutenant who was passed over for promotion 23 times, said he has no plans to leave the department after he settled a discrimination lawsuit for $10.25 million. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Wildhaber said Wednesday that he was happy with his new job as commander of the department’s new diversity and inclusion unit, which he was named to after jurors awarded him $20 million in October. Both sides entered into negotiation talks about the verdict, reaching a settlement this week. “I’ve got 26 years in. I want to finish my career on my terms,” Widhaber said. Wildhaber, 47, said he was focused on learning how to promote diversity in the department and has no special plans for the windfall, other than to take care of family. The county agreed to pay Wildhaber $7 million within 60 days, and an additional $3.25 million by Jan. 31, 2021. After his attorneys are paid, he will clear $6.5 million. Wildhaber said he had been out as a gay man for about half of his career. “There was a lot of time I just stayed in the closet, really for personal reasons. The settlement was completed hours after Jon Belmar announced his retirement as police chief. After the verdict, Belmar’s leadership was called into question, although County Executive Sam Page said Belmar’s retirement was not a condition of the settlement.\n\nMontana\n\nButte: A fire that badly damaged a historic building in Butte started in a storage room on the second floor of the building where several appliances, including a portable heater, were plugged into a power strip. Butte-Silver Bow fire marshal Brian Doherty said the Jan. 23 fire was ruled accidental. The building was constructed in 1922 to house the Butte Daily Post newspaper. It housed three bars – the Irish Times Bar, the Post Bar and the Muddy Creek Brewery. The storage room was between the brewery and the Post Bar and held an ice maker, a microwave, a refrigerator and a beverage cooler. A portable heater was behind the ice maker to keep it from freezing, as it had in the past, investigators said. “Each of these appliances should have been plugged into wall outlets, which still may have overloaded the available circuits,” the report stated. Investigators found a burned electrical cord with the plug melted, a burned portable heater and a burned power strip with several melted plugs still attached. The refrigerator was plugged into an extension cord coming from the brewery side. The report said “the burn patterns appear to start near the back of the ice maker and extend out and up from that corner,” and that it’s “difficult to eliminate the burned up power tap as the likely cause of the incident.”\n\nNebraska\n\nColumbus: Pat Pope, the president and chief executive officer of Nebraska Public Power District, said Thursday that he intends to leave his post. A district news release said Pope expects to remain available to aid with the transition to his replacement. The release said it’s likely the board of director’s executive committee will recommend that Tom Kent replace Pope. Kent is the district’s executive vice president and chief operating officer. Pope joined the district in December 1979 as an electrical engineer and held several positions as he moved up over the years. He became president and CEO in April 2011. “It has been a pleasure working with Pat, and I wish him and his wife, Jackie, the best in the coming years,” said the board chairman, Barry DeKay. “Some may be surprised with this announcement, but Pat has been talking to the executive committee of the board for the past few months to ensure a smooth leadership transition.” The publicly owned utility includes all or parts of 86 of Nebraska’s 93 counties.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:The City Council will be looking for a new city manager again – the second search in less than three years. City Manager Sabra Newby, who started in May 2017 after a career at Clark County, announced in an email to city employees late Wednesday that she wants to move back to Southern Nevada. Newby said she will stay in the post until July 3 to help the city through “this transitional period to securing a new City Manager.” In the email, she praised city workers and touted accomplishments such as a new master plan and downtown improvement district, and a focus on homelessness and affordable housing. “In my time here, I have witnessed the incredible passion and grit that our employees use in their service to this community,” she said. “They truly go above and beyond in their service, often in difficult situations with limited resources.” Newby arrived during a period of upheaval at the city following the termination of former City Manager Andrew Clinger amid accusations of creating a hostile workplace.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: Interstate fishing regulators are holding a series of public hearings in March about plans to try to better manage the fishery for Atlantic herring. Herring are the subject of a major fishery on the East Coast, as the fish are used as food for humans and as bait for species such as lobsters. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission said in a statement that a recent assessment of the herring stock found downward trends in the health of the population. Proposed changes to the way the fishery is managed would give regulators more flexibility when the quota for the fish is low, the commission said in a statement. The rule changes would apply to the inshore Gulf of Maine area. The public hearings are scheduled for March 2 in Gloucester, Massachusetts; March 3 in Wakefield, Massachusetts; March 3 in Portsmouth; and March 9 in Augusta, Maine.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Two men serving life sentences for a double killing 25 years ago, but whose convictions were recently thrown out because of evidence that cast doubt on their guilt, celebrated with relatives and friends after they walked out of prison. Loved ones of Kevin Baker and Sean Washington waited for hours for their release Wednesday outside of New Jersey State Prison in Trenton. A state appeals court ruled last month that new evidence cast doubt on the guilty verdicts against the pair, who were convicted of killing two people outside a Camden housing project in January 1995. The Camden County prosecutor’s office announced this month that it would not seek to retry the men. Baker and Washington had been serving life sentences with no parole eligibility for 60 years. Some of the evidence used to overturn their convictions wasn’t available at their trial: for instance, specialized testing not in common use at the time led one expert to conclude in 2013 that the bullets had struck the ground and ricocheted before hitting one of the victims, contradicting the one eyewitness’ account of the shooting. Other evidence could have been used but wasn’t, according to court documents. Alibi witnesses for both men weren’t called to testify, nor was a man who told police he was with the eyewitness and cast doubt on whether she saw the shooting. Washington also contended he made a 911 call after noticing the two victims when he left a relative’s house to use a pay phone. At a hearing in 2016, he testified no one obtained a copy of the call until 2013. His trial lawyer admitted he hadn’t known of the tape, according to court documents.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Portions of the Gila River would be protected as wild and scenic under legislation proposed by U.S. Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich. The New Mexico Democrats are seeking public comments as they draft the measure. They have posted online a summary of the legislation along with maps detailing proposed protection areas and other information. The greater Gila watershed makes up the largest remaining network of naturally flowing river segments in the Southwestern United States, according to the lawmakers. “The Gila River is an irreplaceable New Mexico treasure,” Udall said. “The Gila watershed is one of the last wild, undammed rivers in the Southwest, it is one of the most biologically diverse watersheds in our state, and it is one of New Mexico’s most iconic outdoor destinations.” The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act created the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Adopted in 1968, the act came at the height of the modern dam-building era to ensure that the construction of new dams was balanced with the protection of select river segments that possess nationally significant values. The senators said the law is the highest form of protection for rivers in the United States. Under the legislation, the Gila River’s traditional values and uses would be protected along with the free-flowing nature of some of its segments and tributaries. Aside from protecting recreational pursuits along the river, the bill would allow for continued uses such as grazing. The senators said the bill would not change how private landowners use their own land nor would it open up private lands to public access. The bill also would not affect existing valid water rights, interstate water compacts or irrigation or water delivery operations.\n\nNew York\n\nGlens Falls: A northern New York city with frequent political gatherings adopted new regulations to govern protesters after several months of review. The Glens Falls Common Council passed the law Tuesday. The legislation regulating protests was proposed by the council last year in response to a growing number of political gatherings including climate, second amendment and protests and counter protests about immigration. One rule in particular remains under scrutiny by some members of the community: the allowed distance between opposing protest groups. The original changes to the city code were first drafted in September and put the required distance between protesters at 30 feet. After consulting with the New York Civil Liberties Union, the distance was reduced to 8 feet, which has previously been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. Several residents at the meeting expressed concern that the 8-foot distance was not enough to keep agitated protesters on either side from harassing each other. People recounted the use of a bullhorn in close proximity by pro-Trump supporters and the shouting of obscenities at participants of a women’s march. The only self-identified Trump supporter at the event said he felt his pro-Trump group had faced plenty of verbal harassment from the other side as well. Fifth Ward Councilman Jim Clark said after the vote that he is discouraged that some of the uncivil political discourse at the national level has spread to the city, the Post-Star reported.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcracoke: Contractors will soon be placing sandbags along a stretch of N.C. 12 on North Carolina’s Outer Banks to protect the road from getting washed out again. The Raleigh News & Observer reported Thursday that the North Carolina Department of Transportation is using the sandbags to reinforce a ridge of sand between the Atlantic Ocean and the road on Ocracoke Island. The new dune replaces one that was washed away by Hurricane Dorian. The September storm flooded the island and buckled about 1,000 feet of roadway. Highway 12 reopened in early December. Contracts will lay sandbags along three-quarters of a mile of the roadway near the north end of the island. N.C. 12 runs for about 12 miles from Ocracoke Village to the north end of the island, where ferries can be taken to and from Hatteras Island.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state reached a proposed settlement agreement Thursday with American Indians who sued over the state’s voter ID laws requiring residents to provide a street address, arguing they are a form of voter suppression. Native Americans argue that such addresses are not always evident on reservations. Many tribal members don’t know their address, don’t have a provable one because they’re homeless or stay with friends or relatives, or can’t afford to get an updated ID with a street address. The proposed federal consent decree announced jointly by tribal attorneys and the state follows U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland’s ruling Monday that the Spirit Lake Nation and the Standing Rock Sioux, as well as six individual Native American plaintiffs, can challenge the state’s requirement that voters have ID with a verified street address. Under the deal, the burden would be on the state to assign or verify street addresses for Native American voters, ensuring they will still be able to cast a ballot, said Tim Purdon, an attorney for the tribes. The Spirit Lake and Standing Rock tribal councils still must approve the settlement agreement, which would halt a federal trial scheduled for May on the issue. North Dakota doesn’t have voter registration, but the state has required voters to provide ID since 2004. The state accepts a driver’s license as identification or ID cards issued by the state, long-term care facilities or North Dakota’s American Indian tribes. The law required that all must have a birth date and valid street address. State officials argued that not requiring street addresses could lead to voter fraud and people voting in the wrong district. The state maintains everyone has a street address via the statewide 911 system, but lawyers for the tribes have argued the system is “incomplete, contradictory and prone to error on reservations.” Native American voters who do not have or do not know their residential street address now will be allowed to mark their residence on a map. State and county officials, in coordination with tribal governments, will then use those maps to assign or verify the voter’s residential street address and will provide that address to the voter, Purdon said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state House again approved a measure covering post-traumatic stress disorder for emergency responders who haven’t suffered a physical injury. Police and firefighters have been pushing for the coverage under the state insurance fund for injured workers for years. The groups argue that it’s wrong for coverage to be available for responders who suffer a traumatic injury but not for those affected by witnessing or experiencing traumatic events. The legislation will help prevent first responders’ deaths by suicide by offering benefits and treatment for PTSD, said Rep. Tom Patton, a Strongsville Republican and the bill’s sponsor. The House approved a similar measure as part of its Bureau of Workers’ Compensation budget last year before the Senate rejected the idea after lawmakers said they wanted more time to study the concept. The bill passed Wednesday moves next to the Senate, where Senate President Larry Obhof, who supports the idea, promised a “full and fair process.” State senate lawmakers have been working on the issue, including a version that would offer the same benefits but outside of the Workers’ Comp budget, Obhof said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state plans to resume executing death-row inmates, five years after lethal injections were put on hold following a series of death-chamber mishaps, state officials said Thursday. Gov. Kevin Stitt, Attorney General Mike Hunter and Oklahoma Department of Corrections Director Scott Crow said in a joint news release that the state will resume executions using a three-drug lethal injection protocol and that a source for the drugs has been secured. The three drugs are: midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride. “I believe capital punishment is appropriate for the most heinous of crimes and it is our duty as state officials to obey the laws of the state of Oklahoma by carrying out this somber task,” Stitt said. Hunter said his office has notified the state criminal appeals court that they’re ready to resume executions, which triggers a five-month wait before an execution can be scheduled. Dale Baich, a federal public defender representing death row prisoners who are challenging the state’s execution procedures in federal court, said in a statement that he’s disappointed the state is reverting to the same three-drug protocol that has been used in past problematic executions. Oklahoma once had one of the busiest death chambers in the nation, but executions were put on hold following a botched lethal injection in 2014 that left an inmate writhing on the gurney and drug mix-ups in 2015 in which the wrong lethal drugs were delivered. One inmate was executed with an unapproved drug and a second inmate was just moments away from being led to the death chamber before prison officials realized the same wrong drug had been delivered for his execution. The execution protocol announced Thursday utilizes the same drugs that Oklahoma used previously including midazolam, which the U.S. Supreme Court found constitutional in 2015. Hunter said he anticipated court challenges but that any past problems during executions have been associated with human error, rather than the drugs themselves. Meanwhile, more than two dozen inmates have exhausted all their appeals and are awaiting execution dates to be set. There are 47 inmates on Oklahoma’s death row, Hunter said.\n\nOregon\n\nHappy Valley: The state Occupational Safety and Health Administration has fined two companies for safety violations that led to the deaths of two workers at a Portland-area music festival. OSHA issued $31,000 in fines to Pickathon LLC and GuildWorks LLC after two workers died at the Pickathon Music Festival in August in a lift accident, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. Brandon Blackmore and Brad Swet were in a boom lift taking down an installation when the lift, which was on an incline, tilted and fell, killing them. The Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office said that they were wearing safety equipment and were roped to the boom lift. OSHA said two alarm devices on the boom lift had been disabled. Each company was fined $12,500 for disabling the alarms. OSHA also fined GuildWorks $6,000 for not following instructions provided by the boom lift manufacturer. The agency said the investigation revealed that Pickathon and Guildworks had “a history of failing to follow proper safety procedures.” Pickathon’s founder and festival director Zale Schoenborn said in a statement Thursday that the tragic loss was heartbreaking and continues to shake them to their core. GuildWorks didn’t respond to a request for comment. The companies set up a fundraiser for the families of the men after the incident\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A federal judge sentenced a former Philadelphia Navy Yard worker on Thursday to six months in prison for lying to the FBI about his ties to a white nationalist group in order to obtain security clearance. Federal authorities said Fred C. Arena, 42, lied on his application for a national security clearance and then to FBI agents who later questioned him about his association with the group Vanguard America. Arena, who changed his plea to guilty in December, told the court Thursday that he was no longer affiliated with white nationalist groups. “I would like to say I’m not part of that stuff any more. I’ve realized it was stupid,” Arena said in court Thursday. “I don’t believe I’m a danger or anything like that…. I got sucked into this left-right stuff and I just took it too far.” Senior U.S. District Judge John R. Padova said the sentence should serve as a deterrent to anyone who would consider lying on applications or to agents when they sought security clearances, saying it was a serious threat. According to court documents, Arena pleaded guilty to five counts of providing false information to federal authorities. Two of those counts were related to lying about his affiliation with Vanguard America and about having a car repossessed on his application for security clearance for a position with a safety contractor at the Navy Yard. The other three charges came from lying to FBI agents during the investigation.Court records did not say how Arena’s affiliation with the white nationalist group became known to federal investigators, but documents said Arena had chatted with at least one agent who posed as someone with similar ideals online. Arena, who listed a Salem, New Jersey address, was denied bail late last year after federal prosecutors argued he was a danger, saying he had advocated for violence and made threats online against people who might have cooperated with investigators.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A Roman Catholic bishop responded to the controversy created by a priest who said he would deny communion to state legislators who support abortion and then defended his stance by saying abortion is worse than pedophilia. The Rev. Richard Bucci, pastor of Sacred Heart Church in West Warwick, distributed fliers in January that said that every lawmaker who voted last year to preserve the right to an abortion in state law would be denied communion, The Providence Journal reported. He also mailed them to lawmakers’ homes. Bucci, when questioned by WJAR-TV, said, “pedophilia doesn’t kill anyone and this does.” Diocese of Providence Bishop Thomas Tobin wrote Wednesday on Twitter that “no one has an absolute right to receive Holy Communion.” He said in a statement Thursday “it is important to affirm that both the sexual abuse of minors and abortion are horrific, immoral actions that have very serious, harmful consequences.” A group of state lawmakers and clergy sex abuse victims called on Tobin to suspend Bucci, who said he isn’t planning to resign. Tobin’s statement does not mention any disciplinary action. His office said there will be no further comment at this time.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A 6-year-old girl who disappeared earlier in the week after getting off her school bus was found dead Thursday, and a homicide investigation has been opened, authorities said. The body of a man also was found recently in the neighborhood where the child, Faye Marie Swetlik, disappeared Monday, said Cayce Public Safety Director Byron Snellgrove. Snellgrove didn’t immediately provide any evidence to link the deaths, but said at a brief news conference to announce the developments that there was no danger to the public. He said no arrests have been made in the girl’s death. The coroner confirmed the girl’s death but has not released the identity of the dead man, Snellgrove said. The girl’s disappearance had brought more than 250 officers to the neighborhood in Cayce, just across the Congaree River from the state capital of Columbia. Searchers knocked multiple times on the doors of every home in the neighborhood. They also checked trash cans and a nearby landfill and towed cars. The girl was last seen getting off the school bus Monday. Her family discovered her missing about 3:45 p.m. and called 911 after looking for her for about an hour, authorities said. The girl’s mother, the mother’s boyfriend and her father cooperated with investigators, authorities said. Flyers with Faye’s picture had appeared all over Cayce and people in the area tracked every development in the case.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:The Sioux Falls Regional Airport will spend millions in the coming years on a multistory, 1,100-space parking ramp and another 600-space parking lot. That's according to Dan Letellier, executive director of the Sioux Falls Regional Airport, who told the Argus Leader on Wednesday that the facility is at capacity when it comes to accommodating parking for airline passengers' automobiles. The parking ramp project is estimated to cost between $25 million and $27 million, depending on whether a skywalk to connect to the terminal is included. The project will go out for designs in the coming months. The parking lot expansion is estimated at $1.5 million. Although plans to add parking have been in the works for year, the number of vehicles using the airports existing lots has spiked in recent months as the airlines flying in and out of Sioux Falls continue to add more routes and destinations. The planned parking garage will be built over the existing short-term parking lot. In 2019, 1.2 million people flew in and out of Sioux Falls. The airport has 2,500 total parking spaces across its three lots. And during peak parking season – typically this time of year when snow birds and spring-breakers are heading to warmer climates – it can add a few hundred overflow spots in various areas around the facility. But that's not a long-term solution, so the Sioux Falls Airport Authority, the governmental entity that oversees the airport, has been saving for a permanent fix. The parking lot expansion project that will add about 600 spaces will be built this summer, Letellier said. And the garage, coming in 2022, will be built over the short-term lot, which has about 400 spaces now. When both projects are completed, the airport will have about 3,800 total parking spaces. In the meantime, Letellier said flyers who live in Sioux Falls are encouraged to catch a ride to the airport to ensure that out-of-town flyers can find a place to park when they arrive at the airport.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Tennessee has not performed autopsies on the four death row inmates who chose to die in the electric chair since the state resumed executions in 2018. The state honored requests that autopsies not be performed from all those inmates. Documents provided to the Associated Press showed that just one autopsy was performed on an inmate in the last 18 months, even though six inmates have been executed. That autopsy was performed on an inmate executed by lethal injection. Those who asked not to have autopsies included Lee Hall, who was electrocuted Dec. 5. Two white plumes of what looked like smoke rose from Hall’s head as he died for the 1991 murder of his former girlfriend. State officials have maintained it was steam. Davidson County Chief Medical Examiner Feng Li said autopsies are typically routine after an execution because they are classified as homicides. There are exceptions, Li said, including for inmates who said they did not want an autopsy performed. That means the last autopsy of an electrocuted inmate in Tennessee was performed in 2007, when Daryl Holton was executed for the 1997 murders of four children. Autopsies are considered vital in determining the cause and manner of death. When the electric chair is used, autopsies can help determine how quickly an inmate died when given jolts of electricity and help determine if the chair worked properly. Questions have surrounded the effectiveness of Tennessee’s electric chair, which was built by a self-taught architect who has warned the chair could fail due to recent changes the state has made to it over the years. When lethal injection is the execution method, autopsies can provide insight in determining if the anesthetic worked. They can be valuable in piercing through the public myth that witnesses are watching someone “fall asleep” during the execution, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Texas’ highest criminal court on Wednesday overturned the death sentence of a man who was convicted of capital murder after having been accused of shooting five people, including his mother and aunt. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did not reverse Charles Brownlow’s conviction in the 2013 slaying of Luis Gerardo Leal-Carrillo, a convenience store clerk. But in its opinion, the court said the trial jury in North Texas’ Kaufman County wasn’t properly told how to determine whether Brownlow had an intellectual disability. Brownlow was arrested in October 2013 after a series of killings in Terrell, about 25 miles east of Dallas. He was accused of having killed his mother, Mary, and setting her body on fire in her home, then shooting other people in the area, including his aunt. He was ultimately tried and convicted for the death of Leal-Carrillo. Experts during Brownlow’s sentencing testified that he had tested as intellectually disabled when he was 5 years old and that he had been diagnosed with several psychological disorders. The appeals court said the judge and prosecutors applied the state standard correctly at the time of his May 2016 sentencing, but the U.S. Supreme Court issued a 2017 opinion that rejected that standard, requiring a new hearing. The Kaufman County district attorney’s office declined to comment Wednesday on whether prosecutors would seek a new hearing since the case is pending. A conviction of capital murder in Texas carries either a death sentence or mandatory life in prison without parole.\n\nUtah\n\nWest Valley City: A police officer helped deliver a baby whose mother got stuck in rush-hour traffic en route to a hospital – but he conceded he was not calm in the process. West Valley officer Jeremy Dean was on duty Tuesday when a car in front of him stopped and the driver got out waving his hands, the Deseret News reported. The driver shouted at Dean that his wife was having a baby. Dean pulled on gloves, got a blanket from his patrol car and released a huge exhale. “Oh, boy,” he said. “Baby was coming, so I quickly got some gloves on and she said she was going, and baby came out,” Dean said. “I just tried to keep the baby from going anywhere and tried to keep it warm.” Dean had worked as an emergency medical technician before moving into police work but does not think it helped prepare him to handle the birth. “Yeah, I had prior experience, but not in delivering babies,” he said. “Mostly just in repairing injuries.” “In 18 years on the job, I’ve heard of it twice,” police Lt. Bill Merritt said about officers stepping in to deliver babies. “The way he handled it, as calm as he was … what I heard on the radio was very impressive.” After delivering the baby, Dean visited the hospital and learned the baby was named Michelle and was doing great. “Congratulations to mom and dad on No. 5,” he said. “A little girl, pretty cute, too.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A Pennsylvania man has been charged with smuggling seven parrots into the United States by carrying them across the Quebec-Vermont border. A federal court affidavit alleged that Jafet Rodriguez picked up the birds from a car parked in Canada outside the Haskell Free Library and Opera House, which straddles the border, on Dec. 30 and then carried them across the border in Derby Line to a car in Vermont. Five of the birds were yellow-headed Amazon parrots and the other two white-bellied parrots. Rodriguez, 39, was charged Jan. 28, but the case was sealed until after his Monday arrest. He was due in court in Burlington on Thursday. Rodriguez’s attorney did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The affidavit said that a surveillance camera showed a man cross into Canada, open the rear door of a car parked just across the border, retrieve a black bag and then cross back into the United States, where he was apprehended by Border Patrol agents. In speaking with agents, Rodriguez said he had made arrangements with people in New York to buy the birds from someone in Canada. Rodriguez told agents he didn’t know that he had crossed the border when he picked up the birds, but he said he had seen the border marker. Rodriguez told the agents he had one of the birds with him in the United States, but because he didn’t have documentation to prove it, all the birds were seized, the affidavit said. Trade in both of the species seized is covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, which provides a mechanism for the international trade in the covered species. The affidavit said the treaty allows for the trade of yellow-headed Amazons only for scientific and research purposes, and then only with valid permits. Commercial trade in white-bellied parrots is allowed, but only with strict regulation. The seven birds were turned over to officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and placed in quarantine at the New York Animal Import Center in Rock Tavern, New York.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: More than 1,000 people rallied at the state Capitol on Thursday, protesting legislation advancing in the Democratic-controlled General Assembly that would ease restrictions on abortion access. Speakers urged the crowd that gathered in a steady rain to pressure lawmakers to vote against bills that they said would undo regulations that protect pregnant women. They encouraged attendees to join anti-abortion advocacy groups to push back against Democrats who retook control of the General Assembly in November, and they vowed to unseat members of the new majority. The House and Senate have passed bills to undo restrictions on abortion access that were enacted when the legislature was under GOP control, including a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion and a requirement that women seeking an abortion undergo an ultrasound and counseling. The bills, which Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam supports, would also roll back the requirement that an abortion be provided by a physician and undo strict building code requirements on facilities where abortions are performed. Each chamber must pass the other’s before they could be sent to Northam for his signature. Abortion-rights advocates said the restrictions injected politics into a health care decision and made obtaining an abortion overly burdensome. Democrats have also defeated some Republican-sponsored bills this session that would have enacted abortion restrictions. Abortion opponents said the existing restrictions protect pregnant women’s health and safety and are prudent, given the gravity of the decision to obtain an abortion. Capitol police spokesman Joe Macenka said the crowd numbered at more than 1,000, though he said the department could not provide an exact count.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: Four nonprofits filed a joint lawsuit Tuesday against the state Department of Fish & Wildlife for issuing a permit for steelhead farms in the marine waters of Skagit and Kitsap counties. The Skagit Valley Herald reported Wild Fish Conservancy, Center for Biological Diversity, Center for Food Safety and Friends of the Earth argued that allowing Cooke Aquaculture to raise steelhead in floating net pens would jeopardize the region’s wild steelhead, salmon and endangered Southern Resident orca whales. Puget Sound steelhead, including those from the Skagit River, have been listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act since 2007. Cooke Aquaculture and the wildlife agency did not respond to requests for comment. The groups behind the lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court said exposure to farm-grown steelhead could put the wild species at increased risk of disease and genetic impacts from interbreeding. They are particularly concerned because of Cooke Aquaculture’s history of growing Atlantic salmon in area waters. In August 2017, one of the company’s farms near Cypress Island in Skagit County collapsed under the weight of debris the company neglected to clean off, and the majority of the 300,000 fish in that net pen escaped.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Soaking rains caused part of a hillside to collapse in southern West Virginia and prompted a flood warning along the Ohio River. Highways officials said high water forced road closings in multiple counties Thursday. Near Williamson, a rock slide Wednesday night covered old U.S. Route 52, knocked over power poles and caused a minor traffic accident. No serious injuries were reported. Crews were trying to remove multiple boulders on Thursday. Rising water levels have hampered search efforts for a kayaker who went missing in Barbour County. Jamie L. Gray, 41, was part of a group of about 10 kayakers near Audra State Park, said Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety spokesman Lawrence Messina. Weather-related school closings or delays occurred in at least 15 of West Virginia’s 55 counties Thursday. The National Weather Service issued a warning for minor flooding along the Ohio River at Point Pleasant and Huntington. The downtown areas of both cities are protected by floodwalls. The weather service said some areas received about 1.5 inches of rain over already saturated ground. In Huntington, the storms prompted U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams to postpone a visit to Marshall University, which said the event is expected to be rescheduled.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state recorded its second child death of the flu season as influenza activity surges in the state, health officials said Thursday. The child who died from flu was from southern Wisconsin, said Tom Haupt, influenza surveillance coordinator for the state Department of Health Services. Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 78 child deaths from flu nationwide since October. Health officials reported more than 500 flu hospitalizations this week, including at least 100 hospitalizations reported Thursday morning, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. “We’re not at peak activity yet,” Haupt said. “We probably won’t be at peak activity for several weeks, followed by many more weeks of high activity.” The strains of flu circulating most in Wisconsin now tend to strike people under 50, unlike most flu that is typically a problem for older adults, Haupt said. More than 40% of Wisconsin residents have received flu vaccine this season, which is a record, Haupt said. But that still leaves many people unprotected, and vaccine remains available, he said. Although it’s too early to know how effective this year’s vaccine is, Haupt said vaccination is still the best means of protection against influenza. “It is not too late to get the vaccine,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: An anonymous tipster application marketed to Wyoming students received a record number of tips last year, with suicide being the most frequently reported concern, a report said. The Safe2Tell program confirmed more than 1,750 tips were sent across the state in 2019, a 37% increase from the previous year, the Casper Star-Tribune reported Tuesday. The program is designed to allow students to anonymously report safety or health concerns for themselves or their peers to Wyoming Highway Patrol and various school officials, officials said. The top five reported concerns last year included suicide with 239 reports, vaping with 229 reports, bullying with 193 reports, selling or using drugs with 179 reports and self harm with 127 reports, the report said. The program launched in October 2016 in the Natrona County School District before later being introduced to the entire state. Safe2Tell can be used by its application, by phone calls or by using its website, officials said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/07/08/new-state-endorsed-bible-has-connections-to-national-movement-to-erode-church-and-state/73677794007/", "title": "New state-endorsed Bible has connections to national movement to ...", "text": "A rare edition of the Bible recently named one of Tennessee’s first official state books is an integral part of a nationwide movement to erode the separation of church and state.\n\nThe Aitken Bible, an edition of the King James Bible often dubbed the “Bible of the Revolution” thanks to its status as the first English-language Bible printed in an independent United States, was named one of 10 official states books in late April, the first state to do so.\n\nWhile the antique edition is far from a household name, its presence is increasingly common within conservative Christian political circles, with many supporters using it to blur the long-held boundaries between church and state.\n\nProponents of the Aitken Bible have embarked on an aggressive lobbying campaign in recent years to boost its prominence, meeting with and presenting copies to top Republican officials in Tennessee and across the country, ranging from local representatives to governors and even a U.S. Supreme Court justice.\n\nIn Tennessee, top GOP officials — including Gov. Bill Lee, House Speaker Cameron Sexton, Lt. Gov. Randy McNally and U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn — all have received copies, as have at least five members of the state's U.S. House delegation and more than two dozen state lawmakers.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, R-Franklin, and former Rep. Terri Lynn Weaver, R-Lancaster, are listed as founding members of the First American Bible Project, and its Franklin-based nonprofit Aitken Bible Historical Foundation, the largest Aitken Bible reproduction printer in the world, according to social media posts made by the group.\n\nStephen Skelton, founder of the Aitken Bible Historical Foundation and the First American Bible Project, said the group aims to provide the Bible to schools and lawmakers as a historical resource.\n\n\"Not as the devotional application, but rather as an object lesson that the teachers will use with topics they're already teaching about the economic factors of the American Revolution,\" he said in an interview.\n\nAlthough Skelton insists his group's work is strictly historical and nonpartisan, he has personally expressed skepticism about the separation between church and state and pointed to the Aitken Bible to back up his views.\n\nExperts and historians have called the rise of the Aitken Bible's popularity a \"misrepresentation\" of history, and First Amendment experts have expressed concern about its use in eroding the wall between church and state.\n\n“This new law is mostly symbolic, but I do think it violates the spirit of the First Amendment and also the Tennessee State Constitution, which says that no preference shall be given to any religious establishment or mode of worship,” said Ryan Jayne, senior policy counsel at the Freedom From Religion Foundation. “I think there is an intent to favor Christianity, but they are trying to couch this in a historical context. …They wanted to include (this book) to try to go along with this myth that the Founders intended to create a Christian country.”\n\nProponents push Aitken Bible with state, national lawmakers\n\nUnder the glitzy ceiling of Mar-A-Lago — the historic Florida resort now famous for serving as former President Donald Trump’s residence — Skelton presented his original copy of the Aitken Bible to attendees at an early March fundraiser.\n\nThe private event served as the annual fundraiser for the 917 Society — a nonprofit that supplies school children with pocket Constitutions and one which Skelton often partners with.\n\nFor the First American Bible project, which allows donors to receive a copy of the book with a sponsorship of a one sent into a public school of their choosing, the event served mostly as a photo opportunity for donors to see the historic book. But it also showed just how well connected the Aitken Bible movement is within conservative political circles.\n\nA review of the First American Bible Project’s website shows photos of meet-and-greets between Skelton and nearly every high-ranking Republican official in Tennessee at private dinners, campaign events and events held at the state Capitol that go back years.\n\nAt least 15 of the 27 Senate Republicans have received copies of, or have been photographed with, an Aitken Bible, along with at least 14 of the 75 House Republicans. The Tennessean could find no Democrats in either chamber who received or were photographed with an Aitken Bible.\n\nSome of these meetings happened shortly before legislation was passed this year elevating the book to an official state symbol.\n\nRep. Gino Bulso, R-Brentwood, and Sen. Paul Rose, R-Covington, the two sponsors of the Tennessee bill, were pictured numerous times with the First American Bible Project months before filing the bill.\n\nRose's support of the Aitken Bible has gone back years, with a 2022 social media post showing him meeting with Skelton and Weaver, the former state lawmaker. The post references Rose's gift of \"five (Aitken Bibles) to five superintendents,\" which helped \"open the doors to put 97 (Aitken Bibles) back into schools.\"\n\nOn top of members of the General Assembly, photos show numerous county and city mayors across the state meeting with Skelton, as well as expressing support for the inclusion of the Aitken Bible in secular settings. Similar photos show a host of county Republican groups with the Bible, including the Claiborne County GOP, which showcased it at their 2024 Freedom Dinner and called the Aitken Bible \"a solution by patriots for patriots.\"\n\nAt the national level, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Columbia, introduced the text of the Aitken Bible into the Congressional Record and introduced a resolution to recognize it as a \"historical document of the United States Congress.\" The resolution has not moved forward.\n\nShortly before he introduced the resolution, Ogles met with the First American Bible Project multiple times, according to photos on social media, including alongside U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in November 2022, as well as in January 2023 and April 2023, when he was given a personalized copy of the Aitken Bible days before submitting it to Congressional Record.\n\nA handwritten letter from U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to one the world’s premiere dealers of antique Bibles in 2014 expressed his gratitude after Thomas received a copy of the Aitken Bible, saying that it has “remained on his desk here at work” since then, according to a blog post made by a church that partnered with the dealer.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, also received a copy of the Aitken Bible in early 2023 from the First American Bible Project and conservative religious group Awake America Ministries as part of the two organizations 2023 initiative to \"present First American Bibles to all elected leaders at the United States Capitol,\" according to a social media statement.\n\nAnd Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took the oath of office with another original copy of the Aitken Bible in January 2023, loaned to the campaign from conservative commentator Glenn Beck.\n\nOutside of government, Willie Robertson of Duck Dynasty, former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow, conservative author and actor Kirk Cameron and country music singer John Rich all have received copies of the book from the First American Bible Project.\n\nSkelton insists his group is focused on 'just the historical'\n\nPublished in 1782, the Aitken Bible is equal parts a religious and largely-obscure historic text, as well as the only edition of the Bible with a Congressional stamp of approval for its accuracy in translation.\n\nFor Skelton, his goal is clear: bring the Aitken Bible into as many schools as possible to serve as a Revolutionary War history lesson.\n\n\"We brought (the Aitken Bible) back into print so that we can put this Bible into schools as an educational resource that illustrates the state academic standards for social studies regarding the American Revolution,\" he said.\n\nThe Aitken Bible does hold a unique place in America's economic history. In the fall of 1782, a committee of the Congress of the Confederation — which predated our current Constitution and the system of government it created — met to discuss the recent printing of the first complete Bible in an independent America by Philadelphian Robert Aitken.\n\nShortly before the meeting, Aitken had written asking that his work be published under the authority of Congress, and that he be commissioned as the official Bible printer for the new nation, noting his intent to put the Bibles into schools.\n\nAlthough Congress did not acknowledge nor grant Aitken the rights to be the official Bible publisher of America, or his desire to place the text in schools, the 1452-page book was praised by members, who said they “highly approve(d)” of Aitken’s work to create the edition, according to Congressional Record.\n\nSatisfied by Aitken’s “care and accuracy in the execution of the work,” Congress authorized him to publish the edition as the new nation’s first printed religious text, a move of defiance against Britain’s publishing embargo on the colonies and a display of American ingenuity.\n\nSkelton said that this history is what inspires him to place the Bible in schools as an historic token.\n\n\"We've probably placed about 2,500 Bibles into public schools, and they're going into the hands of the teachers that are teaching the American Revolution,\" he said. \"It's roughly something like 750 schools, because we're doing roughly three Bibles for each school on average. And we're covering about 11 states right now.\"\n\nThe majority of the reproduction Bibles have been placed into schools in Tennessee, Skelton said.\n\nOnly 25 original editions of the book are known to exist, and five of those — including Skelton's — are in private collections.\n\nSkelton said he was inspired to begin the organization after a documentary from Cameron, the actor and influential evangelical activist. In the film \"Monumental: In Search of America's National Treasure,\" Cameron interviewed David Barton, Texan and political activist for Christian nationalist causes, about the Aitken Bible.\n\nBarton, who owns one of the other remaining original Aitken Bibles, is the founder of WallBuilders, a Texas-based organization that promotes a revisionist Christianity-centric take on the founding of the United States as well as the rejection of the separation of church and state.\n\nWithin the Wallbuilders organization, Barton has been active in pushing the Aitken Bible as proof that the founders did not believe in the separation of church and state.\n\nSkelton said Barton was just \"a seed planter\" for his organization.\n\n\"We're just friends,\" he said. \"I have had the pleasure to have met him twice. And we've talked about what we're doing with (the Bible).\"\n\nRegarding Barton's explicit position on ending the separation of church and state, Skelton said that was \"not what we're doing.\" Skelton stressed his group is focused on \"just the historical perspective.\"\n\n\"We're just not political. We're historical,\" he said.\n\nBut Skelton has made comments questioning the separation of church and state at multiple private events. In video clips posted to the First American Bible Project's social media, Skelton questioned the establishment clause.\n\n\"We have been indoctrinated, in a somewhat subtle way, to the idea that our founders believed in a separation of church and state,\" he said in one video.\n\nSkelton said in the video that the separation of church and state is often invoked by \"those on the other side of the fence.\"\n\n\"How could our founding fathers have believed in a separation of church and state if I have a Bible approved by Congress?\" he said. \"There needs to be a reconciliation between these two arguments.\"\n\nIn an interview, Skelton reiterated that his organization is focused on secular, academic standards, regardless of his opinions.\n\nPush for recognition of the Aitken Bible part of the growing 'patriot myth,' historian says\n\nThe push for the Aitken Bible to embody a sort of revised, religiously focused take on the founding of the nation has drawn attention from historians and First Amendment experts alike, who say the movement is a \"misrepresentation\" and an attempt to subvert the First Amendment's establishment clause.\n\nTad Stoermer, a public history lecturer at Johns Hopkins University and an expert on the American Revolution, said the original intentions of the Aitken Bible were likely far less based in religion — and far more based in the marketing of a new American identity.\n\n\"In the historical moment, it's not a really any kind of adoption, or the endorsement of, the Christian faith,\" he said. \"There are so many conversations in the Continental Congress about how they refer to divine providence in this broad,18th century enlightenment-sense of 'the Creator,' because it was recommended by the chaplains, and it was as seen as being a part of this nascent American identity.\"\n\nThe year before the edition was published, Stoermer said, was a hard year for the young nation. He said Congress was looking for ways to make statements about the existence of a coherent, independent United States — and they find it in the defiant printing of the Aitken Bible in the face of British law.\n\n\"That is what makes the Aitken Bible important at all: not as a religious book, but sort of for the symbolism that it represented at the time,\" said Stoermer, who runs a popular TikTok account where he discusses American history and the nation's founding.\n\nAlthough the book mostly fell into obscurity following the Revolutionary War, Stoermer said the labelling of the Aitken Bible as the \"Bible of the Revolution\" began to pop up as the idea of American exceptionalism began to sweep the nation after World War II.\n\nStoermer said this created a certain nostalgia and placed the Founding Fathers on a pedestal that Stoermer calls the \"patriot myth.\"\n\n\"Post-World War II is when American exceptionalism and particularly the patriot myth really take root,\" Stoermer said. \"(The Aitken Bible) is deployed as this tool to represent what America is supposed to be, with this being the only Bible ever endorsed by the Continental Congress, particularly for Christian nationalists, that ends up taking on a huge level of symbolism. They serve as counterpoints for the United States against the supposed atheists of the communist world.\"\n\nThroughout the turmoil and social upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s, as the modern conservative movement solidified, the Aitken Bible remained a consistent, if small, piece of the puzzle, Stoermer said.\n\nWarren Throckmorton, a retired psychology professor in Pennsylvania, has spent years pushing back on influential evangelicals figures such as pastor Mark Discroll and David Barton. He said the push of the Aitken Bible in modern times is simply to \"redefine the separation of church and state.\"\n\n\"So often many say, 'I believe in the First Amendment, I believe in separation of church and state, but separation really just means that the government can't tell the church what to do. It doesn't mean that you can't have religion in government,'\" he said. \"You can't favor Christianity in some way.\"\n\nIn a response to questions from The Tennessean, Barton and his son, Tim Barton, reiterated the Congressional Record of the Aitken Bible's approval as defense of their position on the book.\n\n\"This Bible came into existence with the approval, endorsement and recommendation of Congress,\" they said in a statement.\n\nThey point to the phrase separation of church and state appearing in private letters from Thomas Jefferson and insist the founders did not necessarily want secular institutions.\n\n\"The restriction was on Congress passing a law,\" they said. \"There was no restriction in acknowledging God.\"\n\nRachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, said the focus on a Christian-centric government, swept along in part by the Aitken Bible, is part of a \"larger trend.\"\n\n\"That larger trend is the undermining of church and state separation in this country,\" Laser said. \"And we're seeing it in Texas and Florida, where chaplains can now replace certified school counselors and public schools. We just saw it in Louisiana, where now all public-school classrooms are going to be required to display the Ten Commandments. In Oklahoma, where our nation's first religious public charter school was set to open this fall. In Missouri, where lawmakers literally wrote their religious motivations for the abortion ban into the law. So it's definitely part of a larger story than Tennessee.\"\n\nLaser said that the promotion of the Aitken Bible as a state book is, \"without a doubt,\" a violation of the First Amendment.\n\n\"It doesn't matter whether the Bible is one of 10 or the only official state book,\" Laser said. \"It's still a flagrant violation of church and state separation, because it's placing the government's favor on one religion and favoring one religious belief — and frankly, even one type of belief system within Christianity, because not everyone uses that Bible. That is a violation of our federal and your state's constitutional religious freedom protections.\"\n\nThe USA Today Network - Tennessee's coverage of First Amendment issues is funded through a collaboration between the Freedom Forum and Journalism Funding Partners.\n\nHave a story to tell?

At its peak, it operated more than 100 stories. In Muncie, Marsh outlasted other homegrown groceries such as Ross and Wise. After relocating its headquarters to Fishers in 1991, the company faced challenges from a changing supermarket industry and big sellers such as Wal-Mart and Meijer.\n\nThe Marsh family sold the company to Sun Capital, a Florida-based investment company, in 2006. Since that time, Marsh has closed some stores, remodeled and updated others and courted potential buyers for the chain.

Penney, Papyrus, Express and Pier 1 Imports, as well as other retailers, have collectively announced 1,218 store closures this year, according to global marketing research firm Coresight Research.\n\nThe fallout comes after a year in which retailers closed more than 9,200 stores, according to Coresight. Those included the liquidation of Payless ShoeSource, Fred's, Gymboree and Charlotte Russe and mass closures by Family Dollar, Forever 21, Charming Charlie, Sears, Kmart, A.C. Moore and GameStop.\n\nNeed a break?

That's the equivalent of about 562 Walmart supercenters.\n\n\"This year will generally be more of the same,\" said Robin Trantham, a consultant for CoStar. \"We expect many companies – and many sizable companies – to announce closures.\"\n\nTo be sure, it's common for the industry to face a reckoning of sorts early in the year following the do-or-die holiday shopping season. About half of closures are typically announced in the first quarter, according to CoStar.\n\nBut the cascading nature of the recent closure announcements reflects a deepening crisis for retail. Some recent closure announcements include:\n\n• Home goods retailer Pier 1 Imports announced plans to close up to 450 locations, or nearly half of its stores.\n\n• Schurman Retail Group announced the closure of its 246 stores, including stationery and greeting card chains Papyrus and American Greetings.\n\n• Fashion retailer Express announced plans to close 91 locations, including 31 stores by the end of January and 35 by the end of January 2021.\n\n• Department store chains Macy's and J.C. Penney are closing 29 and six stores, respectively.\n\n• Bed Bath & Beyond is closing 60 locations, including 40 of its namesake locations.\n\nWith too many stores in the U.S. and chains trying to figure out the right approach, \"the current decade will continue to see store closures and a repurposing of retail real estate as the retail landscape adapts to the digital era,\" Coresight Research analyst Marie Driscoll said in an email.\n\nOff to a bad start\n\nAs the new year starts, many stores are already looking ghostly. In the third week of the month, foot traffic to stores fell 4.9% compared with the same period last year. And it was down 1.4% compared with the previous week, according to Cowen retail analysts.\n\nThat came despite nice weather, which typically encourages shopping. Average temperatures were 3.8 degrees warmer last week than the same week a year earlier, and they were 6.8 degrees warmer than usual for this time of year.\n\nDon't expect conditions to get much better for the retail sector later in the year, either.\n\nThe second half of 2020 poses particular challenges for the industry, according to Morgan Stanley research analyst Kimberly Greenberger, who tracks specialty retailers, department stores and footwear.\n\nIt will be \"tricky with the election looming\" for retailers to stand their ground, since the presidential election could cause consumers to get skittish about spending, Greenberger wrote Wednesday in a research note.\n\nAlthough the \"fundamental consumer backdrop is healthy,\" people's spending on discretionary items \"is likely to be challenged,\" Greenberger wrote.\n\nIs your store on the list?: J.C. Penney closing more stores and a call center\n\nMall foot traffic underwhelms: Express closing 91 stores as fashion retailer grapples with declining sales\n\nEven some chains that were recently thought to be on solid ground are encountering turbulence. The proposed split of Old Navy from its troubled counterpart, Gap, was called off last week amid a \"lackluster performance\" for Old Navy, Cowen retail analyst Oliver Chen wrote in a research note.\n\n\"The company has a lot of work ahead to drive consistent performance,\" and figure out the right number of stores to keep open,\" Chen said of Old Navy.\n\nDepartment stores falter\n\nOf course, digital threats remain at the heart of the retail industry's crisis. E-commerce made up 11.2% of total retail in the third quarter of 2019, up from 4.2% during the same period in 2010, according to financial data firm Refinitiv.\n\nDepartment stores, which historically set themselves apart with their wide variety of merchandise, are particularly threatened by Amazon and other digital marketplaces.\n\nSears and J.C. Penney, in particular, are facing the fight for their lives in 2020. Sears barely survived its recent bankruptcy filing but almost immediately resumed store closures after emerging from Chapter 11 last February.\n\nSome retailers are taking an if-you-can't-beat-'em-join-'em approach. Department store chain Kohl's won praise last year when it announced a returns partnership with Amazon that was hailed as effective insulation from digital competition because of the foot traffic it would presumably create.\n\nBut the significance of that deal is being called into question after Kohl's surprised investors this month by reporting a same-store sales decrease of 0.2% in November and December. The company experienced what CEO Michelle Gass called \"softness\" in women's apparel, \"which we are working with speed to address.\"\n\nIn an effort to lure shoppers into the store, department stores put an average of 74% of their merchandise on sale in 2019, according to Refnitiv.\n\nHaves and have-nots\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom for the retail sector. Retailers have announced about 500 more openings than closures so far this year, Coresight Research said.\n\nAnd some retailers are capitalizing on the demise of others.\n\nMakeup chain Ulta Beauty is projected to pick up sales as department stores continue to wither, according to Oppenheimer equity analyst Rupesh Parikh. Ulta could benefit if J.C. Penney accelerates store closures, which would affect the Sephora beauty shops located within the ailing department store.\n\nIn a world of haves and have-nots, the haves are still flourishing.\n\nNamely, Walmart and Target are still in great shape, with sales growing and profits rising for discount chains. And specialty retailers like Five Below continue to lure shoppers with low prices and convenient options.\n\nBut even they're not immune. Target reported same-store sales growth of 1.4% in November and December, which was \"below expectations,\" the company said earlier this month. And Five Below reported weaker-than-expected holiday season as same-store sales fell 2.6%.\n\nFor retailers to thrive in 2020, they'll have to place an emphasis on \"building customer loyalty via authenticity and innovation through inspiring product, relevant marketing and customer-centric stores,\" Chen wrote.\n\nAnd they need to place an emphasis on a smooth customer experience between their digital and physical operations, including options like buy-online-pick-up-in-store.\n\nCustomers who shop in a physical store become more likely to shop at the store online, and the other way around, according to a recent study by the International Council of Shopping Centers.\n\nFor every $100 a customer spends online with a retailer, they spent $131 in-store with the same retailer within a 15-day period, according to the ICSC report.\n\nIt also works in reverse. After spending $100 in a physical store, the average customer spends $167 online with the same retailer, according to the study.\n\n\"Though many are inclined to pit e-commerce against physical retail, those retailers that offer their customers both options – a choice of shopping online and in stores – tend to boost sales in both arenas,\" ICSC reported.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/2025/03/01/advance-auto-parts-continue-to-close-stores-700-to-shutter-bucks-county/80844225007/", "title": "Advance Auto Parts continuing to close stores: Over 700 set to shutter", "text": "Another chain store announced it is closing locations.\n\nA week after JoAnne Fabrics announced it was closing stores, Advance Auto Parts is continuing in its plan to shutter hundreds of stores and four distribution centers in 2025.\n\nThe company made the announcement in a midweek earnings call after initially announcing the closures in November 2024.\n\nIn releasing its fourth-quarter report Wednesday, the company reiterated its plans to close approximately 500 corporate stores, 200 independent locations and four distribution centers by mid-2025 as part of a \"restructuring plan\" initially laid out in 2024.\n\nThe company said it hopes to improve business performance by focusing on \"core retail improvements\" with hopes of achieving \"consistent profitable growth.\"\n\nThe plan includes the consolidation of distribution centers to operate 12 large facilities by the end of 2026, the opening of 60 market hub locations by mid-2027, and speeding up the pace of new store openings, according to the news release.\n\nAdvance Auto Parts' stock plummeted by roughly 18% Wednesday afternoon as investors reacted to the company's 2025 sales guidance, The Motley Fool reported.\n\nHow many Advance Auto Parts stores are there?

Bankruptcy filings have identified 316 store locations Rite Aid has tapped for closure.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nOn May 15, Rite Aid said it \"successfully entered into a series of sale agreements and pharmacy services transition agreements,\" which would include transitioning pharmacy assets from locations across the U.S. to CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, Albertsons, Kroger, Giant Eagle and other operators. Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs stores in some states will also be operated by CVS Pharmacy as part of the sale agreements, which were approved on May 21 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of New Jersey, according to Rite Aid's bankruptcy docket.\n\nDuring the transition of prescription files, Rite Aid said its stores will remain open and customers can continue to access their pharmacy services, including prescription refills and immunizations. Before the bankruptcy filing, Rite Aid operated 1,240 stores across 15 states.\n\n“A key priority for Rite Aid is to ensure that as many of our loyal customers as possible continue to receive the pharmacy services and care they require without interruption,\" Matt Schroeder, CEO of Rite Aid, said in a statement. \"These agreements ensure our pharmacy customers will experience a smooth transition while preserving jobs for some of our valued team members.”\n\nRite Aid has buyers for customer files at 810 of its stores, but did not find a buyer for files at 200 other locations, according to Reuters. While the deadline to enter bids for Rite Aid's pharmacy assets (May 13) has passed, the deadline to enter bids for the chain's remaining assets, including the Thrifty Ice Cream business, is June 13, with an auction date set for June 20.\n\nHow many Walgreens stores are closing?\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance announced in October 2024 its plans to close approximately 1,200 stores across the United States as the pharmacy chain struggles with slumping consumer spending.\n\nAt the time, the chain said the closures would occur within three years, starting with about 500 stores being shuttered in fiscal year 2025, which ends in August.\n\nThe move is part of a multi-year cost-cutting program under CEO Tim Wentworth, who took on the job in 2023. In a statement in October 2024, Wentworth reiterated the company's commitment to focusing on improving its core business: retail pharmacy.\n\n\"This turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term,\" Wentworth said in the statement.\n\n“We continue to execute our previously announced turnaround plan aimed at stabilizing retail pharmacy, including our footprint optimization program controlling operating costs, improving cash flow and continuing to address reimbursement models,\" Walgreens said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY on May 30. \"We are on track for our three-year store closures plan.\"\n\nThe company closed 70 stores in its first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended Nov. 30, 2024, Wentworth said in a January 2025 analyst conference call. Walgreens planned to close about another 450 stores through the end of 2025 he said.\n\nIn March 2025, Walgreens entered an agreement to be taken private by Sycamore Partners for $10 billion, closing out nearly a century of trading on public markets for the U.S. pharmacy giant. Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm that specializes in retail and consumer investments, has a track record of acquiring distressed retailers for profit: among them were brands such as Staples, Talbots and Nine West, according to Reuters.\n\nThe deal is not yet final, but Walgreens said in a news release in March it is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nHow many CVS stores are closing?\n\nCVS first announced in November 2021 its plan to close stores as part of an effort to \"optimize our existing stores and pharmacies.\"\n\nThe chain closed 900 stores between 2022 and 2024 and aims to close an additional 270 stores in 2025, company spokesperson Amy Thibault confirmed to USA TODAY on May 29.\n\nThe spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the company is closing locations \"strategically to better meet consumers' health, wellness and pharmacy care needs\" and not in reaction to \"industry pressures.\"\n\nAdditionally, even while it closes certain locations, Thibault said CVS is also opening stores and pharmacies in \"areas where there's a need.\" The company has opened 100 stores between 2022 and 2024, and has plans to open nearly 30 locations, including locations inside Target stores, in 2025.\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta, Jonathan Limehouse, Mary Walrath-Holdridge, James Powel and Mike Snider, USA TODAY\n\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

Six of the eight games were decided by at least 11 points, and the Boston Celtics, Milwaukee Bucks, Minnesota Timberwolves and Los Angeles Clippers all led by at least 29 points in their Game 1 triumphs, and the Cleveland Cavaliers were up 20 in their victory.\n\nThe best game was the last Game 1 of the weekend − Oklahoma City over New Orleans, 94-92, in a game that had 20 lead changes and 13 ties.\n\nHere are winners and losers from the first weekend of the NBA playoffs:\n\nWINNERS\n\nOklahoma City’s perseverance\n\nIt was shaky in the fourth quarter for Oklahoma City, making its playoff debut with its young roster. The Thunder had a 10-point fourth-quarter lead against New Orleans and lost it. They had six turnovers in the fourth quarter, including three by MVP finalist Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. But they had just enough offense and defense to beat the gritty Pelicans. Gilgeous-Alexander scored five consecutive points to put OKC up 93-90, and Chet Holmgren had two of his five blocks in the fourth quarter.\n\nDame Time\n\nMilwaukee Bucks star Damian Lillard almost outscored the Pacers by himself in the first half − with 35 points to Indiana’s 42. Lillard finished with 35 points, and he gave the Bucks room to exhale, winning a game with Giannis Antetokounmpo sidelined (left calf injury.) Lillard didn’t need to score in the second half. The damage was done in the first two quarters when Lillard was 11-for-19 from the field, including 6-for-10 on 3-pointers.\n\nBoston’s business-like approach\n\nNot only was a victory necessary for the Celtics in Game 1 against Miami, but it had to be a dominant victory. And that’s what the Celtics did, leaving no doubt against the Jimmy Butler-less Heat. Up by as many as 34 points, the Celtics shot 44.9% on 22 made 3s, and Jayson Tatum had a triple-double (23 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists).\n\nThe Kawhi-less Clippers\n\nThe Clippers could’ve lost Game 1 to Dallas and no one would’ve balked dropping the series opener with Kawhi Leonard (right knee inflammation) out. Instead, the Clippers destroyed Dallas. The 109-97 final is not indicative of the way this game played out − the Clippers led 56-30 at halftime and 70-41 with 7:39 left in the third quarter. James Harden had 28 points and eight assists, Paul George scored 22 points and Ivica Zubac had 20 points and 15 rebounds.\n\nTimberwolves' offense\n\nEveryone knows the Timberwolves can play defense. The NBA’s No. 1 defense held the Suns, the league’s No. 10 offense, to 95 points. More important, the Timberwolves dropped 120 points on the Suns. Anthony Edwards scored 33 points, collected nine rebounds and delivered six assists, Karl-Anthony Towns had 19 points and four assists, Rudy Gobert had 14 points and 16 rebounds, and off the bench, Nickel Alexander-Walker had 18 points and Naz Reid scored 12 points. If the Timberwolves can do that with regularity in the series, they will a playoff series for the first time since 2004 − when Kevin Garnett was 28 years old and won MVP.\n\nNuggets center Nikola Jokic\n\nDenver’s Nikola Jokic had 32 points on 15-for-23 shooting, 12 rebounds, seven assists and two steals in Denver’s 114-103 victory against the Lakers in Game 1. It appears he is headed for his third MVP in four seasons, and Lakers great LeBron James called Jokic one of the best to ever play. The Nuggets have beaten the Lakers nine consecutive times, including a sweep in the last season’s Western Conference finals, and in those games, Jokic averages 27.2 points on 55.7% shooting, 13 rebounds and 10.8 assists, and the Nuggets have outscored the Lakers by 104 points with Jokic on the court.\n\nKnicks' bench\n\nNew York’s reserves outscored Philadelphia’s 42-7. Bojan Bogdanovic (13 points), Miles McBride (21 points), Mitchel Robinson (eight points) were a combined 14-for-29 from the field, including 8-for-13 on 3s from Bogdanovic and McBride. Robinson also had 12 rebounds and four blocked shot, Bogdanovic added seven rebounds and McBride had four assists, three rebounds and one steal. That kind of production takes pressure off Jalen Brunson and the other starters.\n\nCavaliers’ Jarrett Allen-Evan Mobley combo\n\nWhether it was their 23 minutes on the court together or their staggered minutes where one sits and one is the bench, Cavaliers big men Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley provided a defensive boost. The Magic shot 33.3% from the field, 22.2% on 3s and were outrebounded 25-16 with Allen (16 points, 18 rebounds, two steals) and Mobley (16 points, 11 rebounds, three blocks) sharing minutes.\n\nLOSERS\n\nDallas’ disaster\n\nDuds happen in the NBA. That makes Dallas’ performance against the Clippers no less embarrassing. The Mavs had 30 points on 9-for-41 shooting in the first half, including 2-for-21 in the second quarter. This happened even with an offense as good as Dallas’ with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. With Clippers All-Star Kawhi Leonard out, this was a perfect opportunity for the Mavs to steal Game 1 on the road. Doncic had 33 points, Irving 32 and just one other Mav had more than six points.\n\nPacers’ poor start\n\nJust like Dallas, the Indiana Pacers had a chance to take advantage of a team missing its star and get Game 1 on the road. The Pacers failed. Playing against Milwaukee minus Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Pacers trailed by 30 points in the first half. Concerns about the Pacers’ defense were not alleviated − 69 points allowed in the first half − and their potent offense was non-existent in the first half.\n\nLakers' turnovers\n\nAttention will be on D’Angelo Russell’s shooting performance: 6-for-20, including 1-for-9 on 3s. But there’s more to the loss than Russell’s game. Anthony Davis had 32 points, 14 rebounds, five assists and four blocks, and LeBron James had 27 points, eight assists, six rebounds, one steal and one block. That wasn’t enough because the Lakers had 12 turnovers − seven by James − that led to 14 Nuggets points, and Denver outscored the Lakers 21-14 in fastbreak points. Against the defending champs, who had just six turnovers, including zero from primary ball-handlers Jamal Murray and Jokic, empty possessions are detrimental.\n\nSuns' offense\n\nPhoenix was 3-0 against Minnesota in the regular season, scoring 133, 97 and 125 points. In Game 1, the Suns shot 32.1% on 3-pointers, Devin Booker was 5-for-16 from the field, Grayson Allen, who sprained his ankle, missed his three 3-point attempts, Eric Gordon was scoreless and 0-for-4 on 3s and the Suns’ bench was outscored 41-18. The major concerns for the Suns − their offense against Minnesota’s defense, depth and size − were valid.\n\nSixers without Joel Embiid\n\nEven in the best of circumstances, Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid can’t play 48 minutes a game against the New York Knicks. And with Embiid less than 100% as he returns from a knee injury that sidelined in February and March, these are the best of circumstances. So the Sixers need to find way to get better minutes from the unit that is out there when Embiid is not the court. Embiid had 29 points, eight rebounds, six assists and two steals in New York’s 111-104 Game 1 victory, and the Sixers were plus-14 with Embiid on the court in his 36 minutes. They were outscored by 21 points in the 11 minutes, 27 seconds Embiid didn’t play. If the Sixers can minimize that difference, they have a chance against New York.\n\nMagic's offense\n\nThe Magic held Cleveland to 97 points, 44.4% shooting from the field and 26.7% on 3-pointers. And lost, which is almost impossible in today’s NBA. But it illustrated Orlando’s offensive problems. The Magic, which had the No. 22 offensive during the regular season, shot 32.6% from the field, 21.6% on 3-pointers and 63.3% on free throws. No matter how good the Magic’s defense is (No. 3), points are necessary. Nine Paolo Banchero turnovers didn’t help. Now, that Game 1 is out of the way, the playoff jitters must disappear. Orlando’s offense was a known issue coming into the series, but it if can’t generate better offense, it can’t beat Cleveland.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2025/05/05/nba-playoffs-odds-2025-ranking-championship/83460864007/", "title": "Ranking every remaining NBA playoff team by odds to win ...", "text": "The first round of the 2025 NBA playoffs are in the books and the conference semifinals are officially underway.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers and Indiana Pacers got the second round of the NBA playoffs started Sunday, and the other three conference semifinals series in the Eastern and Western Conferences are set to begin on Monday and Tuesday.

He was named MVP. Curry scored 12 points on four-of-eight shooting — with all his attempts coming from beyond the arc — while Celtics forward Jayson Tatum led all players with 15 points.\n\nSpurs phenom Victor Wembanyama led the Global Stars, who shot just 35.5% from the floor, with 11 points.\n\nChuck's Global Stars miss first 10 shots in All-Star final\n\nThere are slow starts and then there are slow starts.\n\nIn the NBA All-Star Game final, Shaq’s OGs, a team of seasoned veterans, scored the game’s first 11 points, as Chuck’s Global Stars started 0-for-10 from the field.\n\nCeltics forward Jayson Tatum led the charge early, leading all players with 11 points scored on a dunk and three 3s.\n\nThe NBA then had an intermission to honor the TNT Inside the NBA crew.\n\nComing out of that break, Chuck’s Global Stars picked up the pace and went on a 7-3 run, though Shaq’s OGs have maintained a commanding lead, 33-19.\n\nKevin Hart fetes 'Inside the NBA' crew during All-Star Game\n\nSAN FRANCISCO ‒ Kevin Hart paid tribute to TNT’s “Inside the NBA” crew of Ernie Johnson, Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal and Kenny Smith, who are broadcasting their final All-Star Weekend with TNT.\n\nTNT is not part of the NBA’s new 11-year, $76 billion TV deal which begins next season with Disney (ABC/ESPN), NBC and Amazon showing NBA games.\n\nThe crew received “gone fishing” gifts, a nod to an “Inside the NBA” segment when a team is eliminated from the playoffs.\n\nWhile TNT won’t have NBA games next season, TNT licensed the rights for “Inside the NBA” to Disney and the popular program will continue on ESPN and ABC.

That allowed the Rising Stars to make a small push, though it would not be enough.\n\nShaq’s OGs scored 17 fastbreak points compared to eight from the Rising Stars, and Bucks guard Damian Lillard, who hit the game-clinching 3 pointer, finished with a game-high nine points.\n\nFan wins $100,000 in shootout with Damian Lillard\n\nJaren Barajas, a fan, won $100,000 when he beat Bucks guard Damian Lillard in a 3-point shootoff, hosted by media personality Mr. Beast.\n\nLillard needed to hit three logo shots before Barajas hit one.

You would not be able to coach — your patience, our patience …” Parker said before trailing off.\n\nGreen had criticized the NBA’s decision to include the Rising Stars as “absurd” earlier during the TNT pregame show.\n\n“I had to work so hard to play on Sunday night of All-Star weekend, and because ratings are down because the game is bad, we’re bringing in Rising Stars?

You get motivated. If I'm healthy and things are going well for me next year, I will want to do it.”\n\nAntetokounmpo was open to other All-Star format changes, too, such as a one-on-one event, international stars vs. U.S. stars and an All-Star Weekend in Europe.\n\n“Anything that can make the weekend more exciting, more fun for the viewers, for the fans and for the players, I would love to participate,” he said.\n\nHe was super supportive of a world stars vs. U.S. stars game.\n\n“That would be the most interesting and most exciting format. I would love that. I'd take pride in that,” he said. “I always compete, but I think that will give me a little bit more extra juice to compete, like having Shai, Jokic, Luka, Wemby, Towns, Sengun. I know those players. Obviously I'm missing some guys that I cannot think from the top of my head, going against the best U.S. players.

I would love to do it again. I was so young. You said 2006? 2007? I was 21, 22 maybe. It was super fun. … It was definitely a treat and something that I can always look back and say ‘I was on a show that Will Ferrell has been on and so many great guys.’ Bill Hader is a good friend of mine.

He made his first All-Star appearance in 2005 and has shared the court with Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal and Kevin Garnett, among others.\n\nHe played in 13 games as a representative for the Eastern Conference. He spent five seasons representing the West. He also spent two seasons as the team captain for Team LeBron James and earned victories over Team Stephen Curry in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe All-Star Game changed to a draft format during those two years and was not specifically tied to the East vs. West team name moniker, according to information on StatMuse. ‒ James Williams\n\nLeBron James’ All-Star Game stats and records\n\nLeBron James is averaging 21.7 points (434 total), 5.7 rebounds (114 total) and 5.7 assists (113 total) through his first 20 All-Star Game appearances.

A preliminary investigation found Armstrong and the alleged victim were in an argument when he allegedly hit the victim with a gun and threatened to shoot her.\n\nArmstrong was booked into jail before 7:30 a.m. on Saturday and was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. His bond was set to $35,000, which he has since posted.

The location of the 2028 NBA All-Star Game has not been announced yet.\n\nTNT’s Ernie Johnson expresses gratitude\n\nIn what is TNT’s last All-Star Weekend telecast for at least the next 11 seasons, longtime TNT sports host Ernie Johnson delivered a thoughtful and grateful message at the annual NBA Legends Brunch.\n\nJohnson relied on one of his trademark rhyming poems to express himself.\n\nIn front of some of the greatest players to play in the NBA, including Oscar Robertson, Johnson said:\n\n“Pointing fingers or placing blame, they have no place in this rhyme.\n\n“Bitterness or ill-will, c’mon, don’t waste my time.\n\n“Instead consider gratitude. We’re thankful, and we’re blessed.\n\n“Our TNT production crew, our backbone, just the best.\n\n“So for all my colleagues, every teammate in our ranks:\n\nWe offer you a simple yet sincere and heartfelt thanks.”\n\nTNT is not part of the NBA’s new 11-year, $76 billion TV deal to televise and stream games starting in 2025-26.

He was preparing to appear with TNT’s popular “Inside the NBA” crew for a show before the Minnesota-Oklahoma City game.\n\n“I said, ‘What do you mean?’ He says, ‘Well, NBC does it after this season.’ When my friend asked me that question, I had never thought about it.\" Read the full story here.\n\nOpinion: NBA's winning social media strategy comes at expense of All-Star Game\n\nDespite the NBA’s best efforts over the last decade to juice up its All-Star Game to a vague level of competitiveness and credibility, it’s hard to see the league’s newest gimmick generating significantly different results this weekend than the Elam Ending or having LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo drafting the teams.\n\nIf that’s the case, NBA commissioner Adam Silver will likely see it as a failure. He has made it clear he wants the All-Star Game to be something other than a glorified pickup run, and the league hopes that this year’s format — dividing players into four teams and having a first-to-40 tournament — will be more satisfying for fans in the arena and more attractive for those watching on television.\n\nBut the real problem with the All-Star Game is not something the NBA can fix with a new format, or even shoveling money into the bank accounts of the players.\n\nThe problem is us. Or, to be more precise, the way our collective consumption of the NBA has evolved. Read Dan Wolken's column here.\n\nOpinion: NBA All-Star Game on life support? Format change may save it\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver wants a more competitive All-Star Game. His broadcast partners domestically and globally want a more competitive game. Fans – and their seething, disgusted, and worse, apathetic emails dropped into my inbox – want the same. I, too, prefer a more competitive All-Star Game.\n\nYet, I am skeptical that there is a long-term solution to making it a better product for the league, its partners and fans.

Those teams are occupying the No. 5 through No. 8 seed, but, with a handful of games still left, there figures to be plenty of movement.\n\nWhat should make this final stretch all the more captivating is that many of these teams will face each other over this final stretch.\n\nHere are the winners and losers from the penultimate week of the 2024-25 NBA season.\n\nWINNERS\n\nIn jumbled West play-in picture, Warriors gain some ground\n\nWith Stephen Curry back and healthy from his pelvic contusion, the Warriors (44-31) have ripped off three consecutive wins, averaging 131 points per game in that stretch. Curry, who erupted for 52 points in a huge victory Tuesday against the Grizzlies, has appeared refreshed following the week off.\n\nIt was paramount for Golden State to secure that win against Memphis; starting with Thursday, the Warriors embark on a tough stretch with three games in four days, against the Lakers (46-29), Nuggets (47-30) and Rockets (50-27).\n\nTimberwolves do, too\n\nMinnesota, winners of 12 of its last 15 games, is playing its best basketball of the season. Anthony Edwards has been tremendous, both scoring in bursts when needed, but also feeding his teammates and deferring to them when opponents blitz him with double teams.\n\nJulius Randle, acquired in the offseason trade that shipped Karl-Anthony Towns to the Knicks, has become a far more reliable No. 2 option, emphasizing efficiency in his shot selection. More importantly, and for the time being, the Timberwolves climbed into the No. 6 seed, the last guaranteed postseason berth in the West.\n\nHeat find winning formula: 3 and D\n\nMiami went from a season-long losing streak of 10 games directly into a season-long winning streak of six — the most recent being a 19-point demolition of the Celtics in which Boston emptied the bench with just fewer than five minutes left.\n\nOver the last six games, the Heat have posted the NBA’s second-best defensive rating, allowing just 104.4 points per 100 possessions. Miami has also had its best 3-point shooting stretch of the season, converting 46.9% of its attempts during this winning streak, best in the league over that span. Is it sustainable? Tyler Herro has been particularly efficient and effective, but a promising sign for Miami is that role players like Davion Mitchell, Kyle Anderson and rookie Pelle Larsson have also contributed.\n\nLOSERS\n\nUnstable Grizzlies make a drastic change\n\nIt’s never a great sign when a franchise, albeit one with a cloudy direction, makes an abrupt coaching change; it’s even worse when it’s coming from a team well on its way to the playoffs with nine games left in the regular season. Yet, the Grizzlies (44-32), losers of 16 of their last 25 games, had been tumbling down the Western Conference standings and fired Taylor Jenkins March 28.\n\nMaking matters worse, the Grizzlies lost an essential matchup Tuesday against the Warriors, ceding invaluable ground in the Western Conference standings, giving Golden State a key tiebreaker over Memphis should the teams end up with the same record. By the end of Wednesday night, the Grizzlies had tumbled all the way down to the No. 8 seed.\n\nWhether it was Taylor Jenkins or interim coach Tuomas Iisalo, the same problems persist. Stephen Curry torched the Grizzlies for 52 points and 12 made 3s, highlighting just how poor perimeter defense has been recently; over the last 15 games, the Grizzlies have allowed teams to hit an average of 16.7 3 pointers per game, just 0.1 off from the NBA-worst 76ers in that span.\n\nHawks pick awful time to slide\n\nLast week, Atlanta was in the No. 7 seed and had a chance — had it caught fire — to potentially sneak into the No. 6 slot in the East. Yet, the Hawks (36-40) have lost four of five games, including three to teams with losing records, and now might tumble even further.\n\nAtlanta is suddenly just one game up on the Heat, and is slumping with its 3-point shooting. The Hawks have converted just 34.4% of their 3s over the last five games, ranked 25th in the NBA in that span.\n\nSuns are running out of time, and quickly\n\nThe schedule makers were not kind to Phoenix. Stuck in a four-game losing streak, the Suns (35-41) — who don’t have much margin for error to begin with — face a brutal stretch to end their season. According to tankathon.com, the Suns will see the second-toughest remaining schedule (.615) in the NBA, with games against the Thunder, Celtics, Knicks and Warriors left.\n\nIt could get ugly for Phoenix, which is one game back of the No. 10 seed, the final spot in the play-in tournament. The issue is that those four elite opponents mentioned above rank third, second, fifth and 16th in offensive rating. The Suns, meanwhile, have posted an abysmal defensive rating of 137.0 during their four-game skid. And, with Kevin Durant (ankle) expected to miss time, it’s looking like this build may have run its course.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/thunder/2025/05/03/okc-thunder-playoff-schedule-clippers-warriors-game-7-nba-playoffs/83416547007/", "title": "NBA playoff history says OKC Thunder schedule gap not a bad thing", "text": "The Clippers and Nuggets will play Game 7 on Saturday, exactly one week since the Thunder won a Game 4 to sweep the Grizzlies.\n\nGame 7 for the Clippers and Nuggets. Off Day 7 for the Thunder team that awaits one of them in Round 2. And with the Round 2 series not scheduled to start until Monday, the Thunder will be coming off eight days rest compared to two days off for Los Angeles/Denver.\n\n“We’re gonna be very rested and recovered and healthy and they’ll have played high-leverage games all week while we’ve been practicing,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said Friday. “There’s obviously trade offs to both, but that’s just what it is. We’re just trying to maximize our situation.”\n\nRest almost always wins out.\n\nSince 2000, there have been 15 series in which a team coming off a four-game sweep faced a team in the next round that had just played a seven-game series.\n\nIn 14 of those instances, the team coming off a sweep beat the team coming off a seven-game slog.\n\nThe only outlier came in the 2013 NBA Finals. The Spurs swept the Grizzlies in the Western Conference Finals while the Heat fended off the Pacers in a seven-game Eastern Conference Finals. History would suggest the Spurs would win the NBA Finals, but the Heat — thanks to an iconic Ray Allen 3-pointer in Game 6 — won in seven games.\n\nGranted, rest isn’t the only factor here. A team that swept is often better than a team that won a series in seven. The most recent example coming in the Denver vs. Miami 2023 NBA Finals. Denver swept the Lakers in the West Finals. The Heat dispatched the Celtics in seven. The Nuggets were more rested, but they were also the No. 1 seed in the West going against a No. 8 seed Heat team.\n\nThe top-seeded Thunder is/was going to be a heavy favorite over either the Nuggets or Clippers regardless of rest.\n\nThe long layoff doesn’t hurt though, even if the Thunder is getting a little antsy.\n\n“You want a break, but not too long of a break,” Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said.\n\nThe Thunder had seven days off last season between the first and second rounds. OKC swept New Orleans while the Mavericks-Clippers series went six games. The Mavs beat the more-rested Thunder in six.\n\nIn 2012, when the Thunder made its NBA Finals run, OKC swept Dallas in the first round. Its second-round opponent, the Lakers, played a seven-game first-round series. The Thunder had eight days off heading into the West semifinals. The Lakers had one day off. OKC won that series in five games.\n\nOKC has also been on the other side. In 2011, the Thunder beat the Grizzlies in seven in the West semifinals. Meanwhile, the Mavericks swept the Lakers. Dallas beat OKC in five in the West Finals.\n\n“It’s good for us mentally and physically,” Thunder guard Cason Wallace said.\n\nIf there’s any team that could thrive on short rest it’d be the young Thunder, a team on which a 31-year-old Alex Carsuo is treated like a senior citizen. But the benefits of rest certainly outweigh any worries about rust. The games and travel add up.\n\n“The cumulative travel bites into recovery for a number of reasons — sleep, resources and just the psychological comfort of being in your own bed,” Daigneault said.\n\nThe Clippers or Nuggets were going to have their hands full against the Thunder no matter what. But bludgeoning each other for seven games while the Thunder recharges is going to make a Round 2 upset even more unlikely.\n\nHistory favors the team that sweeps (and sleeps).\n\nTeams that swept vs. teams that went seven\n\n2023\n\nWest finals: Nuggets over Lakers (4-0)\n\nEast finals: Heat over Celtics (4-3)\n\nNBA finals: Nuggets over Heat (4-1)\n\n2017\n\nWest first round: Warriors over Blazers (4-0)\n\nWest first round: Jazz over Clippers (4-3)\n\nWest semifinals: Warriors over Jazz (4-0)\n\n2017\n\nEast semifinals: Cavs over Raptors (4-0)\n\nEast semifinals: Celtics over Wizards (4-3)\n\nEast finals: Cavs over Celtics (4-1)\n\n2016\n\nEast semifinals: Cavs over Hawks (4-0)\n\nEast semifinals: Raptors over Heat (4-3)\n\nEast finals: Cavs over Raptors (4-2)\n\n2014\n\nEast first round: Heat over Bobcats (4-0)\n\nEast first round: Nets over Raptors (4-3)\n\nEast semifinals: Heat over Nets (4-1)\n\n2013\n\nEast first round: Heat over Bucks (4-0)\n\nEast first round: Bulls over Nets (4-3)\n\nEast semifinals: Heat over Bulls (4-1)\n\n2013\n\nWest finals: Spurs over Grizzlies (4-0)\n\nEast finals: Heat over Pacers (4-3)\n\nNBA Finals: Heat over Spurs (4-3)\n\n2012\n\nWest first round: Thunder over Mavericks (4-0)\n\nWest first round: Lakers over Nuggets (4-3)\n\nWest semifinals: Thunder over Lakers (4-1)\n\n2012\n\nWest first round: Spurs over Jazz (4-0)\n\nWest first round: Clippers over Grizzlies (4-3)\n\nWest semifinals: Spurs over Clippers (4-0)\n\n2011\n\nWest semifinals: Mavericks over Lakers (4-0)\n\nWest semifinals: Thunder over Grizzlies (4-3)\n\nWest Finals: Mavericks over Thunder (4-1)\n\n2010\n\nEast first round: Magic over Bobcats (4-0)\n\nEast first round: Hawks over Bucks (4-3)\n\nEast semifinals: Magic over Hawks (4-0)\n\n2009\n\nEast first round: Cavs over Pistons (4-0)\n\nEast first round: Hawks over Heat (4-3)\n\nEast semifinals: Cavs over Hawks (4-0)\n\n2005\n\nWest first round: Suns over Grizzlies (4-0)\n\nWest first round: Mavericks over Rockets (4-3)\n\nWest semifinals: Suns over Mavericks (4-2)\n\n2004\n\nEast first round: Pacers over Celtics (4-0)\n\nEast first round: Heat over Hornets (4-3)\n\nEast semis: Pacers over Heat (4-2)\n\n2001\n\nWest Finals: Lakers over Spurs (4-0)\n\nEast Finals: 76ers over Bucks (4-3)\n\nNBA Finals: Lakers over 76ers (4-1)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/columnist/jeff-zillgitt/2025/05/28/thunder-will-be-nba-champions/83913350007/", "title": "No one will stop the Thunder from winning NBA championship", "text": "The Oklahoma City Thunder are your 2025 NBA champions.\n\nWell, not officially.\n\nOfficially, they are just the 2025 Western Conference champs after eliminating the Minnesota Timberwolves in a five-game conference finals.\n\nBut you know where this is headed.\n\nThe Thunder were the best team during the NBA’s regular season.\n\nThey won the Western Conference in dominating fashion. Game 5 was a demolition – a 124-94 Thunder victory that left no doubt.\n\nANTHONY EDWARDS: Timberwolves star struggles against Thunder\n\nThey can play the opponent’s best style and play it better. Go big, go small, go deep into your bench, win with offense, including the 3-pointer, win with defense and win with stars, the Thunder can do it better than any team in the league.\n\nSorry Indiana. Sorry New York. It’s just not your year.\n\nOklahoma City is in the Finals for the first time since 2012 and is in terrific position to win the franchise’s first title since 1979 when it resided in Seattle and was called the SuperSonics.\n\n“They're highly professional, consistently professional. They're high character people. They come from high character circles, they're unbelievably competitive,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “They put the work in behind it consistently through the ups and downs, and most of all, they're team-first. They embody everything it means to be a team and so they deserve this.\n\n\"They deserve the opportunity that we have now. I couldn't be happier for them. They invest so much in their own games, but they also invest so much in each other and in the team and I just think it's a really uncommon thing in professional basketball that they've built.”\n\nWhile sweeping proclamations can be imprudent endeavors, there is no reason to believe the Thunder won’t be NBA champions within the next few weeks.\n\nEveryone can see it.\n\nThe Thunder don’t want to hear that, and they shouldn’t. Before Game 5, Daigneault talked about staying in the present. That is the right thing to say and the right thing to do. What’s in front of you in that second is the most important thing. Reaching a goal is a series of accomplishments that requires meticulous focus.\n\nThey’ve been headed for this moment for seasons and the grand plan – building another contender through the draft, trades and free agency – has come to fruition.\n\nBefore this season, this group had not won more than one series, and despite the No. 1 seed last season, they lost in the second round. They bypassed some growing pains in this season’s playoffs, learning lessons in real time and figuring out how to finish off games and close out series.\n\nFor a squad that had never won a conference finals closeout game, the Thunder answered any lingering questions about resolve.\n\n\"When we're put up against adversity that you don't really have during the regular season and it's like do-or-die moments, I think that's where we kind of grew up as a team,\" Jalen Williams said. \"I think that last series was big for us. That was our first Game 7, and getting over the hump of the second round, that was big for us.\"\n\nTheir top-ranked defense slowed Nikola Jokic in the conference semifinals and put the brakes on Anthony Edwards and Julius Randle in the conference finals. Daigneault and his coaching staff develop and gameplan, and they have the defenders to execute it whether it’s taking away Jokic’s passing lanes or double-teaming Edwards.\n\nIf there was any doubt about Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s MVP – and there shouldn’t have been any – he erased any uncertainty. It was an MVP performance, and in Game 5, he had 34 points, eight assists and seven rebounds – it was his seventh game with at least 30 points in his past eight. He had a playoff career-high 40 in Game 4 and averaged 31.4 points and shot 45.7% for the series and earned the Western Conference finals MVP.\n\n\"I wanted two things,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"I didn't want to go back to Minnesota travel-wise, and then I wanted the fans to be able to enjoy the moment with us. I wanted them to be able to see it unfold in front of their eyes. I wanted them to be able to celebrate tonight in our building, go home, get drunk, whatever they do. I wanted them to have fun with the moment and yeah, it was good. I just wanted to make sure that above all I could give my energy and my effort to try to give these fans what they deserve.\"\n\nThe Thunder are far from a one-man show. Jalen Williams made his first All-NBA team this season, and Chet Holmgren is headed for an All-Star appearance with his ability to score, rebound and protect the rim. Williams had 19 points, eight rebounds, five assists, one block and one steal, and Holmgren had 22 points, seven rebounds and three blocks. Lu Dort played outstanding defense, and center Isaiah Hartenstein was a shrewd offseason signing that has added to Oklahoma City’s versatility.\n\nAlex Caruso, Cason Wallace, Aaron Wiggins, Isaiah Joe, Kenrich Williams and Jaylin Williams give Daigneault more options.\n\nThey are improving by the game and by the series, looking more and more unbeatable in a series with each victory.\n\n\"Now we are a step closer to our goal and we're happy about that,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"But it's still four more games to go win, four really hard games to go win and we have to be the best version of ourselves for four nights to reach the ultimate goal. And we understand that. We know that, and that's what we're focused on.\"\n\nIt is a team that has 2025 NBA champions written all over it.\n\n(This story was updated with additional information.)\n\nFollow NBA columnist Jeff Zillgitt on social media @JeffZillgitt", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2025/06/23/nba-finals-2025-winners-losers/84313526007/", "title": "NBA Finals 2025 winners, losers: Thunder claim championship", "text": "The Oklahoma City Thunder earned the NBA championship. They made it through the fierce gauntlet that is the Western Conference and then needed seven games to beat the Indiana Pacers, one of the hardest-playing teams in the league.\n\nThe Thunder put together a 68-win regular season and were favorites to win the title even though they had never advanced beyond the conference semifinals with this group before this season. They learned what was required to finish the job through wins and losses, through sweeps and seven-games series.\n\nIndiana enters the offseason with one of the worst what-ifs. What if Tyrese Haliburton hadn’t sustained a lower right injury in Game 5 and had not left Game 7 in the first quarter after further injuring his leg?\n\nInjuries always impact the playoffs to some degree, and the Thunder were healthy enough and talented enough to survive.\n\nHere are winners and losers from the Pacers-Thunder NBA Finals:\n\nWINNERS\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had an all-time great season, becoming just the fourth player in NBA history to win the regular-season scoring title, regular-season MVP, title and Finals MVP in the same season, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan and Shaquille O’Neal.\n\nAgainst the Pacers, he averaged 30.3 points, 5.6 assists, 4.6 rebounds, 1.9 steals and 1.6 blocks and shot 44.3% from the field, including 49.6% inside the 3-point line, and in Game 7, he had 29 points, 12 assists, five rebounds and was 11-for-12 on free throws.\n\nSam Presti\n\nThe Thunder executive vice president and general manager has sought this moment for almost 20 years. He came close with the Thunder squad featuring Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden, but when that era crumbled with Durant’s departure in 2016 and Westbrook’s trade in 2019, Presti embarked on another plan to build a contender. He succeeded with a slew of savvy draft picks, trades and free-agent signings. The second-youngest team to win a title in the past 50 years, the Thunder will be favorites to win the title again in 2025-26.\n\nJalen Williams\n\nWilliams, 24, emerged as an All-Star, All-NBA performer and All-Defensive selection in his third season in 2024-25. He is one of the league’s best two-way players and his best years are in front of him. He averaged 23.6 points, 5.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists in the Finals and had a spectacular 40-point performance in Game 5.\n\nOklahoma City, the city\n\nHurricane Katrina forced the New Orleans Hornets’ relocation to Oklahoma City for the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons. It gave the city a taste of pro basketball and revealed that a major pro sports franchise could thrive there. The unfortunate part is that Seattle lost a team when it moved to Oklahoma City in 2008 (and that injustice can be rectified if and when the NBA expands). Thunder fans love the team, and the players appreciate the support.\n\nMark Daigneault\n\nIn his fifth season as Thunder coach, Daigneault won a title and has demonstrated he’s one of the best coaches in the league. His steady approach resonates with players, is quick to adapt and is a thinking-man’s coach.\n\nThunder roster\n\nWith this team, it’s difficult to name just a few players because it receives so many contributions from so many players. Alex Caruso won his second title, Chet Holmgren showed why he’s important to the Thunder success, and players through the roster (Lu Dort, Cason Wallace, Aaron Wiggins, Isaiah Joe, Isaiah Hartenstein, Ajay Mitchell, Kenrich Williams, Jaylin Williams) had their moments for Oklahoma City this season.\n\nLOSERS\n\nIndiana’s future takes a hit\n\nThis loss will sting, yes, but Indiana’s outlook for the immediate future might have just become far grimmer. If the Pacers fears about a torn Achilles tendon manifest, Indiana would be at a disadvantage next season — assuming Haliburton is able to return next season.\n\nThe third and fourth quarters Sunday night proved how challenging it will be if Haliburton misses extended time; he sets the pace of Indiana’s offense, finds open players and became one of the all-time clutch players. If he’s indeed out for several months, the Pacers will sorely miss Haliburton.\n\nPacers turnovers cost them the game\n\nIndiana, simply put, lost the game because of turnovers. Credit the Thunder, a historically great defense, but the Pacers committed 23 turnovers, while Oklahoma City gave it away just eight times. That led to a massive 32-10 discrepancy in points off turnovers.\n\nIt also started to tilt the balance in the third quarter; the Pacers committed eight turnovers in the period, leading to 18 Thunder points off turnovers in the third alone. The Pacers were outscored by 14 in the period.\n\nSome key Pacers fail to show up\n\nAny game in which a star player goes down early — let alone Game 7 of the NBA Finals — the path to victory was always going to require role players and reserves to step up. And while it’s tough to blame a few players for Indy’s defeat, Obi Toppin (who had posted some pretty big games these Finals), Aaron Nesmith and Myles Turner each struggled, combining to go 3-of-13 (23.1%), for nine points. Toppin was held scoreless and committed three turnovers.\n\nHoops fans robbed of epic Game 7\n\nThis was looking like the setup for an epic Game 7. Tyrese Haliburton had finished games strongly, but slow starts had been an issue. Not Sunday night. Haliburton was hyper-aggressive and sought his shot, draining three deep 3-pointers to score nine points through seven minutes before he got hurt.\n\nThe Pacers hung in, but it was clear they were missing their star player to generate offense. Perhaps the Pacers still lose even if Haliburton finishes the game. In any case, it would’ve made for a far more compelling watch.\n\n“You just hate to see it in sports in general, but in this moment, my heart dropped for him,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “I couldn't imagine playing the biggest game of my life and something like that happening. It's not fair. But competition isn't fair sometimes.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2024/11/19/nba-cup-2024-games-today-time-channel-stream-schedule/76225351007/", "title": "NBA Cup 2024 games today: Time, channel, schedule for Tuesday", "text": "Steph Curry and Klay Thompson got the 2024 Emirates NBA Cup started off last week with a playoff-like atmosphere for Thompson's return to the Bay Area with the Dallas Mavericks.

Still, with most teams having six or seven games remaining on their schedules, there could still be plenty of movement in the standings, particularly in the Western Conference, where four teams, the Warriors, Grizzlies, Timberwolves and Clippers — the five-through-eight seeds — are separated by just a single game.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports separated NBA bubble teams into three tiers in terms of their likelihood of making the playoffs — less likely, likely and more likely — and the things each team must do to get there.\n\n(Stats and results are through Tuesday’s games)\n\nEastern Conference\n\nLess likely\n\nChicago Bulls (34-42): They’ve been playing some of their best basketball in recent weeks and it appears as though we’re headed for a third consecutive Heat-Bulls matchup in the play-in. Chicago lost each of the previous two play-in games against Miami. Chicago must keep its recent offensive efficiency, with Josh Giddey running point guard and creating chances for Coby White and others.\n\nAtlanta Hawks (36-39): This is an interesting scenario. The Hawks will almost certainly face the Magic in the first play-in game. Atlanta and Orlando have split the pair of games both have played thus far, but they will see each other twice in the final week of the regular season. Meaning there’s a high probability they will see each other three times in a week. While the Hawks have played well at times this season, their weaknesses on defense compromise their chance at success if their normally-hot shooting falters.\n\nLikely\n\nOrlando Magic (37-40): That’s why the Magic get the slight edge here. If indeed Orlando faces the Hawks in the play-in, one victory gets the Magic through to the playoffs. Orlando has been the better team down the stretch, although they do record the occasional offensive clunker.\n\nMiami Heat (34-41): Their five-game winning streak snapped a 10-game losing streak and came mostly against teams completely out of the playoff picture. All season long, the Heat have failed to play up to contenders, going 9-26 (.257) against squads .500 or better, and they’ve struggled to finish games in the fourth quarter. None of the teams Miami would face in the play-in, however, are teams with winning records and the Heat has plenty of experience in the play-in tournament. A deep postseason run, though, appears unlikely.\n\nMore likely\n\nMilwaukee Bucks (41-34): They’re in the sixth seed and a solid five games ahead of the Magic, but the Bucks have lost six of their last nine. They haven’t figured out their offensive rhythm with Damian Lillard (deep vein thrombosis) sidelined, so the Bucks need Kyle Kuzma and Bobby Portis (eligible to return from suspension April 8) to step up. Milwaukee, ranked 25th in defensive rating (119.5) over the last nine games, must also defend far better. The good news? Milwaukee has the NBA’s sixth-easiest remaining schedule, per tankathon.com.\n\nWestern Conference\n\nLess likely\n\nPhoenix Suns (35-41): Even if Phoenix, currently 1 ½ games back of the 10-seed, sneaks into the play-in picture and wins the first game, it would almost certainly have to face one of the Timberwolves, Clippers, Grizzlies or Warriors — all superior, more consistent teams — in the second game of the tournament. Losers of four in a row, the Suns have an atrocious defensive rating in that span of 137.0. The Suns also have the NBA’s toughest remaining strength of schedule (.618), per tankathon.com.\n\nSacramento Kings (36-39): The Kings have won just one game in their last six and have extreme difficulties playing perimeter defense. And, all the potential opponents the Kings would like face, mentioned in the entry above, are at least solid in 3-point shooting percentage.\n\nDallas Mavericks (37-39): It’s hard to see the Mavericks, even with Anthony Davis back, getting past the play-in. They sorely miss Kyrie Irving, and the team’s shot creation and offensive rhythm can often stagnate. Simply put: Dallas will need Anthony Davis to carry the team.\n\nLikely\n\nMemphis Grizzlies (44-32): Losing Tuesday night to the Warriors hurt their chances some, though the Grizzlies remain in the No. 6 spot — for now. Yet, Memphis is 2-8 over its last 10 and has lost four consecutive. As always with this fast-paced, up-tempo team, the priority is enacting some element of control and limiting turnovers; Memphis ranks 28th in the NBA in turnovers per game (15.8). Ja Morant, in particular, needs to slow things down a touch, as his six giveaways Wednesday against Golden State proved to be costly.\n\nMore likely\n\nLos Angeles Clippers (43-32): There’s a significant drop off after the No. 8 seed in the West, currently occupied by Los Angeles. The Clippers are currently 6 ½ games up on the ninth-place Mavericks. The real battle is to determine which two teams will occupy the fifth and sixth seeds — the automatic playoff berths. The Warriors, Grizzlies, Timberwolves and Clippers are separated by just one game. It’s difficult to see a playoff picture without each of those four teams. Los Angeles, though, will need continued health and availability from Kawhi Leonard.\n\nGolden State Warriors (44-31): With their win Tuesday against the Grizzlies, the Warriors secured a massive tiebreaker over Memphis. The Warriors are 19-5 since trading for Jimmy Butler, even though the competition in that span has not been the strongest. As a two-game absence of Steph Curry last week showed, Golden State’s offense cannot function without its star player; the Warriors must continue to do whatever they can to keep Curry, 37, fresh.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves (44-32): A massive victory on the road Tuesday night against the Nuggets sets up the Timberwolves nicely down this final stretch, where they play the easiest remaining schedule (.382), according to tankathon.com. As teams continue to throw double-teams at Anthony Edwards, Minnesota must find ways to get other scorers involved.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.

Andrew Cuomo in New York City's June 24 Democratic mayoral primary.\n\nWhile there were 11 candidates on the ranked-choice ballot, preliminary polling named Cuomo and Mamdani the front-runners by a large margin. Cuomo frequently polled above Mamdani in the weeks leading up to voting day, but the former governor ultimately ended up calling his opponent on Tuesday night to concede.\n\nMamdani led Cuomo 44% to 36% among first-place votes, with 96% of ballots counted as of around 1 p.m. on Wednesday, June 25.\n\nThe Democratic nominee will begin the general election as the favorite in the overwhelmingly Democratic city. Considered the more progressive candidate of the two, Mamdani's platform has included stances on rent and housing, cost of living, safety, infrastructure and relations between the city and President Donald Trump.\n\nHere is a brief look at Mamdani's stance on major city issues, based on his campaign page and reporting from USA TODAY.\n\nWho is Zohran Mamdani?\n\nMamdani is a 33-year-old politician and member of the Democratic Socialists of America party. He was born in Kampala, Uganda but moved to New York City with his family when he was 7 years old, where he attended the Bronx High School of Science, according to his assembly biography.\n\nMamdani is currently the three-term representative for Assembly District 36, located in Queens, in the New York State Assembly. He is the first South Asian man and Ugandan to serve in the assembly and the third Muslim person to do so.\n\nHe worked as a foreclosure-prevention housing counselor prior to serving in the assembly, according to his biography. Interestingly, he also worked a stint in film, writing and as a rap music producer.\n\nHe is the son of Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, and Mira Nair, an Indian filmmaker.\n\nIf elected, he would become New York's first Muslim mayor, as well as the city's first Asian and Millennial mayor.\n\nWhere does Zohran Mamdani stand on issues?\n\nRent and housing\n\nIn a city with sky-high rent prices, cost of housing was a major tentpole in all mayoral candidates' campaigns. Mamdani's vision includes freezing rent on rent-stabilized apartments and building more affordable housing.\n\nBesides \"immediately\" freezing rent for rent-stabilized tenants, Mamdani's platform also outlines a plan for constructing 200,000 new \"affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized\" units over 10 years and fast-tracking approval for \"affordable\" developments.\n\nIt also promises a \"revamp\" of the mayor's tenant protection efforts to bolster 311 services (non-emergency city services), allow tenants to request and track inspections and enable the city to step in when landlords are not meeting city standards. It would also create a new \"Office of Deed Theft Prevention\" for homeowners.\n\nPublic transportation\n\nFree and faster buses are a major talking point in Mamdani's campaign. He says he would eliminate fares on all city buses and would improve their speed by building and expanding priority lanes, bus queue jump signals and dedicated loading zones.\n\nHealth and safety\n\nWatch any NYC campaign commercial and you'll hear candidates talking about safety on the streets and subways. Mamdani plans to create the Department of Community Safety, a proposal that includes increased investment in mental health programs and crisis response, expanding \"evidence-based gun violence prevention programs\" and increasing funding to \"hate violence prevention programs\" by 800%.\n\nCost of living and labor; city-owned grocery stores\n\nAnother cost of living strain on New York families, beyond rent, is the price of essentials, like groceries. Mamdani has said he plans to address the cost of food by creating city-owned grocery stores that will pay no rent or property taxes, buy and sell at wholesale prices from centralized warehouses and partner with local vendors to keep prices down.\n\nOn childcare, Mamdani's campaign says it will offer free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years. He will also seek to implement the distribution of baby baskets to parents of newborns, which would include items like diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, post-partum pads, swaddles, books and local resource guides.\n\nMamdani has also said he will aim to raise NYC's minimum wage to $30 by 2030 and regulate delivery apps like DoorDash, GrubHub and Uber Eats to strengthen licensure requirements and expand resources to assist app workers.\n\nEducation\n\nMamdani's plans surrounding K-12 education, as outlined in his campaign, include ensuring equal distribution of money and resources to city schools, creating car-free \"School Streets,\" expanding the Bronx pilot Every Child and Family Is Known program to address homelessness in the school system and, on a collegiate level, investing in the CUNY system.\n\nHe also champions the Green Schools for a Healthier New York City initiative that seeks to renovate 500 public schools with renewable energy infrastructure and HVAC upgrades, make asphalt schoolyards into green spaces and build hubs in 50 schools for community emergency situations.\n\nTaxation, bills and fees\n\nRunning on a platform of pushing back against the proverbial \"big guys,\" Mamdani has proposed a 2% tax on residents earning above $1 million annually and raising the corporate tax rate to 11.5%.\n\nMamdani has also promised to \"fight corporate exploration\" by banning \"hidden fees\" and non-compete clauses, \"fighting\" misleading advertising and predatory contracts, limiting tax dollars given to companies under NDA agreements and funding challenges to ConEd's price increases. He plans to do so via enforcement of consumer protection laws, pushing legislation in Albany and working with the City Council, according to his campaign's policy memo.\n\nResponding to Donald Trump\n\nAnother topline talking point among all of the mayoral candidates was handling relations with President Donald Trump and, in many cases, laying out plans to resist or respond to his policies.\n\nAmong Mamdani's plans to \"resist\" Trump are strengthening sanctuary city protections by ending cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and barring them from city facilities, increasing legal support for migrants, preventing personal data from being given to ICE, protecting abortion rights and increasing the budgets of the NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection and the NYC Commission on Human Rights.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/04/politics/eric-adams-new-york-crime-midterms", "title": "Mayor Eric Adams could be New York Democrats' fall guy for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDemocratic officials and strategists in New York tell CNN they are bracing for what could be stunning losses in the governor’s race and in contests for as many as four US House seats largely in the suburbs.\n\nWith crime dominating the headlines and the airwaves, multiple Democrats watching these races closely are pointing to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, accusing him of overhyping the issue and playing into right-wing narratives in ways that may have helped set the party up for disaster on Tuesday.\n\n“He was an essential validator in the city to make their attacks seem more legit and less partisan,” said one Democratic operative working on campaigns in New York, who asked not to be named so as not to compromise current clients.\n\nOther Democrats argue this has it backwards. While they accuse Republicans of political ploys they call cynical, racist and taking advantage of a situation fostered by the pandemic, they insist candidates would be in better shape if they had followed Adams’ lead in speaking to the fear and frustration voters feel.\n\nBut going into Election Day, New York Democrats worry about a double whammy from how they’ve struggled to address crime: Swing voters turned off by Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and suburban House Democrats go vote Republican, while base Democrats in the city, dejected by talk of how awful things are, don’t turn out at all.\n\n“Crime today has been compared to the ’80s and the ‘90s, and the fact of the matter is that crime is lower now than it was then,” said Crystal Hudson, a Democratic New York City councilwoman from Brooklyn. “That’s emboldened the right to use crime as their narrative and put Democrats in a bad spot for these midterm elections.”\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin, Hochul’s GOP opponent, has taken to regularly invoking Adams on the campaign trail, to the point that some Democratic operatives have grimly joked that Zeldin could just run clips of Adams talking about crime as his closing ads.\n\nThere are national ripples: Democratic groups like the Democratic Governors Association are moving in millions of dollars to prop up Hochul in a deep-blue state instead of spending that on tight races elsewhere, with Vice President Kamala Harris flying in on Thursday in one of her own last campaign stops and President Joe Biden heading to Westchester County, north of New York City, on Sunday to rally with the governor. Republicans, meanwhile, are seizing opportunities to pad a potential House majority by targeting seats that Democrats had been counting on as backstops.\n\nAdams was elected mayor last year on a tough-talking, tough-on-crime message, then embraced as such a hero among many Democratic leaders that rumors circulated he might be eyeing a 2024 presidential run himself. In office, he’s often talked about the bad shape the city is in, including citing statistics he says demonstrate connections between the rise in crime and a 2019 progressive-led state law change that barred judges from setting cash bail for all but the most serious offenses.\n\nMultiple top Democrats argue that Adams could have used his credibility to buttress Hochul – whom allies point out is in a tricky political spot talking about crime in New York City as a 64-year-old White woman from Western New York – instead of loudly pushing the governor to call a special session of the legislature to roll back more of the new bail laws. Hochul also seemed to be caught surprised by the attacks and unsure of how to defend her record, with several elected officials and operatives saying she appeared to be balancing between different factions of the party rather than setting a firm agenda of her own.\n\nThat’s fed an increasingly tense relationship in the campaign’s final weeks, though Adams recently appeared with Hochul at both an official government event announcing she’d allocate state money to pay for overtime for police patrolling the subways and at a campaign stop in Queens as she seeks to prove to voters that she’s taking crime seriously. Adams has also shifted to blaming the media for sensationalizing the crime problem.\n\nAppearing on “CNN This Morning” on Friday, Hochul said there’s never been a governor and mayor in New York with as strong a relationship as the one she has with Adams. While she acknowledged that violent crime is up and that the issue was rooted in voters’ sincere fears, she said Republicans were “not having a conversation about real solutions.”\n\nShe cited her record of getting more cops and cameras on the street and help for the mentally ill, and Zeldin’s opposition to gun control.\n\n“Crime has been a problem,” she said. “I understand that. Let’s talk about real answers and not just give everybody all these platitudes.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Lemon asks NY governor why her race is so close with GOP candidate 04:13 - Source: CNN Lemon asks NY governor why her race is so close with GOP candidate 04:13\n\n‘People want to feel safe first’\n\nRep. Kathleen Rice, a retiring moderate Democrat from just outside New York City and a former Nassau County district attorney, said at first she was encouraged by Adams. As a former police officer, he understands the problem, she said, but “the general consensus is that he hasn’t shown he has focused on the issue enough for it to have made a difference.”\n\nRice said she’s heard from constituents from just outside the city who are turned off by reports of Adams spending late nights at pricey private restaurants juxtaposed with stories about murders on the subways and other horrific incidents.\n\n“People want to feel safe first before they go to a club,” Rice said.\n\nRice’s seat is one of two Democratic-held seats on Long Island now seen at risk. Democrats are also in danger of losing two seats north of New York City – one held by Rep. Pat Ryan and the Lower Hudson Valley district of Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\n“It is an issue for voters, but it is not because they have personally experienced crime in the Hudson Valley or their neighbors are talking about crimes committed in the Hudson Valley as much as it is the narrative pushed by the industrial fear machine at Fox and the New York Post describing New York City as a lawless hellscape,” Maloney said in an interview. “That, understandably, is raising concerns among suburbanites.”\n\nMonths ago, Maloney warned other House Democrats, in conversations and in a March memo sent around by the DCCC and obtained by CNN, to be ready to respond and rebut attacks for being weak on crime. The guidance started with telling candidates to be firmly against calls to “defund the police” but also to talk about the more than $8 billion Democratic lawmakers had secured for law enforcement in bills such as the American Rescue Plan.\n\nMaloney pointed to his votes for legislation to fund programs for body cameras and plate reading technology for local police departments in his district, as well as for the gun control measures enacted over the summer.\n\nHe also stood by a remark he made last July – catching several Democratic operatives’ attention at the time – when he stood with Adams on the steps of the Democratic National Committee headquarters and called him “a rock on which I can build a church.”\n\n“What I meant is that I like his combination of respecting good policing and understanding the need for public safety with a genuine passion for justice and fairness in our system,” Maloney said in an interview. “He may not get everything right, and it may not be everything I would do. But he recognizes that we’re not where we should be. And I support his efforts to clean it up.”\n\nOthers have not been convinced.\n\n“The concern over crime is real. It is acute,” said Rep. Mondaire Jones, a progressive Democrat who lost a primary to represent parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn after Maloney opted to run for a redrawn suburban seat that also included parts of Jones’ district. “But once this election is over, I hope people have an honest conversation about how Democrats like Eric Adams have validated a hysteria over crime that is uninformed and that has been debunked.”\n\nSuburban statistics don’t match New York City\n\nConversations about crime in New York are bound up in the debate over reforming the bail laws, and in well-worn internal political power struggles among officials. In phone calls and meetings at the beginning of the year, Adams urged top officials in Albany to change the laws, warning them that crime would likely be a major political liability in the fall, according to people familiar with the conversations.\n\nLegislative leaders have already passed two partial rollbacks, including one supported by Hochul earlier this year. But they have resisted doing more, despite warnings from suburban members.\n\nAdams has charged that the “insane broken system” of bail laws now puts criminals back on the street who then tend to get back to committing crimes. According to figures from the New York Police Department, in the first half of the year, 211 people were arrested at least three times for burglary and 899 people were arrested at least three times for shoplifting, increases of 142.5 percent and 88.9 percent, respectively, over the same period in 2017. The mayor’s office also pointed to statistics that show double-digit jumps in recidivism for felony, grand larceny and auto theft.\n\nStill, crime statistics don’t tell as simple a story as what shows up in political ads. Suburban counties are reporting safer streets and communities – a report in February by the Westchester County executive from just north of New York City, for example, showed a 26.5 percent drop in its crime index.\n\nMurders and shootings are down in the city from last year, but rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and auto theft are all up, by over 30 percent from 2021 in several categories, according to New York Police Department data.\n\nBut those are the stories which play on the same local news – and campaign ads during the breaks – that reach into the homes of suburban voters who may not have been crime victims themselves, or even spent much time in the city for years. And that’s left Hochul and Democratic House and state legislative nominees leaching support in Long Island, Westchester and the northern New York City suburbs.\n\n“A lot of the story that’s being told is of New York City crime,” said Democrat Bridget Fleming, a former prosecutor who’s been endorsed by police unions in the House race for much of the area Zeldin currently represents on Long Island. “We’re making sure law enforcement is supported – and other than gun crime, we’re keeping crime down here.”\n\nEvan Roth Smith, a pollster working on several local races, said Adams “may be a drag on Democratic trustworthiness on crime.”\n\nBut Adams spokesman Maxwell Young said the mayor’s job isn’t to put a rosy spin on things in a way that could benefit Hochul’s or any of the other candidates’ campaigns.\n\n“We can’t, and won’t, ignore the reality,” Young said. “Those who claim we aren’t making progress or, conversely, that we’ve been crying wolf aren’t paying attention and have no idea what they’re talking about.”\n\nTrying to break a decades-long paradigm\n\nEvan Thies, a top Adams political adviser, said he wished other Democrats had taken lessons from the mayor’s win last year.\n\n“You have to convince people you’re worthy to lead by following their lead on issues and meeting their urgency, not by disagreeing with them,” Thies said. “The mayor became mayor by listening to and advocating for people in high-crime communities – he’s not going to abandon them now.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adriano Espaillat, whose district covers Upper Manhattan and parts of the Bronx, points to how many systemic, as well as larger societal and economic issues, are involved in making a real impact on crime – and that Adams has only been on the job for 10 months.\n\n“He’s really trying hard. This is not easy,” Espaillat said. “It’s going to take some time.”\n\nBiden had his own bromance with Adams, from hosting him in the White House weeks after he won his mayoral primary to offering him half of his peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich as they rode together in the limo in February during a presidential visit to New York to talk about gun violence. White House chief of staff Ron Klain praised Adams for tapping into the same coalition of pragmatic, working-class and African American voters, which won Biden the 2020 Democratic nomination.\n\nThrough an aide, Klain did not respond to questions about how he and the president view Adams these days.\n\nBut what many Democrats are left with as they approach the end of campaigning in New York is a potentially devastating example of failing again to break a decades-long paradigm of Republicans capitalizing on calling them soft on crime.\n\n“The paradox here is: Crime is high in some of the reddest parts of the country where they have the weakest gun safety laws. We needed to tell that story and done so loudly to neutralize the issue. You can’t sit idly by and wish it away,” said Charlie Kelly, a political adviser to former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s gun safety group Everytown and former executive director for the Democratic-aligned House Majority PAC.\n\nIn New York and beyond, some Democrats are already hoping for a post-election recognition and realignment that pushes their party both toward a tougher attack on Republicans and a more forceful deflection of their own left flank.\n\n“We can’t dismiss people’s concerns,” said Justin Brannan, a New York City councilman from a moderate district in Brooklyn. “It’s another thing to be a Republican, to say, ‘If you go outside, you’re going to die.’”\n\n“It’s both true that crime is down from the 1990s and that it has been increasing and that people feel uncomfortable,” said Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president. “Democrats have to be able to talk about that and offer real solutions.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/us/brooklyn-subway-shooting-wednesday", "title": "Suspect in Brooklyn subway train shooting called in the tip that led to ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nThe man suspected of shooting 10 people on a subway train in Brooklyn on Tuesday called in a tip to Crime Stoppers that led to his capture Wednesday, two law enforcement sources told CNN.\n\nFrank James, 62, was arrested without incident by patrol officers in Manhattan’s East Village neighborhood on Wednesday afternoon, officials said.\n\nJames called in the tip and told authorities he was at a McDonald’s on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the sources confirmed.

The call dropped moments later and was followed by a 911 call from another person who said they had spotted James, one of the two sources told CNN.\n\nPatrol officers arrived at the McDonald’s but did not see him, the sources said.

He was in federal custody Wednesday afternoon.\n\nJames will have his initial court appearance Thursday, according to a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. CNN has reached out to his federal defender for comment.\n\nJames had nine prior arrests in New York dating from 1992 to 1998, including possession of burglary tools, criminal sex act, and theft of service, NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said. He also had three arrests in New Jersey in 1991, 1992 and 2007 for trespassing, larceny and disorderly conduct, Essig said.\n\nWednesday’s arrest came hours after officials elevated James from a “person of interest” to a suspect – and shortly after the city issued an emergency alert to residents saying James was “wanted” and asking for tips.\n\nThe subway shooting represents a long-feared nightmare scenario for New York City, which relies heavily on its mass transit system. Subway ridership cratered during the Covid pandemic as many workers stayed home, and ridership has not returned to its pre-pandemic levels, in part due to wariness over an increase in violence on the transit system.\n\nThe photo gallery below contains graphic images.

After opening fire on the train, he got off at the 36th Street station, boarded an R train across the platform and rode to the 25th Street station stop, Essig said.\n\nLess than an hour later, he was spotted boarding the subway at the 7th Avenue and 9th Street station, about 1.5 miles away, Essig added.\n\nInvestigators combing through the shooting scene found a Glock 9 mm handgun, three extended magazines, two detonated smoke grenades, two non-detonated smoke grenades, a hatchet and keys to a U-Haul van, Essig said. Witnesses also described the suspect as a heavyset Black man wearing a neon construction jacket.\n\nThe gun found at the scene was purchased by James in Ohio in 2011, Essig said Wednesday. A credit card that was used to rent the U-Haul was also found, two law enforcement sources told CNN. Two officials told CNN they believe the gun jammed during the shooting.\n\nThe U-Haul van was rented by James, police said. The van was recovered near the Kings Highway Station, and surveillance video showed James leaving it on Tuesday morning, according to a criminal complaint. The neon construction jacket, which had been discarded on the subway platform, had a receipt for a storage unit in Philadelphia registered to James, the complaint states.\n\nFederal prosecutors believe he visited the storage facility filled with ammunition and more weapons on the evening before the Tuesday attack, according to court documents.\n\nOn Tuesday, authorities executed a court-authorized warrant to search the storage facility and found “9mm ammunition, a threaded 9mm pistol barrel that allows for a silencer or suppresser to be attached, targets and .223 caliber ammunition, which is used with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle,” among other things.\n\nAccording to the complaint, law enforcement executed a search warrant at a Philadelphia apartment authorities believe James rented for 15 days beginning around March 28 and found “an empty magazine for a Glock handgun, a taser, a high-capacity rifle magazine and a blue smoke cannister.”\n\nInvestigators did not find any other weapons or explosives in the van, two law enforcement officials said. The officials said it appeared James may have slept in the vehicle. They said a license plate reader detected the van driving over the Verrazzano Bridge from Staten Island into Brooklyn around 4 a.m. ET Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities also tracked the purchase of a gas mask to James through an eBay account, two officials said.\n\nHis family did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows inside NYC subway car 'after all the popping' 01:23 - Source: CNN Video shows inside NYC subway car 'after all the popping' 01:23\n\nPeople aboard the train car on Tuesday morning said smoke filled the car and gunshots rang out, causing people to push their way to the other side of the train in panic and confusion.\n\nHourari Benkada, 27, who was shot in the back of the knee, said he thinks he was sitting next to the shooter.\n\nSpeaking from a hospital bed Tuesday, Benkada said he’d gotten into the last car of the N train and sat next to a man with a duffel bag who appeared to be wearing an MTA vest. The man let off a “smoke bomb,” said Benkada, a housekeeping manager at the New Yorker Hotel.\n\n“And all you see (is) smoke – black smoke … going off, and then people bum-rushing to the back,” Benkada said. “This pregnant woman was in front of me. I was trying to help her. I didn’t know there were shots at first. I just thought it was a black smoke bomb.\n\n“She said, ‘I’m pregnant with a baby.’ I hugged her. And then the bum-rush continued. I got pushed, and that’s when I got shot in the back of my knee.”\n\nThe shooting started about 20 seconds after the train took off from the 59th Street station and felt like it lasted for nearly 2 minutes, Benkada said.\n\nClaire Tunkel, 46, who was in the subway car where the shooting took place, described the scene as chaotic. She said she couldn’t see anything because of the smoke, but she heard people crying out for help and others saying they were bleeding.\n\nPeople were rushing to the front of the car, and some fell to the ground, she said. “You could feel the bodies.”\n\nSuspect talked about mass shootings in videos\n\nEmergency personnel, including the FBI, search a moving truck during an ongoing investigation in the Brooklyn borough of New York, Tuesday, April 12, 2022.

He documented his travel from Wisconsin to the Northeast in a series of videos in recent weeks.\n\nJames talked about violence and mass shootings in the videos, including one uploaded Monday in which he said he’s thought about killing people who have presumably hurt him.\n\nIn another video posted last week, James rants about abuse in churches and racism in the workplace, using misogynistic and racist language. Many of the videos that James uploaded included references to violence, including at a set group of people he believed had maligned him, in addition to broad societal and racial groups that he appeared to hate.\n\nIn another video posted last month to the same channel, James said that he had post-traumatic stress.\n\nIn a video posted in February, he also criticized a plan by the Adams administration to address safety and homelessness in the subway in part through an expanded presence of mental health professionals. In a racist and rambling recording, James called the new effort “doomed to fail” and described his own negative experience with city health workers during a “crisis of mental health back in the ’90s, ‘80s and ‘70s.”", "authors": ["Brynn Gingras Shimon Prokupecz Pervaiz Shallwani Artemis Moshtaghian Laura Ly Kristina Sgueglia Eric Levenson Mark Morales", "Brynn Gingras", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Pervaiz Shallwani", "Artemis Moshtaghian", "Laura Ly", "Kristina Sgueglia", "Eric Levenson", "Mark Morales"], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/us/brooklyn-shooting-sunset-park-residents", "title": "Sunset Park felt like a safe neighborhood in a big city.

The 20-year-old could make out the sounds of sirens on the street, helicopters overhead. When he stepped outside his front door, he found himself in the middle of chaos.\n\nAcevedo lives across the street from the 36th Street subway station where, just hours earlier, a gunman opened two smoke grenades and fired at least 33 shots at commuters, striking 10 people.\n\n“It’s really surreal for us,” Acevedo told CNN of his neighborhood in the southwest part of Brooklyn. “This whole neighborhood, it’s a community, crime isn’t what you expect here. I’m speechless.”\n\nIn the aftermath, neighbors held each others’ hands across the fences that separate their homes. Others sat in shock on their stoops. This kind of violence is something the more than 135,000 residents of this tightknit community – about a third of whom are Asian and a third Hispanic, according to US Census data – are used to hearing about in other neighborhoods. Not here, not so close to their haven where they call everyone “family.”\n\nLike Acevedo, Nicholas Sciammarella and his partner, Anthony Valentino, realized something was amiss as the sound of sirens flooded their home during breakfast.\n\nThe couple live a block away from the station, and Valentino went out to see what was happening there.\n\n“I saw two people holding up a man who was all bloodied, blood all over his hands, and he was in shock, walking like a zombie before sitting to the floor,” Valentino said. He stayed, offering water, phone calls and help to those leaving the station.\n\nSciammarella said they also called down their list of neighbors, “checking one by one and making sure everyone is OK.”\n\nNicholas Sciammarella, left, and Anthony Valentino, residents of Sunset Park Courtesy Nicholas Sciammarella\n\nAt the L&E Deli Grocery, just two blocks from the station, manager Elia Tapia, 38, was processing it all. She has lived in Sunset Park for 20 years.\n\n“Never in my life could I have thought this would happen to our home,” she said. “This is a huge surprise for us, this neighborhood is so nice and quiet, nothing happens. We are a family here, we all know and take care of each other.”\n\nAsk a Sunset Park local to describe their neighborhood, and they’ll likely tell you it’s a calm, friendly place, the type of neighborhood to raise a family in. The neighborhood has emerged as part of Brooklyn’s Chinatown, thanks to a growing population of immigrants from China’s Fujian province.\n\nIt’s only a short subway ride from Manhattan but still far enough to feel like a different city altogether. Situated on the waterfront, Sunset Park offers green space and views of New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty and even New Jersey, on a clear day.\n\nTapia has lost that feeling of safety she had always adored about her neighborhood.\n\n“I used to be able to walk here, late at night, 2 in the morning to the train, but now I could never,” she told CNN. “We can feel the difference (in violence) in the city, but still we could have never expected this to happen to us.”\n\nMembers of the New York Police Department are seen patrolling the streets after the mass shooting. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe shooting at 36th Street subway station comes amid a surge in violence across New York City. More than 360 people have been shot this year in 322 shooting incidents, according to figures released by the New York Police Department on Sunday. That’s an 8.4% increase in shooting incidents over this time last year.\n\nGeneral crime on the transit system has spiked even more – 68% over last year, the NYPD reports.\n\nCrime in the 72nd Precinct, which includes Sunset Park, has rapidly risen as well, NYPD data shows.\n\nOverall crime is up more than 103% so far this year through Sunday compared to this time in 2021 and up 70% from 2020, with the highest increases seen in burglary, grand larceny and auto theft. There had been one shooting incident in the precinct this year as of Sunday, the same number as this time last year.\n\nFor Lilea Ng, too, Tuesday felt like her home was under attack, she told CNN. A Chinese American born in Panama, Ng moved to the city 20 years ago, eager to find the American dream.\n\nNow, that dream is turning into a nightmare, she said.\n\nEven before Tuesday’s violence, Ng avoided riding the subway or any public transportation, she said, noting the rising violence towards Asian Americans during the pandemic.\n\n“I’ve never felt this unsafe before,” Ng said. “Even after 9/11 I felt safe. But the feeling I have now, it’s different. I’m never on the subway or any public transportation anymore.”\n\nLeaving New York was never on the table before – but now, the thought lingers in the back of her mind.\n\nLaw enforcement officials lead subway shooting suspect Frank James away from a police station in New York on Wednesday, April 13.

Inside the dimly lit bar, the energy was still comforting – proof that despite the fears, heartache and confusion, this community is in it together.\n\nThat’s how 30-year resident Guillermo Tejeta described it, sitting at the bar with his newborn baby on his lap. Tejeta was driving home after dropping his son at day care when the commotion unfolded around him: Police officers flooded into the street, halting traffic and making space for first responders.\n\n“People were talking about shootings and explosions and I was like, ‘Yeah, whatever,’” Tejeta said. But when he got home, he went online and realized what was happening.\n\n“Only yesterday, my girlfriend’s mother called us, telling us, ‘You guys need to leave New York.’ And I was like, ‘Hell no, I’ve lived my whole life here, I’m not going anywhere.’ But this hit close to home.”\n\nTejeta is often at Minnie’s but especially felt the need to be there Tuesday to talk over what had happened with friends and family, he said.\n\n“This is our train stop. This is what we use to go into work, to go into the city, so it’s scary, really scary,” he added.\n\nHe paused to kiss his baby’s head. “We gotta make you New York strong, OK?”", "authors": ["Alaa Elassar Theresa Waldrop", "Alaa Elassar", "Theresa Waldrop"], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/politics/hillary-clinton-2024-presidential-election", "title": "The case against a Hillary Clinton 2024 election bid | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nHillary Clinton is perfectly positioned to step into the breach created by an unpopular Joe Biden and a shaky Kamala Harris in 2024, according to a new op-ed in the Wall Street Journal by pollster Doug Schoen and former New York City Council president Andrew Stein.\n\n“Several circumstances—President Biden’s low approval rating, doubts over his capacity to run for re-election at 82, Vice President Kamala Harris’s unpopularity, and the absence of another strong Democrat to lead the ticket in 2024—have created a leadership vacuum in the party, which Mrs. Clinton viably could fill,” the two write. “She is already in an advantageous position to become the 2024 Democratic nominee.”\n\nBefore we go any further, it’s worth noting that neither Schoen nor Stein have sterling credentials as Democrats. Schoen worked for former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg while Stein endorsed none other than Donald Trump in the 2016 election against, wait for it, Hillary Clinton.\n\nTheir backgrounds should give you pause about a) their intentions and b) their analysis of the state of the Democratic Party and the 2024 field.\n\nBut, let’s put that aside and, for the sake of argument consider their case on the merits. The core of their argument is that:\n\na) Clinton is an experienced hand in government and national politics.\n\nb) She could run as the change candidate.\n\nc) She is dropping hints that she wants to run again.\n\nLet’s break down – and debunk – these ideas one by one.\n\n1. Clinton has the right experience to be president. Yes, this is true! Clinton’s resume – Secretary of State, New York Senator, First Lady – is, without question, one of the most impressive of any politician in either party. Here’s the problem: That was true when she ran for president in 2016 and even in 2008 when she hadn’t been secretary of state yet! And, breaking news, she lost both of those campaigns. What’s changed between then and now? Schoen and Stein would argue that the moment – Covid-19 continuing to rage in the country, supply chain issues, the disastrous pullout of American troops from Afghanistan – all point to the need for a steady hand at the top. But, isn’t that what voters chose the current president for? Yes, yes it is. And while Clinton and Biden are not carbon copies of one another, their relevant experience is remarkably similar – long careers in the public policy space in Washington.\n\n2. Clinton is the change candidate. Here’s the Schoen/Stein argument; “If Democrats lose control of Congress in 2022, Mrs. Clinton can use the party’s loss as a basis to run for president again, enabling her to claim the title of ‘change candidate.’” Uh, what? Republicans winning the House (and maybe the Senate) will allow Clinton – who spent three-plus decades as a pillar of the Washington establishment – to position herself as the change candidate? How, exactly? There’s absolutely no scenario I can imagine in which Clinton would be able to be the change candidate. Her background is simply too Washington (and politics) heavy. Plus, Schoen and Stein just got done arguing that Clinton has the right experience for the job. So, how could she run as the experience candidate and the change agent? I simply do not think that Republicans winning control of Congress in 2022 suddenly transforms Clinton into a change candidate along the lines of Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. (Worth noting again: Clinton lost that primary to Obama.)\n\n3. Clinton is offering some signals that she wants to run. The evidence that Schoen and Stein cite for this claim is an interview Clinton gave NBC’s Willie Geist at the end of last year. Speaking about the state of the Democratic Party, she said this: “I think that it is a time for some careful thinking about what wins elections, and not just in deep-blue districts where a Democrat and a liberal Democrat, or so-called progressive Democrat, is going to win.” Which is interesting! But feels like pretty thin gruel to hang the idea that Clinton, as Schoen and Stein write, “would seize the opportunity to run for president again if an opening presents itself.” It’s also worth noting here that Clinton said in 2017 that her career as an “active politician” is now over.\n\nLook, the election of Trump in 2016 has taught me to never dismiss any idea – no matter how seemingly outlandish – as impossible. Which means that I am not willing to say that there is a 0.0% chance that Clinton thinks about running in 2024.\n\nWhat I can say is that this Schoen/Stein op-ed does little to convince me that:\n\na) She will run.\n\nb) Her running would be a good idea.\n\nc) She would be well positioned to win.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/tech/elon-musk-twitter", "title": "Elon Musk has taken control of Twitter and fired its top executives ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk has completed his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, a source familiar with the deal told CNN Thursday, putting the world’s richest man in charge of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nMusk fired CEO Parag Agrawal and two other executives, according to two people familiar with the decision. Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe deal’s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter’s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. After initially agreeing to buy the company in April, Musk spent months attempting to get out of the deal, first citing concerns about the number of bots on the platform and later allegations raised by a company whistleblower.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet Thursday night saying, “the bird is freed.”\n\nBy completing the deal, Musk and Twitter have avoided a trial that was originally set to take place earlier this month. But Musk’s takeover, and the immediate firings of some of its top executives, now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it.\n\nIn addition to Agrawal, Musk on Thursday fired CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to the two sources. Musk also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, according to a source.\n\nLeft to right, clockwise: Twitter former executives Vijaya Gadde, Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Sean Edgett. Andrew Harnik/AP/Kevin Dietsch/Patrick T. Fallon/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nIn taking those steps, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters to meet with employees. He also posted an open letter to Twitter advertisers, saying he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThe acquisition also promises to extend Musk’s influence. The billionaire already owns, oversees or has significant stakes in companies developing cars, rockets, robots and satellite internet, as well as more experimental ventures such as brain implants. Now he controls a social media platform that shapes how hundreds of millions of people communicate and get their news.\n\nA deal that went off the rails\n\nEven for Twitter, a company known for a certain amount of chaos over its history, the months-long deal process with Musk was turbulent.\n\nMusk, a prominent and controversial Twitter user, became involved with the company earlier this year when he built up a more than 9% stake in its shares. After announcing he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk accepted and then pulled out of an offer to sit on the company’s board.\n\nMusk then offered to buy Twitter outright at a significant premium, threatened a hostile takeover and signed a “seller-friendly” deal to buy the company that involved waiving due diligence.\n\n“This is not a way to make money,” Musk said in an on-stage interview shortly after making an offer to buy Twitter. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.”\n\nMusk also pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying,” referring to the fake and scam accounts that are often especially active in the replies to his tweets and those of others with large followings on the platform.\n\nWithin weeks of the acquisition agreement, however, Musk began raising concerns about the prevalence of those same fake and spam accounts on Twitter and ultimately attempted to terminate the deal.\n\nMusk visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters earlier this week before the acquisition closed to meet with employees. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTwitter sued him to follow through with the agreement, alleging that Musk was using the bot argument as a pretense to get out of a deal for which he had developed buyer’s remorse. In the weeks after the deal was announced, much of the stock market, including social media companies, declined amid concerns about rising inflation and a looming recession. The downturn also hit Tesla and, in turn, Musk’s personal net worth.\n\nLegal experts widely believed that Twitter was on strong footing to have the deal enforced in court. Two weeks before the contentious legal battle was set to go to trial, Musk said he would follow through with the deal on its original terms after all. As the parties negotiated, Musk’s attorneys asked a judge to stay the legal proceedings, prompting pushback from Twitter, which feared that Musk might not stay true to his promise to close the deal.\n\nIn a sharp response, Twitter’s lawyers wrote that Musk had been attempting to exit the deal and “now, on the eve of trial, Defendants declare they intend to close after all. ‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time.’”\n\nDelaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Judge McCormick gave the parties until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a rescheduled trial.\n\nWhat’s next for Twitter\n\nWith the deal drama out of the way, attention now turns to Musk’s plans for Twitter.\n\nBeyond the removal of Twitter’s CEO and other executives, Musk’s takeover could also usher in the return of some measure of influence over the company by founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November and left its board in May. While Dorsey has said he will not formally return to Twitter, he has privately discussed the takeover with Musk and offered advice.\n\nMusk has also reportedly told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff, in a move that could disrupt every aspect of how Twitter operates. He previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nAmong the changes Musk could make to Twitter is restoring the account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter may not have use for many of its existing staff. Musk has repeatedly made clear he would overhaul Twitter’s content moderation policies and bolster what he calls “free speech,” potentially undoing years of efforts from the company to address misinformation and harassment and to create “healthier” conversations on the platform.\n\nSuch a move could also have ripple effects across the social media landscape. Twitter, although smaller than many of its social media rivals, has sometimes acted as a model for how the industry handles problematic content, including when it was the first to ban then-President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAnd in recent years, several alternative social networks have launched largely targeting conservatives who claim more mainstream services unduly restrict their speech. These services include Trump’s Truth Social and Parler, which Kanye West recently said he would acquire. While it’s unclear how far Musk could go in fulfilling his free speech dreams, any loosening of existing content moderation policies could effectively make Twitter, which provides a much larger audience, a more enticing service for some of the users who have fled to those smaller, fringe services. (Musk, however, could run into regulatory issues, especially in Europe, depending on how far he takes his efforts to loosen content restrictions.)\n\nApart from content moderation, Musk has also tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting recently that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nDespite his months-long attempt to get out of buying the company and his own recent remarks that he is “obviously overpaying” for it, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on Tesla’s earnings conference call last week.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/politics/jan-6-committee-final-report", "title": "January 6 committee releases final report, says Trump should be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection recommends barring former President Donald Trump from holding office again.\n\nThe recommendation is among the conclusions of the panel’s final report, a comprehensive overview of the bipartisan panel’s findings on how Trump and his allies sought to overturn the 2020 presidential election, released late Thursday evening.\n\nThe 845-page report – based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation – includes allegations that Trump “oversaw” the legally dubious effort to put forward fake slates of electors in seven states he lost, arguing that the evidence shows he actively worked to “transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives” despite concerns among his lawyers that doing so could be unlawful.\n\nIn a symbolic move Monday, the committee in its last public meeting referred Trump to the Justice Department on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straight forward conclusion: the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, whom many others followed. None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him,” the report states.\n\nCommittee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said on Monday that he has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith is leading the Justice Department’s investigations related to Trump, including both his post-election actions and classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort earlier this year.\n\nTrump swiftly lashed out over the report on his Truth Social platform with false claims about the riot and the 2020 election. He did not address specific findings from what he called the “highly partisan” report but instead falsely blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the breakdown in security that day and resurfaced his unfounded claims of election fraud.\n\nHere’s what’s in the report:\n\nTrump and his inner circle engaged in ‘at least 200’ attempts to pressure state officials\n\nIn an effort to overturn election results in key states, Trump and his inner circle targeted election officials in “at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation,” between Election Day and the January 6 attack, according to the report.\n\nThere were 68 meetings, attempted or connected phone calls, or text messages, aimed at state or local officials, as well as 125 social media posts by Trump or senior aides targeting state officials.\n\nTrump “spearheaded outreach aimed at numerous officials in States he lost but that had GOP-led legislatures, including in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona,” the report says. (He lost all of those states.)\n\nFor example, during a January 2, 2021, call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the then-president went through a “litany of false election-fraud claims” and then asked Raffensperger to deliver him a second term by “finding” just enough votes to ensure victory, according to the report.\n\nTrump infamously said, “I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.”\n\nCommittee identifies pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro as architect of fake electors plot\n\nThe January 6 committee identifies a little known pro-Trump attorney as being the original architect of the legally dubious fake electors plan: Kenneth Chesebro.\n\nConservative attorney John Eastman authored a now-infamous memo detailing step-for-step how then-Vice President Mike Pence could theoretically overturn the 2020 election results. But the committee points to Chesebro, a known associate of Eastman, as being responsible for creating the fake electors plot.\n\n“The fake elector plan emerged from a series of legal memoranda written by an outside legal advisor to the Trump Campaign: Kenneth Chesebro,” the report says.\n\nIt was previously known that Chesebro was involved in the fake electors scheme, but the committee’s conclusion about his leadership role is new.\n\nThe effort to put forward fake slates of pro-Trump electors is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn Joe Biden’s election victory in 2020.\n\nThe committee wrote that Chesebro sent a memo to then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani after a request from Trump campaign official Boris Epshteyn about a “‘President of the Senate’ strategy,” which wrongly asserted that the vice president could pick which presidential electors to count during the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\n“President Trump in the days immediately before January 6th, Chesebro – an attorney based in Boston and New York recruited to assist the Trump Campaign as a volunteer legal advisor – was central to the creation of the plan,” the report says. “Memos by Chesebro on November 18th, December 9th, and December 13th, as discussed below, laid the plan’s foundation.”\n\nCNN has previously asked Chesebro to comment about these topics and he has not responded.\n\nTrump WH called Eastman on the day he wrote his memo\n\nEastman reached out to speak to Trump on December 23, 2020, the same day that he drafted his initial memo on the Pence theory.\n\nEastman emailed Trump’s assistant, Molly Michael, at 1:32 p.m., according to the committee. “Is the President available for a very quick call today at some point? Just want to update him on our overall strategic thinking.”\n\nThe committee wrote that Eastman received a call from the White House switchboard, and the call lasted 23 minutes, according to Eastman’s phone records. Eastman’s two-page memo discussed various ways to ensure “President Trump is re-elected,” even though by then, he had been projected to lose the election, according to the committee.\n\nThese new details show how the committee used emails and phone records it obtained after it successfully fought in court to obtain the documents.\n\nThe committee obtained Eastman’s emails after a judge sided with the House in a lawsuit where the committee accused both Eastman and Trump of a criminal conspiracy to obstruct Congress and to defraud the government.\n\nTrump latched onto Eastman’s theories that incorrectly claimed Pence could overturn the election, and launched a pressure campaign against Pence in the days leading up to January 6. Eastman was present at a January 4, 2021, meeting between Trump and Pence in the Oval Office where Trump tried to convince Pence he could intervene when Congress certified the Electoral College vote on January 6.\n\nJanuary 6 committee recommends barring Trump from holding office again\n\nBarring Trump from further public office is one of 11 recommendations the committee is making as a result of its investigation.\n\nThe panel zeroes in on the section of the Constitution that states an individual who has taken an oath to support the US Constitution but has “engaged in an insurrection” or given “aid or comfort to the enemies of the Constitution” can be disqualified from office. The former president and others have been referred by the committee to the Department of Justice for assisting or aiding an insurrection.\n\nIt calls on congressional committees of jurisdiction to create a “formal mechanism” for evaluating whether those individuals violate that section of the 14th Amendment should be barred from future federal or state office.\n\nSays lawyers should be held responsible\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals, the select committee is calling for lawyers involved in the efforts to overturn the election to be held accountable.\n\n“Those courts and bar disciplinary bodies responsible for overseeing the legal profession in the states and the District of Columbia should continue to evaluate the conduct of attorneys described in this Report” the panel writes, adding that there are specific attorneys the report identifies as having “conflicts of interests” for the Department of Justice to evaluate.\n\nThe report even calls on Congress to amend statutes and consider the severity of penalties that deter individuals from efforts to obstruct, influence or impede the Joint Session of Congress that certifies election results. It calls for statutes of federal penalties for certain types of threats against election workers to be strengthened.\n\nAlthough the panel was successful in getting more than 1,000 witnesses to testify as part of its investigation, it still had difficulty gaining cooperation from everyone it wanted to speak to. Its report recommends congressional committees of jurisdiction “develop legislation” to create “a cause of action” for the House to enforce its subpoenas in federal court.\n\nElectoral Count Act reform\n\nOne recommendation may soon become reality.\n\nThe panel calls on Congress to pass an overhaul of the 1887 Electoral Count Act aimed at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election – the first legislative response to the insurrection and Trump’s relentless pressure campaign to stay in power.\n\nThe House and Senate have each passed their own version of the legislation.\n\nCommittee refers Trump to Justice Department\n\nA video of former President Donald Trump is shown on a screen on Capitol Hill on December 19, 2022. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump’s defeat and says there’s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Eastman and “others.”\n\nThe report summary first released Monday says there’s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nThe panel says it also has the evidence to refer Eastman on the obstruction charge, and it names him as a co-conspirator in other alleged criminal activity lawmakers have gathered evidence on.\n\nThe committee alluded to evidence of criminal obstruction of the House investigation but the summary does not go into detail about that evidence.\n\nTrump’s false victory declaration was ‘premeditated’\n\nThe committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.\n\n“President Trump’s decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated,” the report states.\n\nThe committee also revealed emails from Tom Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, from before the 2020 presidential election that say Trump should declare victory regardless of the outcome.\n\nIt notes that Trump’s top allies, including those who testified before the committee, acknowledged they found no proof to back up the former president’s claims.\n\n“Ultimately, even Rudolph Giuliani and his legal team acknowledged that they had no definitive evidence of election fraud sufficient to change the election outcome,” it adds, referring to Trump’s then-personal attorney.\n\n“For example, although Giuliani repeatedly had claimed in public that Dominion voting machines stole the election, he admitted during his Select Committee deposition that ‘I do not think the machines stole the election,’” it states.\n\nMillions of dollars were raised on false claims, but RNC showed caution to not go too far\n\nThe committee investigators describe how Trump campaign and Republican National Committee fundraising pitches containing false claims of a stolen election ultimately raised more than $250 million – but were met internally with some resistance.\n\nInvestigators describe three options that were considered for a post-election fundraising appeal by the campaign. One option, that the campaign opted against using because they knew it was false, said that Trump had won. A second unused option said the campaign was waiting on results. Ultimately, according to the committee, the Trump campaign approved a message that Democrats are going to “try to steal the election” that was written before election night.\n\nThe committee describes, based on interview with Trump campaign officials, that much of the material in the fundraising emails was based on messages said by Trump – but were not checked for accuracy before being used to ask for donations.\n\n“President Trump’s claims were treated as true and blasted to millions of people with little to no scrutiny by those tasked with ensuring accuracy,” the committee wrote.\n\nTrump campaign’s deputy director of communications and research Zach Parkinson told investigators that reviews for accuracy were limited to “questions concerning items such as time and location.”\n\nThe RNC did eventually tone down some messages, which the committee suggests shows “the RNC knew that President’s Trump’s claims about winning the election were baseless” and made “changes to fundraising copy that seemingly protected the RNC from legal exposure,” according to investigators.\n\nHouse investigators said that RNC lawyers directed copywriters not to use the term “rigged,” according to interviews conducted by the committee. The panel obtained several examples of fundraising appeals that were toned down to be accurate and less inflammatory.\n\nTrump privately called some of Sidney Powell’s election claims ‘crazy’\n\nWhite House communications director Hope Hicks told the January 6 committee that Donald Trump had laughed at one of his election lawyer’s claims about foreign powers interfering in the election, calling them “crazy,” according to the committee’s final report.\n\n“The day after the press conference, President Trump spoke by phone with Sidney Powell from the Oval Office. During the call, Powell repeated the same claims of foreign interference in the election she had made at the press conference,” the report said, referring to conspiratorial claims made by Powell, Trump’s onetime attorney, at an outlandish press conference after the 2020 election.\n\n“While she was speaking, the President muted his speakerphone and laughed at Powell, telling the others in the room, ‘This does sound crazy, doesn’t it?’” the report says.\n\nDuring the press conference, Powell falsely claimed, among other things, that widely used voting machines from the election technology company Dominion Voting Systems featured software created “at the direction” of deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to swing his own election results, and that the company has ties to the Clinton Foundation and George Soros.\n\n“A few days later, the Trump campaign issued a statement claiming Powell was not part of the Trump campaign’s legal team. But Powell’s outlandish claims were no different from those President Trump was making himself,” the committee writes.\n\nTrump refused to act as riot unfolded\n\nPro-Trump supporters storm the US Capitol following a rally with President Donald Trump on January 6, 2021 in Washington. Samuel Corum/Getty Images/FILE\n\nThe committee lays out Trump’s failure to act as the riot unfolded, noting that as he watched the riot on television, he made no calls for security assistance and resisted efforts from staffers asking him to call off his supporters.\n\n“President Trump did not contact a single top national security official during the day. Not at the Pentagon, nor at the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., the Capitol Police Department, or the D.C. Mayor’s office,” the committee writes. “As Vice President Pence has confirmed, President Trump didn’t even try to reach his own Vice President to make sure that Pence was safe.”\n\nMilley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the committee he had this reaction to Trump, “You know, you’re the Commander in Chief. You’ve got an assault going on on the Capitol of the United States of America. And there’s nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?”\n\nWhite House staffers, meantime, described being appalled that as the Capitol was under attack, Trump fired off a tweet criticizing Pence.\n\nHicks texted a colleague that night to say, “Attacking the VP? Wtf is wrong with him,” according to the committee’s summary report.\n\n“No photographs exist of the President for the remainder of the afternoon until after 4 p.m. President Trump appears to have instructed that the White House photographer was not to take any photographs,” the committee writes, citing testimony from former White House photographer Shealah Craighead.\n\nIn the aftermath, on the evening of January 6, Trump’s former campaign manager Brad Parscale told Katrina Pierson, one of the rally organizers, that he felt guilty helping Trump win, the report states.\n\nThe events of the day, Parscale said, resulted from “a sitting president asking for civil war.”\n\nAide characterized Trump’s tone on January 6 as, ‘can you believe this sh*t?’\n\nTrump’s tone during his last known phone call on January 6 was like, “wow, can you believe this sh*t?” according to the White House aide who spoke with him that night.\n\nIn newly revealed testimony included in the January 6 committee’s final report, the aide, John McEntee, said Trump told him “[t]his is a crazy day.” The report added, “McEntee said his tone was one of “like, wow, can you believe this sh*t?”\n\nTrump did not express any sadness over the violence that had unfolded at the Capitol that day, McEntee told the panel.\n\n“I think he was shocked by, you know, it getting a little out of control, but I don’t remember sadness, specifically” McEntee said.\n\nHe wasn’t the only person with that impression about Trump’s mood.\n\nIvanka Trump, a senior White House adviser at the time, told the select committee her father was “disappointed and surprised” by the attack on the Capitol.\n\nBut when pressed by committee investigators, she could not provide any instances of the president discussing whether or not he did the right thing on January 6 or speaking about those who were injured or died that day.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Annie Grayer Jeremy Herb Tierney Sneed Devan Cole Geneva Sands Katelyn Polantz Hannah Rabinowitz", "Zachary Cohen", "Annie Grayer", "Jeremy Herb", "Tierney Sneed", "Devan Cole", "Geneva Sands", "Katelyn Polantz", "Hannah Rabinowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/politics/beto-orourke-uvalde-greg-abbott", "title": "Beto O'Rourke interrupts Texas governor during update on Uvalde ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTexas Democratic gubernatorial nominee Beto O’Rourke confronted Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and other officials on Wednesday during a press conference about Tuesday’s deadly shooting at an elementary school in the state.\n\n“Gov. Abbott, I have to say something,” O’Rourke – a former congressman who represented El Paso, Texas, and is a former Senate and presidential candidate – said as he approached the stage in Uvalde, Texas.\n\n“The time to stop the next shooting is right now and you are doing nothing,” O’Rourke told Abbott. The two will face off in Texas’ gubernatorial race in November.\n\n“You said this is not predictable. This is totally predictable,” he said of Tuesday’s shooting at a local elementary school where 21 people – including 19 children – died and 17 were injured.\n\nThis is far from the first time O’Rourke has spoken out on gun violence. The former congressman used his platform during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary to advocate for stricter gun control measures, including a mandatory assault weapon buyback program. His focus on the issue was sharpened by an August 2019 racist massacre at a Walmart store in El Paso.\n\nAt a Democratic debate the following month, he was unapologetic about the stance, which drew swift backlash from Republicans and would have gone further than most of the proposals being discussed by his rival primary candidates.\n\n“Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” O’Rourke said to applause in the debate hall. “We’re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.”\n\nHis declaration then, well before he decided on a gubernatorial run this year, set up a stark contrast with Abbott, who has frequently touted any move to loosen restrictions on access to and possession of guns. Abbott is scheduled to speak at the National Rifle Association’s annual meeting in Houston this week.\n\nO’Rourke addressed Abbott directly as he left the room on Wednesday: “This is on you, until you choose to do something different.”\n\n“This will continue to happen. Somebody needs to stand up for the children of this state or they will continue to be killed, just like they were killed in Uvalde yesterday,” he added.\n\nAt Wednesday’s press conference, Abbott argued that tougher gun laws aren’t a “real solution.”\n\n“People who think maybe we can implement tough gun laws and we can solve it – Chicago, New York and LA disprove that thesis. Chicago teaches you that what you are talking about isn’t a real solution,” Abbott said.\n\nAbbott also said there are continuing discussions about how to address people with mental health challenges in the state, as well as ways to keep schools safe.\n\nConfrontation with officials\n\nPrior to O’Rourke’s exit, Texas Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told the former congressman, “You’re out of line and an embarrassment.”\n\n“Sit down,” Sen. Ted Cruz, O’Rourke’s opponent in the 2018 Senate race, said, shaking his head.\n\nAnother official onstage, Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin, shouted profanities at O’Rourke and appeared to direct authorities in the room to remove the former congressman from the auditorium.\n\nO’Rourke was then led away by officers.\n\n“(Abbott) said he was going to do something. He did nothing. In fact, the only thing he did was make it easier to carry a gun in public,” O’Rourke told reporters after he exited the press conference.\n\nThe former congressman said the Texas governor’s “only interest is the gun lobby.”\n\nHe pointed out to reporters that Abbott is currently scheduled to speak at the National Rifle Association convention this Friday in Houston, “just days after these kids were slaughtered right here in Uvalde, after they were slaughtered at Santa Fe High School, at Sutherland Springs, In Midland-Odessa, in El Paso, Texas.”\n\n“Five of the worst mass hosting in US history, right here in this state in the last five years. He was governor for every single one of them,” O’Rourke continued.\n\nLess than an hour before O’Rourke interrupted the press conference, he sent an email to his supporters where he said the Uvalde shooting is a “direct consequence” of “choices made by Greg Abbott.”\n\n“These massacres are not natural disasters, acts of God, or random. They are totally predictable, direct consequences of the choices made by Greg Abbott and the majority of those in the Texas legislature,” he wrote.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details from the event.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Gregory Krieg", "Maegan Vazquez", "Gregory Krieg"], "publish_date": "2022/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/us/robert-e-crimo-highland-park-suspect", "title": "Robert E. Crimo III: What we know about Highland Park shooting ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHours after gunfire interrupted the Highland Park, Illinois, July Fourth parade, killing seven people and wounding dozens more, police apprehended the man they believe was responsible.\n\nRobert “Bobby” E. Crimo III, 21, faces seven charges of first-degree murder in connection with the shooting, which authorities said he allegedly carried out by climbing onto the rooftop of a nearby business and opening fire minutes after the parade started, sending paradegoers and participants running for safety.\n\nA judge on Wednesday ordered him held without bond in a virtual hearing where a Lake County assistant state’s attorney alleged Crimo confessed to firing on the crowd in a voluntary statement to law enforcement. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for July 28.\n\nInvestigators believe the suspect planned the attack for weeks, Chris Covelli, spokesperson for the Lake County Major Crimes Task Force, said at one of several news conferences Tuesday. The suspect dressed in women’s clothing to help conceal his identity, Covelli said, blended in with the crowds as they fled the area, and went to his mother’s house.\n\nLaw enforcement has yet to establish a motive, and Covelli declined to address a potential motive again Wednesday, saying only that Crimo “had some type of affinity towards the number four and seven and inverse was 7/4,” the date of July Fourth.\n\nCovelli previously said there has been no information to suggest the attack was “racially motivated, motivated by religion or any other protected status.” There is no indication anyone else was involved, Covelli said.\n\nThe suspect was taken into custody soon after police publicly identified him Monday as a “person of interest,” whom the FBI said was “being sought for his alleged involvement in the shooting of multiple individuals” at Highland Park’s Independence Day parade.\n\nThe suspect took his mother’s vehicle, and a member of the community saw him, Covelli said. That individual called 911, and then North Chicago police conducted a traffic stop and took him into custody.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\n\nCrimo faces a sentence of life in prison without parole if convicted, Assistant State’s Attorney Ben Dillon said in Wednesday’s hearing. But the suspect faces “many more charges” in addition to the seven first-degree murder charges, Eric Rinehart, state’s attorney for Lake County, said in a news conference, suggesting other potential charges include attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm.\n\nFederal charges are also a possibility, FBI Director Christopher Wray said.\n\n“If the facts gathered end up supporting a federal prosecution, then we will work with the US Attorney’s office to pursue prosecution on the federal side as well,” Wray said at an event in London. The director also noted the bureau is helping local and state authorities with the crime scene and evidence collection.\n\nAttorney Thomas Durkin previously confirmed to CNN he was representing Crimo, but he said in court Wednesday he would not, citing a potential conflict of interest.\n\nAttorney Steve Greenberg is representing Crimo’s parents, he said Tuesday, and released a statement attributed to them.\n\n“We are all mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, and this is a terrible tragedy for many families, the victims, the paradegoers, the community, and our own,” the statement says. “Our hearts, thoughts, and prayers go out to everybody.”\n\nHere’s what we know about the suspect:\n\nHe legally obtained the weapon used, officials say\n\nThe suspect used a Smith & Wesson M&P15 semi-automatic rifle to carry out the shooting, Dillon, the assistant state’s attorney, said at Wednesday’s bond hearing.\n\nAccording to Dillon, Crimo told investigators that when he climbed on top of the roof, he looked through the weapon’s sights and opened fire at people across the street, emptying two 30-round magazines before loading the weapon with a third and continuing to fire.\n\nSurveillance video from the scene showed a person running west with a black bag over the shoulder immediately after the shooting, Dillon said Wednesday. While the individual was running, an object wrapped in cloth fell onto the pavement. The subject left the object and continued running.\n\nIt turned out to be the Smith & Wesson, per Dillon. And on the rooftop, investigators found the three magazines and 83 spent shell casings.\n\nRobert E. Crimo III is seen in this handout provided by law enforcement. Highland Park Police Department\n\nThe suspect legally purchased the weapon he used in Monday’s shooting, Covelli said Tuesday, describing it as a “high-powered rifle” that shot high-velocity rounds. The weapon, which he described as “similar to an AR-15,” was purchased locally, Covelli said, within the Chicagoland area. There is no indication the weapon was modified, he said.\n\nCrimo also legally purchased a second rifle found in his vehicle at the time he was apprehended, as well as other guns recovered from his home, which Covelli described as pistols.\n\nBetween June 2020 and September 2021, Crimo passed four background checks while purchasing firearms. Those background checks went through the Firearms Transaction Inquiry Program (FTIP), which includes the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, state police said in their statement.\n\nAt the time, the only criminal offense included in Crimo’s history was a January 2016 ordinance violation for possession of tobacco, and no mental health prohibiter reports were submitted to state police by health care facilities or personnel, police said.\n\nPolice in Highwood – the suspect’s hometown, just outside Highland Park – had no prior crime-related interactions with Crimo, according to Chief Dave Wentz.\n\nThe only contact the department had with Crimo involved a noncriminal incident where Crimo was present when he was a juvenile, Wentz said.\n\n“We literally have nothing on him,” Wentz said. “He was not potentially involved in anything.”\n\nPolice took knives from home after Crimo said he would kill people\n\nBut Crimo did have past interactions with Highland Park Police.\n\nIn April 2019, local police had gone to the family home after receiving a report Crimo had tried to take his own life using a machete a week prior, according to a police report of the well-being check visit.\n\nOfficers spoke with him, and his parents and were told mental health professionals were handling the matter, the report shows.\n\nThen, in September 2019, Highland Park Police went to Crimo’s home after a family member reported that he had said he was going to kill everyone, according to another police report.\n\n“The threat was directed at family inside of the home,” Covelli noted.\n\nPolice confiscated a collection of bladed items – 16 knives, a dagger and a “Samurai type blade” that were in Crimo’s closet. Later that afternoon, the father went to the police station and picked up the collection and told authorities it belonged to him, according to the police report.\n\nNo arrests were made during that incident because there were no signed complaints against Crimo. At the time, involuntary commitment wasn’t an option, Covelli said.\n\nLocal police submitted a “Clear and Present Danger” report about the visit to the Illinois State Police, the police report shows. State police said in that report Crimo had said he didn’t intend on harming himself or others when police questioned him at the time.\n\nRobert E. Crimo III is seen being arrested in this photo obtained by CNN. obtained by CNN\n\nState Police Master Sgt. Delilah Garcia said they looked at whether Crimo had a firearm owner’s identification (FOID) card that should have been revoked, but he had no card.\n\nComplete coverage of the Highland Park shooting\n\nIn a news release, Illinois State Police officials said Crimo in December 2019 applied for a FOID card that was sponsored by his father.\n\n“The subject was under 21 (he was 19) and the application was sponsored by the subject’s father. Therefore, at the time of FOID application review in January of 2020, there was insufficient basis to establish a clear and present danger and deny the FOID application,” state police said.\n\nCovelli said later that the suspect bought five guns, including two rifles, after the September visit from police.\n\nHe ‘contemplated’ a second attack\n\nAfter fleeing the scene of the parade shooting, Crimo drove to Madison, Wisconsin, where he “seriously contemplated” carrying out another attack with the firearm he had in his car at the time, a Kel-Tec SUB200, Covelli said Wednesday.\n\nThe shooter had approximately 60 rounds of ammunition in his car, Covelli said.\n\n“Investigators did develop some information that it appears when he drove to Madison, he was driving around, however, he did see a celebration that was occurring in Madison, and he seriously contemplated using the firearm he had in his vehicle to commit another shooting in Madison,” he said.\n\n“We don’t have information to suggest he planned to drive to Madison initially to commit another attack, Covelli added. “We do believe he was driving around following the first attack and saw the celebration.”\n\nBut the suspect did not carry out the attack, Covelli added, saying, “Indications are that he hadn’t put enough thought or research into it.”\n\nHe posted violent imagery online\n\nThe suspected shooter posted music on several major streaming platforms under the pseudonym Awake the Rapper, and he apparently made and posted music videos online featuring ominous lyrics and animated scenes of gun violence.\n\nIn one video entitled “Are you Awake,” a cartoon animation of a stick-figure shooter resembling the suspect’s appearance is seen wearing tactical gear and carrying out an attack with a rifle. Crimo, seen with multicolored hair and face tattoos, narrates, “I need to just do it.

He was later pardoned by Trump.\n\nPresidential pardons do not apply to state investigations, however.\n\nHandcuffed and flanked by officers as they walked past reporters into court, Bannon said, “This is what happens in the last days of a dying regime. They will never shut me up, they’ll have to kill me first. I have not yet begun to fight.”\n\nAccording to the indictment, one of Bannon’s associates who isn’t named created an online fundraising platform to raise money to build a wall on the border. In order to receive the money from donors, the organizer promised that “100% of the funds” would go towards building a border wall, and he would not be taking a salary from the project, prosecutors say.\n\nBannon’s associates discussed telling the public that no one involved in the “We Build The Wall” project would take a salary, according to the indictment. In a text message, one of the associates told Bannon that the claim “removes all self interest taint on this” and it “gives [the CEO] saint hood,” the indictment says.\n\nBannon publicly claimed he was acting “kind of as a volunteer” for We Build The Wall, prosecutors said in the indictment. Behind the scenes, Bannon allegedly helped to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars to himself and his associates.\n\n“Today is an important day for justice,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said when announcing the charges alongside Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nJames said everyday Americans play by the rules, but powerful, politically connected people think they’re above the law.\n\n“Steve Bannon stands out as a perfect example of this blatant inequality,” James said.\n\nBannon appeared to blame his situation on political motivations.\n\n“This an irony, on the very day the mayor of this city has a delegation down on the border, they are persecuting people here, that try to stop them at the border” he told reporters outside the DA’s office Thursday.\n\n“This is all about 60 days from the day,” he said later, referencing the November election.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney’s office launched a criminal investigation into Bannon’s “We Build the Wall” crowd-fundraising activities early last year after then-President Trump pardoned Bannon on federal fraud charges relating to the same alleged scheme.\n\nBannon had been federally charged with diverting more than $1 million to pay an alleged co-conspirator and cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal expenses. Prosecutors alleged that the donors, including some in New York, were falsely told that all the money contributed would go toward the construction effort.\n\nIn recent months, several people close to Bannon were brought before the state grand jury.\n\nManhattan prosecutors subpoenaed bank records and quietly worked on the investigation over the past year as they investigated Trump and his real estate business, sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN. But the district attorney’s office deferred a charging decision on Bannon until federal prosecutors concluded their case against his three co-defendants, who were not pardoned.\n\nBannon issued a statement late Tuesday, in part calling the indictment “phony charges” and “nothing more than a partisan political weaponization of the criminal justice system.”\n\n“I am proud to be a leading voice on protecting our borders and building a wall to keep our country safe from drugs and violent criminals,” he said in the statement, adding: “They are coming after all of us, not only President Trump and myself. I am never going to stop fighting. In fact, I have not yet begun to fight. They will have to kill me first.”\n\nA federal jury in July found Bannon guilty of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. He is scheduled to be sentenced in October and faces a minimum sentence of 30 days in jail, according to federal law.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Hannah Rabinowitz Shawna Mizelle", "Kara Scannell", "Hannah Rabinowitz", "Shawna Mizelle"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}]}

The directive creates a new employment classification for tens of thousands of nonpartisan career civil servants, effectively stripping them of job protections by reclassifying them as at-will positions, meaning they can be dismissed for nearly any reason.\n\nA separate executive order froze hiring of federal civilian employees in the executive branch. It stated that any federal civilian position vacant when Trump took office may not be filled, and no new position may be created - with rare exceptions.\n\nJan. 28: Buyout offer made to federal employees\n\nTrump's administration offered buyouts to nearly all 2.3 million federal employees. The offer came in a surprise email that hit inboxes at 6:04 p.m. on Jan. 28 with the subject line: \"The Fork in the Road.\"\n\nIn the email, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management offered all federal employees eight months of pay and benefits through September if they resigned by Feb. 6. Unions warned workers considering Trump’s offer that there is no guarantee the president can or will stick to it because Congress hasn’t approved funding for federal agencies beyond March 14.\n\nJan. 29: Union sues over reclassifying federal employees\n\nUnions representing federal employees sued the Trump administration to block the schedule F executive order, alleging that it aimed to politicize the federal government by stripping federal workers of job protections.\n\nFeb. 4: USAID employees placed on administrative leave\n\nAbout 10,000 employees of the United States Agency for International Development ‒ two-thirds of whom work overseas across 60 countries ‒ were notified that they will be placed on administrative leave at the end of the week as part of Trump's move to dismantle the foreign aid agency.\n\nFeb. 5: Government warns of furloughs\n\nThe Trump administration warned federal employees that they could be furloughed if they did not accept the buyout offer, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThe email warned employees that many will be stripped of civil-service protections and suggested there may be loyalty tests for those who remain.\n\nFeb. 6: Boston judge temporarily halts deadline to accept buyout offer\n\nU.S. District Judge George O’Toole issued a temporary restraining order pausing the Trump administration’s deadline to accept the buyout in order to allow time for labor unions to challenge the plan's legality. The American Federation of Government Employees and two other unions filed the lawsuit arguing that the administration lacks any statutory basis for the \"unprecedented offer.\"\n\nThe Trump administration’s lawyers had argued that extending the deadline on the very last day would “markedly disrupt the expectations of the federal workforce, inject tremendous uncertainty into a program that scores of federal employees have already availed themselves of, and hinder the administration’s efforts to reform the federal workforce.”\n\nAlso on Feb. 6, the administration ordered all federal department and agency heads to produce lists of their lowest-performing employees.\n\nThe order from OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell also asked departments and agencies to identify potential barriers to ensuring \"the ability to swiftly terminate poor performing employees who cannot or will not improve.\"\n\nFeb. 7: Trump fires head of the Office of Special Counsel\n\nAn aide to Trump fired Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of the Special Counsel, on the night of Feb. 7 in a one-sentence email. Dellinger sued, arguing that 1978 federal law creating his position states he can only be removed from his job because of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.\n\nProbationary employees largely rely on the special counsel to back them when challenging a dismissal through the proper government channels, rather than suing.\n\nFeb. 10: Trump fires leaders of Merit Systems Protection Board\n\nWithin a matter of minutes, Trump fired the leaders of two other boards that federal workers can turn to as an avenue to contest their firing. Union challenges to the firings have been rejected because they have not first gone through these boards.\n\nTrump fired Merit Systems Protection Board chair Cathy Harris, just before 11 p.m., leaving the board with two members – Raymond Limon, a Democrat whose term expired on March 1, and Henry Kerner, a Republican. A court temporarily reinstated Harris, whose term doesn't expire until 2028, after she sued. The Merit Systems Protection Board is tasked with protecting federal workers against partisan politics and illegal employment practices. It cannot operate without a quorum.\n\nTrump also fired the Federal Labor Relations Authority board chair, Susan Grundmann, three and a half minutes before he fired Cathy Harris. The authority handles certain complaints with federal workers’ labor unions.\n\nGrundmann sued to be reinstated, but for the time being, Trump named Colleen Kiko, a Republican member, as chair, presiding over only one other member, Democrat Anne Wagner.\n\nAlso on Feb. 10, a court temporarily reinstated Dellinger, who promptly asked the Merit Systems Protection Board to pause the terminations of six probationary employees at six agencies, and reinstate them while he investigated their cases.\n\nFeb. 11: Trump signs new EO to make major cuts to federal work force\n\nTrump signed an executive order Feb. 11 that seeks to significantly reduce the size of the government by instructing heads of federal departments and agencies to undertake plans for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"\n\nA White House summary of the order said agency heads were ordered to \"coordinate and consult with DOGE to shrink the size of the federal workforce and limit hiring to essential positions.\"\n\nUnder the order, federal agencies aren't allowed to hire more than one employee for every four employees who depart. It also instructed the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to create new rules to ensure future federal hires are subject to additional conduct standards, such as U.S. citizenship and filing federal tax returns on time.\n\nFeb. 12: Judge allows buyouts to move forward\n\nO'Toole, the Boston-based federal judge, restored Trump's buyout project, deciding federal employees unions that sued to stop the program lacked standing to bring their challenge and that his court does not have jurisdiction to hear their complaint.\n\nIn total, about 75,000 federal employees accepted President Donald Trump's buyout offer. That equaled about 3.3% of the federal government's 2.3 million workers, coming in below the White House's projections that 5% to 10% of the workforce would accept. Congress has not yet approved spending for the next year or said spending for buyouts would be included.\n\nFeb. 13: Thousands of probationary employees are fired\n\nThousands of recently-hired federal workers received notice that they had been fired.\n\nProbationary workers are easier to fire because they lack the bargaining rights that career employees have to appeal their terminations. Firings were government-wide: from the Department of Education and Small Business Administration to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Forest Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the agency that oversees the nation's fleet of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe firings have continued in the weeks since, including more than 880 probationary employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – which forecasts the nation’s weather and protects ocean species - on Thursday.\n\nFeb. 20: Unions sue over firing probationary employees\n\nA coalition of federal employee unions sued the administration, alleging that officials misused the probationary period to eliminate staff and that the Office of Personnel Management directed federal agencies to use a standardized termination notice falsely claiming performance issues in firing tens of thousands of employees.\n\n\"OPM, the federal agency charged with implementing this nation’s employment laws, in one fell swoop has perpetrated one of the most massive employment frauds in the history of this country, telling tens of thousands of workers that they are being fired for performance reasons, when they most certainly were not,” the unions argued in court documents.\n\nFeb. 22: Five things or resign\n\nMusk took to his social media site, X, to instruct federal workers to report their work accomplishments via email or resign.\n\n\"Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump’s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,\" said the post. \"Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\"\n\nThe email that employees received did not mention termination or disciplinary action for employees failing to respond promptly, but sent shockwaves as employees got conflicting instructions from agencies about whether or not to respond.\n\n\"What did you do last week?\" the emails read. \"Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\"\n\nFeb. 24: Office of Special Counsel says firing of probationary employees was illegal\n\nDellinger, who leads the Office of the Special Counsel, said firing probationary employees was illegal because it used boilerplate language blaming their performance rather than specific concerns and asked the Merit Systems Protection Board to decide whether to reinstate six employees while he investigates further.\n\nFederal law generally requires 60 days' notice for a reduction in force (what the federal government calls layoffs) and prohibits probationary employees from being fired for reasons unrelated to performance or conduct.\n\nFeb. 25: Merit Systems Protection Board reinstates some probationary employees\n\nThe Merit Systems Protection Board ordered six fired federal employees to be rehired at least through April 10, while Dellinger's office investigates.\n\n\"I find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that each of the six agencies engaged in a prohibited personnel practice,\" stated the order. The Office of Special Counsel has said it is considering ways to seek relief for a broader group of federal employees similarly fired in recent weeks.\n\nFeb. 26: New orders for mass layoffs targeting civil service employees\n\nThe Trump administration ordered heads of federal departments and agencies to prepare plans to initiate \"large-scale reductions in force\" by March 13.\n\nA memo sent by the offices of Personnel Management and Management and Budget also instructed federal departments to eliminate and consolidate duplicative positions, reduce their property footprints and produce reorganization plans for their agencies.\n\nFederal employees with full civil service protections are expected to be targeted. U.S. Postal Service workers, positions deemed necessary for law enforcement, national security and border and immigration obligations, as well as military personnel in the armed forces are exempted.\n\nThe memo also instructs federal departments to submit new organizational charts by April 14 as well as any proposed relocations of agency offices or headquarters from Washington to \"less-costly parts of the country.\"\n\nFeb. 27: California judge blocks firing of probationary employees\n\nJudge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern California District temporarily blocked the Trump administration from its mass firing of probationary federal employees.\n\nAlsup said the mass firings were likely unlawful and ordered the Office of Personnel Management to halt the action, saying the agency acted out of bounds by telling other agencies – including the Education Department, the Small Business Administration and the Energy Department – to fire employees.\n\n“OPM does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire or fire any employees, but its own,\" Alsup said. The judge did not order the rehiring of anyone who had been terminated.\n\nFeb. 28: A second five things email\n\nThe administration sent a second round of emails to federal workers instructing them to list what they've accomplished that week. The new directive came from agency leaders instead of DOGE.\n\nMarch 5: Firings are up to agencies\n\nIn response to Alsup's ruling, the Trump administration informed federal departments that any firings of their probationary workers are up to the agencies themselves.\n\nThe revised guidance from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management states that \"OPM is not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees,\" adding that \"agencies have ultimate decision making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\"\n\nThat same day, the Merit Systems Protection Board ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to reinstate a fired worker, as well as \"numerous\" other probationary employees who were fired Feb. 13 and later.\n\nThe ruling at the request of the Office of Special Counsel who argued the firings violated federal laws related to probationary employees and reductions in force because they used a form letter that the Department of Agriculture also sent to nearly 6,000 other probationary employees.\n\nMarch 6: Trump allowed to fire special counsel\n\nA federal appeals court ruled that Trump did have authority to fire Dellinger, the Office of the Special Counsel leader who said firing probationary employees was illegal because agencies used boilerplate language. Dellinger said he would not appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it will replace Dellinger with Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins. His agency is laying off workers whose main avenue to contest their firing is to turn to the Office of the Special Counsel for help.\n\nMarch 12: Member back on the Federal Labor Relations Authority\n\nU.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan reversed Trump's Feb. 10 removal of Grundmann, a Democratic member from the Federal Labor Relations Authority, by issuing a permanent injunction requiring the rest of the board to treat Grundmann as if she had not been removed.\n\nThe authority hears disputes between federal agencies and their employees' union and could play a significant role in expected legal fights over the mass layoffs.\n\nWhat is ahead?\n\nHeads of federal departments and agencies have until Thursday to prepare and present plans to initiate \"large-scale reductions in force\" as Trump shifts to a more aggressive phase of cutting the federal workforce beyond recently hired or promoted employees.\n\nAmong the planned reductions, reported by USA TODAY, are terminations of 76,000 workers from the Department of Veterans Affairs, 1,300 workers from the Department of Education, and more than 1,000 workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Trump has also openly discussed cuts of 65% to the Environmental Protection Agency’s workforce.\n\nLayoffs are not immediate. Agencies must give employees 30 or 60 days notice.\n\nUSA TODAY reporters Joey Garrison, Bart Jansen, Maureen Groppe, Kayla Jimenez, Erin Mansfield and Tom Vanden Brook contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/15/federal-layoffs-firings-2025/78761259007/", "title": "Federal layoffs 2025: See impacted agencies, including NPS, NIH, IRS", "text": "In a flurry of activity at the end of the week, the Trump administration fired more than 10,000 federal workers across multiple agencies as part of its \"large-scale reductions\" in the government workforce.\n\nThis is likely just the beginning of the job cuts, as President Donald Trump and top White House aide Elon Musk seek to continue slashing agency budgets.\n\nTrump signed an executive order Tuesday seeking a significant reduction in the size of the government. It instructs heads of federal departments and agencies to make \"large-scale reductions in force.\"\n\nThe initial firings focused on – but weren't exclusive to – employees in their first year of their federal job, as they lack the ability longer-term employees have to appeal their terminations. Coupled with about 75,000 workers who took President Trump's buyouts, the job cuts amount to nearly 4% of the federal government's 2.3 million workers.\n\nOverall, about 220,000 federal workers of the total federal government workforce had less than one year of experience as of March 2024, according to the most recently publicly available data from the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nHere's where firings have occurred so far.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau: Layoffs and a court challenge\n\nA federal judge on Friday blocked the dismissal of any more workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to multiple reports. More than 100 employees were laid off before the pause, NPR reported. A court challenge was filed by a union representing workers seeking to block Trump's efforts to eliminate the CFPB.\n\nDepartment of Education: Employees fired, put on leave\n\nTermination notices were sent to more than 60 probationary employees across multiple work groups, including the offices of general counsel, special education and rehabilitation services, and federal student aid. Dozens of employees have been put administrative leave, multiple outlets including the New York Times and Washington Post reported, amid the Trump administration's efforts to remove diversity, equity and inclusion positions from the government.\n\nPresident Trump has said he would like to dismantle the Education Department. Last week, Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, announced on X the department canceled nearly $1 billion in educational research contracts, severely limiting the agency's data-collecting arm.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nWhich agencies are being hit by DOGE? Education Department, USAID, NIH and more\n\nDepartment of Energy job cuts include nuclear agency firings\n\nAbout 1,200 to 2,000 workers in the department were terminated, including some at the National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages the U.S. nuclear weapons fleet and secures radiological materials around the world. Less than 0.5% of the NNSA workforce was dismissed, an Energy Department spokesperson said in a statement. Some NNsA employees at first identified for dismissals were later reinstated, Jill Hruby, former NNSA administrator in the Biden administration, said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services: CDC, NIH firings\n\nThousands of probationary employees were fired across the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), according to multiple reports\n\nRoughly 1,300 probational workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 10% of the agency's workforce, were fired on Friday, the Associated Press and NPR reported.\n\nWorkers were also fired at the National Institutes of Health, where a \"huge\" number of nurses from the NIH Clinical Center were let go, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources. Some facilities may be forced to close due to staffing shortages.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security: Firings at several federal agencies\n\nMore than 400 employees, identified as \"non-mission critical personnel in probationary status,\" were fired at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, according to CBS News and ABC News.\n\nDepartment of the Interior: National Park Service hit with firings\n\nAt least 2,300 federal workers had their positions terminated. Among them were 800 Bureau of Land Management employees and about 1,000 National Park Service workers.\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs: Firings yield $98 million\n\nMore than 1,000 of the department's about 43,000 probationary employees were terminated, producing an estimated savings of about $98 million, the department said.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency: 388 firings at federal agency\n\nThe agency fired 388 employees who were on probationary status \"after a thorough review of agency functions in accordance with President Trump’s executive orders,\" said Jeff Landis, an agency spokesman.\n\nGeneral Services Administration: Agency drops 100-plus workers\n\nMore than 100 probationary employees at the agency, which manages the nation's real estate portfolio, have been pressured into either resigning or facing being put on leave and then terminated, Reuters reported.\n\nInternal Revenue Service: Mass firings could be in the thousands\n\nThe IRS is preparing to fire thousands of workers next week, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. It was unclear how many thousands of employees would be fired at the IRS, which grew to about 100,000 people – including roughly 16,000 probationary workers – under the Biden Administration to increase its including its ability to audit corporations and wealthy taxpayers. Job cuts could affect the IRS' work to process upcoming tax returns, according to The New York Times, which first reported the expected layoffs.\n\nOffice of Personnel Management loses dozens of workers\n\nDozens of probationary employees at the agency, which had instructed other federal agencies to let go its probationary employees, also fired dozens of its own workers in a Thursday afternoon group call, CBS News and CNN reported.\n\nSmall Business Administration: About 20% of workers fired\n\nAbout 20% of the agency's staff, or about 720 SBA employees, including hundreds of probationary employees, were fired, Politico reported.\n\nU.S. Forest Service: About 3,400 workers fired\n\nThe agency, which is within the Department of Agriculture, fired about 3,400 probational workers, or nearly 10% of the Forest Service workforce of 35,000 employees. A source familiar with the cuts told USA TODAY the layoffs do not include firefighters, law enforcement officers, bridge inspectors or meteorologists.\n\nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID)\n\nAbout 10,000 USAID employees, excluding essential personnel, were placed on administrative leave last week.\n\nContributing: Reuters and Zachary Schermele of USA TODAY.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Threads, Bluesky and X: mikegsnider &@mikegsnider.bsky.social &@mikesnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

A USA TODAY analysis of the federal workforce explores the answers.\n\nHow many people work for the federal government?\n\nAbout 3 million people were on the federal payroll as of November 2024, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported. That's nearly 2% of the entire civilian workforce in the country. More than 600,000 of those employees work for the U.S. Postal Service ‒ an independent federal agency.\n\nGovernment contractors are not counted as part of the federal workforce, neither are the 1.3 million active-duty military personnel.\n\nAside from federal employees at the Postal Service, there were about 2.4 million federal workers as of last November.\n\nThe Pew Research Center reported that the federal government – not counting the Postal Service – is the nation’s single largest employer, with even more workers than Walmart, Amazon, or McDonald’s.\n\nWhich departments employ the most people?\n\nOf the 18 cabinet-level departments in the executive branch, the Department of Veterans Affairs employs the most people ‒ more than 486,000, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Office of Personnel Management FedScope data. This analysis uses data from March 2024 and does not include postal workers, employees working for intelligence agencies, or presidential appointees who require Senate confirmation.\n\nWithin the Department of Veterans Affairs, most federal employees work for the Veterans Health Administration ‒ a major health care system with a network of hospitals, clinics and nursing homes that provides care to over 9.1 million veterans.\n\nThe Department of Education is the smallest federal agency, employing 4,245 people. Trump has previously stated plans to shut down the Education Department.\n\nThe department oversees nearly $2 trillion in federal student loans, a figure on par with some of the biggest banks. It also protects students from predatory colleges and holds higher education institutions accountable for ensuring their degrees provide a good return on investment.\n\nWhere do federal employees live?\n\nMore than 80% of the federal workforce lives outside of the Washington, D.C., metro area. About 454,000 federal employees work in the district, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nCalifornia and Texas have a large concentration of federal employees, about 147,500 and 130,000, respectively, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nWhat are the most common jobs in the federal government?\n\nNearly 364,000 federal employees, or 16% of the federal workforce, are in health-related fields – the single largest occupational category.\n\nWho has lost their jobs so far?\n\nMass firings of federal workers thus far have focused primarily on eliminating recently hired or promoted probationary workers. This first round of firings came after buyouts were offered to all federal employees, which more than 75,000 workers accepted.\n\nWhile the exact number of federal employees affected by layoffs is not yet known, the following departments have been affected:\n\nInternal Revenue Service\n\nApproximately 6,000 employees at the IRS were set to be laid off starting Thursday, according to Reuters.\n\nDepartment of Defense\n\nThe Department of Defense announced on Feb. 21 that it planned to reduce its civilian workforce by 5%-8% by laying off about 5,400 probationary employees beginning the following week.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n\nMore than 400 employees, identified as \"non-mission critical personnel in probationary status,\" were fired at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USA TODAY recently reported.\n\nDepartment of the Interior\n\nAt least 2,300 federal workers had their positions terminated. Among them were 800 Bureau of Land Management employees and about 1,000 National Park Service workers.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration\n\nAbout 400 recently hired support staff employees at the FAA were fired on Feb. 14 as part of the Trump administration's mass terminations of federal workers, according to the union representing the employees.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\n\nThousands of probationary employees were fired across the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), according to multiple reports.\n\nRoughly 700 workers were let go at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to The Associated Press and NPR,\n\nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID)\n\nAbout 10,000 USAID employees, excluding essential personnel, were placed on administrative as of Feb. 7, and battles over the federal funding freeze are underway in court.\n\nSmall Business Administration\n\nAbout 20% of the agency's staff, or about 720 SBA employees, including hundreds of probationary employees, were fired, Politico reported.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture\n\nAbout 3,400 probational workers, or nearly 10% of the Forest Service workforce of 35,000 employees were laid off.\n\nOther agencies and departments that experienced layoffs include: The Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Personnel Management, the General Services Administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Energy and the Department of Education.\n\nCONTRIBUTING Kinsey Crowley, Joey Garrison and Mike Snider, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/01"}]}

I think it's such a huge moment and a huge movement,\" Mbagwu says.\n\nAnd while \"Cowboy Carter\" is rich with American history, the impact is profound all over the world.\n\n\"I think it personally resonates a lot because I think there's been a lot of erasure of Black people,\" Mbagwu says. \"A lot of culture comes from Black people, and I think that's kind of lost down the line in terms of, you know, appropriation. The artistry, the message behind the songs and the way she of invokes her art — it's artwork. Genuinely 'Cowboy Carter' is artwork.\"\n\n'Attending Beyoncé's tour in London felt significant'\n\nOther fans traveled from Australia, Italy, the U.S. and everywhere in between.

The halftime performance was dubbed the \"Beyoncé Bowl and drew in nearly 27 million U.S. viewers on Netflix.\n\nWhile the performance may have been a precursor to the singer's upcoming tour, most fans are expecting it to only have scratched the surface of what Beyoncé will deliver at her concerts. Fans have voiced their wishes and predictions for the upcoming rodeo, and it's clear they are putting no limits on Beyoncé. Some cities are expected to be especially epic.\n\nWill the concerts be live streamed?\n\nFans who can't attend the show in person will have the opportunity to witness the performance thanks to fans like Matthew Serafin, who turned live streaming her shows into a passion and an act of service. He plans to attend and stream the opening show and a number of others from his personal social media accounts.\n\nMany other fans plan to do the same.\n\nWhen did Beyoncé first announce her tour?\n\nBeyoncé first announced the tour the night before the 2025 Grammy Awards, where she took home the award for best country album and the top prize — album of the year — for her eighth studio album \"Cowboy Carter.\" She became the fist Black woman to take home the award for best country album.\n\nPrior to her three \"Cowboy Carter\" wins, no Black female solo artist had ever won a Grammy for country music. Four years ago, Mickey Guyton became the first Black female solo artist to be recognized in a country music category when she received a nomination for her song \"Black Like Me.\" This year also marked the first time a Black woman has been nominated for the top prize of album of the year for a country album. Ray Charles was nominated for album of the year for \"Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music\" in 1962.\n\nThe Grammy recognition was especially significant considering Beyoncé was snubbed, receiving zero nominations, at the Country Music Association Awards just months prior.\n\nBeyoncé last toured in 2023 for her record-breaking Renaissance World Tour. It began May 10 in Stockholm, Sweden, and concluded Oct. 1 in Kansas City, Missouri, with Beyoncé performing a total of 56 shows.\n\nReleasing 'Cowboy Carter' and its larger impact\n\nShe first released the 27-track project March 29, 2024. It has since made history and broken multiple records. As Beyoncé's first country album, she deliberately featured country legends and emerging Black country artists alike.\n\nPrior to releasing \"Cowboy Carter\" Beyoncé opened up about creating the project and her struggles within the country music genre, referencing her 2016 CMA Awards performance.\n\n\"This album has been over five years in the making. It was born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed…and it was very clear that I wasn’t,\" she wrote. \"But, because of that experience, I did a deeper dive into the history of Country music and studied our rich musical archive.\"\n\nThe album is the second part of a three-act project. Her seventh studio album, \"Renaissance\" is considered Act 1. The 2022 project earned her four Grammys, including best dance/electronic music album, making her the most decorated artist in the awards' history.\n\nFollow Caché McClay, the USA TODAY Network's Beyoncé Knowles-Carter reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @cachemcclay.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2025/06/04/beyonce-tour-london-what-to-know-tottenham-stadium-parking-cash/83995101007/", "title": "Beyonce's tour heads to London: What to know at Tottenham Stadium", "text": "AI-assisted summary Beyoncé is expanding her \"Cowboy Carter\" tour to international stages, starting with six nights at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.\n\nAttendees are encouraged to use public transportation, as there is no public parking at the stadium, and the venue operates cashlessly.\n\nA strict bag policy is in place, limiting bag sizes and requiring medical exemptions for oversized equipment.\n\nBeyoncé Knowles-Carter has wrapped the first U.S. leg on her \"Cowboy Carter\" tour, and now she's expanding the genre-bending concert to international stages.\n\nBeyoncé is headed to London, where she will kick off her Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for a total of six nights.
