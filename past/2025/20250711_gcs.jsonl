But her passing leaves a void for the UK at a time of steep challenges, amid a change in political leadership and a looming economic recession.\n\nThough Britons rarely looked to the monarchy for political leadership, the late Queen was a steady presence highly esteemed by many throughout decades of significant change that saw Britain transform from a war-weary declining imperial power into a modern multi-cultural state.\n\nWorld leaders from across the globe issued statements honoring Elizabeth’s life, underscoring the global impact she made during her 70-year reign. Elizabeth was head of state not just in the UK but in 14 other Commonwealth realms including Australia and Canada, and was head of the 54-member Commonwealth – the overwhelming majority of which are former colonial territories of the British Empire.\n\nAs the day began on Friday and the UK entered its first full day of mourning, church bells rang out in the Queen’s honor across the country, gun salutes were fired in royal parks in her memory, and people gathered outside Buckingham Palace in London.\n\nSome shops, including department store chain Selfridges, decided to close as a mark of respect, and Premier League soccer games have been postponed this weekend.\n\nKing Charles III is expected to make a televised address to the nation on Friday afternoon after meeting with Truss, and St. Paul’s Cathedral in London will hold an evening service to mark the Queen’s death at 6 p.m local time, which will be open to the public.\n\nKing Charles III leaves Balmoral Castle in Scotland with Camilla, Queen Consort, on Friday.

One part of that meeting will include a formal announcement of the sovereign’s death, and a formal proclamation of King Charles III as the new sovereign.\n\nThis is a closed meeting but attended by hundreds of dignitaries and members of the Privy Council, which is a panel of royal advisers, and will be followed by the Garter King of Arms – the person charged with overseeing royal ceremonial duties – reading the Proclamation from the palace balcony and gun salutes will across the capital.\n\nThe King has asked for a period of Royal Mourning to be observed from Friday until seven days after the Queen’s funeral, according to a Buckingham Palace statement issued Friday.\n\nMourners gather outside Buckingham Palace in London on Friday.

Many returned on Friday, laying flowers at the gates of the palace.\n\nMore than eight out of 10 people in England and Wales have never known a monarch other than Elizabeth, according to CNN analysis of 2021 census data.\n\nSome mourners outside Buckingham Palace told CNN how fearful they felt about the months to come, without the Queen to offer the type of stability she provided to the UK during times of political upheaval. Britain, which is grappling with its new identity since leaving the European Union, has had four prime ministers in a little over six years.\n\nA portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on display in London's Piccadilly Circus on Friday morning.

But the monarchy is always changing, especially with the younger generation coming in,” Om Shah, an 18-year-old student from London, told CNN.\n\nThe outpouring of sympathy included a statement from United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who called the Queen “a reassuring presence throughout decades of sweeping change,” and another from US President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, who said the Queen “defined an era.”\n\nIn Asia, India declared a day of mourning on September 11. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote in a tweet Friday morning that the Queen would be “remembered as a stalwart of our times,” while Chinese leader Xi Jinping called Charles on Friday to express his “deep condolences,” Chinese state media said.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron praised the Queen for her service and love of France. “Elizabeth II mastered our language, loved our cultures, and touched our hearts,” he said Friday.\n\n“To you, she was your Queen.

It reminded him of the 1992 fire at Windsor Castle, she added.\n\n“Of course it’s an incredible moment for him to have the opportunity, with the queen, to look at this (renovation) work and also meet the firemen who were involved,” she said.\n\nCharles and Macron will also attend a reception for British and French business leaders about financing climate-related and biodiversity projects.\n\nThe king will end his trip on Friday with a stop in Bordeaux, home to a large British community.

But hanging over the celebrations of the allied victory during World War II was the uncertainty of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nBiden met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zeleneskyy in Paris on Friday and announced another $225 million to help the war-torn country reconstruct its electric grid. He and Macron discussed both wars and other issues of mutual interest during a meeting Saturday at the presidential palace.\n\nAfterward, Biden warned that all of Europe would be in danger if Russian President Vladimir Putin wins his war against Ukraine.\n\n“Putin’s not going to stop at Ukraine,” Biden said, with Macron at his side. “It’s not just Ukraine. It’s more than Ukraine. All of Europe will be threatened.”\n\n“We’re not going to let that happen,” he added. “We will not walk away.”\n\nMacron stressed that France and the United States “see eye to eye” on the war in Ukraine. He thanked Biden for taking what he called “a critical role” on Ukraine and reiterated France’s support for a cease-fire and hostage deal the Biden administration is pushing to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nFrance has yet to agree to a Biden plan for a $50 billion loan assistance package for Ukraine that would use interest from frozen Russian assets held in Western financial institutions. But Macron expressed hope that the package would win the approval of the Group of Seven allies who are meeting next week in Italy.\n\nApart from the talk of war, however, was all the spectacle of a state visit, French style.\n\nAt the welcome ceremony earlier Saturday, Biden and first lady Jill Biden joined Macron and his wife Brigitte at the Arc de Triomphe, a monument to French soldiers who fought and died in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.\n\nBiden and Macron watched as soldiers laid a floral wreath beside the eternal flame that burns beside the monument's Tomb of the Unknown Solider. Four military jets flew overhead in formation. The two leaders and their spouses signed a guest book, shook hands with some uniformed officers and then proceeded down the Champs-Élysées to the presidential palace.\n\n“It was a moving experience for a student of French history,” Biden said later.\n\nAt the state dinner in Biden's honor, Macron toasted the enduring friendship between the two countries. “We are allies and will remain allies,” he said, as glasses were clinked and raised.\n\nBiden said his time in France “has been the most remarkable trip I’ve ever made.”\n\n“France and the United States have always been there for one another,” he said, adding that the two countries stand together “to defend the very values that are the soul of our two nations.”\n\nHe then asked everyone to raise a glass and concluded: “May we continue to seek democracy … and may we always stay together.”\n\nBiden and Macron have a had a friendly, but at times testy relationship.\n\nJust a few months after Biden took office, France complained that it had been stiffed after the U.S. announced a submarine deal with the United Kingdom and Australia, causing the Aussies to cancel a contract to buy submarines for the French.\n\nA contrite Biden acknowledged the U.S. had been “clumsy” in how it handled the announcement. He later hosted the Macrons at a state dinner at the White House, the first of his presidency.\n\nFrance and other European countries also have griped about the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. European officials argue the law is designed to protect American interests and punishes their manufacturers because it offers tax breaks and subsidies to U.S. companies that produce clean-energy products, in particular electric vehicles and solar panels.\n\nStill, the White House insists transatlantic relations between the two countries are strong.\n\n“One of the things the president respects and admires so much about President Macron is that he's as honest and as forthright as Joe Biden is,” said John Kirby, the White House spokesman on national security issues. “That's what he wants to see in a friend and an ally – you know, an ability to shoot straight, say what's on your mind.”\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

It comes a year after the US announced a surprise US-Australia submarine partnership – upending France’s own submarine deal with Australia and infuriating French officials. The perilous relations are no small matter, given the array of major challenges facing the larger western alliance.\n\n“If you look at what’s going on in Ukraine, look at what’s going on in the Indo-Pacific and the tensions with China, France is really at the center of all those things,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications. “President Macron has been the dynamic leader inside the G7 … so the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country to start with for state visits.”\n\nIn an early sign of that diplomacy, the Elysee confirmed to CNN on Thursday a series of gifts exchanged between the world leaders and their spouses.\n\nMacron gifted his US counterpart a centerpiece from French goldsmith and tableware house, Christofle, the Elysee said. The present, crafted in 2012, is a tribute to the French transatlantic liner, the “Normandie,” which sailed with a Christofle silverware collection in the interwar period, per the Elysee.\n\nBiden was also presented with a vinyl record and CD of the soundtrack of the film “A man and a woman,” directed by Frenchman Claude Lelouch. The Elysee described the gift as a “nod to the personal history of the Biden couple” as they watched the 1966 film during their first date. The film also won France’s highest film award, the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden received two French literary works: a copy of “Madame Bovary,” by Gustave Flaubert, as well as a collection of essays written by Albert Camus, per the Elysee.\n\nFinally, Biden received two gifts from the Elysee Palace gift shop, a watch from watchmaker LIP and a jumper from the French brand Saint James.\n\nButter-poached Maine lobster and calotte of beef, shallot marmalade, are seen at the White House during a media preview of the state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron. Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Sipa USA/AP\n\nThe dinner has domestic political overtones, as well. As the Bidens roll out the red carpet for Macron and his wife Brigitte, there’s word they have two more state dinners in the works along with several other social events to come. Several people with knowledge of White House planning and operations, who spoke to CNN for this story, confirmed this State Dinner will be one of several hosted by the Biden administration in upcoming months.\n\nIt may suggest, said those familiar with the thinking around future state dinners, Biden indeed wants to run for a second term, something he has said he intends to do, but a decision that also hinges on the consent and support of his wife and extended family.\n\n“These are intricate – and expensive – events,” said one of the people, who has worked in the White House, of state dinners. “If the administration is willing to sink budget dollars into them, there’s probably a larger strategy at play.”\n\nThe guest list for Biden’s first state dinner was big from the start, made extra-large to include all of the people who have missed out on key social time with the president due to Covid-19 restrictions. Having done the mental calculations months ago as planning began, said two people familiar with the dinner’s details, the East Wing, the West Wing, the State Department and the National Security Council’s lists ballooned.\n\nAmong those attending the state dinner were celebrities and musicians, as well as top lawmakers, according to a printout of guests from the White House. Stephen Colbert, Anna Wintour and John Legend were among the invitees to rub shoulders with the likes of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nTwo guests of Macron – the head designers for fashion house Oscar de la Renta, Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia – confirmed to CNN that Jill Biden wore the luxury label at the dinner.\n\nGarcia said they collaborated with the first lady for about two months on the dress, getting her input on what she wanted for the look, which included “a sense of ease.”\n\nThis first State Dinner offered the opportunity to finally make amends to VIPs and diplomats, members of Congress and deep-pocketed donors. A decision was made to hold the dinner in a tent on the South Lawn, which would allow them to comfortably seat the more than 400 guests expected to attend. (The White House is referring to the tent as a “pavilion,” as it has clear panels on the sides.)\n\nAn indoor dinner in the State Dining Room is limited by space restrictions – only about 120 guests can be accommodated. The second and last Trump administration State Dinner, for Australia, was held in the Rose Garden, which could seat approximately 200 for a formal dinner.\n\n“We’ve always expected a larger guest list as it’s the first state dinner of the Biden Administration,” Vanessa Valdivia, Jill Biden’s press secretary, told CNN.\n\nA table is set during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe dinner for France was actually supposed to take place months prior, said the two people, but scheduling conflicts, including campaign trips for midterm elections, foreign travel and the wedding of Naomi Biden, meant the date was pushed back more than once. Thursday evening was ultimately where the schedules of several executive branch agencies landed with clear calendars.\n\nUnfortunately for the White House social offices and usher’s office, the final date also meant pulling off the ritual of holiday decorations and dozens of White House holiday parties in tandem with a debut State Dinner, something that has not been done before during a modern presidency. The White House calligraphers, kitchen staff, service teams and floral shop all worked to juggle the demands of overlapping, high-caliber events.\n\nAncillary kitchen space has been added with refrigeration units placed outside the White House kitchen area, as is usually the case for multiple or large social events, especially during the busy holiday party season where there can be as many as two or three receptions per day. (Three of the industrial-sized refrigerators outside earlier this week were labeled with the word “cheese,” in black magic marker – unclear whether for the French dinner, or holiday party nibbles.)\n\nFor the State Dinner, the Bidens have opted to use rental dishes, glasses, flatware, table accoutrements and linens. The venue, though on the White House grounds, does not allow for the official White House china services to be used for the dinner, said White House social secretary Carlos Elizondo. White House curators, who oversee the use of all items in the White House collection, do not count the temporarily installed tent as part of the campus – and thus the china of presidents’ past would not be part of the service.\n\nThe overall design and the floral arrangements were put together by an event planner, Jung Lee, and her company, Fete, a posh party design outfit favored by celebrities.\n\nA stage and dance floor was erected in the tent for the evening’s entertainment from singer Jon Batiste, a New Orleans native, a city Jill Biden said Wednesday is “shaped by both French and American culture.” The Macrons will visit New Orleans after Washington, before returning to France.\n\nWhite House Executive Chef Cris Comerford presents the menu during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe décor for the dinner was inspired by red, white and blue, the shared colors of the American and French flags, and “our common values: liberty and democracy, equality and fellowship,” said Biden at a preview of the table settings and menu.\n\nThe trick of a successful State Dinner format, says a former White House social secretary, is to seamlessly and organically combine elements from both the United States and the visiting country, an offering of hospitality on the side of a main course of diplomacy. But without being too hokey about it.\n\nThe flowers on the tables Thursday night were mostly roses; American Beauty varietals and Piano Roses, deep red blooms because, as Elizondo said, Emmanuel Macron likes the piano. French-made Champagne flutes were used for toasting, but filled with American sparkling wine. Tall candelabras holding blood-red candles are meant to mimic the Statue of Liberty, France’s gift to the United States. And so on.\n\nThe table setting is something the first lady has said is always her first consideration when hosting anyone for a meal, a memory from her childhood and her mother. “Even if we were only having fish sticks from the freezer, she always made our dinners feel special,” said Biden, who is expected to make remarks at the dinner.\n\n“The first lady has been involved since the beginning, it’s been important to her that the dinner reflects the warmth and approachable hospitality that the Bidens are known for,” Valdivia said.\n\nA person with knowledge of the first lady’s hands-on approach to the dinner said she was involved with all aspects of the planning, down to doing tastings of each dish and overseeing the seating chart, much like her immediate predecessor, Melania Trump, whose first state dinner also happened to be for the Macrons. Unlike the Trump dinner, the Bidens served caviar and butter-poached lobster for a first-course, Calotte of beef and watercress and sunchoke salad for the main. Trump went with goat cheese gateau with tomato jam, and a rack of lamb. Though the two dinners would share a dessert: crème fraiche ice cream.\n\nA table is set during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnother common thread with Biden’s immediate predecessor is the lack of a high number of state dinners by this time in his presidency. However, for much of it, Biden has not been able due to the pandemic to host parties. Trump had a third State Dinner in the works – for the King and Queen of Spain – but canceled it as the pandemic took hold around the world.\n\nBiden is also not as inclined socially to host big events at the White House, Covid-19 restrictions or not. The first couple has notably spent most weekends away from Washington in Delaware or Camp David, and as a closely bonded family, there are few occasions where guest lists for dinners expand beyond relatives.\n\nPrevious presidents have used the White House frequently to entertain, typically with a subtext, whether political or cultural. In recent history, Barack and Michelle Obama hosted birthday parties and music concerts, bringing together celebrities and politicians for fun-filled, late nights of elbow-rubbing and bonding. The Obamas’ State Dinner for then-French President Francois Hollande in 2014 brought a star-studded guest list that included Bradley Cooper, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Stephen Colbert and Elon Musk.\n\nSinger Mary J. Blige entertained at the dinner. By contrast, Trump’s two state dinners lacked bold-faced guests and headliners, as his political leanings were often antithetical from those of mainstream Hollywood.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images In pictures: White House state dinners Prev Next\n\nGoing back further, presidents accumulated State Dinners as a means to help soothe icy relationships, or build support on geopolitical crises.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, for example, continued to hold State Dinners during World War II, to pull in allies. Dwight Eisenhower in 1959 hosted Nikita Khrushchev, the first State Dinner for a Soviet leader, to help quell concerns of escalating nuclear tension. Jimmy Carter was not a big party guy – the State Dinners hosted by the president and Rosalyn Carter did not include hard liquor, just beer and wine – but he had held 33 State Dinners by this time in his tenure. After the signing of the Panama Canal treaties, Carter hosted one state dinner for 18 Latin American heads of state, according to data collected by the White House Historical Association.\n\nAs time went on, guest lists for the dinners routinely grew, observed by the orders for presidential china sets, which went from accommodating about 100 people, to the most recent official set for the Obamas, which accommodated 320 people. Biden, in other words, still has the time and the space to showcase the highest form of diplomacy this country can offer another world leader. And he intends to.\n\n“There are more being planned and in the works for the future,” said one of the people with knowledge of the larger Biden State Dinner strategy. “This is just the start.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/europe/gallery/king-charles-iii", "title": "Britain's King Charles III | CNN", "text": "The coronation of Britain's King Charles III was witnessed by hundreds of high-profile guests inside Westminster Abbey in May 2023.\n\nCharles had been \"monarch-in-waiting\" for more than 70 years.

That's quite a signature, isn't it?” he said. “He’s a beautiful man and a wonderful man.”\n\nTea and diplomacy with a side of flattery\n\nStarmer, who was in town to obtain a crucial commitment from the U.S. to provide a “backstop” or security guarantee in Ukraine to deter Russia from invading again in the event of a ceasefire, did not miss an opportunity to demonstrate his soft diplomacy skills.\n\nStarmer left the White House empty-handed, but not before singing Trump's praises.\n\nUsing language that sounded unmistakably Trumpian, Starmer described the invitation as “very special.”\n\n“This is unprecedented,” he said. “I think the last state visit was a tremendous success. His Majesty the King wants to make this even better than that. So this is truly historic and unprecedented.”\n\nIndeed, Trump would be the first elected political leader to be hosted for two state visits by a British monarch. Other than Trump during his first term in 2019, Barack Obama and George W. Bush were the only two presidents to be invited to state visits to Britain during late Queen Elizabeth's 70-year reign.\n\nDuring his 2019 state visit, Trump had tea with Charles, who was then heir to the throne.\n\nTrump accepted the new invitation on the spot.\n\n\"The answer is yes,\" he said. \"Our wonderful First Lady, Melania and myself ... we look forward to being there,\" he said.\n\nNot to be outdone in the flattery department, Trump complimented Starmer on his clipped British accent, said the two got along \"famously\" and said he was very impressed with Starmer's wife, Lady Victoria Starmer.\n\n\"I'm very impressed with him, very impressed with his wife,\" said Trump. \"I must say, she's a beautiful, great woman. And I said, you're very lucky.\"\n\nNo firm American commitment on peacekeeping efforts in Ukraine\n\nStarmer was the second European leader after French President Emmanuel Macron to visit Trump this week in the hopes of securing U. S. security guarantees to stop future aggression from Russia.\n\nThe U.K. prime minister announced Sunday that he was willing to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine when the Russia-Ukraine war ends.\n\n\"We are facing a once-in-a-generation moment for the collective security of our continent,\" Starmer wrote in the Telegraph. \"This is not only a question about the future of Ukraine – it is existential for Europe as a whole.\"\n\nBut rather than commit to any specific form of American support, Trump chose to focus on a deal to gain U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals that can be used in magnets, batteries, and aircrafts, saying that would indirectly keep the area safe.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy who will be in White House on Friday, is expected the sign the deal during the visit.\n\nTrump, who has been negotiating with Russian President Valdimir Putin to end his three-year Russian invasion and occupation of Ukraine − without participation from Ukraine or its European allies, much to their chagrin.\n\n“We'll have a lot of people working there,” Trump said as he held a press meet with Starmer, referring to future U.S. mining in Ukraine. “So in that sense, it’s very good. It's a backstop. I don't think anybody's going to play around if we're there.”\n\nTrump said his team was working very hard to bring the war to an end, and that he’d had back-to-back calls with Putin and Zelenskyy.\n\n“I think we’ve made a lot of progress, and I think it’s moving along pretty rapidly, “said Trump, adding. “It’ll either be fairly soon or it won’t be at all.\"\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House Correspondent for USA TODAY.

About 45 minutes later, they finally relented.\n\n“They just kept talking and talking and talking. And so you eventually had protocol people from both sides just continuing to step forward. I was actually wondering if they were about to physically grab them and drag them out of the room,” a senior administration official said, describing the meeting on the condition of anonymity. “I think if they had been left to their own devices, they probably would have sat there for another two hours and just kept talking.”\n\nThe September meeting typified the close working relationship that aides say has emerged between the two men. And it belied the fact that it fell almost exactly one year after French-American relations sunk to their lowest point in decades, with Macron taking the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Washington for consultations over a US-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multi-billion dollar defense contract.\n\nThose tumultuous weeks are now far from the minds of either men or their respective administrations as Macron touches down in Washington on Tuesday evening for an official state visit, the first time Biden has bestowed that honor on any leader since taking office nearly two years ago.\n\nThe visit will put on display the critical alliance and the increasingly close working relationship between the two men, brought even closer in the nine months since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February, according to US and French officials. And it will be an opportunity for the pair – who both place a premium on personal relationships as a tool of international diplomacy – to deepen their personal relationship as well, with a private dinner with their spouses on Wednesday night ahead of the lavish state dinner the following day.\n\nSaul Loeb/Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden and Macron have met several times on the sidelines of international conferences and speak regularly over the phone to coordinate the West’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – including at least seven one-on-one calls so far this year and a dozen joint calls with other leaders. During the midterm campaign, Biden frequently invoked an anecdote involving Macron to make his case about the importance of protecting democracy.\n\nAnd when Biden turned 80 earlier this month, Macron sent the US president a handwritten birthday card, a US and French official said, wishing Biden a happy birthday and congratulating him on his granddaughter’s wedding, which took place the same weekend.\n\nAbove all, senior administration officials indicated that France’s selection for Biden’s first state visit was intended to highlight the premium Biden has placed on the US core alliances, his view of the importance of democracies in a world being tested by rising autocracies and France’s central role in both of those principles – both as the US oldest ally and Macron’s starring role in its defining battles.\n\n“I mean, if you look at what’s going on in Ukraine, look at what’s going on in the Indo-Pacific and the tensions with China, France is really at the center of all those things,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications. “President Macron has been the dynamic leader inside the G7, particularly there in Europe. And so the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country to start with for state visits.”\n\nOther natural candidates to highlight the US core alliances in Europe have become less obvious choices. The United Kingdom has been riven by political turmoil and Germany became a lesser-known quantity on the international stage following the departure of longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel. Meanwhile, Macron is the longest-serving European leader within the G7 and has sought to establish himself as Europe’s preeminent head of state.\n\n“France has in many respects jumped to the head of the queue and become America’s go-to partner when it comes to advancing transatlantic cooperation,” said Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council. “And I think that’s in part because of Macron himself, who leans into Europe’s role in the world and who in comparison with most other European leaders is quite active and quite ambitious.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden (back to camera) shakes hands with French President Emmanuel Macron during the Global Fund Seventh Replenishment Conference in New York on September 21, 2022. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUS and French officials do not expect the visit to yield any major deliverables, but both sides see it as an opportunity for the two countries to deepen their partnership on a slew of global challenges, from the war in Ukraine to policy toward China and the challenges posed by Iran’s nuclear program. The two sides will also advance working group discussions which were launched in the wake of last year’s submarine affair to step up cooperation on space, cyberspace and energy issues.\n\n“We’re in an extremely strong place with France. There has been a tremendous convergence of our policy on all the big ticket items,” a senior administration official said.\n\nUkraine will be “front and center” in Biden and Macron’s discussions, the official said, from coordinating their efforts to supply Ukraine’s military, to continuing to punish Russia for its invasion and mitigating the economic and energy fallout on the West. Those discussions come as Europe braces for the stinging effects high energy costs and tight supply will have and as Ukraine’s recent battlefield advances have ratcheted European calls for negotiations with Russia.\n\nThe US and Europe’s policy in the Indo-Pacific and toward China is expected to be a close second, following Biden’s recent meeting with Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 in Indonesia and as Macron prepares to make a trip to Beijing early next year.\n\n“The two presidents are going to want to compare notes on that,” a senior administration official said. “Our views on China are not identical, but I think there is a strong view that we should be speaking from a common script in response to China.”\n\nWhile the US and France are closely aligned on both big ticket items, that’s not to say there aren’t also areas of disagreement and divergence. As a difficult winter approaches, calls in Europe for Ukraine to move toward negotiations have begun to grow louder and concerns are emerging about preserving Western unity as the war drags on. On China, Biden will look for Macron to link arms with him in confronting the country over its trade practices and military moves in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nPerhaps the biggest point of tension will be over billions of dollars in electric vehicle subsidies included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which applies only to those manufactured in North America. Macron has slammed the measure as protectionist and French officials said he intends to raise the issue in meetings with Biden and congressional leaders. The Biden administration has stood up a working group with the European Union to address the issue, but the text of the law limits the administration’s ability to act.\n\nA French flag flies alongside the US flag in front of the White House in preparation for this week's state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, in Washington, U.S., November 29, 2022. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nMacron’s forward-leaning stance on the issue underscores another dynamic of the Biden-Macron relationship: despite the closeness of the relationship and overarching agreement on top global issues, Macron has not been shy about carving out his own space on the global stage – including by pursuing and maintaining backchannel communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin – and publicly disagreeing with Biden at times.\n\nIn March, Macron warned against the risk of escalation after Biden called Putin a “butcher” who “cannot remain in power.” The next month, he warned again about an “escalation of words,” disagreeing with Biden’s decision to call Russian war crimes in Ukraine a genocide. And in October, Macron urged “prudence” after Biden warned of the risk of nuclear “Armageddon.”\n\nMacron’s approach has rankled US officials at times, but officials and experts say the free-wheeling nature of the comments point to a relationship with Biden – and the US – built on more than just personal connection.\n\nMacron had also secured the first state visit of President Donald Trump’s term in office, after pursuing a charm offensive that left some calling the relationship a “bromance.” But that “bromance” struggled to survive as Trump repeatedly cast doubt on the US commitment to the NATO alliance, leading to a war of words between the two men.\n\nNow, both sides know they have a partner fundamentally committed to the alliance – tactical and stylistic differences notwithstanding – particularly in the face of the war in Ukraine.\n\n“The irritants in the relationship are completely overwhelmed by partnership and solidarity,” said Kupchan, the former NSC senior European affairs director under President Barack Obama. “I think with Biden, (the French) know they have an Atlanticist. And they have someone who has transatlantic partnership in his DNA.”", "authors": ["Jeremy Diamond"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}]}

But how easy is it to form a separate one? Can anyone form a political party? Here's what to takes to start your own in Ohio.\n\nWhat is Elon Musk's 'America Party'?\n\nFounded by Elon Musk, the America Party critiques both the Republican and Democratic parties. \"The America Party is needed to fight the Republican/Democrat Uniparty,\" Musk wrote in a separate X post. According to Reuters, the new party carries a tech focus, while being \"budget-conscious, pro-energy and centrist.\"\n\n\"When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,\" Musk wrote on X, his social media platform. \"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.\"\n\nMusk has strongly opposed Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" which includes tax cuts, increased spending on immigration enforcement and military, and deep funding cuts to Medicaid, according to USA TODAY. The bill increases the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.\n\nWhat does it take to start a political party in Ohio?\n\nStarting a political party can be an uphill and expensive challenge, though not impossible.\n\nAt the state level, there are two major political parties: Republican and Democratic. Other political parties would fall under the minor political party, according to the Ohio Secretary of State. There is a formal process to petition your party.\n\nPaperwork for a \"petition to form a minor political party\" should be submitted to the Ohio Secretary of State. According to the state office, you must gather signatures from qualified electors equal to at least one percent of the total votes cast for governor or presidential electors in the most recent election for that office. (The 2022 Ohio gubernatorial election saw 4,201,368 voters cast ballots.) Additionally, the petition must have \"at least 500 qualified electors from each of at least a minimum of one-half of the congressional districts (CD) in the state.\"\n\nAccording to the Ohio House of Representatives, time is also of the essence, and you must petition your political party to the Secretary of State at least 125 days before the general election. The House adds that to maintain your party's status for future elections, \"a party’s candidate for governor or president must receive at least 3 percent of the total vote cast in the most recent election.\"\n\nOhio's petition process also includes designating a committee of three to five people to represent the petitioners, and naming your prospective political party which must be different from an existing party name. If successful, the Secretary of State notes that the new political party comes into legal existence and can nominate candidates to appear on the ballot at the general election.\n\nHow easy is it to form a national political party?\n\nOn the federal level, starting a political party typically requires forming a committee, lots of fundraising, gathering widespread support and registering with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). According to the FEC, this includes getting a tax ID and bank account, appointing a treasurer, and following specific criteria set by the agency.\n\nSeveral newly formed political entities referencing America Party, Musk or one of his businesses appeared in the FEC database in the wake of the billionaire's declaration, according to PBS reporting. However, email addresses and addresses listed in the filings indicate that those are false and not actually affiliated with Musk.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/07/elon-musk-third-party/84492259007/", "title": "Does the U.S. have third parties? Elon Musk announces 'America ...", "text": "Elon Musk has announced he is forming a new political party, and he did it the day after President Donald Trump signed the megabill that the pair have publicly sparred over for weeks.\n\nThe billionaire said in a post on his social media platform, X, July 5 that he is creating the America Party because Americans are living in a \"one-party system, not a democracy,\" a criticism aimed at the Republican Party for its support of the president's sweeping tax and spending bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the legislation will increase the national debt by $3.4 trillion over a decade, an increase Musk has repeatedly lambasted.\n\nMusk, once a close ally to Trump and a major funder of his 2024 presidential campaign, said the party would aim to unseat the Republican lawmakers in Congress who backed the bill in next year's midterm elections. He is the world's richest person, worth $405 billion, according to Forbes, and he spent nearly $290 million to help Trump and other Republicans win elections last year.\n\nA third political party: Has one ever succeeded in the U.S.?\n\nTrump criticized the new party announcement on social media July 6, writing Musk has gone \"off the rails\" and that third parties \"have never succeeded in the United States.\"\n\nThe United States has maintained a two-party system through most of its history, dominated by the Republican and Democratic parties. While candidates of third political parties have never won a U.S. presidential election in the 20th and 21st centuries, they have had some level of influence in elections over the years.\n\nThe two largest third parties in 2025 are the Libertarian and Green Parties, though neither is registered in all 50 states. That presents a considerable barrier in efforts to compete with the Democrats and the GOP. The Federal Elections Commission and individual states have their own sets of rules and requirements for a political party to register in elections, a system that can make formation of new parties difficult.\n\nOftentimes, third parties have acted as vote siphons that threaten either Republican or Democratic candidates' ability to reach a majority, or have mobilized attention over voter issues. The last time a third party candidate made headway in a presidential race was in 1968, when American Independent Party nominee George Wallace won electoral votes from five Southern states.\n\nIn 1992, Ross Perot of the Independent Party ran for president, and in 2000 Ralph Nader did the same representing the Green Party, but neither won any electoral votes.\n\nThe most successful third-party candidacy was in 1912, according to Boston University political history expert Bruce J. Schulman, when Theodore Roosevelt finished second and got about 27% of the popular vote. Schulman said in an interview in October 2024 with the university's newspaper that third parties in the United States can be understood using historian Richard Hofstadter's analogy − that third parties are like bees, and once they have \"stung,\" or got their message across, they die.\n\n\"With the more substantial third parties, like those that get enough support to qualify for debates, they often form out of a social movement due to the two major parties not addressing a concern or constituency,\" Schulman said. He said that they \"can produce important changes in the political system,\" including influencing a major political party to adopt its message, but that \"none in the last century has ever threatened to take power.\"\n\nA few public figures express interest in Musk's proposed third party\n\nMusk has suggested he would use his proposed third political party to influence a select number of congressional races.\n\n\"Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people,\" Musk wrote on X on July 4 after a poll he posted asking users to vote on whether he should create a third party. As of July 7, the social media poll has 1.2 million participants, and 65% have selected yes.\n\nA few public figures have expressed interest in supporting the party. Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban said on social media that he wants to help the party get on ballots, and Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly was Trump's White House director of communications in 2017, wrote on X that he would like to meet with Musk to discuss the party. Both have been outspoken critics of the Trump administration.\n\nIn a 2024 Gallup poll, 58% U.S. adults said a third major party is needed in the United States because the Republican and Democratic parties \"do such a poor job\" of representing the American people. The results were the 12th consecutive time Gallup recorded a majority response on the question, with an average 56% support level for a third party since 2003. The 2024 survey results were down 5 percentage points from 2023’s record high, according to Gallup data.\n\nContributing: Zac Anderson, USA TODAY; Reuters\n\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

It comes as his designation as a \"special government employee\" ‒ which allowed him to stay on the job for 130 calendar days a year ‒ has ended.\n\n\"As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\" Musk said. \"The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\"\n\nA White House official confirmed Musk's exit, telling USA TODAY, \"The offboarding process has begun.\"\n\nAs the head of DOGE and a senior White House adviser, Musk led the effort to gut the government of what he called \"waste and fraud\" and reduce the federal workforce. DOGE, which is staffed by more than 100 government employees, is set to continue operating without Musk in charge. But it was unclear how much power the group will maintain without its famous leader.\n\nMusk already had shifted his attention back to his business empire. Tesla, his electric car company, suffered financial losses after he became a polarizing figure as President Donald Trump's chief sidekick. This week, Musk took part in a blitz of media interviews from the headquarters of his company SpaceX in South Texas, coinciding with the latest test flight of his Starship spacecraft.\n\nThe day before his departure, Musk broke with Trump by criticizing his massive tax and spending bill that the president has dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill.\" The bill, which includes Trump's domestic agenda on items ranging from border security to tax cuts, passed the House along party lines. It now heads to the Senate.\n\n\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk said in an interview May 27 on \"CBS Sunday Morning.\"\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.\n\n“I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion,” Musk said in the interview.\n\nMusk, the richest man in the world and a Republican megadonor who helped bankroll Trump's 2024 campaign, last week said he intends to substantially cut back his political spending in future elections as he focuses more time on his businesses.\n\n\"I think in terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future,\" Musk said May 20 at the Bloomberg News Qatar Economic Forum. \"I think I've done enough.\"\n\nDOGE has boasted of saving the federal government more than $175 billion through cuts ‒ though the group's declared savings have often been exaggerated or misleading. The office has dismantled entire federal agencies, axed government contracts and led the firings of tens of thousands of federal workers.\n\nMusk downplayed the effect his absence could have on DOGE's survival during an interview with USA TODAY and other media outlets earlier in May.\n\n\"Is Buddha needed for Buddhism?\" Musk asked. \"DOGE is a way of life.\"\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/19/tech/twitter-elon-musk-problems", "title": "Deal or no deal, Elon Musk could upend Twitter's business for a long ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nNearly a month after Twitter agreed to sell itself to Elon Musk in a stunning $44 billion deal, the fate of the acquisition remains very much uncertain.\n\nIn recent days, Musk has said the deal “cannot move forward” until he sees more information about the amount of spam and fake accounts on the platform and has flippantly pushed back at careful explanations from Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal on the matter.\n\nTwitter (TWTR), meanwhile, remains unwavering that the acquisition will go through. In a statement to CNN Business on Tuesday, the company said it intends “to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement.”\n\nMusk’s back-and-forth with the company is widely viewed as him setting the stage to renegotiate the offer price, or else back out of the deal entirely. No matter what happens next, however, one thing is certain: Musk has created a big mess for Twitter, the effects of which won’t be easily or quickly undone. And in the meantime, the company’s employees, users and shareholders hang in the balance.\n\nIn one scenario, Twitter is bracing for an innovative but erratic billionaire owner who is expected to cut some staff, overhaul the leadership team and potentially undo years of content moderation efforts with uncertain outcomes for advertisers, users and the morale of the staffers who remain.\n\nIn another scenario, Twitter faces the prospect of a prolonged legal battle with the world’s richest man if he tries to back out of the deal, not to mention the possibility of other acquirers coming out of the woodwork. The result could be unending background noise that adds to challenges for Twitter to hold on to staffers and regain momentum.\n\nAs Wedbush analyst Dan Ives put it on Friday, after the Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO first said he was putting the deal “temporarily on hold” over the spam account issue, the “Twitter circus show” has morphed into a “Friday the 13th horror show.”\n\nA prolonged fight\n\nFrom the start, there have been doubts about the deal going through, including from Musk. Shortly after announcing his offer to buy Twitter last month, Musk said in an on-stage interview at the TED conference, “I’m not sure I’ll actually be able to acquire it.” Industry watchers have also questioned whether Musk will be able to finance the acquisition. The recent decline in Tesla shares, which he’s partly using to back his financing of the deal, has only added to those concerns.\n\nTwitter’s stock has traded noticeably below the $54.20 per share Musk offered throughout the deal process, an indication of investor skepticism about the deal being completed or completed at that price. As of this week, Twitter stock has wiped out all the gains since Musk first disclosed taking a large stake in the company early last month.\n\nWith his latest public statements, Musk raised the possibility that Twitter has significantly undercounted the amount of spam and fake accounts on its platform in its quarterly disclosures, though he has yet to provide evidence to support that claim. In the process, some legal experts say, Musk appears to be trying to lay the groundwork to argue inaccurate information would constitute a “material adverse event,” which might entitle him to back away from the deal.\n\nBut the bar for such a claim is high. Twitter has made the same boilerplate disclosure — that spam accounts make up less than 5% of its active users — for many quarters. Moreover, a recent securities filing from Twitter revealed that Musk waived due diligence before making his offer to buy Twitter. That concerns over spam may squash the deal is all the more curious considering Musk said part of his motivation to acquire Twitter in the first place was to rid it of such accounts.\n\nElon Musk has been raising doubts about his ability to complete the takeover of Twitter since the day he and the company announced the deal. Ryan Lash/AFP/TED Conferences, LLC/Getty Images\n\nShould Musk ultimately try to back out of the deal, he could be on the hook for a $1 billion breakup fee. He could also effectively open the door to litigation from Twitter to enforce the terms of the merger agreement and compel him to buy the company.\n\nBrian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, told CNN Business that Twitter is in “a very strong legal position” if it tried to go to court and force the deal on the original terms. But there are still business risks here for Twitter in going that route, which could push the company to negotiate a somewhat lower deal price.\n\nAs Wedbush’s Ives put it: “Then it gets caught in the courts for 12 to 18 months. It’s a significant overhang on Twitter, and it becomes just a fiasco as they’re basically just caught up in this circus show.”\n\nTwitter and Musk did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nChallenges for Twitter either way\n\nEven if the deal is completed, the company could still be in for a period of significant turbulence.\n\nMusk has said he plans to remove content restrictions on the platform in the name of what he calls “free speech,” by which he has said he means all legal speech in the various markets in which Twitter operates. Musk has also said he would restore former President Donald Trump’s account on the platform and do away with many of the permanent bans that Twitter and other platforms have used to handle repeat violators of their rules.\n\nSuch steps could move Twitter closer to some less moderated social media sites popular with conservatives that have yet to gain significant traction, in part, some say, because many users and advertisers prefer not to be on platforms rife with harmful content like misinformation and harassment.\n\n“The places which are just cesspools of no content moderation have not taken off,” said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. Thus, there could be conflict between Musk’s stated goal to grow Twitter’s business and his plans for how to handle content moderation.\n\nIf the deal doesn’t go through, Twitter could still face renewed scrutiny of its business, its spam accounting methods and its content moderation decisions, after Musk has spent weeks criticizing the company on these fronts.\n\nFor much of its life as a public company, Twitter has struggled to grow its audience and to boost its stock price. Prior to Musk taking a stake last month, Twitter’s stock was trading below the closing price from its first day of trading more than eight years ago.\n\nIf the deal collapses, it may only reignite investor pressure on Twitter to bolster growth — and to do so at a time when the broader tech sector is struggling. It also raises the possibility of other acquirers attempting to scoop up the company at a discount from what Musk offered.\n\nIn a regulatory filing this week, Twitter said its board had considered whether to reach out to other companies about a potential acquisition. It opted not to because Musk’s offer had been publicly disclosed and because “other parties were unlikely to have the interest in, or capability to, acquire Twitter … based on the regulatory, financing and other execution risks applicable to each party discussed.”\n\nThose unknowns risk adding to the apparent chaos and uncertainty already generated by Musk’s takeover inside Twitter.\n\n“If I’m an employee right now, I’m probably throwing my resume around, looking around for new jobs,” said Angelo Zino, senior industry analyst at CFRA research. “In a situation like this, you could potentially lose some great talent.”\n\nIn fact, Twitter already has. The company confirmed to CNN Business this week that three senior employees have left the company. Twitter also said last week it had implemented a partial hiring freeze and parted ways with two longtime executives: general manager of consumer Kayvon Beykpour, and revenue product lead Bruce Falck.\n\nAgrawal addressed on Twitter last week why a “‘lame duck’ CEO would make these changes if we’re getting acquired anyway” and the difficult state of the tech industry that the company is navigating.\n\n“While I expect the deal to close, we need to be prepared for all scenarios and always do what’s right for Twitter,” he said. “Regardless of the company’s future ownership, we’re here improving Twitter as a product and business for customers, partners, shareholders, and all of you. … Our industry is in a very challenging macro environment – right now. I won’t use the deal as an excuse to avoid making important decisions for the health of the company, nor will any leader at Twitter.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Catherine Thorbecke", "Clare Duffy", "Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/04/03/wisconsin-supreme-court-elections-winners-and-losers/82773286007/", "title": "Bice: Fate of humanity?

He was the first foreign leader to visit the president-elect at Mar-A-Lago after the November election.\n\nTrump's top British political ally, Nigel Farage, will also attend the inauguration, he recently confirmed to USA TODAY. Farage, the leader of the Reform U.K. political party, will jet into Washington despite his very public spat in recent weeks with Elon Musk, a tech billionaire who has become tightly embedded in Trump's entourage.\n\nMilei's attendance is historically significant. It breaks with an American political tradition that has kept foreign heads of state away from participating in the American transfer of power. The U.S. Department of State says that no serving, foreign leader has ever attended a U.S. presidential inauguration.\n\nTrump has invited several sitting heads of state and government, and at least one former leader, to attend his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nThe soon-to-be president has offered tickets to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was recently indicted for allegedly launching a Jan. 6-style coup attempt after losing his 2022 bid for reelection.\n\nMeloni could not be reached for comment. A spokesperson for Orban did not respond to multiple inquiries. Zelenskyy said this week that he expects to meet with Trump after the inauguration. A representative for the Salvadoran government could not immediately be reached.\n\nChina's foreign ministry announced Friday that it would send Vice President Han Zheng in Xi's place.\n\nTrump said in a social media post later on Friday that he spoke to Xi on the phone. \"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately. We discussed balancing Trade, Fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects,\" Trump said.\n\nMilei has been Argentina's leader since December 2023.

Trump will be reinstated,” Musk tweeted Saturday night. “Vox Populi, Vox Dei,” Latin for “the voice of the people is the voice of God.”\n\nThe final poll results on Saturday night showed 51.8% in favor and 48.2% opposed. The poll included 15 million votes.\n\nThe much-anticipated decision from the new owner sets the stage for the former president’s return to the social media platform, where he was previously its most influential, if controversial, user. With almost 90 million followers, his tweets often moved the markets, set the news cycle and drove the agenda in Washington.\n\nTrump has previously said he would remain on his platform, Truth Social, instead of rejoining Twitter, but a change in his approach could hold major political implications. The former president announced this month that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, aiming to become only the second commander in chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms.\n\nAsked on Saturday what he thought of Musk purchasing Twitter and his own future on the platform, Trump praised Musk but questioned whether the site would survive its current crises.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what Trump said about possibly returning to Twitter 02:10 - Source: CNN Hear what Trump said about possibly returning to Twitter 02:10\n\n“They have a lot of problems,” Trump said in Las Vegas at the Republican Jewish Coalition meeting. “You see what’s going on. It may make it, it may not make it.”\n\nStill, Trump said he liked Musk and “liked that he bought (Twitter.)”\n\n“He’s a character and I tend to like characters,” the former president said of Musk. “But he’s smart.”\n\nThroughout Trump’s White House tenure, Twitter was central to his presidency, a fact that also benefited the company in the form of countless hours of user engagement. Twitter often took a light-touch approach to moderating his account, arguing at times that as a public official, the then-president must be given wide latitude to speak.\n\nBut as Trump neared the end of his term – and increasingly tweeted misinformation alleging election fraud – the balance shifted. The company began applying warning labels to his tweets in an attempt to correct his misleading claims ahead of the 2020 presidential election. And following the US Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, the platform banned him indefinitely.\n\n“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said at the time. “In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action.”\n\nThe decision followed two tweets by Trump that, according to Twitter, violated the company’s policy against glorification of violence. The tweets, Twitter said at the time, “must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks.”\n\nThe first tweet – a statement about Trump’s supporters, who he called “75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me” – suggested that “he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election,” Twitter had said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump's dilemma: Truth Social or Twitter? 05:11 - Source: CNN Trump's dilemma: Truth Social or Twitter? 05:11\n\nThe second, which indicated he did not plan to attend Joe Biden’s inauguration, could be viewed as a further statement that the election was not legitimate and could be interpreted as Trump saying that the inauguration would be a “safe” target for violence because he would not be attending, according to Twitter.\n\nFollowing Musk’s decision, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming suggested on Twitter that “it’s a good time to watch” a public hearing held earlier this year by the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack.\n\n“It covers each of Trump’s tweets that day, including those that have been deleted, and features multiple Trump (White House) staff describing his inexcusable conduct during the violence,” Cheney, a notable Trump critic who serves on the select committee, tweeted Saturday.\n\nSoon after Trump’s Twitter ban, he was also restricted from Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, which could also restore his accounts as soon as January 2023.\n\nOn November 18, Musk tweeted that he had reinstated several controversial accounts on the platform, but that a “Trump decision has not yet been made.”\n\n“New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach,” he said at the time. “Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted & demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter. You won’t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out, which is no different from rest of Internet.”\n\nMusk had previously said he disagreed with Twitter’s permanent ban policy and could also return other accounts that had been removed from the platform for repeated rules violations.\n\n“I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump; I think that was a mistake,” Musk said at a conference in May, pledging to reverse the ban were he to become the company’s owner.\n\nJack Dorsey, who was the CEO of Twitter when the company banned Trump but has since left, responded to Musk’s comments saying he agreed that there should not be permanent bans. Banning the former president, he said, was a “business decision” and it “shouldn’t have been.”\n\nThe Trump decision is the latest in a series of major changes Musk has made at Twitter, including pushing out its top leadership and a significant portion of its staff.\n\nMusk also launched an updated subscription service allowing users to pay to receive verification checkmarks, an indicator previously reserved for authenticated public figures, which was quickly abused and used to impersonate prominent people, businesses and government agencies. Twitter paused the service and plans to reinstate it later this month.\n\nAnd on Friday, he said he would restore the accounts of three controversial, previously banned or suspended users: Canadian podcaster Jordan Peterson, right-leaning satire website Babylon Bee and comedian Kathy Griffin.\n\nThe chaos has scared off many of Twitter’s major advertisers, who are wary of having their ads run alongside potentially objectionable content, threatening the company’s core business model. Macy’s, Volkswagen Group, General Mills and other large brands have all paused advertising, causing what Musk called earlier this month “a massive drop in revenue.” And restoring Trump to the platform is unlikely to help.\n\nNAACP President Derrick Johnson called on advertisers still funding Twitter to immediately stop all ad buys.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Will Twitter advertiser dollars affect Musk's promise to Trump? 02:05 - Source: CNN Will Twitter advertiser dollars affect Musk's promise to Trump? 02:05\n\n“In Elon Musk’s Twittersphere, you can incite an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which led to the deaths of multiple people, and still be allowed to spew hate speech and violent conspiracies on his platform,” Johnson said in a statement. “If Elon Musk continues to run Twitter like this, using garbage polls that do not represent the American people and the needs of our democracy, God help us all.”\n\nIn an apparent effort to reassure advertisers and users, Musk previously said he would implement a “content moderation council” to help set policies, and that no major content moderation decisions would be made before it was in place. There is no indication that such a group was involved in the move to restore Trump nor the other users who were returned to the platform on Friday.\n\nIn an op-ed published in the New York Times Friday, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety Yoel Roth, who left the company last week, said that despite the billionaire’s promises to involve others in key decisions, “Mr. Musk has made clear that at the end of the day, he’ll be the one calling the shots.”\n\nAny surge in traffic on Twitter due to Trump’s reinstatement could also put a technical strain on the platform that would coincide with the World Cup, which is typically one of the biggest audience events on the site.\n\n“Twitter servers being out [put] through quite the stress test by @elonmusk right now,” Sriram Krishnan, an investor who is assisting as part of Musk’s Twitter leadership team, tweeted Saturday night.\n\nMass worker exits at the company had prompted users, as well as some employees, to question whether the platform could face outages or other issues.

Trump on Friday said he would impose “reciprocal” tariffs that would affect all countries.\n\nTrump described the “reciprocal” approach as tariffs that would be applied to imports from other countries if they place tariffs on U.S. exports. “If they charge us, we charge them,” Trump said.\n\nLast week, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, only to hold off on the tariffs after leaders of both countries agreed on efforts to reenforce their borders with the U.S.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nCBS poll finds 53% approval rating for Trump\n\nLess than one month into Trump’s second presidency, 7 in 10 Americans say he is following through on his campaign promises, according to a new CBS News/YouGov survey.\n\nWith a 53% job approval rating, the poll of 2,175 U.S. adults found Trump draws overall majority support for some of his actions on immigration and the war in Gaza. But 66% say he hasn’t focused enough on lowering prices, and most Americans don’t approve of new tariffs except on goods from China.\n\nAbout 60% agree with Trump’s program to deport unauthorized immigrants and with sending troops to the southern border, the poll found. But a slight majority of respondents oppose holding people in mass detention centers while authorities determine who should be deported.\n\nTrump’s newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which he has tapped tech billionaire Elon Musk to head, draws mixed support. Nearly a third of respondents say Musk and DOGE should have zero influence on government operations and spending, while 23% say they should have “a lot” of influence. Support for DOGE is driven by Republicans, the poll found.\n\n- Minnah Arshad\n\nTrump says he trusts Elon Musk to cut spending\n\nTrump told Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that he trusts Elon Musk, his head of the Department of Government Efficiency, to find ways to cut federal spending and will turn the spotlight on the Education Department and the Pentagon next.\n\nMusk has been criticized for sending staffers to gather sensitive information at government agencies and he blocked temporarily in court from gaining access to secure systems at the Treasury Department. But Trump said he asked Musk for the help and will ask him to review Education and Defense next.\n\n“I've had a great help with Elon Musk, who's been terrific,” Trump told Bret Baier of Fox News. “Trust Elon? Oh, he's not gaining anything. In fact, I wonder how he can devote the time to it. He's so into it. But I told him do that.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump disagreed with court blocking Musk access to Treasury\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Fox News he has to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, so it was a mistake for a federal judge to block Elon Musk’s access to Treasury Department systems looking for problems.\n\n“I disagree with it 100%,” Trump told Bret Baier of the ruling. “I think it’s crazy.”\n\nTrump argued that hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on the wrong priorities. He said he would move funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development to the State Department, for example.\n\n“I think I’d rather give it to Marco Rubio over at the State Department, let him take care of the few good” programs, Trump said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump doubles down on desire to annex Canada\n\nDuring an interview with Fox, Baier asked Trump whether his desire to make Canada the 51st state was real.\n\nTrump reaffirmed that, saying: “We lose 200 billion dollars a year with Canada and I'm not gonna let that happen.\"\n\nCanada would “be much better off being a 51st state,” he said. “Why are we paying 200 billion dollars a year essentially in subsidy to Canada? Now, if they’re a 51st state I don't mind doing it.”\n\n- Minnah Arshad\n\nTrump says Canada, Mexico must take action to avoid tariffs\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Fox News he “got a lot of good action” from Canada and Mexico on border security after ordering 25% tariffs on goods from those countries, which he paused for 30 days, but he said more action was necessary.\n\n“No, it’s not good enough,” Trump told Bret Baier.\n\nTrump complained about a $200 billion U.S. trade deficit with Canada and a $350 billion trade deficit with Mexico that he said he wouldn’t allow to continue.\n\n“Something has to happen,” Trump said. “It’s not sustainable.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says 'just something special' about his dance at rallies\n\nOn a lighter note during the Fox News interview, Bret Baier asked President Donald Trump what he thought about UFC fighters and NFL players imitating his swaying and arm-waving dance from his political rallies.\n\nTrump often danced to the Village People’s “YMCA” at the end of his rallies. While perhaps not the same cultural touchstone as John Travolta’s dancing in “Saturday Night Fever,” the dance caught on among Trump’s followers.\n\n“I don't know what it is,” Trump said. “I try and walk off sometimes without dancing, and I can't but I have to dance because it's just that something special about it.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security promotes safety at Super Bowl\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security promoted a video on social media about safety measures it is taking to protect 100,000 people visiting New Orleans for the Super Bowl.\n\nSecurity has been enhanced in the weeks since a follower of ISIS drove a truck through a Bourbon Street crowd on New Year’s Day, killing 14 people and forcing a one-day postponement of the college Sugar Bowl in the same stadium, Caesars Superdome.\n\n“We have a big event coming on Sunday and we are committed to having a safe environment for everyone that attends,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in the video.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nSecret Service recruits at Super Bowl\n\nA Secret Service recruitment video to be played on the jumbotron during the big game chronicles how the agency has protected “the most important people and events” since 1901, including Super Bowl LIX.\n\nThe one-minute video features inspirational speeches from former Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. The video also has darker themes, including the assassination attempts against Reagan and President Donald Trump, and the terrorist hijackings Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n“America’s Secret Service protecting the Super Bowl is asking a few more to step forward,” the video said in closing.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump joins Super Bowl for ‘patriotic values’\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued a statement he was looking forward to joining fans at the Super Bowl for the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles for a sense of national unity and patriotism.\n\n“The coaches, players, and team staff on the field tonight represent the best of the best in professional football, but they also embody the best of the American Dream,” Trump said.\n\nTrump noted the 14 deaths and 35 injuries from the “senseless” truck attack in New Orleans on New Year’s Day. He said the football game provides an annual opportunity to transcend differences and strengthen communities.\n\n“This annual tradition transcends our differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family, faith, and freedom heroically defended by our military service members, law enforcement officers, and first responders,” Trump said. “We value their devotion to protecting our great Nation and salute their selfless service.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump is commander in chief but didn't serve in military\n\nPresident Donald Trump is commander in chief of the military by virtue of his office, but he never served in the military.\n\nTrump received five deferments from the draft for military service during the Vietnam War. He received four educational deferments while he was a college student and a fifth deferment in 1968 for a medical exemption after he graduated, for a bone spurs in his heel.\n\nDuring an interview with NBC News in 1999, Trump went into detail about the war and him not serving.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump golfs with Tiger Woods\n\nAhead of the Super Bowl Sunday night, the president played golf with professional golfer Tiger Woods, according to pool reports.\n\nThe acclaimed golfer was spotted on the green with the president at Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach, Florida, Sunday morning.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTrump's travels prevent basketball coach from attending\n\nSouth Carolina women's basketball coach and Eagles fan Dawn Staley planned to attend Super Bowl 59, but said she can't anymore because of flight restrictions due to Trump's arrival.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration puts flight restrictions in place when the president is traveling, and on Friday officially confirmed the temporary flight restrictions for New Orleans from 3:45-5 p.m. ET and 10:15-midnight on Sunday.\n\n– Lulu Kesin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/13/trump-cabinet-positions-rubio-gaetz-gabbard/76267843007/", "title": "Donald Trump Cabinet picks: Matt Gaetz, Marco Rubio among the ...", "text": "Editor's note: Follow along here for the latest updates on Trump's Cabinet.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump continues to round out his new administration, revealing more positions on Wednesday.\n\nAfter meeting President Joe Biden at the White House to discuss the transition of power, he confirmed nominations for several key allies joining his Cabinet, including U.S. Sen.

We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!\"\n\nTrump earlier dismissed a World Health Organization report estimating the death rate at 3.4%, telling Fox News that people with mild symptoms don't get tested and thus skew the data. That issue is frequently raised by health officials estimating the lethality of the outbreak. Trump estimated the true rate at less than 1%.\n\nTennessee, reeling from tornado, now has virus case\n\nTennessee, still recovering from a series of tornadoes and storms that killed 25 people and destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses, now is faced with its first case of coronavirus. Gov. Bill Lee announced the first confirmed case in the state. The patient, a 44-year-old Williamson County man with a recent history of out-of-state travel, is currently quarantined at home with mild symptoms, the Tennessee Department of Health said.\n\n\"We prepared early,\" Lee said. \"We continue to remain confident in our ability and in the measures we are taking to prevent the spread of this infection.\"\n\n– Brett Kelman and Joel Ebert, Nashville Tennessean\n\nAirlines could lose $113 billion in revenue\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak could cost airlines up to $113 billion in 2020 global revenue, The International Air Transport Association estimated. IATA said losses would reach at least $63 billion even if COVID-19 is contained in current markets.\n\n“The turn of events as a result of COVID-19 is almost without precedent,\" CEO Alexandre de Juniac said. \"In little over two months, the industry’s prospects in much of the world have taken a dramatic turn for the worse.\"\n\nSouthwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly said the nation's largest domestic carrier has seen a \"very noticeable, precipitous decline in bookings'' in the past week, a decline that continues daily. The plunge in new bookings has a \"9/11 like feel,'' Kelly said in an interview with CNBC.

Officials also have set up checkpoints to limit travel between major cities.Tehran announced that all the city’s public places, including the metro trains and buses, are being disinfected hourly.\n\nHow many cases of coronavirus in the US, and where?\n\nThere were at least 215 confirmed cases as of Thursday afternoon, according to a coronavirus dashboard run by Johns Hopkins University. That number is expected to rise, as the CDC has expanded its testing efforts and encouraged more testing at health centers across the country. Common signs of infection include fever, cough and breathing difficulties. If the infection worsens, it can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death.\n\nWhat's the worldwide coronavirus death toll?\n\nThe global death toll was at least 3,383 Thursday afternoon, with more than 2,900 in mainland China, where the outbreak began in the bustling capital of the country's Hubei province, Wuhan.

We couldn’t have asked for better partners.”\n\nThe Black Cat Cave joins another location in Rutherford County with the discovery of past Native American life at a camp in Eagleville, according to a March 4 DNJ article.\n\nThe remains of that camp were uncovered last summer by then-MTSU professor Tanya Peres and her archaeological field school for MTSU students at the Magnolia Valley equestrian farm in Eagleville.\n\n“People were here. This was more than just scraping by,” Peres said during a monthly meeting of the Rutherford County Archaeological Society, according to the artcicle.\n\nIt has been long believed that few humans lived in Rutherford County prior to European contact, Peres said in the previous article.\n\nWhen it comes to the Black Cat Cave, a public-private partnership to protect and preserve the archaeological site has resulted in an innovative gate system to prohibit public access to the property, the city press release states. The new cave gate consists of steel columns supporting horizontal bars spaced approximately 5 inches apart.\n\nThe design balances cave security with biological transparency, an important part of the design because it allows air and water exchange in the cave system as well as habitat for cave-dwelling species.\n\n“We recognize, with the help of our MTSU partners, that Black Cat Cave is a cultural resource that must be preserved,” Murfreesboro Parks and Recreation Director Lanny Goodwin said in the press release. “We appreciate the work of the university’s scholars and students, as well as the engineering firm Griggs & Maloney to preserve and protect this newly found evidence of prehistory.”\n\nGriggs & Maloney Inc., a Murfreesboro engineering and environmental consulting firm, teamed up with the city of Murfreesboro Parks & Recreation Department, the MTSU department of sociology and anthropology and Rollins Excavating Company to plan, design and construct the new gate system. The Native History Association also participated in the planning.\n\nThe cave’s entrances had been closed and fenced by the city due to the vandalism and potential liability for injuries. A man-made concrete floor had covered-up the natural cave flooring. Until last year’s vandalism drew its attention, the city had no knowledge of any evidence of prehistoric or ancient activities within the cave.\n\nThe city partnered with Aaron Deter-Wolf, a prehistoric archaeologist with the Tennessee Division of Archeaology, and MTSU’s Hodge and Peres.\n\nPeres and Hodge directed the team of MTSU student volunteers to do the study, with their work including cleanup of garbage and an assessment of the damage done to the natural cave walls and cultural features.\n\nPeres, who recently left MTSU to take a position at Florida State University, was able to radiocarbon date charcoal samples from the site with funds from a Tennessee Historical Commission grant, states the press release.\n\n“The ultimate goal is to protect this Native American site from future episodes of vandalism and looting, while gaining important archaeological information to better understand the long-term use of the cave by various groups that lived in Rutherford County,” Peres said in the press release\n\nTraditionally, historians and archaeologists believed that for thousands of years much of Rutherford County was a “no-man’s-land” between neighboring groups, used simply as a hunting ground. But this site proves that prehistoric people lived and thrived in the rich environment and abundant natural resources in the county, Hodge said.\n\nIn its natural state, Black Cat Cave had a 5- to 6-foot limestone shelf which formed a horizontal opening, approximately 120 feet in length. During more modern history, the cave’s opening was barricaded with boulders and a failing, aged fence for safety. The boulders and fence have been removed and replaced with the new design.\n\nGriggs & Maloney Vice President Ryan Maloney said the new gate system is designed to protect cultural and natural resources and “prevent public access to a potentially hazardous environment.” The new gate system includes a “heavy duty, hinged opening” that will allow future archaeological study, Maloney added.\n\nIn addition to modern artifacts, including glass fragments from the cave’s speakeasy days, the 2014 dig and screening uncovered stone artifacts and other evidence from the Middle Archaic Period dating back more than 5,000 years. The evidence includes ancient remains of freshwater mussel and snail shells brought into the cave, and discolored soil layers, which are evidence of human activity such as a hearth for a fire.\n\n“Despite previous historical writings to the contrary, this new evidence shows that people lived in what is now Rutherford County for thousands of years,” Peres said in the release. “This is a rich prehistoric cultural past in Rutherford County that we are just beginning to understand.”\n\nPeres has studied other prehistoric sites in Rutherford County, including what is known as the Magnolia Valley Site in the southwestern corner of the county. The site at Black Cat Cave will help tell part of the story of prehistoric occupation in the area and could expand understanding of how Rutherford County was used by prehistoric people.\n\n“As archaeologists, one major focus is to preserve these resources not only for us, but for people who are going to come a decade, a hundred or a thousand years after us,” Hodge said in the press release. “We want them to be able to know as much and gain even more.”\n\nStudy of evidence found in the cave by the MTSU team is ongoing.\n\nContact Scott Broden at 615-278-5158.

Tom Wolf issued his order to shut down indoor dining across the commonwealth, and the impact on industry workers is already palpable, especially in light of the rapidly-approaching holidays.\n\nWolf’s directive, one of several mitigation efforts put into effect on Dec. 12, dealt a substantial blow to the already heavily impacted world of restaurants and bars in Pennsylvania. While outdoor dining, food and alcohol takeout still are permitted, thousands of servers, hosts and hostesses, bartenders and other employees have found themselves unemployed or severely underemployed.\n\nDustie Heller has been a server at Barley Creek Brewing Company in Tannersville for four years, and usually makes what she considers a great income. Now, she works only about a quarter of the hours she previously did.\n\n“This week, I haven’t worked since Sunday,” Heller said.\n\nRob Sinchak, a cook/manager at the Tick Tock Café in Ambridge and the Penn Avenue Pub in Monaca, is feeling the same pain. Between the two eateries, Sinchak was normally able to rack up between 45 and 55 hours a week while also playing bass for award-winning blues band Bobby Thompson & The Groove and the country group Justin Wade Band.\n\n“Once we were forced to do takeout only, my hours changed to about 30 a week, then 20 a week, and now we're shut down entirely at Tick Tock, so I'm getting zero hours a week. And we're only doing takeout at Penn Ave Pub,” Sinchak said.\n\nPennsylvania’s restaurant and hospitality industries have traditionally been reliable sources of income, and a major part of the commonwealth’s economy.\n\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry, food preparation and serving related occupations accounted for 509,330 jobs in Pennsylvania in May 2019 – the fourth largest field in the entire commonwealth. In fact, over the past decade, labor and hospitality across Pennsylvania had been growing year over year to the point that the there just weren’t enough employees.\n\nAs of November 2020, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 14.6% unemployment rate in the accommodation and food services sector. While that is an improvement over previous months – in August, it was a 20% unemployment rate – December’s job losses are yet to be determined, and could potentially surpass the 2020 high of 37.3% in April, near the peak of the pandemic.\n\nAnd while many workers have been able to hold on to their positions, even in a diminished capacity, early predictions for staff cuts across the state are especially concerning.\n\nJohn Longstreet, president of the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association, said that in a recent survey of 1,546 restaurants — about 5.8% of the states total eateries — owners stated that they were likely to end up laying off a total of 26,250 employees from their establishments. If those predictions hold up across the state, job losses in the industry would be beyond catastrophic.\n\n“I think the first thing (restaurateurs) think about is their employees, because they’re like their families,” Longstreet said, adding that the decision to cut staff is often a heartbreaking task for both the employee and the employer.\n\nWhile restaurant workers' hours and income have dropped significantly, financial obligations have remained consistent, and in some cases are due to increase.\n\n“My rent is going up next month, I have health insurance to pay for, Christmas for my nieces – it’s definitely made a huge impact on my income,” Heller said.\n\nStaying afloat\n\nFor Daniel Fry, a bartender and server at Villa Capri in Doylestown, the uncertainty is what’s most challenging, along with the constant mandates that continue to become more restrictive to restaurants despite all the safeguards they have in place.\n\nThe Friday before new indoor dining ban went into effect, Fry took home $200. On Saturday, he earned only $30.\n\nFortunately, Fry hasn’t lost his job. Restaurant owner Matt Mannino has found other duties for him, taking orders over the phone for take-out meals, delivering meals and crafting “to go” cocktails. One of his specialties is the Blackberry Jam, an $11 blackberry, ginger and vodka cocktail.\n\n“Right now, we are slowly making ends meet, but if restrictions continue, financially and mentally, it will become even more challenging,” said Fry, who is grateful that customers continue to come out for outside dining. But he knows he can’t expect the patio to remain busy all winter. “No one wants to be outside when it’s 20 degrees.”\n\nLisa Walters, a server who has worked on and off at The Perk in Perkasie for two decades, used to work two or three shifts a week, which effectively supplemented her husband’s income to help keep their budget balanced.\n\nBut ever since the indoor dining ban ended up cutting shifts at The Perk, Walters has had to tighten her purse strings.\n\n“On a personal level, my tips would cover our household utility bills and grocery costs,” Walters said. “My husband and I had to significantly reign in our budget and plan off of his income alone, once my shifts were no longer available. Each month we are pulling more and more from our savings accounts.\n\n\"With my situation, I am staying afloat, but that is only because I live in a two-partner household.”\n\nLianna Weir of Franklin Borough in Cambria County was working at four different establishments before Wolf’s dine-in shutdown. She’s down to just one gig, and expecting her monthly income to be less than half of what it was.\n\n“I’m kind of lucky because I live by myself,” the 32-year-old said. “But there are people with families.”\n\nWeir has been in the restaurant industry, off and on, for the past 14 years. She went back into it this year after being laid off by the CPV Fairview natural gas power plant late last year.\n\nPrevious experience with the commonwealth’s unemployment system has Weir dreading what comes next.\n\nIn 2019 she filed for unemployment on Black Friday. The money didn’t arrive until New Year’s Eve.\n\n“This is the first time since I’ve been an adult that I’m going to work and (concerned) I’m not going to be able to pay my rent,” Weir said. “It’s the first time I’m really worried about not being able to pay my bills.”\n\nWaiting for help\n\nWeir is not along in being concerned about how she'll be able to make it through the pandemic, let alone the remainder of the month, and it does not appear as if government assistance is anywhere close to coming to fruition.\n\nThe bi-partisan RESTAURANTS Act, a $120 billion relief package for the industry introduced by Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and Sens. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Arizona — continues to garner support but remains at a standstill in Washington. State funding for restaurant workers and owners starts and stops with the CARES Act, which runs out at the end of the year.\n\nBrandi Mikos, a server who has worked in the industry for 26 years, and at Luciano's in White Oak for the past 18 years, feels that targeted assistance is a necessity for the restaurant and hospitality industry.\n\n\"I make $84 a week [on unemployment], my bills are $1,800,\" Mikos, a single mother of two, said. \"There's no relief. No extra stimulus ... they just shut us down. If you’re going to shut us down, then do something to pay us.”\n\nMikos launched an effort herself to help out fellow workers, Pennsylvania's \"Adopt-a-Server\" Facebook page. Since the page launched after Thanksgiving, it grew from a little over a hundred members to now over 3,500.\n\nService industry workers can post on the page requesting some form of relief, and the page mostly has turned into a holiday relief fund, Mikos said. Most members have had helped with their Amazon wish list or ensuring that they have Christmas gifts for their children as thousands of restaurant workers across the state are on hiatus until January.\n\n“I hope this is somehow, someway a blessing because right now your mind is worrying. You’re always worrying,\" Mikos said.\n\nOther industry workers across the commonwealth have launched their own assistance programs as well.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Kacy McGill helped launch the Pittsburgh Restaurant Workers Aid (PRWA).\n\nSince its inception in April the group has helped deliver care packages and meals to over 1,500 households throughout Allegheny County — all for hospitality workers in need or out of work. The group continues to deliver approximately 100 care packages weekly.\n\nMcGill acknowledged that the nonprofit was preparing for some additional restrictions this month, but that doesn't make the challenge any less daunting.\n\n“We're still not prepared as an industry to go through this,\" they said. \"I’m in a position to choose my car bill, hospital bill, groceries or put gas in my tank.\"\n\nMcGill, who has worked at several notable Pittsburgh eateries including The Abbey, Bar Marco and Legume, said the industry as a whole has to pull together in order to get through this.\n\nThe PRWA is partnering with Pittsburgh's US Bartenders Guild chapter for a holiday drive this month along with additional projects with the city's Restaurant Opportunity Center chapter; and while McGill is happy their team can offer some aid this time of the year, they understand cities such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia are better situated for such quick organized responses.\n\nMcGill is aware of Mikos' \"Adopt-a-Server\" program and was supportive of the initiative but characterized it as a \"bridge\" program. It's a reactive solution — not unlike the PRWA — that can lessen the damage for the short term, but government aid needs to be on the agenda.\n\n\"We shouldn’t have to do this,\" McGill said. \"We shouldn’t have to put together an organization to solve state and federal problems.\"\n\nBack to work?\n\nWhile restaurant and hospitality workers would be happy to take some assistance from the government to make ends meet, most are actually more interested in getting back to their jobs and earning their keep themselves.\n\n“I want to be clear that we want to physically work and offer our services to the community,” Walter, said. “We are hopeful for the day when our dining room can be packed again.”\n\nHeller looks forward to a similar future, and hopes that once business returns to some semblance of normality, things will improve. In the meantime, she won’t be giving up on serving, even if the shifts have shortened and the pay has plummeted.\n\n“I’m going to stick with the industry,” Heller said. “I think we’ll be back to where we were, hopefully sooner rather than later. It’s not an occupation that I’m looking to change though.”\n\nWhile the future remains uncertain, and further challenges may yet come, restaurant and hospitality workers at places like Barley Creek are striving to support one another in any way possible, financially, emotionally or otherwise. Being the backbone of many communities’ economies in the commonwealth, these servers, bartenders and other workers are fighting for a future.\n\n“It’s tough, but we’re in an industry where we work hard, and I think that we’re going to be OK,” Heller said.\n\nThe Intelligencer/Bucks County Courier Times reporter Marion Callahan, Our Town editor Bruce Siwy and The Times entertainment editor Scott Tady contributed to this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/03/06/coronavirus-grand-princess-cruise-passengers-what-we-know/4972973002/", "title": "Coronavirus: Grand Princess cruise has 21 positive cases, will dock", "text": "Vice President Mike Pence said Friday that the Princess Cruises' Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California will dock this weekend in a “non-commercial port,” and that all passengers and crew will be tested for the coronavirus.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Friday evening, Pence said that 46 people aboard the ship had been swabbed.

Just as life happens in cities for good and for bad, life also happens onboard our ships,\" Princess Cruises' president Jan Swartz said in a video posted to Twitter Friday morning.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, coronavirus had infected more than 101,000 people globally and killed 3,460 according to Johns Hopkins data.\n\nPresident Trump says White House is involved\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told reporters Friday in the White House's Diplomatic Room that he spoke to Newsom about the Grand Princess being held off the coast of California.\n\n“We had a good conversation; we’re both working on the ship together,” he said of his conversation with Newsom. “It’s close to 5,000 people, so big ship. We’re doing testing on those people.”\n\nThere are 2,422 passengers and 1,111 crew representing 54 nationalities currently sailing on the Grand Princess for its Hawaii voyage, according to the cruise line.\n\n“We have big news on the ship. A lot of things are happening on the ship,” Trump said during a signing ceremony for the $8.3-billion spending package to combat the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\"It's a big decision because we have very low numbers compared to major countries throughout the world,\" he said of how to deal with the cruise ship. \"Our numbers are lower than just about anybody.\"\n\nWhen will people on the cruise ship disembark and where?\n\nWhile the ship was meant to arrive to port in San Francisco, it is is unclear which “non-commercial port” Pence was referring to when he said the ship would dock this weekend.\n\nThe office of the Mayor of San Francisco said in a statement Thursday that the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are determining a location that \"can most appropriately address the health of those passengers that may have COVID-19 and the safety of those passengers not impacted, as well as the surrounding community.\"\n\nHow were the coronavirus tests administered?\n\nA military helicopter lowered test kits onto the 951-foot (290-meter) Grand Princess by rope Thursday as the vessel lay at anchor off the coast of San Francisco.\n\nKailee Higgins Ott, a passenger on Grand Princess from California, who is 17, told USA TODAY that she's not worried about herself. \"But I’m worried because we made friends with some older folks on the cruise,\" she said. \"I’m worried about them and the crew members.\"\n\nUpon hearing the news that 21 people had tested positive on board for coronavirus, she said she was \"kind of annoyed with the cruise line that they didn’t announce anything and we had to hear it from the news. I’m scared about missing school and all the uncertainties. We don’t know anything that’s happening with us yet.\"\n\nAcross the hall from Higgins Ott's state room, some guests were being tested. The medical team was wearing white masks over their mouths with a clear face mask cover. Their bodies were fully covered and they were wearing gloves.\n\n\"The test took place in the room,\" she said. \"There’s about five medical people that helped with the testing.\"\n\nA baby was being tested, too. She heard that test would take longer to conduct than the others.\n\nWhat's it like for those on the ship?\n\nWhile confined in their rooms, guests will receive all meals by room service. Extra television and movie options have been added to programming in each state room, and guests have been given complimentary internet service – the ship’s bandwidth has been increased, according to the cruise line.\n\nGreg and Susan White, from Fort Collins, Colorado, are on board and weren't surprised to hear that they were being confined to their rooms when the announcement came.\n\nBefore they were directed to stay in their staterooms, they said there was a lot of \"gallows humor,\" but that everyone understood the need to isolate.\n\n\"Personally, this did not surprise me because I was on business travel some 2,000 miles from home on Sept. 11 and saw pretty much the same thing,\" White said in an email to the Coloradoan, which is part of the USA TODAY Network. \"Virtually everyone cooperated fully, resigned to the fact that there wasn't really anything they could do about it.\"\n\nHiggins Ott said that when passengers were informed they should remain in their staterooms, there was a scramble in the shops and restaurants on board to stock up.\n\n\"There were a lot of people in the lobby, there were a lot of people in the store, getting food and chips,\" Higgins Ott said Thursday as the lunch period was ending. \"People tried to get into the dining rooms, to do last-minute things.\"\n\nIn a video recording obtained by USA TODAY of a Thursday evening announcement from the captain detailed the meal delivery procin addition to an update on the status of testing.\n\n\"The sample collection continues for guests,\" the captain can be heard saying. \"We expect the test results sometime in the near future, as previously advised we anticipate that we will receive the first results tomorrow morning.\"\n\nWhat about for those who disembarked from its Mexico voyage?\n\nA passenger from the Mexico voyage, Judy Cadiz of Lodi said she and her husband Mark became ill following their cruise but did not give it much thought until learning a fellow traveler had died of the virus. Now they cannot get a straight answer about how to get tested, she said.\n\nWith Mark, 65, running a fever, the couple worries not only about themselves, but about the possibility that — if they contracted the infection — they could have passed it on to others.\n\n“They’re telling us to stay home, but nobody told me until yesterday to stay home. We were in Sacramento, we were in Martinez, we were in Oakland. We took a train home from the cruise,” Judy Cadiz said Thursday. “I really hope that we’re negative so nobody got infected.”\n\nThis isn't Princess Cruises' first coronavirus cruise situation\n\nPrincess Cruises also owns the Diamond Princess, the ship that was quarantined in Yokohama, Japan, and experienced a coronavirus outbreak that infected more than 700 passengers.\n\n“We learned a lot from our recent experience in Japan, and we are taking those lessons into account as we continue to support our fleet and our guests,\" Swartz said in the video on Twitter.\n\n“We have been on the frontier of fighting this disease, and we are sharing what we learned with the hospitality and the travel industry.\"\n\nThe Princess Cruises ship was carrying 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew when it set sail and was quarantined after 10 cases of coronavirus were reported Feb. 4. More than 400 Americans were on the cruise ship. The State Department coordinated with the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies to bring some passengers back to the U.S.\n\nAll but a handful of the remaining passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who had been quarantined at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio were released to return home Tuesday. Passengers who had symptoms during the quarantine in Texas and tested positive for coronavirus will remain in isolation.\n\nMeanwhile, Princess Cruises' Sun Princess was met with riots when stopping in port at Réunion Island, located off the southeastern coast of Africa, near Madagascar on Sunday, Princess Cruises confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nThe reason? More concerns over coronavirus. There had not been any cases reported in Réunion as of Wednesday, nor on the ship.\n\nPrincess Cruises said Wednesday that there are no concerns of coronavirus on the ship.\n\n\"We can confirm that there are no cases of COVID-19 onboard Sun Princess. Sun Princess is heading back to Fremantle (Australia) as scheduled with arrival March 10th,\" Princess Cruises said in a statement shared with USA TODAY by spokesperson Alivia Owyoung Ender on Wednesday.\n\nWhat is happening with future Princess Cruises?\n\nPrincess has adjusted its cancellation policy, at least temporarily, to allow people who have booked an upcoming cruise to change their plans. Those who have a cruise booked through May 31, 2020, can make changes to their reservations, the company stated.\n\nContributing: John Fritze, Maureen Groppe,Courtney Subramanian, USA TODAY; The Associated Press; Sady Swanson, Fort Collins Coloradoan; Sam Gross, Reno Gazette Journal", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/10/01/anderson-county-hurricane-helene-south-carolina-trees-roadways-powerlines-emergency-team/75454033007/", "title": "Anderson County continues Hurricane Helene cleanup, what to know", "text": "Anderson County remains in a state of emergency after Hurricane Helene passed through South Carolina last week.\n\nThe storm brought down power lines and numerous trees that blocked 600 county roadways.\n\nLocal authorities, state and federal partners, including the National Guard, Lexington and Horry County public work crews, and emergency response teams, are working tirelessly to clear debris-blocked roads, restore power to affected areas, and assist the injured.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Anderson County Emergency Team, an additional 20% of roads have opened as of Monday night, with approximately 130 still closed. Local authorities have advised residents to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel until all hazards are cleared.\n\nDrivers should be aware of eight impassable streets in Anderson County: Grady Hall, Gray Drive, Coachman Drive, Harbin Road, Old Bell Road, Simpson Road, Colorado Lane, and Pettigrew Road.\n\nAnderson County Sheriff's Office Public Information Officer Shale Remien emphasized the importance of being aware that even if there's a downed tree and a power line, their crews cannot clear the road until the power company has disconnected the line. Once this is done, they can remove the trees from the road.\n\nRemien also mentioned that people may notice many trees scattered across the county on the side of the road, but these will be the last things the crews will address.\n\nDonations in Anderson County\n\nThe Anderson Regional Airport is at Heli Plane Aviation, collecting donations for North Carolina Hurricane relief supply efforts. Multiple helicopters will be loaded later today to help those more severely affected by the storm. Please consider donating to help with this effort.\n\nSuggested items included Non-perishable food, Bottled water, First aid items, Clothes, Hygiene products, a Flashlight, Batteries, Candles, Solar chargers, and Small emergency radios.\n\nBurn Ban Upstate\n\nStarting Tuesday, October 1, the SC Forestry Commission issued a burn ban in Anderson County. Twenty counties impacted the most by the storm, including Anderson, are not allowed to burn remaining wood or debris in unincorporated areas.\n\nSCFC Fire Chief Darryl Jones said, \"We understand people may wonder why a burning ban is necessary when more than half of the state has received so much rain. However, we’re issuing the ban not because of elevated fire danger but rather because so many of our firefighting and emergency personnel and resources are committed to hurricane-related response.” He added, \"This does not include fire for food or outdoor fireplaces.\"\n\nTown of Pendleton roadway cleanup\n\nAccording to Pendleton, a town-wide roadway cleanup is in progress. Crews are removing debris from roads. The town reported that most debris will be cleared within the next few weeks. Residents should know that the town can only collect limbs no more than 6 feet long and 6 inches in diameter.\n\nThe town also reported that they will not pick up anything placed by contractors unless the removal is for elderly residents who need assistance and can not remove full trees. Despite the storm, sanitation services in the Town of Pendleton will run normally. Residents can continue to place their carts out as usual.\n\nHere is a list of roadways that have passage issues or debris.\n\n--Calhoun Street\n\n--Cherry Street at Lebanon Road & South Elm Street\n\n--Chester Circle\n\n--East Main Street at Lebanon Road\n\n--Giles Street\n\n--Hopkins Avenue\n\n--Jackson Street\n\n--Keese Street\n\n--Mechanic Street at Broad moving North\n\n--Morse Street West Side\n\n--Poplar Street at Woodland Circle\n\n--Shannon Drive TCTC side\n\n--Shirley Street\n\n--Stephen's Road\n\n--West Queen Street Streetscape to S Curves\n\n--Westinghouse Road\n\n--Westminster Street 400 block\n\n--Woodland Circle 500 Block.\n\nTown of Williamston debris disposal\n\nThe town of Williamston reported that on Monday, crews began removing storm debris from Hurricane Helene's impact.\n\nHere is the Town of Williamston ordinances for debris disposal:\n\nTree limbs up to 4 inches in diameter should be no longer than 6 feet. Tree limbs over 4 inches in diameter should be no longer than 2 feet. No pile of yard waste shall exceed 4 feet in height and 10 feet in width. If multiple piles are needed, please ensure at least 2 feet of space between each pile.\n\nLarger limbs will be placed in a staging area where folks will be offered the opportunity to cut them up to use as firewood. Keep larger limbs separate from smaller limbs and other yard waste. If you wish to transport your fallen limbs to the debris staging area, please contact Greg Paige at 864-958-6291 between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. to coordinate.\n\nThe town of Williamston plans to pick up garbage on a regular schedule. This will continue as long as sanitation crews can access the landfill.\n\nTown of West Pelzer recovery efforts\n\nAccording to the town of West Pelzer, due to storm damage and the prolonged power outage, the West Pelzer Municipal Center and the O'Dell Community Center will be closed until power is restored. Staff members have limited access to email and phone calls/voicemails, but they continue to work on behalf of the Town and will respond as soon as they can access messages and contacts.\n\nThe town of West Pelzer also reported that Mayor Jim Riddle and Town Administrator Paula Payton have been in regular contact with all available area relief agencies to keep them aware of the storm's effects on West Pelzer and are receiving updates on the progress of the relief efforts for our citizens.\n\nWith these extenuating circumstances, Coffee with a Cop on October 2 and the Council Meeting on October 8 will be postponed. Residents can check the Town of West Pelzer website and Facebook page for an updated schedule.\n\nSCDOT and Duke Energy are working to restore power and clear the roadway and sidewalks for safe use on Main Street/Highway 8. Due to safety concerns for vendors and attendees, the Fall Mile Long Yard Sale scheduled for Saturday has been canceled.\n\nBelton-Honea Path lift boil water advisory\n\nFollowing Hurricane Helene, Belton-Honea Path Water instructed residents to consume boiled tap or bottled water to protect public safety. Consumption included drinking, brushing teeth, making ice, food preparation, washing fruit and vegetables, and preparing baby formula. Customers did not need to boil water before using it for showering or bathing.\n\nThis notice was necessary because flooding negatively affected the water quality entering the water treatment plant so much that they couldn't be 100% certain of its safety. Officials have lifted the boil water advisory for the City of Belton and the Town of Honea Path.\n\nBottled water remains available at Leeda Poore Park for impacted families, with one case per household. Residents can resume using tap water without boiling it first, marking an step towards normalcy as the community recovers.\n\nTown of Iva recovery efforts\n\nAccording to the town of Iva, most downed trees have been cleared from the local roads. West Broad Street remains closed on the west side below Pendley Street. Only residents beyond that point should travel that portion.\n\nResidents without power in their homes who need to charge electronic devices can visit the farmers market in Iva, which has outlets at each column. These outlets are available for phone charging during the day and night.\n\nCases of water are also available at the town hall for anyone without power who needs some. Garbage collection is scheduled for Monday and will be collected on Tuesday, October 1.\n\nCity of Clemson cleanup plan\n\nAccording to the City of Clemson, five crews, both city and contracted, began brush cleanup in affected community areas, following a plan to expedite the cleanup as efficiently as possible. Three additional crews will be brought in tomorrow and placed in every zone.\n\nThe crews are working as quickly as possible while ensuring safety. However, they cannot safely begin cutting trees in or on power lines until Duke Energy can ground them.\n\nThe city of Clemson also reported several groups and organizations have expressed interest in helping clean up neighborhoods. If you need and are interested in receiving help, don't hesitate to get in touch with Lindsey Newton at lnewton@cityofclemson.org\n\nAccording to the city of Anderson. All games/practices held at Nettles Park are canceled on Tuesday, October 1, due to power and water outages. Volleyball games are on as scheduled at Clemson Central Recreation Center. Away game updates will be communicated by team coaches\n\nThe City of Clemson reported that the recycling drop-off at the brush grinding facility on Old Central Road is closed due to the volume of brush and debris being hauled to the facility. Please take your recyclables to the Kite Hill Recycling Center until we reopen.\n\nThe City of Anderson's recovery efforts continue\n\nAccording to the City of Anderson, household garbage crews will finish Monday’s routes and begin Tuesday’s routes. Curbside debris crews are focusing only on vegetative debris pick-up. City crews and teams from SCDOT, Anderson County, Rock Hill, and Horry County are tackling the remaining street closures as utility lines are removed.\n\nThe city asks that residents remember that tree limbs placed at the curb less than 12” inches in diameter must be 5’ or less, and anything greater than 12” in diameter must be less than 2’ in length. Contractors cutting trees for residents are responsible for hauling away the debris they cut.\n\n73,000 people are still without electricity in Anderson\n\nSince Hurricane Helene passed through the Upstate area, many residents still lack electricity, and the lack of access to essential services is causing significant disruption in their daily lives. According to the Anderson County Emergency Team, crews have restored an additional 10% of the community's power, but around 73,000 people are still without electricity.\n\nRiley Morningstar, Blue Ridge Electric Cooperative Communications Manager, said two of the 13 substations that lost transmission service remained offline on Monday due to severe damage.\n\nA statement from Blue Ridge Electric Cooperative on Monday reported that Duke Energy made progress overnight on the remaining transmission lines. They could energize approximately 3,500 members serviced by the Cross Roads and Tygerville substations.\n\nSubstations serving the Bountyland, Corinth, Newry, Six Mile, Dacusville, Gap Hill, Enon, Landrum, Liberty, Marietta, and Pleasant Ridge communities are now online. However, more work must be done for all members to have power. Broken poles must be replaced, and lines must be hung to get power from these substations to homes.\n\nSenior Vice President of Engineering and Operations Mark Waters said, \"we are moving in the right direction. “This will be a slow process, but having service restored back to our substations is very important.”\n\nBlue Ridge Electric Cooperative reported that field workers have confirmed over 450 broken poles across their five-county service area, which spans 1,900 square miles.\n\nAccording to Blue Ridge Electric Cooperative, on average, it takes a four-man crew about three to four hours to replace one broken pole. Replacing three poles in a 12-hour shift is a full day’s work for a single crew. Replacing four is a feat in these circumstances. These are not simple repairs.\n\nDuke Energy's spokesman Ryan Mosier said, \"We are currently assessing damage and making repairs across the Upstate. However, the extensive damage means some customers will experience a multi-day outage.\"\n\n\"Anderson County customers should see their service restored as late as Friday night, but we will see most customers restored well before that,\" Mosier said.\n\nWhat to do if you are still without power?\n\nAs crews assess the situation for outages in the area, residents can receive updated estimated restoration times at duke-energy.com/outagemap . The website also has information on how Duke Energy restores power , generator safety , flooding, electrical safety, and more.\n\nResidents are urged to stay patient and utilize local shelters, charging, and cooling stations if needed.\n\nAnderson County offices and libraries\n\nAnderson County Offices will open on Tuesday, October 1.\n\nThe Powdersville Treasurer’s office will remain closed at this time.\n\nThe Anderson County Library will also be open on Tuesday, October 1, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Due to the continued power outage, all other library locations will remain closed.\n\nResidents are welcome to charge devices, connect to Wi-Fi, and enjoy library materials at Anderson Main, Iva, Pendleton, Piedmont, and Honea Path locations.\n\nAnderson County Schools remain closed on Tuesday and Wednesday\n\nSchools remain closed, adding to the community's challenges during this extensive power outage. Dylan McCullough, public information officer of Anderson County District Three, stated that all Anderson County districts will observe an eLearning Day on Monday, September 30, Tuesday, October 1, and Wednesday, October 2, due to continued widespread power outages.\n\n\"Our schools will be flexible in meeting eLearning Day requirements, as we understand many families still lack access to power or the Internet,\" McCullough said.\n\nThe community is rallying together, with neighbors helping each other and local organizations, churches, schools, and universities providing food, water, and access to essential services. Emergency shelters have been set up for those needing assistance to provide relief for those in need until full power can be restored.\n\nAnderson School District One will open Spearman Elementary School on Tuesday, October 1, for community members to charge their devices. The school will be open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nFlat Rock Elementary and Iva Elementary will be open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for those who need a place to charge devices or cool off temporarily.

Residents also will have access to free lunch, cases of water, ice, power, Wi-Fi, etc. Food will be available from noon to 1 p.m.\n\nAnderson Five will provide meals for anyone 18 years of age or younger on Tuesday, October 1, and Wednesday, October 2, at the following sites: Calhoun Academy, Centerville Elementary, North Pointe Elementary, Varennes Elementary, Whitehall Elementary, and Robert Anderson Middle.\n\nChildren do not have to be Anderson Five students, but per an agreement with the USDA, meals can only be provided to those 18 years of age and younger. Children must also be present to receive the meal. Each site will operate from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.\n\nThe Anderson Mall is also open and equipped with power. On October 1, residents can seek shelter and use essential services to charge their devices. Littlejohn Coliseum will open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. to provide community members with free food, drinks, ice, showers, and charging stations.\n\nClemson University reported. Crews are set up for Meals, Ready-to-Eat (MRE), and water distribution near Clemson University in the P5 parking area adjacent to the National Guard Armory. Community members can drive through and receive allocations today, Tuesday, October 1, from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. or until supplies last.\n\nAnderson County Sheriff's Office Emergency Management team has partnered with Starr Fire Department to provide water for those in our community in need. The water will be in our front parking lot. Residents are allowed to take only one case per household.\n\nAnderson University without power\n\nAccording to Anderson University, most of the campus is currently without power, and there is no clear timeline for its restoration. As a result, all in-person classes, activities, and events are canceled through Wednesday, October 2.\n\nAnderson University Student Center, including the Culinary Center, remains open for student use; all other campus operations are suspended.\n\nMost residence halls are open but remain without electricity.

University officials are reviewing options for playing the game at an alternate location away from areas affected by Hurricane Helene.\n\nHomecoming and Family Weekend activities have also been postponed. Anderson University Homecoming has been rescheduled for Saturday, November 9. However, that date is subject to change. Details are being worked out, and more information will be announced as it becomes available.\n\nAn official announcement will be made when campus electricity is fully restored.\n\nWhat to do with debris or lingering trash?\n\nDebris and lingering trash can be found throughout Anderson County. Neighbors and community members have come together to clear the affected areas.\n\nRemien said \"it really does take a community because, unfortunately, first responders can't be everywhere at the same time when that storm hits.\"\n\nSuppose you need to remove debris or lingering trash from the storm. In that case, these Anderson County Convenience Centers are now open at King David, White Street, Parker Bowie, Starr Landfill, and Anderson Regional MRF. The remaining convenience centers will open as power is restored.\n\nResidents are encouraged to utilize these facilities to help with the cleanup efforts and ensure the community returns to normalcy as quickly as possible.\n\nHurricane Helene damage cleanup\n\nAccording to the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, if you need help with damage cleanup following Hurricane Helene, call Crisis Cleanup at 844-965-1386.\n\nIf there is property damage from Hurricane Helene, report it using the Damage Assessment tool in the SC Emergency Manager app to notify authorities. Download the app from the App Store and Google.\n\nAnMed Health services\n\nSince Helene passed through the area, as roads have been cleared, AnMed reported increased visits to the emergency department. If you or a loved one are experiencing an emergency, call 911.\n\nAccording to Michael Burns, AnMed Health Services Public Relations Coordinator, AnMed urges residents with non-emergency medical needs to visit AnMed CareConnect locations in Anderson and Clemson. They have doubled staff there in response to circumstances, and exceptional care providers are there and ready to serve those in need.\n\n\"Hospital services are operating normally, and elective surgeries are going on as scheduled,\" he said. \"However, our service providers continue to work to restore power and phone connections to a few of our doctors’ offices in outlying areas.\"\n\nPlease check AnMed.org for ongoing updates about practice closures.\n\nPelzer, Urgent Care\n\nAccording to the Town of Pelzer, Urgent Care is open, but it doesn’t have phones. You must go in if you need service.\n\nMedical Needs shelters in Anderson\n\nThe South Carolina Department of Public Health maintains Medical Needs Shelters in Anderson and elsewhere. These emergency shelters provide limited support for qualifying people with medical needs and adult caregivers. Call 1-855-472-3432 to inquire about eligibility for care at Medical Needs Shelters.\n\nIf a public member needs shelter and medical equipment that requires power (oxygen, refrigerated medicines, etc.), please call the Department of Public Health Careline at 1-855-472-3432 to be triaged in a Medical Needs Shelter.\n\nFree food distribution event\n\nMany residents faced power outages due to Hurricane Helene's impact, and families around the county lost food that went bad. If you were affected, consider attending the Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina this Friday, October 4, from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. at the Anderson Jockey Lot in Belton.\n\nAnderson food distribution is every first Friday, and Abbeville is every second Friday.

Visit the link below to see the steps you can take.\n\nTravis Rose covers Anderson County for the Independent Mail. Reach him via email at trose@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/08/05/local-fire-departments-find-struggle-recruitment/495704001/", "title": "Local fire departments find struggle in recruitment", "text": "BATAVIA - There were times when the chief of this tiny hamlet’s volunteer fire department would show up to emergencies all by himself.\n\n“It’s just one guy and one truck,” Dennis Schulz said, recalling occasions when he was the only member of his small rural department who was available to respond to midday calls.\n\nIn those cases, backup wasn’t far behind. Nearby Beechwood, which also has its own fire department, almost always teamed up with Batavia’s firefighters. In fact, the two small-town volunteer departments grew to complement one another over the years, regularly responding to emergency calls together.\n\nNot anymore, though. Batavia's all-volunteer department ceased most operations earlier this year after a precipitous decline in membership — a problem that's reflected in the broader struggles facing volunteer fire agencies around the state and country.\n\nFire departments that rely on volunteers have been struggling for years to fill boots. But it's a particularly serious problem in a state like Wisconsin, where fire stations rely more heavily on volunteers than do most other parts of the country. Besides the Sheboygan area, departments in parts of Fond du Lac County have also acknowledged struggles to populate their stations.\n\nThe Batavia Fire Department, which had been in operation in rural Sheboygan County’s far southwest corner since 1908, effectively closed on June 30. Batavia, an unincorporated community in the sparsely populated Town of Scott, will continue running emergency medical services from its old fire station, but neighboring Beechwood’s department remains the town’s only contracted firefighting outfit.\n\n\"June 30 may have been our last day, but it was also our best day,\" said Schulz, who's been with the Batavia department since 1986 and became its chief nearly 15 years ago. Morale had been running high over the last few years, and the department had managed to replace aging equipment even as volunteer membership remained low. Efforts to recruit new members, though, hadn't turned in solid-enough results.\n\nThe town board opted not to renew its service contract with the department in Batavia, instead allowing it to expire at the end of June, board chairman Randy Narbatovics said. That's left Beechwood with a fire department but no locally based EMS service, and Batavia with a crew of about nine EMS responders but no firefighting role.\n\n“Batavia just didn’t have the members,” Narbatovics said, noting a department roster turned in to him earlier this year showed Batavia had only a small handful of volunteers qualified to fight fires. Beechwood’s department, he said, had nearly 30.\n\nTown leaders had previously tasked both departments with working toward a consolidation, Narbatovics added, but those efforts stalled and the merger never took place.\n\nBy his own reckoning, Schulz’s firehouse included about eight volunteer firefighters and nine members trained to handle EMS calls. With some crossover between the firefighting and medical responder ranks, the lineup stood at just 15 people, some of whom also volunteered with other nearby departments.\n\n“Definitely, it’s not an ideal situation,” Schulz acknowledged of his hollowed-out crew, which in the early 1990s had boasted about 15 first responders and “upwards of 20 firefighters.”\n\nVolunteer agencies face broad troubles\n\nStruggles recruiting new members put Batavia’s fire department in good company.\n\nThe National Volunteer Fire Council says the number of volunteer firefighters in the U.S. hit its low point in 2011. Numbers have slowly climbed back up since then, but “the growth isn’t enough to meet the steady increase in call volume,” according to the nonprofit group representing national volunteer fire, EMS and rescue services.\n\n“It’s just gotten worse and worse and worse,” Schulz said, noting he and other volunteer fire officials have been stymied by efforts recruiting younger millennials.\n\nNathaniel Melby, first vice president of the Wisconsin State Fire Chiefs Association, said multiple causes lie behind volunteer departments’ recruitment struggles. Melby is the chief of the Town of Campbell Fire Department near La Crosse, which also relies on volunteers, and has experienced firsthand the challenges smaller departments can face attracting and keeping members.\n\nSometimes, would-be volunteers are just too busy, he said. Rigorous training requirements to earn firefighting certifications can create roadblocks, too. And sometimes, poor leadership in a firehouse can turn away volunteers who might otherwise sign up, he said.\n\nIn Batavia, reasons for a volunteer shortage seemed to run a small gamut. Schulz said the tiny town along State Highway 28 doesn’t have many deeply-rooted residents, making for an increasingly shallow pool of devoted locals from which to draw new members.\n\n“For lack of a better word, it’s just a very transient town,” he said. “People come and go all the time. There’s not a lot of people that stay there for generations.”\n\nA lack of local industry has also added to the challenge. Those who live in Batavia, Schulz said, usually commute to work in other communities, leaving them unavailable to respond to local emergencies during the day.\n\nThat wasn’t the case just a few years ago, when a local business that specialized in making shipping pallets employed a few members of Schulz’s fire department. When the company went out of business, though, the area lost a local employer. And Schulz lost some of his volunteers.\n\n“There’s really nothing to keep people here,” he said.\n\nState relies heavily on volunteers\n\nThough studies show that a decline in volunteer firefighting agencies’ memberships is a national phenomenon, Melby said the issue is even more stark in Wisconsin, where small cities and towns rely more heavily on volunteer fire departments than do most other parts of the country.\n\nStudies by the National Fire Protection Association show there’s been a nationwide shift away from volunteer fire departments in recent years. As recently as 2001, about three-quarters of all fire departments in the U.S. relied solely on volunteers; by 2015, the figure had dropped to about 69 percent, according to studies by the group. Departments that rely entirely on staffed firefighters or a mix of full-time responders and volunteer have grown to pick up the slack, according to the NFPA.\n\nBut a 2011 report by the same organization showed an estimated 80 percent of fire departments in Wisconsin still relied entirely on volunteers.\n\nMelby said he can’t think of instances in which volunteer shortages in Wisconsin have led to significant or deadly consequences. But the issue can lengthen emergency response times if agencies from farther away are tasked with filling the void.\n\n“There’s a big difference between having a fire department in your community and having a fire department from two communities away respond,” he said.\n\nRelying on volunteers to fill boots can cause headaches for departments in Sheboygan and Fond du Lac counties, where firefighters’ jobs can create obstacles to responding to daytime calls.\n\n\"A lot of our guys work outside the community,\" said Kyle Salter, fire chief for the Eden Fire Department, just south of Fond du Lac. He said his department boasts nearly four dozen volunteers, but fielding enough volunteers to show up for daytime calls can cause worries.\n\n\"But we have been fortunate so far,” he said, “to have employers who will allow them to leave to respond to calls. That's just part of being a volunteer fireman. We aren't standing around waiting; we have full-time jobs outside of this.\"\n\nAndrew Stahl, a captain with the volunteer fire department in the Town of Sheboygan, agreed with broad reports that volunteer departments like his are hurting for members. His own agency, whose jurisdiction borders the City of Sheboygan, has somewhere between 25 and 30 volunteers, though not all are equally active. And only a few are usually available to respond to emergencies during most normal business hours.\n\n“We have a decent amount of firefighters,” Stahl said, “but we could definitely use some more — especially during the day.”\n\nRecruitment efforts vary\n\nMark Hovarth, fire chief for the Fairwater Fire Department, said the 29 volunteers on his force is a low number. But he’s counting his blessings.\n\n\"In past years we have struggled to find new recruits,\" he said. \"But in this past year we have had five new members alone, so we are pretty lucky.\"\n\nHovarth said he’s noticed new recruits tend to be younger, an attribute difficult to come by in most of the state’s smaller communities.\n\nEfforts over the last few years to drive up recruitment in Batavia had shown only mixed results.\n\nSchulz, the former fire department’s chief, said his agency mailed fliers several years ago to all town residents urging them to volunteer. But the sweeping effort turned up only three new recruits — two of whom had actually previously volunteered with the department.\n\nNarbatovics, the board chairman covering the area around Batavia, said the department’s roster as of January boasted only a few trained firefighters. He said it had begun seeing a slight uptick in recruits earlier this year even as the department prepared to close.\n\n“But adding members doesn’t mean anything,” he said, explaining new volunteers still need to go through months of rigorous training before they’re qualified to fight fires.\n\n‘Cautiously optimistic’ about future\n\nA 1970s-era firefighting pickup truck still gleamed bright red inside one portion of the Batavia fire station last month, and the department had kept a few old hose nozzles as relics from its bygone heyday.\n\nOtherwise, the department’s equipment had grown to be fairly modern. Schulz pointed to two glistening fire engines his department acquired in 2012 and 2014; together, he said, they carried a combined 3,500 gallons of water. Predicting a few years ago that membership would remain sparse, Schulz said he made sure to outfit the trucks with equipment designed for smaller crews.\n\nThe department hosted a farewell brat fry just before its closing in June, and laudatory posts thanking it for 109 years of local service started showing up on Facebook around the same time.\n\nThe department’s final days were stressful, though Schulz said he also felt a sense of relief that the difficulties of running a tiny firefighting outfit were coming to an end.\n\nNo longer a fire chief, Schulz is now the leader of Batavia’s small remaining crew of EMS personnel. He said he’d like to grow the roster to at least a dozen — a recruiting effort he knows from experience will pose a challenge.\n\nAnd he said there’s a chance, however small, that volunteers might someday don firefighting gear again and run emergency calls out of Batavia’s firehouse. Achieving that, Schulz said, will require coming to an agreement with Beechwood officials to run firefighting services jointly. (Narbatovics also acknowledged the possibility, though he said it would require recruiting more firefighters to justify running the department out of two stations.)\n\nHammering out such a joint agreement might be hard and could take time, Schulz said. But asked if he thought it might happen, he offered a hopeful response:\n\n“Cautiously optimistic.”\n\nReach McLean Bennett at 920-453-5133, mbennett2@gannett.com or @Bennett_McLean on Twitter.\n\nReach Jillian Ellison at jeellison@gannett.com or 920-907-7968; on Twitter: @ellison_writes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2018/07/23/shootings-millbrook-alabama-two-wounded-melee-millbrook-party-and-domestic-violence/818156002/", "title": "Separate shootings in Millbrook leave several wounded", "text": "MILLBROOK — Millbrook police are investigating two unrelated shootings this past weekend, one where multiple shots were fired at a party and the other where a woman received serious injuries.\n\nThe party shooting was reported at 11:30 p.m. Friday in the 3500 block of Boxwood Drive where there were reports of multiple shots fired, said Police Chief P.K. Johnson.\n\nWhen officers arrived, they heard more shots fired from the parking lot area of a business in the 2100 block of Main Street, he said. A physical altercation at the party apparently lead to the gunfire, Johnson said. A 19-year-old man from Alabaster received a broken jaw in the melee, the chief said.\n\nAs they were investigating the shootings, police received a report of a gunshot victim being treated at Prattville Baptist Hospital, Johnson said. Officers talked to a 21-year-old man from Montgomery who had received gunshot wounds to his right leg, Johnson said.\n\nThat man would not give a statement to police and was uncooperative, Johnson said.\n\n“Apparently, some of our young people are under the impression that it’s OK to fire indiscriminately into a crowd of people or into vehicles,” Johnson said. “We are extremely fortunate that only two people were injured, one being the result of gunfire and the other a physical assault. This type of behavior is totally unacceptable and will not be allowed to become the norm in our city.”\n\nSince the 21-year-old shooting victim is uncooperative, officers won’t be investigating that case, he said.\n\n“We are not getting a lot of cooperation from anyone that was present or that may be able to identify who the shooter or shooters were,” Johnson said. “We have been actively engaged in this and other areas of town where this type of activity has occurred, and we will continue to increase patrols and enforcement activity in these areas until this violence stops.”\n\nThe other shooting occurred just a few hours later, at 1:13 a.m. Saturday in the 4000 block of Grandview Road, Johnson said. Police received a report of a domestic violence situation where a person was shot.\n\nOfficers found a 51-year-old woman with gunshot wounds to her right hand and chest, Johnson said. Also injured was the woman’s 21-year-old son, being shot twice in his right arm, Johnson said. The woman is in critical condition.\n\nThe suspect has been identified by Millbrook Police as Louis Stinson Jr., a 40-year-old Montgomery resident.\n\nInvestigators with the Millbrook Police Department’s Criminal Investigative Unit have obtained warrants for Stinson’s arrest for assault 1st degree, domestic violence and robbery 1st degree.\n\n\"At this time it appears that the suspect in this case has fled the area in an attempt to avoid apprehension,\" Johnson said in a statement Monday. \"Saturday evening our investigators received credible information that the victim’s vehicle had been abandoned just across the Georgia state line. We reached out to law enforcement officials in that area, who did in fact locate the victim’s vehicle. The vehicle was impounded and processed for physical evidence, which may be useful in assisting us in prosecuting this case. For now, our focus is on locating and apprehending the offender in this case. He’ll have to face a Judge and jury for the crimes that he’s alleged to have committed. Fleeing only makes the situation worse. The warrants that have been signed against Mr. Stinson will reach just as far as he wants to flee. We are working with our local and state law enforcement partners in the state of Georgia, as well as federal law enforcement officials attempting to have Mr. Stinson located, so that he can be returned to Millbrook and face these charges. Our investigators have been working non-stop since this case began.\"\n\nJohnson asks for anyone aware of Mr. Stinson’s location to contact the Millbrook Police Department at (334) 285-6832, or the Secret Witness Line at (334) 285-8500.\n\n\"Mr. Stinson needs to turn himself into law enforcement where we can resolve this case in a manner that is safe for all parties involved,\" Johnson said. \"Additional charges against Stinson may be forthcoming, as this case remains under investigation.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/05/21/assisted-living-facility-violations-upstate-residential-care/489849002/", "title": "Sexual assaults, beatings, missing residents: A history of trouble at ...", "text": "When a man was beaten with a belt and critically injured at an Anderson assisted living facility this year, the incident gave only a hint of the alarming history of trouble and violence at the home.\n\nAfter 58-year-old Henry Middleton, a resident of Upstate Residential Care, was arrested in March and charged with beating Charles Larry Ross, his 73-year-old roommate who has Alzheimer's disease, the Independent Mail sought public records to determine how many times the Anderson Police Department responded to the South McDuffie Street facility in the past five years.\n\nRoss' beating is one of at least 21 dangerous incidents that police have responded to at the home during the five-year period. Police records detail allegations of rape, residents punching each other and at least 10 instances of mentally and physically disabled people wandering away from the home and being lost for hours or even days.\n\nIt is impossible to determine which of those incidents were reported to the state Department of Health and Environmental Control, which oversees safety at the facility and others like it in South Carolina. DHEC has a record of only four serious incidents at the home, and it's unclear which incidents those are because DHEC keeps those reports for only 30 days after they have been reviewed and problems cited have been corrected.\n\nDespite receiving multiple citations for violations, Upstate Residential Care has been fined only once, for $13,400. That came after inspectors discovered at least 33 violations at the home in a four-month period in 2014.\n\nDiscrepancies revealed by an analysis of state and city records show minimal oversight at Upstate Residential Care, and they raise concerns about the protection of assisted living facility residents throughout South Carolina.\n\nThe Independent Mail has requested records from all assisted living facilities in Anderson, Greenville, Oconee, Pickens, Abbeville, Spartanburg and Laurens counties to determine the extent of oversight at similarly classified facilities. The request is pending.\n\nHorace Alexander, the owner of Upstate Residential Care, declined to discuss his facility or the safety of its residents for this article.\n\nAssisted living and nursing homes are different\n\nContained within what appears to be a large brick house near downtown Anderson, Upstate Residential Care is licensed to have 10 residents and usually has about eight. The residents share three bedrooms on one of the house's upper floors. The same building also is home to WLAS, a radio station that plays a mix of R&B, old-school and gospel music.\n\nAt times, the person operating the radio station may also be responsible for caring for vulnerable residents, records show.\n\nUpstate Residential Care is what state regulators call a \"community residential care facility.\" Commonly called assisted living facilities, these businesses are cheaper — and less regulated — than nursing homes.\n\n\"A CRCF offers room and board and a degree of personal assistance,\" said DHEC spokesman Tommy Crosby. \"A CRCF is not a nursing home, which provides intermediate or skilled nursing care.\"\n\nAccording to state regulations, such a facility is \"designed to accommodate residents’ changing needs and preferences, maximize residents’ dignity, autonomy, privacy, independence and safety, and encourage family and community involvement.\" Included in the definition of a CRCF is any facility other than a hospital \"which offers or represents to the public that it offers a beneficial or protected environment specifically for individuals who have mental illness or disabilities.\"\n\nDeborah Ross, the wife of the injured Charles Larry Ross, said the price of Upstate Residential Care was a major reason she chose it for her husband of 30 years. She said the couple's Social Security and retirement income wouldn't stretch far enough to pay for some of the places she considered.\n\nShe signed up to pay $1,461 a month, most of it going for her husband's room and board and $45 going to his medication, according to her invoices from Upstate Residential Care.\n\n\"The best place would have been $3,500 a month,\" she said. \"We only had $2,500 a month, so it could not have been the best place. I was looking for somebody who could take care of him but still leave me money to live on... I thought for sure they would keep him safe.\"\n\nAlexander said in a previous interview that residents under the care of his facility are safe.\n\n\"We are just as safe as any other residential facility licensed by the state of South Carolina,\" Alexander said March 2, the day that Middleton was arrested at the home and charged with assaulting Charles Larry Ross.\n\nAlexander, who also manages the radio station, declined to speak to an Independent Mail reporter for this article.\n\n\"I'm not interested in talking,\" Alexander said. \"You and I are in the same business. We both do media.\"\n\nSexual assaults at the facility\n\nAnderson police have investigated at least two reports of sexual assaults at Upstate Residential Care.\n\nOne of them Alexander described as being preceded by \"a staffing emergency.\"\n\nIn June 2014, a man who had just been released from a Georgia prison was left alone to supervise the facility's residents.\n\nSometime between 1:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m., the man assaulted a young woman at the home whose mental health rendered her \"unable to consent to sex,\" according to state records.\n\nDonald Alexander Mitchell, then an Upstate Residential Care employee, was charged with criminal sexual conduct, according to an arrest warrant. He later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, second-degree assault and battery, court records show.\n\nDespite South Carolina regulations that require assisted living facilities to report all crimes against their residents to DHEC, Upstate Residential Care did not report the assault. DHEC learned of the events through a separate, filed complaint and cited Upstate Residential Care for failing to disclose what happened.\n\nIn a response to DHEC after the incident, Upstate Residential Care owner Alexander said trained employees didn't show up for work on the night of the assault. He acknowledged that the person he allowed to work that night did not have a proper background check. He said that from talking with the worker's parole officer, he was aware only of the man's \"burglary-related offenses.\"\n\n\"There was no intent on having the staff member in question having contact with residents,\" Alexander wrote. \"But... a staffing emergency left us between a rock and a hard place.\"\n\nAlexander submitted \"a plan of corrective action.\" DHEC reviewed the plan and accepted it.\n\nLater that year, police responded to a report of a rape that was alleged to have occurred on a fire escape and gone unheard by the facility's staff. The woman who reported what happened was removed from the home and placed in emergency protective custody.\n\nSerious incidents: What are the rules and what was reported?\n\nDHEC requires community residential care facilities licensed in South Carolina to report all \"serious incidents.\"\n\n\"Serious incidents include everything from assault and battery to sexual assault and misconduct to elopement, among others,\" Crosby, the DHEC spokesman, said in an email. \"DHEC monitors compliance with the reporting requirements by conducting document review during inspections and when applicable, investigations.\"\n\nThe most recent serious incident reported by Upstate Residential Care, and the only one that DHEC still had an incident report on file for, was the Jan. 16 altercation involving Middleton and Ross, though their names are redacted from the record.\n\nThe report says that someone, whose name is redacted, admitted to beating Ross between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. because he was \"annoying... other residents, keeping them from sleeping.\"\n\nDHEC provided three emails that appear connected to previous incident reports, though some items reported did not actually qualify as serious incidents as defined by state regulations.\n\nIn one July 2017 email, a person whose name is redacted notified DHEC that he was attacked by a resident whom he \"took down\" and restrained until police arrived. Matching Anderson Police Department records show the person who reported the assault was Alexander, and that he told police a resident had come into his office and threatened him.\n\nIn a May 2016 email, a person whose name is redacted reported having a client who was \"refusing to sign admission documents\" and another who was \"trying everything... to return to Spartanburg County.\"\n\nIn the last email, from Nov. 26, 2014, Alexander gave his account of what happened when a resident wanted to leave the facility and instead stay at The Salvation Army. Alexander said he was trying to look after the resident, that he was worried about the person being able to self-medicate. Alexander said that as he tried to talk to police about what happened, the environment \"turned into a hostile one\" and that police were not helpful to him.\n\nDHEC officials decided to launch their own investigation based on Alexander's email.\n\nAccording to state records, a DHEC investigator listened to a 911 call in which an Upstate Residential Care resident asked dispatchers for help.\n\n\"The owner says that if I leave, I will carry an ass-whooping,\" the resident said. \"I just want to go.\"\n\nRecords show that DHEC cited Upstate Residential Care for breaking state law: \"A resident must be free from mental and physical abuse.\"\n\nAccording to an Anderson police report, the man who tried to leave Upstate Residential Care was followed by a white van as he walked to The Salvation Army, and an employee of the assisted living facility told an officer that he followed the man to take away his prescribed medication.\n\nDHEC also cited Upstate Residential Care for this, saying that the only staff on duty during this incident appeared to have left the home, leaving all other residents in the home unsupervised.\n\nIn responding to the citations, Alexander wrote to DHEC, in part: \"Our facility also operates a 24-hour radio station, which is man(ned) by someone 24 hours a day who is certified in a dual capacity for both the radio station and the facility just to make sure we are never understaffed.\"\n\nFurther, he wrote, \"at the time of investigation, we were not aware that we were not making all efforts to maintain a facility free of mental and physical abuse.\"\n\nThey disappeared, and state regulators didn't know\n\nWillie Lee Shell, who was deaf and unable to speak, disappeared from Upstate Residential Care three times in two months, according to police records. It's not clear how or when he returned.\n\nA few months later, Shell walked away from the home a fourth time.\n\nThree days passed before someone at Upstate Residential Care called Anderson police on Aug. 25, 2014, according to a police report. The report offers little information except that he \"left walking\" on Aug. 22 and hadn't returned. Police sought the public's help to find Shell and told media he may have left the home to buy cigarettes.\n\nFour days after he disappeared, Shell was found uninjured in Greenville.\n\nUpstate Residential Care never reported any of Shell's disappearances to DHEC.\n\nDHEC sent an inspector to the home after the South Carolina Governor's Office of the Ombudsman filed a complaint about the way the home handled Shell's fourth disappearance. DHEC cited Upstate Residential Care for failing to report the disappearance of Shell, whom DHEC called \"Resident A.\" DHEC also cited the home for putting in Shell's records that he \"rejected his medications\" on five days that he was actually missing from the facility.\n\nIn his response to the citations, Alexander defended his actions.\n\n\"It appears we have become a dumping ground for people who would otherwise be homeless or public nuisances, and in return, we find ourselves the brunt of all complaints,\" Alexander wrote to DHEC.\n\nWhat happened with Shell was not an isolated incident.\n\nAnderson police records show that residents were reported missing from Upstate Residential Care at least 10 times in the last five years, with most of those disappearances occurring in 2014.\n\nNone of the disappearances were detailed in the four serious incidents reported to DHEC.\n\nThe state's response?\n\nThe Independent Mail has asked DHEC about multiple situations that police responded to at the home that do not show up in the state agency's log of serious incidents at the facility. Those cases include a May 2016 resident-on-resident assault and a separate incident last July involving Middleton, according to police records.\n\nIn that July case, an officer determined that a mentally ill woman had taken something of Middleton's.\n\n\"Middleton then became upset and threw a small brick\" at the woman and hit her with a cane, according to the police report.\n\nThe officer did not pursue charges against Middleton because he determined that both people involved in the assault had mental health issues.\n\nSix months later, the 58-year-old was accused of beating Ross.\n\nRoss remains hospitalized while his wife searches for a new facility for him.\n\nCrosby said in a recent interview that DHEC will further investigate any police cases not included in the state agency's log of serious incidents at the home \"to find out if everything that should have been done was done.\"\n\nLater, Crosby emailed a statement to the Independent Mail.\n\n\"DHEC has followed up with the facility to discuss the issues you have raised,\" he said. \"DHEC’s goal is to help ensure that facilities are in compliance with our regulatory requirements for the protection of the residents that call these communities their home.\"\n\nFollow Nikie Mayo on Twitter and email her at mayon@independentmail.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/12/15/cities-adding-losing-most-jobs/4009031/", "title": "Cities adding and losing the most jobs", "text": "Michael B. Sauter, Thomas C. Frohlich and Alexander E.M. Hess\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nFlorida metro had highest job gains over one-year period%3A 7.6%25\n\nIllinois city had biggest job losses%2C down 4.3%25\n\nUneven improvement in economy%2C labor market across nation\n\nU.S. payrolls rose by more than 200,000 in November as employers continued to hire at a steady pace. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dropped to 7.0%, the lowest it has been since late 2008. While the figures generally point to an overall improvement in the economy and labor market, the progress isn't even across the nation, and in some areas, jobs are still being shed.\n\nIn some parts of the country, however, job growth is especially strong. Such is the case in the metro area of Naples-Marco Island, Florida, where the number of jobs jumped by 7.59% over the past year. In other areas of the country the job market remains extremely weak. The number of jobs in Decatur, Illinois, fell by 4.3% over the past year. Based on the most recently available data, 24/7 Wall St. identified the metropolitan statistical areas with the greatest percent gains, and losses, in jobs.\n\nNationally, several industries have been driving job growth. In several of the metro areas that added the most jobs in the past 12 months, these industries have been a major factor as well. Martin Kohli, chief regional economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), noted that \"the continued boom in energy exploration appears to be a factor in why these areas in are doing relatively well.\" In Midland and Odessa, Texas, two of the cities adding the most jobs, mining accounted for a great deal of job growth.\n\nIn other metro areas where jobs are on the rise, the housing sector has played a major role. Job growth in construction and new housing starts have begun to pick up after reaching multi-decade lows during the recession. This is especially important for the four fast-growing job markets in Florida, Kohli explained. An improved housing market is important \"because areas in Florida were among those hardest hit by the bursting of the housing bubble.\"\n\nEmployment in the manufacturing sector rose last year, but in many of the metro areas losing the most jobs, the long-struggling sector continued to decline. In Peoria and Decatur, Illinois, which both had among the largest job losses between October 2012 and October 2013, manufacturing employment declined 8.4% and 16.1%, respectively, during that time.\n\nLargely because of continued budget-tightening, nationwide government employment in October was slightly lower than the same month in 2012. In several of the cities losing the most jobs, government employment declined even more. In Manhattan, Kansas, where overall jobs fell by 3.5%, the number of government jobs fell by nearly 10%.\n\nTo identify the 10 cities adding and losing the most jobs, 24/7 Wall St. examined the one-year change in total non-farm payroll from figures published by the BLS for each metro area between October 2012 and October 2013. Additional figures on unemployment and labor force size are also from the BLS, as are data referencing the industry composition of the workforce in specific metro areas. Wage data from the Bureau are as of May 2012. Many of these areas are small and data may be subject to sampling error.\n\nThese are the American cities adding (and losing) the most jobs.\n\n1. Naples-Marco Island, Fla.\n\n> Jobs pct. change: 7.6%\n\n> Total non-farm jobs: 124,700\n\n> Total workforce: 155,261\n\n> Unemployment rate: 6.4%\n\nAs of October, no metro area matched Naples for non-farm job growth over the preceding 12 months. The metro area also added almost 5,800 workers, a 3.9% increase from the previous October. As a result, Naples' unemployment rate dropped from 8.5% in October 2012 to 6.4% in October 2013. By comparison, non-farm payrolls nationwide rose less than 2% over that time, while the U.S. unemployment rate trickled down from 7.9% to 7.3%. One major source for job growth was the leisure and hospitality industry, where the number of jobs increased by 6.7% from last year. Also, job growth in the professional and business services sector was up 10.4% during the same period.\n\n2. Sebastian-Vero Beach, Fla.\n\n> Jobs pct. change: 6.7%\n\n> Total non-farm jobs: 47,700\n\n> Total workforce: 65,024\n\n> Unemployment rate: 8.0%\n\nThe housing crisis affected Florida more than most states, and the Sebastien-Vero Beach area's housing recovery has been slow. The unemployment rate in the area was more than 14% as of October 2009. Three years later, in October 2012, the region still had an unemployment rate of 10.3%, compared to a national rate of 7.9%. Over the next 12 months, however, things began to pick up in the area's job market. The region's labor force grew at one of the fastest rates in the country, and the economy added 3,000 jobs, a 6.7% increase. The unemployment rate fell by 2.3 percentage points to 8%, the fourth-largest decline of any metro area.\n\n3. Crestview-Fort Walton Beach-Destin, Fla.\n\n> Jobs pct. change: 6.0%\n\n> Total non-farm jobs: 82,500\n\n> Total workforce: 101,042\n\n> Unemployment rate: 4.4%\n\nFlorida is home to the three metro areas with the highest job growth in the U.S., including the Crestview area, where the number of non-farm jobs has risen 6% between October of 2012 and October of 2013. Additionally, the unemployment rate in the area has fallen 1.3 percentage points in the most recent 12 months, and stood at just 4.4% as of October. None of this job growth has come from the public sector, as the number government jobs has been flat over the last year. Many major area employers include aerospace and defense companies, and according to the Economic Development Council of Okaloosa County, Florida, the area also offers an industrial air park for private companies to use as well as tax credits to recruit aerospace employers.\n\n4. Midland, Texas\n\n> Jobs pct. change: 5.2%\n\n> Total non-farm jobs: 87,500\n\n> Total workforce: 95,977\n\n> Unemployment rate: 3.1%\n\nMidland's labor force grew by nearly 4% between October 2012 and October 2013, the fifth-largest improvement out of any metro area. The region's unemployment rate of 3.1% this October was among the lowest in the nation. Like Odessa, Midland's growth may be explained in part by the booming oil and gas industry. According to the Midland Development Corporation, oil and gas companies generated nearly 3,500 jobs in the region over the last 12 months. Compared with other metro areas adding the most jobs, wages in Midland are high. In 2012, the annual median wage was nearly $35,000, in the top third of all metro areas.\n\n5. Yuba City, Calif.\n\n> Jobs pct. change: 4.8%\n\n> Total non-farm jobs: 39,100\n\n> Total workforce: 70,446\n\n> Unemployment rate: 12.4%\n\nYuba City is located in the fertile Sacramento Valley and is highly reliant on agriculture. There are more than 61,000 employed people in the region, but less than 40,000 non-farm jobs. Despite non-farm job growth of nearly 5% in the last year and a 17.4% decline in the jobless population, unemployment remains a problem in Yuba City. The region's unemployment rate as of October was 12.4%, much higher than the national rate of 7.3%. Only three other metro areas had a higher unemployment rate than Yuba City.\n\nCities losing the most jobs\n\n1. Decatur, Ill.\n\n> Jobs pct. change: -4.3%\n\n> Total non-farm jobs: 50,800\n\n> Total workforce: 51,006\n\n> Unemployment rate: 11.7%\n\nEven as the Decatur area's labor force shrank, its unemployment was persistently high. There were roughly 50,800 non-farm jobs in the metro area as of October, down from 53,100 one year earlier. Much of this job loss has been in manufacturing, where employment has declined 16% year-over-year through October. Also, agricultural processing giant Archer Daniels Midland has announced plans to move its global headquarters and top executives out of the area. Currently, Illinois legislators are working on a plan to keep the company in state, offering as much as $25 million in long-term tax incentives if the company moves its headquarters to Chicago while adding 500 jobs over five years in Decatur.\n\n2. Manhattan, Kan.\n\n> Jobs pct. change: -3.5%\n\n> Total non-farm jobs: 57,100\n\n> Total workforce: 62,373\n\n> Unemployment rate: 4.7%\n\nManhattan, Kansas, has struggled to grow jobs in recent years. Although the Little Apple's unemployment rate was just 4.7% in October, up slightly from October 2012, the number of jobs in the area has declined by 3.5% in the last year. The public sector, including Kansas State University and Fort Riley, home to the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division, is one of the area's major employers — and one of its major sources of job losses. Government jobs declined by nearly 10% in the last 12 months. Federal defense spending cuts earlier this year impacted the Fort and its workers.\n\n3. Palm Coast, Fla.\n\n> Jobs pct. change: -3.4%\n\n> Total non-farm jobs: 20,000\n\n> Total workforce: 34,424\n\n> Unemployment rate: 9.4%\n\nThe unemployment rate in Palm Coast, fell by 1.3 percentage points between October 2012 and October 2013. Still, with a 9.4% unemployment rate, the region continues to have one of the highest jobless rates in the country. The region has had exceptionally high unemployment rates for some time, well above 10% for nearly all of the last five years. In the last year alone, the region lost roughly 700 jobs, or about 3.4%. One of the biggest factors in this decline was the estimated loss of approximately 300 the government sector jobs.\n\n4. Ocean City, N.J.\n\n> Jobs pct. change: -3.2%\n\n> Total non-farm jobs: 38,800\n\n> Total workforce: 53,525\n\n> Unemployment rate: 11.1%\n\nThe unemployment rate in Ocean City was 11.1% in October. However, the high unemployment rate may be in part due to the seasonal nature of work in the area. There is a strong leisure and hospitality sector in Ocean City that is subject to seasonal fluctuations. This past July, for example, there were 20,200 people employed in the sector. Three months later, in October, the sector had shrunk to 9,200. Even accounting for seasonality, the Ocean City job market is quite poor. As of October, total non-farm jobs were down 3.2% over the last 12 months. Further, the area's annual median wage of $30,310 in 2012 was below the national median.\n\n5. Panama City-Lynn Haven-Panama City Beach, Fla.\n\n> Jobs pct. change: -3.0%\n\n> Total non-farm jobs: 70,700\n\n> Total workforce: 85,992\n\n> Unemployment rate: 6.0%\n\nUnfortunately, the Panama City metro area hasn't improved much since January, 2010 the worst month in the past six years. That month, there were just under 70,000 jobs in the region. At last count, there were 70,700 jobs. This October, the region's labor force had shrunk by more than 5% from the year before — the third largest labor force decline nationwide. Because many residents left the area or stopped looking for work, the number of people considered unemployed declined by more than 25%, the largest decline out of all metro areas. The area's annual median wage of $27,600 in 2012 remained one of the lowest in the nation.\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce echoed this sentiment at a July 8 press briefing.\n\nThe State Department did not reveal further details about the identities of the foreign ministers and U.S. politicians contacted.

Yep, we're now being told that it's wise to ditch the \"Hi this is Sally, can't come to the phone right now\" custom message and go with the boring, pre-recorded default greeting offered on your cell phone that uses a voice that isn't yours.\n\nIt's not exactly the cheery kind of stuff we want to hear as the calendar moves closer into 2025. But it's not exactly the kind of message we can afford to ignore, either.\n\nArtificial intelligence tools can replicate our voices\n\nCyber criminals have a few new tools that experts say will open up the door for even more fraud in the next few years — AI-powered voice and video cloning techniques.\n\nScammers want our voices and videos so that they can do a more convincing job of impersonating us when they're out to steal money. Such cloning can be wrongly used when crooks make a call pretending to be a grandson who claims to need money to get out of jail, a boss who wants you to pay some mysterious invoice, a romantic interest met on social media and a host of others.\n\nThe FBI is warning that artificial intelligence tools pose an escalating threat to consumers and businesses as cyber criminals using AI to conduct sophisticated phishing and social engineering attacks.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel in early December warned residents that rapid advancements in AI are being misused to create \"deepfake audio and video scams so realistic that they can even fool those who know us best.\"\n\nWe're not hearing from local law enforcement about a ton of such voice-impersonation scams taking place yet. But experts say people need to be prepared for an onslaught of activity and take precautions.\n\nThose operating sophisticated fraud rings only need roughly three seconds of your voice to duplicate who you are — replicating the pitch of your voice, your tone, the pace at which you speak — when the crooks use some readily available, low-cost AI tools, according to Greg Bohl, chief data officer for Transaction Network Services. The company provides services to the telecommunications industry, including cell phone companies. Bohl's work focuses on developing AI technologies that can be used to combat fraud.\n\nMany times, Bohl said, criminals will take information that's already readily available on social media or elsewhere, such as your cell phone, to clone a voice.\n\n\"The longer the greeting, the more accurate they can be with that voice replication,\" Bohl told me via a video conference call.\n\nHe called a 30-second snippet on a voicemail or a social media post a \"gold mine for bad actors.\"\n\nMany scams already spoof a legitimate phone number to make it appear like the call is coming from a well-known business or government agency. Often, real names are even used to make it seem like you're really hearing from someone who works at that agency or business.\n\nBut this new AI-cloning development will take scams to an entirely new level, making it harder for consumers to spot fraudulent robocalls and texts.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission warns that AI can be used to \"make it sound like celebrities, elected officials, or even your own friends and family are calling.\" The FCC has been working, along with state attorney generals, to shut down illegal AI voices and texts.\n\nCyber crooks do their research to sound real\n\nPeople unknowingly make the problem worse with social media posts by identifying family members — say your son Leo or your daughter Kate — in videos or photos.\n\nThe crooks, of course, need to know who cares about you enough to try to help you in an emergency. So, the scammers first must identify who they might target among your real friends and family before staging a crisis call to ask for money.\n\nDuring the holidays, Bohl said, anything you do on social media to connect with families and friends can trigger some risk and make you more open to fraud.\n\nHis top two tips:\n\nNo. 1: switch to automated voicemail.\n\nNo. 2: Create a family \"safe word.\"\n\nScam calls will sound even more real using replicated voices of those we know, experts say. So, we will want to be able to calmly figure out if we're talking to a crook. You want a safe word or security question in place long before any of these calls start.\n\nQuestions can help, such as: What five tricks can the dog do in the morning? What was your favorite memory as a child? What was the worst golf score you ever posted? You want something that a scammer won't be able to easily guess — or quickly look up online. (And if you don't have a dog or play golf, well, you might have a good trick question there.)\n\n\"We can expect a significant uptick in AI-powered fraudulent activities by 2025,\" said Katalin Parti, an associate professor of sociology and a cybercrime expert at Virginia Tech.\n\nThe combination of social media and generative AI will create more sophisticated and dangerous attacks, she said.\n\nAs part of the fraud, she said, scammers also can create robocalls to collect voice samples from potential victims. It can be best not to engage in these types of calls, even by responding with a simple \"hello.\"\n\nParti gives more tips: Don't contact any telephone number received via pop-up, text or email. Do not answer cold calls, even if you see a local area code. If you do not recognize the caller but you decide to answer the call anyhow, let the caller talk first.\n\nAI voice-cloning is a significant threat as part of financial scams targeting older adults, as well as for misinformation in political campaigns, according to Siwei Lyu, professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Buffalo and director of the UB Media Forensic Lab.\n\nWhat's troubling, he said, is that AI-generated voices can be extremely difficult to detect, especially when they are played over the phone and when the message can elicit emotional reactions such as when you think a close family member is hurt.\n\nTake time to step back and doublecheck if the call is real, Lyu said, and listen carefully to other clues to detect an AI-generated sound.\n\n\"Pay attention to abnormal characteristics, such as overly quiet background, lack of emotional tone in the voice or even the lack of breathing in between utterances,\" he said.\n\nNew tools can make a scam phone call more convincing\n\nBut remember, new technology is evolving. Today, more types of phishing emails and texts look legitimate, thanks to AI.\n\nThe old saw, for example, which suggests you just need to look for bad grammar or spelling mistakes to spot a fake email or text could prove useless one day, as AI tools assist foreign criminals in translating the phrases they're using to target U.S. businesses and consumers.\n\nAmong other things, the FBI warned that cyber crooks could:\n\nGenerate short audio clips containing a loved one's voice to impersonate a grandchild or other relative who was arrested, hurt in a car accident or facing some other crisis. When the voice sounds like someone you know, you might be more likely to panic and give into a request for bail money or even a demand for a ransom. And you might be more willing to take swift action when a call from your \"boss\" demands that buy gift cards for Best Buy to pay a particular invoice. Be skeptical.\n\nCrooks could use AI-generated audio clips of individuals and impersonate them to gain access to bank accounts.\n\nScammers can be expected to use realistic videos for private communications to \"prove\" the online contact is a \"real person.\"\n\nMany times, we cannot even imagine how cyber criminals thousands of miles away could know how our voices sound. But much is out there already — more than even a simple voicemail message.\n\nSchool events are streamed. Business conferences are available online. Sometimes, our jobs require that we post information online to market the brand.\n\nAnd \"there's growing concern that bad guys can hack into voicemail systems or even phone companies to steal voicemail messages that might be left with a doctor's office or financial advisor,\" said Teresa Murray, who directs the Consumer Watchdog office for U.S. PIRG, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nSuch threats become more real, she said, in light of incidents such as the massive data breach suffered by National Public Data, which aggregates data to provide background checks. The breach was announced in August.\n\nYep, it's downright sickening.\n\nMurray said the proliferation of scams makes it essential to have conversations with our loved ones to make sure everyone understands that computers can impersonate voices of people we know.\n\nTalk about how you cannot trust Caller ID to show that a legitimate government agency is calling you, too.\n\nDon't be afraid to just hang up\n\nMichigan Attorney General Nessel's alert about potential holiday scams using artificial intelligence recommended that:\n\nFamilies should agree on a \"code word\" or key phrase that only your family would know to confirm an identity during a suspicious call.\n\nBe ready to hang up. If something feels off, just hang up.\n\nCall someone to verify their identity. Use a phone number that you know is real.\n\nDo not hand over money easily. Scammers often demand that you pay them with cryptocurrency, gift cards or money transfers. But once you send that money, it's hard to trace or reverse.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

His staff is no more or less competent.\n\nBut suddenly, images of Biden as a feeble septuagenarian atop a mismanaged White House have given way to those of an experienced leader, smiling behind aviator sunglasses, whose battle-tested team has delivered on a range of national priorities. A winning streak does that for you.\n\nIt has not happened because of a strategy shift or staff shakeup, though at low points allies wanted him to take those ritual steps. It’s been a combination of good luck, skill and persistence by a president and Democratic Party determined to act unilaterally where Republicans wouldn’t and strike compromises where Republicans would.\n\nGas prices, which wounded Biden when they spiked, have declined for two months. The President didn’t cause either movement. But the turn of fortune has relieved some of the inflation pressures that remain his single largest political problem.\n\nLate last month, weather conditions cleared the way for a CIA drone to kill al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri on the balcony of his Kabul home. The precision strike, the planning of which began this past spring, vindicated Biden’s assertions that the US could fight terrorism in Afghanistan even without troops on the ground.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Justice has been delivered': Biden says US killed al Qaeda leader 03:00 - Source: CNN 'Justice has been delivered': Biden says US killed al Qaeda leader 03:00\n\nIn Congress, Biden has proven detractors wrong from both directions. Politicians and pundits describing a failed legislative agenda had written their reviews before the end of the play.\n\nProgressive lawmakers who scorned the former senator’s talk of working with the GOP have seen Congress make bipartisan investments in infrastructure, domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, and veterans’ health care. They joined a critical mass of Republicans to pass them.\n\nOthers who complained Biden had veered too far left have seen Congress take the largest-ever government steps to curb climate change. Not a single Republican voted yes. Every single Democrat did.\n\nThis doesn’t make Biden a modern-day FDR or LBJ. He cannot claim a singular monument to rival Social Security, Medicare or even the Affordable Care Act, though he has strengthened it.\n\nProposed investments to expand economic opportunity through child care, child tax credits, paid leave and universal pre-kindergarten have faltered. The bipartisan gun-safety law that ended years of congressional paralysis did not meet his call to ban assault weapons. He has not won legislation to safeguard voting rights at a moment when Republican extremism threatens democracy and the rule of law.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Historian who warned Biden in private White House meeting speaks out 05:37 - Source: CNN Historian who warned Biden in private White House meeting speaks out 05:37\n\nPartisan math has imposed the fundamental constraint. To act alone on the small number of top-priority initiatives shielded from Republican filibuster, Democrats can sustain only a few defections in the House and none in the Senate. The climate package prevailed only because Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, after months of resistance, finally agreed to join hands with party colleagues.\n\nThat legislative tightrope makes all the more remarkable what Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have achieved. To call them “wins” on the political scoreboard, as if governance were a sporting event, obscures their impact on American life.\n\nThe 2021 infrastructure law, which eluded Biden’s two immediate predecessors, means $550 billion for new federal investments in roads, bridges, airports, public transit, railroads, rural broadband, clean water and electric-vehicle charging stations, among others.\n\nThe semiconductor bill provides over $52 billion to spur domestic manufacturing of vital components for products ranging from cars to computers, reducing America’s reliance on foreign suppliers.\n\nThe so-called “burn pits” bill extends new health care and disability benefits to millions of veterans exposed to toxins during their service.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act – named to lure Manchin though it will have negligible impact on inflation this year – means Medicare beneficiaries will pay no more than $35 per month for insulin and no more than $2,000 per year in out-of-pocket drug costs. For the first time, Medicare can use its market power to negotiate lower prices from drug companies.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's how the Inflation Reduction Act could affect you 02:05 - Source: CNN Business Here's how the Inflation Reduction Act could affect you 02:05 • CNN Business\n\nThe IRA also devotes $370 billion to developing clean energy and curbing climate change, which analysts say will help the US reduce carbon emissions 40% below 2005 levels by 2030. It sustains American leadership at a time when extreme weather events increasingly place the dangers to the world in sharp relief.\n\nBiden’s weak public standing has begun ticking slightly up. Democrats on the 2022 ballot have gained more ground from anger over the conservative Supreme Court’s decision to end the constitutional right to abortion.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean voters will reward them in midterm elections this fall. Republicans need just a four-seat net gain – well below the historical average for the party not holding the White House – to recapture control of the House.\n\nNor does it mean Biden will follow the precedents of Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan in recovering from early setbacks to win a second term. At age 79, Biden looks the part of the oldest chief executive in American history as restless younger Democrats eye fresh leadership.\n\nBut it does mean the President and his party have capitalized on the opportunity control of government has given them for these two years.

Ray Smith\n\nHistorically Speaking\n\nRetired Oak Ridge High School teacher Benita Albert brings us part two of her story on Ron Garret.\n\n***\n\nRon Garret, known as Erann Gat while an Oak Ridge High School student in the Class of 1982, describes himself as a software engineer, entrepreneur, and angel investor. He said, “I have cofounded four startups and invested in over a dozen others. In a previous life I was a researcher specializing in robotics and AI.”\n\nAnd there is much more to report. I will continue his story where I left off in a previous, Part One installment.\n\nFrom the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to Google\n\nIn his first year of master’s degree studies at Virginia Tech, Ron met a new professor on campus with whom he formed a special bond, subsequently selecting him as the advisor for both his master’s and Ph.D. programs. That professor, David Miller, would also be the influencer over the first phase of Ron’s professional work. In 1998, Miller accepted a job offer with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California, and he chose two of his graduate students to accompany him, securing jobs for them at JPL.\n\nRon said, “So I was working and finishing my dissertation at the same time.” Completing his dissertation in April of 1991, he considered applying for an academic teaching and research position. However, due to an overflow of candidates for such assignments, he chose to stay at JPL. Reflecting on this choice, Ron said, “In retrospect it was a much better career path for me. I got to work on all kinds of cool projects with no teaching or research fundraising responsibilities.”\n\nSummarizing his work at JPL, Ron wrote, “In a previous life I was a researcher specializing in autonomous robots. I helped to pioneer what is today the de-facto standard autonomous mobile robot control architecture. For a while I was the most referenced computer science researcher at all of NASA according to the ‘citeseer’ citation tracking engine, a title I held for several years after I stopped publishing. I eventually rose to the rank of Principal at JPL, the highest rung on the technical career ladder there.” His time at JPL stretched from 1988-2004 with a one-year interruption in 2000 to commute weekly from Southern California to a job in Northern California with a new company named Google.\n\nGoogle is an American search engine company that more than 70% of worldwide online users now employ. When Ron joined the neophyte enterprise, Google was less than two years old. To further emphasize his trailblazer appointment, consider that Ron’s badge number, issued when he hired in, was 104.\n\nRon described his work at Google as follows: “I was the lead engineer on the first release of ‘AdWords.’ I also wrote the ‘Google Translation Console,’ one of the first crowdsourcing applications on the web.”\n\nI researched ‘AdWords’ and learned that it was one of the first self-serve online advertising platforms with the name now rebranded as ‘Google Ads.’ Love it or hate it as users, the software allows businesses and advertisers to create ads to be displayed on Google search results pages.\n\nRon was the first author of the ‘Google Translation Console,’ later rebranded as Google Translate. Ron described his initial efforts: “It was an interface through which volunteers (humans) would translate Google’s site content into various languages. The modern term would be ‘crowdsourcing,’ though that word had not been invented then. The challenge was how to make sure the translations were accurate when we had no one on staff who spoke the target language.”\n\nHis initial efforts in 2000 came to fruition in 2006, five years after his departure, with the official launch of Google Translate. In 2025, the Google Translate app supports 249 languages and can translate text, handwriting, photos, and speech.\n\nRon’s short tenure with Google was due to several factors, but he cited two especially compelling reasons - a “brutal commuting schedule” (from his home in Los Angeles to San Francisco) and the fact that JPL sought his return for leadership on new outer space projects, one of those being Deep Space 1. Deep Space 1 was a NASA demonstration spacecraft that flew by an asteroid and a comet as a part of the New Millenium Program testing advanced technologies.\n\nWithin the first half decade of his professional career, Ron found himself immersed in the dichotomous work mentalities of government research laboratory missions and corporate competitive cultures. Perhaps his ground-breaking work inside Google made him suffer from what he called \"imposter syndrome,\" meaning he questioned whether he was contributing enough. As he said, “It was hard to see the future success in the beginning days.” His work at JPL in early robotic technology and control systems was on the forefront of driverless car innovations, again, a futuristic concept waiting for acceptance and implementation.\n\nNew companies and a documentary film\n\nAs of 2004, Ron stepped out on his own taking on new ventures that expanded his scientific background to include entrepreneurship. The stock options available to him as a former Google employee supported his efforts to envision, finance, and create innovative ventures. In the last two decades he has co-founded four companies and invested in at least a dozen others.\n\nFrom 2004-06, Ron was the co-founder and chief technology officer for IndieBuyer, an online marketplace for independent films. Anticipating a potential growth market due to cheaper high-resolution video cameras and digital editing software, his initial plans were not unlike the later highly successful Netflix marketing strategy. However, Ron said they underestimated the amount of capital needed to reach critical mass. This venture, though thwarted, spun off a unique self-actualizing project for Ron to pursue.\n\nAs a citizen of Los Angeles, Ron became interested in filmmaking. He enrolled in a course in screenwriting in the early 2000s. He felt dissatisfied with his lack of writing experience in his educational background, desiring more than just the mechanical aspects of essay writing he had learned. He sought what he called, “More substance … an emphasis on dramatic structure, character arcs, and historic context.” Furthermore, Ron added, “I like to tell people that after you’ve lived in LA for a while, if you don’t write a screenplay, they kick you out.”\n\nThey didn’t kick him out, perhaps because he made a full-length feature film titled, “But for the Grace of God?” which is available on iTunes and Amazon. The film centers on one man’s quest to address the homeless problem. That one man is Ron Garret who attempted to converse with, and to help homeless individuals get off the streets of LA. The film premiered in 2011 at the Oakland International Film Festival.\n\nI love the pre-story, a snapshot of Ron’s motivation to address the subject of homelessness.\n\n“My dog, Mobo, didn’t fear approaching homeless people. He was an equal-opportunity sniffer who did not discriminate based on race, socioeconomic status, or even species. As long as you smelled interesting, he was your friend.”\n\n“Thank you for letting me pet your dog,” a statement made to Ron by Walter, a homeless man, changed everything. Ron continued, “In the span of five minutes my image of homeless people was changed forever.” The message, so beautifully delivered in the film, is to listen, care, and act.\n\nRon became an instrument-rated, private pilot, a passion first born in his youth while flying with his father, a former Israeli Air Force jet pilot. He recalled that they would fly a small plane around the East Tennessee area, taking off and landing on a small, grass airstrip in Oliver Springs.\n\nLater, it was Ron’s idea to create an online marketplace for charter jets, named Smart Charter. As a co-founder and CTO, Ron proposed aggregating demand data for an automated scheduling system, which could be used to reduce the number of empty legs across a fragmented private jet industry. Operating a website that would let prospective customers enter trip details for sharing with jet charter operations, Smart Charter could provide a centralized scheduling service. Before the company was launched, it drew the interest of Richard Branson of the Virgin Group who acquired the concept for $10 million.\n\nRon opposed the acquisition, but he was outvoted by his two fellow co-founders. He resigned from the company but kept his shares in the hopes the renamed company, Virgin Charter, would prosper. Ron reflected that the subsequent changes to the business model and a lack of understanding of the dynamics of the rarified market of charter jets led to failure of the venture. He summarized his lesson learned: “Be careful who you take on as a partner. Success in one industry does not necessarily translate into success in another.”\n\nRon remained undaunted as his curiosity and eagerness for new challenges led him to dabble in ventures in ride sharing, in replacing credit cards with digital signatures for e-commerce, and in online spreadsheet data innovations. His ride-sharing plan was hindered by procurement of driver resources, while simultaneously, a new company named Ubercab, later shortened to Uber, snagged the market. Working with the banking industry and promoting enhanced software design projects taught him the importance of committed partnerships and open information sharing.\n\nIn a recent blog posting, Ron wrote about the vagaries of entrepreneurship and his life’s adventures with same: “My tale of failed startups all somehow have added up to a good life at the end of the day. Of course, hitting the jackpot at Google didn’t hurt, but I really don’t think that was the whole story. I learned a lot. And I think my current happiness stems mainly from the fact that I like the person I’ve become, someone who can fail … and still find a way, for the most part, to be happy.”\n\nWith his wife Nancy, Ron shares a love for traveling the world including all seven continents and many island tours. Nancy is a photographer, environmentalist, and writer of poetry, plays, and novels. Her writings appear under the pen name of Eleanor Rogers.\n\nIn addition to Ron’s pursuits in screenwriting mentioned earlier, he also loves to write. He describes himself as an armchair quantum mechanic while observing that, “Quantum pedagogy goes back to the early 20th Century, but the right explanation wasn’t revealed until the 1960s and confirmed in the 1990s. I was never satisfied with the explanation being harder than it should be.” He wrote a paper titled “Quantum Mysteries Disentangled” that he presented at a Google Tech Talk in 2011, a lecture you can view online by searching Ron’s name and the paper’s title.\n\nHe also describes himself as a part-time blogger. Since 2003, he has posted “Rondam Ramblings,” sharing his thoughts on various scientific topics, as well as personal opinions and reflections.\n\nRon is working on a book about programming in Common Lisp for real-world applications. Lisp (List Processing) is one of the oldest, high-level coding languages still in use. Ron learned to program in Lisp as a teen, and he has continued to use updated versions of same throughout his professional career. Investigating more about Lisp, I learned that it was developed in 1958, and it became a favored language for artificial intelligence research. Common Lisp is considered a modern standardized version known for flexibility, powerful macro systems, and modifiable running applications.\n\nI feel Ron’s happiness lies in the excitement of a new challenge, both in his professional and personal life. Currently, Ron is involved in proprietary work as a senior hardware designer. You can be sure he is on the forefront of science and that he is once again seeing the future and making it happen.\n\nI admire the writings of theoretical physicist Brian Greene, and I am reminded of his comments on extraordinary feats of ingenuity: “Nothing quite focuses the mind like dissonant details awaiting harmonic resolution.” Ron is driven by a need for finding solutions to discordance, be it in scientific applications, business innovations, or the social milieu. Furthermore, Ron is a dreamer with an insatiable curiosity to understand, explain, and experience new adventures. His mind is wide open.\n\n***\n\nThank you, Benita, for an amazing story of Ron Garret and his lifelong experience of making things happen.\n\nD. Ray Smith is the city of Oak Ridge historian.

It's the latest run of dominance after their success in the early 2010s with four consecutive drivers' and constructors' world championships.\n\nOne man's been a constant during both periods of success: team principal Christian Horner. But Red Bull made a massive change this week by firing him after 21 years in the position.\n\nHorner was the longest-tenured team principal on the F1 grid. He's been in the sport longer than one of the current teams (Haas) and all but one current driver: Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso.\n\nCHRISTIAN HORNER FIRED: What led to Red Bull Formula 1 team principal's exit\n\nSky Sports obtained video showing some of Horner's farewell speech to team members at Red Bull's base in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.\n\n\"Yesterday I was informed by Red Bull that operationally I would no longer be involved with the business or the team moving forward from after this gathering,\" he said in the clip. \"I will still remain employed by the company but operationally the baton will be handed over. And that obviously came as a shock.\"\n\nRed Bull hired Horner ahead of the 2005 season, the team's first in the sport. Red Bull had bought the team formerly known as Jaguar Racing F1 Team and brought Horner in to usher in a new era.\n\nHe's been the team principal for all 124 of the team's wins in the sport. Only former McLaren boss Ron Dennis has overseen more in F1 history.\n\n\"What I have had time to do is to reflect over the last 12 hours or so and I wanted to stand in front of all of you and just express my gratitude to each and every single member of the team that has given so much during the last 20 and a half years,\" Horner said.\n\nLaurent Mekies will take over for Horner. He's set to make his debut as Red Bull team principal at the Belgian Grand Prix on July 27.\n\nPrior this move, Mekies had served as team principal at Racing Bulls, Red Bull's second team on the F1 grid.\n\nRed Bull sits fourth in constructors' standings which would be its worst result as a team since the 2015 season.\n\nChristian Horner firing reaction\n\nHorner's firing has drawn mixed reactions from across F1 media. Commentator David Croft – the voice of F1 on Sky Sports and ESPN's re-broadcast – posted on X that \"it doesn't get much bigger in F1\" than a firing like this.\n\nCroft's broadcast partner, Martin Brundle, said he was sad to hear of Horner's firing but wasn't completely surprised by the move.\n\n\"I don't think it's completely out of the blue, given the problems in the team,\" he wrote. \"It's not too difficult to feel in the F1 paddock and to observe and hear that things were not particularly rosy. ... It perhaps makes it more likely that the Verstappens will stay there – I think that became quite personal.\"\n\nHorner also faced an investigation into allegations of inappropriate behavior towards a female colleague in 2024. Red Bull cleared him of wrongdoing after an external investigation but that may have had an impact on his relationship with star driver Verstappen and his father, Jos.\n\nFox Sports' Will Buxton, who many will recognize from his appearances on the Netflix F1 series \"Drive to Survive,\" posted on X that this may be the right move at this time to keep Verstappen from getting signed away by rival Mercedes.\n\nVerstappen himself thanked Horner in a post to his Instagram page.\n\n\"From my first race win, to four world championships, we have shared incredible successes,\" he wrote. \"Winning memorable races and breaking countless records. Thank you for everything, Christian!\"\n\nRed Bull rankings in F1 history\n\nRed Bull's been a part of F1 for 21 seasons – all under Horner's watch – and has become one of the most accomplished teams in history.\n\nHere's a list of their team records and where they rank among all teams in F1 history:\n\nRaces: 405 (7th)\n\n405 (7th) Wins: 124 (4th)\n\n124 (4th) Podiums: 287 (5th)\n\n287 (5th) Pole positions: 107 (5th)\n\n107 (5th) Constructors' championships: 6 (6th)\n\n6 (6th) Drivers' championships: 8 (4th)\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.

Democratic incumbents in three of four competitive districts cruised to double-digit victories, with Rep. Mikie Sherrill of Montclair leading the pack with a 17-point win over Republican newcomer Paul DeGroot of Montville.\n\nThe exception was Rep. Tom Malinowski, the Democratic incumbent in the 7th Congressional District, who lost a challenge from Republican Tom Kean Jr. in a rematch of the 2020 race, closely watched as a national bellwether. But that hardly came as a shock. Congressional redistricting last year turned the 7th into friendlier Republican territory.\n\nBut Tuesday's results revealed some important political trends and dynamics that could shape the contours of politics in next few years. Here are some key takeaways.\n\nBacklash on abortion lingers\n\nSome Democratic strategists feared that candidates placed too much emphasis on abortion rights and not enough on pocketbook issues. Of primary concern to voters were curbing inflation or reducing crime. Polls found abortion to be a secondary issue, at best. The backlash over the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling in June, which revoked federal access to abortion, became a powerful motivator of women and young voters.\n\nIt became part of a larger warning of Republican extremism that could control the House agenda if they seize control.\n\n\"MAGA versus moderation,\" Malinowski said, in one of his talking points.\n\nSherrill and Rep. Josh Gottheimer of the 5th Congressional District also tapped the backlash fury in attack ads. One analyst argued Tuesday night that the backlash over Dobbs helped make the Malinowski-Kean race tighter than it should have been.\n\nSome national exit polling suggested that abortion mobilized voters.\n\nInflation and the economy proved the most important voting issue and motivated 51% of voters in exit polls that were conducted by the Associated Press and analyzed by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAfter the Dobbs decision, \"people understood now the danger of the Republican agenda. It took it from the theoretical to the real world,\" said Dan Bryan, a consultant for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nBut abortion was the single most important issue for a quarter of all voters and for a third of women under age 50, the Kaiser report found. It also cited exit polls from NBC News, which placed the importance of abortion even higher, with 32% of voters saying inflation was their top voting issue and abortion ranking second at 27%.\n\nMAGA v. moderation? Moderation wins\n\nTraditional middle-of-the-road moderation reasserted this fall, as Gottheimer, Sherrill and Malinowski pummeled their opponents as \"extremists\" who were out of step with mainstream New Jersey values.\n\nIn television ads, Gottheimer contrasted himself as the pro-police, problem-solver centrist concerned about rising property taxes while switching to images of his opponent, Frank Pallotta of Mahwah, in dark glasses as the narrator recited his anti-abortion position: \"Frank Pallotta: Too extreme for New Jersey.\"\n\nDemocrats looking for a winning formula might do well to emulate Gottheimer's \"brand of optimistic moderation\" said Bob Sommer, a political communications strategist.\n\nBut it also helps to have a stockpile of campaign cash to broadcast that message. Gottheimer and Sherrill amassed enormous war chests and were helped by a $2 million infusion of cash help from billionaire Mike Bloomberg near the end of the race. DeGroot and Pallotta lacked the resources to respond.\n\nKean: A moderate anew?\n\nA big test for Kean as he enters Congress will be if he is able to revert to his moderate pedigree. Will Kean become a foot soldier for a right leaning agenda?\n\nDuring the campaign, Kean leaned heavily to the right, campaigning as a pro-life Republican even though he insisted his long support for a woman's right to choose, and a defender of the \"Trump agenda.\" But Kean was careful not to get pinned down on which specific parts of the Trump agenda he supported.\n\nHe will find himself wedged between the hard right activists who will never believe he's sufficiently conservative, and the Malinowski Democrats whose convinced that he's a MAGA Republican.\n\nTargeting Pelosi fades as a tactic\n\nRepublicans have been casting Democratic candidates as rubber stamps for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for much of the last decade, and this year, it reached mantra-like intensity — even after the nation recoiled in horror at the attack of her husband, Paul, in their San Francisco home. Kean mentioned Pelosi so often in one debate that Malinowski mocked him for playing the \"Pelosi drinking game.\"\n\nThe Kean campaign could argue that it helped mobilize votes against Malinowski, but it offered little help to DeGroot, Pallotta or Bob Healey, the 3rd District Republican, who was defeated by Democratic incumbent Andy Kim, although Healey fastened more of his attacks on Kim as a Biden protege.\n\nRedistricting matters\n\nRedistricting is an issue that voters rarely pay close attention to, but it was likely the most important factor behind Malinowski's loss.\n\nThe new congressional district boundaries approved by the court-appointed tiebreaker left Malinowski with a district that was stocked by 30,000 more Republicans as of October, when compared to the older district. It also added Democratic towns that he didn't represent under the old map, like parts of Linden and Rahway in Union County. That forced him to redouble his outreach as a newcomer.\n\nThe map put Malinowski behind the eight-ball from the start, leading many prognosticators to predict a Kean victory. The map was also widely seen as a Machiavellian move by the Democratic party bosses.\n\nBut in hindsight, some supporters argue that it was unnecessary. Malinowski argues that he would have won if the 7th District wasn't sacrificed in the party's strategic planning.\n\n\"I think it was a mistake,'' Malinowski said in an interview Wednesday. \"Not so much because I'm upset about my own loss — in the larger scheme of things my own situation is not important — but holding on to the seat is important to Democrats when the House has been, and apparently will remain, narrowly divided.\"\n\nSue Altman, a progressive activist and Malinowski supporter, put it bluntly.\n\n\"There was enough Democratic votes to go around,'' she said pointing to the double digit victories of Sherrill, Kim and Gottheimer. \"And we played scared and compromised. We negotiated against ourselves when we didn't need to.\"\n\nSherrill's hard-hitting ad\n\nSherrill arguably produced the most aggressive, go-for-the-jugular attack ad of the campaign. It featured a veteran nurse, Maxine, warning that women \"will die\" because of DeGroot's position on abortion. He declared himself pro-choice, but supported the Dobb's decision directive to allow each state to craft its own abortion policies.\n\nOn one level, Sherrill's attack on a little-known and underfunded opponent was a symptom of the leave-no-stone-unturned anxiety that coursed through even safe Democratic district races. But on another level, it served as an audition, a way to show party chieftains that she won't be afraid to throw a punch if she runs for governor in 2025, as some predict.\n\nShe might face a crowded field. Other names being bandied about are Gottheimer, former Senate President Stephen Sweeney, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop.\n\nCharlie Stile is a veteran political columnist.

When winds were exceeding 70+ mph gusts, personnel sought shelter at the closest facility, but went right back to responding as soon as they could safely respond. During these winds, trees and power lines were falling down all around our personnel, but they were still committed to serving the citizens of Columbia County.\"\n\nThe department's initial focus was clearing roads for fire, EMS, and law enforcement to gain access, with the support of Columbia County Roads and Bridges and Army National Guard teams, according to Willis. Fire rescue proactively added four quick response units and a swift water rescue team several hours before the storm.\n\nSince then, fire rescue's strike teams have been gaining access to some of the hardest-hit areas, doing door-to-door searches – in addition to continuing to respond to regular calls for service.\n\nThe Columbia County 911 center processed more than 5,300 calls on the day of the storm, according to county data. Post-Helene, the department is still averaging 2,000 calls daily.\n\nWillis described the county's response to Helene as \"remarkable.\"\n\n\"The entire county has been running 24/7 operations led by Columbia County EMA - from Water Utility keeping our drinking water moving and safe, Broadband and Information Technology keeping communication lines running, Road and Bridges staff clearing roadways, fleet keeping vehicles and buildings running on generators, to county management providing guidance and support,\" he said. \"The entire team of Columbia County employees have had a non-stop attitude for the community. There came a time over the past week where they had to be made to take a break, because they didn’t want to stop.”\n\nEven though a week has passed since Helene made its way through the Augusta area, safety is still a concern.\n\nWillis provided the following tips for residents:\n\nDo not get around downed power lines. This is very dangerous, as you do not know if they are energized or could become energized during restorations.\n\nFollow all safety precautions using chainsaws or other equipment. If you are unsure of proper cutting techniques, call professionals to handle it.\n\nDo not run generators in the home or garage, as they produce carbon monoxide and also could pose a fire hazard.\n\nIf you have an emergency call 911. If you have questions about the storm, trees down, or other non-emergent issues, call 311.\n\n-Alexandra Koch\n\nThe Georgia Department of Transportation released the number of traffic lights with and without power Wednesday afternoon in Richmond and Columbia counties, and announced it is assisting in debris removal along the interstates.\n\nRichmond County currently has 92 traffic lights with power and 165 are either damaged or without power, according to GDOT.

affected by natural disasters, rolled into Augusta this week ready to prepare and serve Augusta area residents nearly 5,800 servings of food on Tuesday with more expected on Wednesday.\n\nWhat they didn’t expect was the emotion that would come with feeding so many Augusta families devastated by the Hurricane Helene\n\nCarter, a 34-year Walmart truck driver, wiped his dampening eyes while talking about what he saw Tuesday while serving Augustans who were without water and power for nearly a week.\n\nA little boy ran up to Carter after being given his food, looked up at him, and said, “I love you,” before reaching up for a hug.\n\n“How do you put that into words,” Carter said. “This is devastating. We've had people cry. To be able to help those folks is an honor.”\n\nAugustans were served a variety of protein, provided by partner Tyson Foods, along with mashed potatoes and gravy, a green bean medley, water, and ice.\n\nAs palettes disappeared from the parking lot, Carter reflected on the start of the program, which stemmed from a response to a tornado in Henryville, Indiana, nearly eight years ago.\n\n“I'm from Seymour, Indiana and I told my boss, ‘Let’s go down there and help folks,’” Carter said. “[My boss] said, ‘Carter, we sent them water.’ I asked him, ‘Did you have breakfast this morning?’ And he said, ‘Well, yeah.’ I said, ‘They haven't.’ That was the first [meal distribution] we ever did. I immediately called Rickey, because Rickey and I have done so many things in the past together, and Walmart said it would give us some [supplies] and see how it works out.”\n\nAfter proving Walmart drivers could come together to make the initiative happen, Walmart began expanding the program, allowing hundreds of its drivers from all over the country to provide assistance.\n\n“We've been very blessed to work for a company that puts its money where its mouth is.” Carter said. “I could retire, I'm 68 years old and will be 69 in November. I’m not going anywhere. I love what I do. … We don't have enough of this in the world. It’s not ‘I’ and ‘me’, it's ‘us,’ and ‘we’. If we could ever get back to that, we would be alright.”\n\nAugustans can pick up food, water and ice Wednesday between noon and 5 p.m. at the Walmart Supercenter in Augusta, located at 260 Bobby Jones Expressway.\n\n-Alexandra Koch\n\n6:15 a.m. Wednesday − Thousands more linemen expected to start work on Wednesday to repair power lines\n\nAs many as 8,000 linemen are expected to arrive in the Augusta area by Wednesday, said Augusta Mayor Garnett Johnson.\n\nAlready about 1,000 linemen had worked to restore power to thousands of Augusta area homes by Tuesday as the city continues recovery efforts following Hurricane Helene.\n\nTo read more about efforts to restore power, click here.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, will survey the impacts of Hurricane Helene and receive an on-the-ground briefing about recovery efforts in Augusta on Wednesday, according to the White House.\n\nBoth Biden, who is set to visit North Carolina and South Carolina on Wednesday, and Harris said they wanted to wait to visit storm-damaged areas so their presence would not pose disruptions during the immediate emergency response.\n\nThe speed, quality and disputes over federal aid could have election ramifications in the battleground states of North Carolina and Georgia, both ravaged by flooding.\n\nRead the full story HERE.\n\nThe National Weather Service on Tuesday announced a radar/EM confirmed tornado touched down near Vidette in Burke County.\n\nThe tornado touched down at 5:53 a.m. Thursday and was categorized as an EF0, with peak winds reaching 80 mph, according to a news release from the NWS.

He respects men and women who have oil-stained clothes, busted knuckles and grease under their nails. He appreciates people who do engine and body work themselves. It’s how he paid his way through school.\n\nThe son of a banker who expected his boy to find independence early, Farley at age 14 talked himself into a summer job rebuilding car engines in Southern California. And he’d sort old parts, like power steering pumps and brake shoes. When he saved up $500 to buy a black 1966 Mustang with a blown motor, he had the pony car towed to a work site and stayed in it for the rest of that summer.\n\n“Kinda like a Johnny Cash song,” Farley said. “After work was done, I worked on my engine and I built it one part at a time.”\n\nJames D. \"Jim\" Farley Jr., 56, is not a senior executive who hangs out at the yacht club sipping martinis. A friend who loved racing left Farley a vintage car two decades ago after securing his promise to drive it. So Farley took lessons and now travels the world competing. He says there’s nothing like driving the Le Mans track in France at 2 a.m. in the rain.\n\n“Properly tuned, my 1965 GT40 goes over 200 miles per hour,” he said. “When I get out of the car after a long hard race, you feel so calm and relaxed. It’s my yoga.”\n\nThis is the man assigned to guide Ford Motor Co. into the future.\n\nA grandfather's wish\n\nNo one could have predicted his path.\n\nWell, maybe his grandfather.\n\nBy the time Farley was 5 years old, he was being groomed by his grandfather Emmet Tracy, an early employee of company founder Henry Ford, who went on to run an auto parts business and a car dealership in Grosse Pointe.\n\nWhile other grandparents read Dr. Seuss, Tracy sat down with a stack of Automotive News when his grandson visited during Christmas and summer breaks. The two would drive past the Packard Plant, the Ford Piquette Plant and the Rouge Plant, where Tracy worked.\n\n“You’ve got to go to college because these are really tough jobs,” he told the child.\n\nEven now, Farley said, he can picture his grandfather arriving at the factory with his lunch pail as one of the nameless, faceless workers who built Model T's.\n\nAfter earning degrees in economics and computer science at Georgetown University and an MBA at UCLA in 1990, Farley scored job offers from Ford, General Motors and Toyota. At Ford, he would have concentrated on just one aspect of the F-Series truck. Toyota offered him the chance to focus on the whole car, specifically the launch of a new luxury brand no one had heard of — Lexus.\n\nDetroit could wait.\n\nAnd Lexus surged to dominance.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Farley paid a price privately.\n\nDisapproval in Detroit\n\n“I won’t go into it. But there were many, many, many tense moments for me,” Farley said. “My dad was a naval officer in World War II. Many of my relatives on my mom’s side here in Detroit, I think they were completely baffled by why I worked at Toyota. For my mom, she was so happy to see me come to Ford (in 2007). I myself was unaware of the social impact Toyota’s growth had in the U.S. on companies like Ford.”\n\nHe took chances at Toyota that paid off. Colleagues couldn’t believe when Farley requested assignment in Europe with no guarantees of a job when he returned two years later.\n\n“He wanted all the challenges,” said Dave Danzer, one of Farley’s earliest bosses at Toyota. “He wanted to learn the dealer experience. He wanted to work on small cars, which is a big deal in Europe. He wanted to go to plants and experience manufacturing and assembly. Jim was highly motivated, not so much by money and I don’t think by titles.”\n\nToyota recruited product planners from Stanford, Duke, Northwestern, UCLA, Michigan and California, Berkeley. What set Farley apart were not his prestigious degrees, because everyone had those.\n\n“He really loved cars — fast, beautiful, classic cars,” said Danzer, of Manhattan Beach, California, the retired group vice president, corporate planning for Toyota and Lexus in the U.S. and Mexico.\n\n“He worked around the clock. He had a very strong work ethic or he wouldn’t have made it at Toyota. He was demanding on himself and his people. He was very respectful of the Japanese, and he earned their trust.”\n\nToyota emphasized sales and marketing, Danzer said. It knew its products were good and the team needed to get the word to consumers.\n\n“We grew every month for 20 years at Toyota,” Farley said. \"It was all about new opportunity, new growth, finding new products that didn’t exist in the market.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ford presented a stark contrast to Toyota.\n\n\"It was a new experience, consolidating and shrinking to grow the business, like we went through at Ford in 2007,\" Farley said, \"and what we’re doing in Europe and South America now. We had to get the size and cost structure down to a point where it was healthy so we could grow again. Same thing we’re doing now.”\n\nHe spent three years in Europe implementing a turnaround plan for Ford, oversaw the multi-billion-dollar operation, and stopped the bleeding. From 2015-17 as president of Ford Europe, he executed a plan that led to record profitability, record margins and increased sales.\n\nSince Farley's departure, conditions for Ford Europe have taken a dramatic turn for the worse. The company has cut thousands of jobs amid uncertainty related to Brexit, the bungled British attempt to exit the European Union.\n\nIn his current role, Farley doesn’t oversee manufacturing or operations. That’s in the hands of Joe Hinrichs. Farley is leading Automotive 2.0, the Ford program for such things as autonomous vehicles and big data. He is the future.\n\nFord CEO Jim Hackett, 64, named his top two lieutenants on April 10. Either one is a potential successor.\n\nOf the non-retiring top-paid Ford executives identified in 2018 regulatory filings, Farley has the second longest tenure; Hinrichs, 52, has been with the company longer than anyone not named Ford.\n\nWatched in awe\n\nAfter 12 years, Farley speaks of his former employer with admiration.\n\n“Coming from Toyota, where we were always growing ... there was a paranoia for trying to do better,\" Farley said. \"I feel that people are satisfied with just growth itself and improving profits. But I’ve learned that kaizen (Toyota's famed process for continuous improvement) means that even when things are going really well, that’s actually the most important time to feel like there’s more — more opportunity.”\n\nLifers at Ford say the company can be feudal. People complain that investing in political gamesmanship can garner favor that translates to job security.\n\nAt Toyota, Farley was labeled a rising star. He spent nearly two decades at the Japanese company as it relentlessly built its reputation, profit and market share. The Detroit Three watched in awe.\n\n“In product planning, you have to make bets that aren’t clear to the competition and sometimes not even to the customers,” Farley explained. “You have to make choices to go to parts of the market that either don’t exist or are very underdeveloped. At the time, there may not be evidence of why to do that. But those that do get handsomely rewarded.”\n\n'I couldn't care less about Detroit'\n\nAs a young product planner at Toyota, Farley spent nearly six months writing a paper of nearly 70 pages for a presentation.\n\n“My boss was like, 'Farley, what is this?' ” he recalled, laughing.\n\nDanzer, who worked at General Motors before Toyota, said he can't forget the epic Lexus product proposal created by Farley, even after all these years.\n\n“He gave me 'Moby Dick' and I was expecting CliffsNotes. I just wanted a crisp and concise recommendation,\" Danzer said. \"I worked 16 years for Chevrolet and General Motors. Everybody got into the habit of how big the words are that you use, how pretty it looked, like things were made for publication. At Toyota, you have half an hour to sell an idea, and that's including intense Q&A: Here’s the issue. Here’s the impact on us. Here are three ways we can go, and then the pros and cons. Here's the recommendation with charts, graphs and bullet points. Usually four pages or less, no big words.”\n\nFarley went on to play key roles in developing the Lexus luxury brand, launching the Toyota Scion to connect with young drivers and unveiling the Toyota Tundra pickup in an audacious effort to challenge Ford and Chevy.\n\nWhen Detroit critics questioned his debuting products at nightclubs and underground art venues in 2003, the New York Times quoted Farley saying, “I couldn’t care less about Detroit.”\n\nHe predicted that one day Detroit would follow his lead.\n\n“Toyota was my life,” Farley said. “These were my friends.”\n\nLife stopped\n\nBy 2006, Ford was looking for new blood and new direction. Bill Ford Jr. hired Alan Mulally from Boeing to guide the company. Mulally, who drove a Lexus when he came to Detroit, publicly declared that he would benchmark Ford against Toyota. Soon, getting Farley onto the team would become part of the strategy.\n\nIn fall 2007, Farley and the Ford CEO met in a lobby of a private hangar at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\n“I watched Jim get out of his car,” Mulally told the New York Times. “I remember his hello, his eye contact, his questions, how articulate and genuine he was. I knew right then this was the person I wanted.”\n\nThe talks went well. And then tragedy struck. The plan was put on hold.\n\nLia Farley gave birth to twins prematurely and, after complications, the infants died.\n\nLife came to a screeching halt.\n\nAfter weeks of reflection, Jim Farley chose Detroit.\n\nHe left a thriving, healthy company to join a rescue squad.\n\nIn his first meetings with Ford, upon arrival from California, he spoke in brutal realities. The economy was tanking.\n\n“I don’t have much time,” Farley told Automotive News in November 2007 as Ford's new marketing chief. “I’m here to break through the clutter in a very honest way and tell U.S. customers, in any way you can, you’ve got to look at Ford.”\n\nLooking back, Farley says that people misunderstood impatience for anger.\n\n“I was brought from another company because of my experience,” he told the Free Press in May 2019. “My value was to change the product. There were some people who thought they should be in the job I was in, or maybe felt like we needed more time to study things in ’08. We didn’t have time. We were out of time.”\n\nHe paused. “How do you put it? When you’re the person who gets off the train in the Wild West, the guy with the black hat on who’s hired to deal with the bad actor in town, there’s a piece to it that isn’t democratic.”\n\nThe culture contrast between Ford and Toyota was profound. Toyota was stable while Ford was cutting jobs, closing factories and selling off assets.\n\n'Shocked'\n\nMulally was the only auto CEO in Detroit who managed to avoid bankruptcy during the economic collapse. He famously mortgaged everything, even the Blue Oval logo, and put together a plan.\n\nWhile rivals GM and Chrysler were mandated by the government to overhaul cost structure and operations, Ford had to execute through internal struggle.\n\nRemember, Mulally was a leader who shocked the Motor City when he confessed in September 2006 to driving a Lexus because it was “the finest car in the world,\" wrote Free Press columnist Tom Walsh at the time. Mulally \"knows Lexus cars are better than anything currently in Ford's lineup, and he doesn't care if Ford employees or the media hear him say it out loud.\"\n\nThat is the bold leadership Farley joined.\n\nMulally created a new position for Farley, making him the first vice president of marketing and communication at Ford.\n\n'A big, huge hairy idea'\n\nToday, some Ford employees complain Farley refuses to assimilate to the company culture. They don't like that he doesn't really “blend.” But Farley wasn’t hired to blend. He was recruited from a championship team to work magic. He still has harsh critics.\n\nAfter Farley was promoted in April to president of new business, technology and strategy, Peter DeLorenzo wrote on Autoextremist.com that “Ford’s chief bad actor and enfant terrible’ was “clearly being moved off to the side.”\n\nThe blogger, who consulted for Ford until Farley decided not to renew the contract, referred to Farley in October 2018 as “Jim ‘I’m a genius, just ask me’ Farley, Ford’s self-appointed all-knowing — and all-tedious — marketing guru.\"\n\nBut many people who work with Farley say he is a genius. Even some skeptics within the company said Farley gets the job done without fail. And he's tireless.\n\n“He’s very, very intense,” said Janet Lawson, who was with the Ford Fund. “Sometimes people are needy, I think. They need those pats on the back to say, ‘You like what I’m saying, right?’ If they don’t get those attaboys from him, they take it personally. Jim is not thinking about that. He’s 30,000 feet above sea level. He doesn’t think in straight lines. He thinks in spirals. I would want my tomorrow in Jim Farley’s hands. He is wicked smart.”\n\nUpon arriving in Detroit more than a decade ago, Farley and Lawson have crossed paths through volunteer work.\n\n“He knows who he is and what he’s about,\" Lawson said. \"If people don’t understand him, I could see how they might feel threatened. People like the status quo. Jim is an interrupter. He’s not afraid of a big, huge hairy idea and not afraid to make it happen. He’s just never afraid. And he’s a perfectionist. It’s intimidating to other people who don’t work that hard.”\n\nBill Ford was quoted in the New York Times in April 2008, saying, “Intense is a good description of Jim, incredibly intense. He feels everything.”\n\nFewer f-bombs\n\nKenneth Williams, an autonomous vehicle digital experience manager, works with Farley now.\n\n“He is very direct and focused on outcomes,” Williams said. “What you notice in a lot of leadership is they tend to not want to make that decision as quickly. If you send material before a meeting, Jim will read it and jump right to pages that matter. It’s refreshing. He gets it: Let’s just do what we need to do. He’s not stuck in process. Sometimes he’ll cut you off, because it’s not about having hours of dialogue. It’s about getting to the answer.”\n\nFarley has earned a reputation over the years as someone with a temper. Others say he’s simply passionate. He doesn’t drop the f-bomb like he used to. He is older now.\n\n“He’s a guy in a position that has to make tough calls, not where you’re making friends,” said Robbie Buhl, 55, a former IndyCar driver and friend since childhood. “If Ford is going to be around and thriving in five years, the culture has got to change. If it doesn’t change, the company won’t be around.”\n\nBuhl, whose family members were mayors of Detroit in the 1800s, refurbished the Corktown site that houses Ford workers known as Team Edison.\n\n“Jim would be a tough guy to work for because he’s so demanding. He’s a workaholic and he’s bright,” Buhl said. “I’m not a gushy lovey type person with friends, family or anybody. So you can qualify that how you want. But he’s got to figure out what the new world is, how things are going to happen in this world of electrification and mobility and whatever that is.”\n\nDetroit versus Silicon Valley\n\nFarley is known to reach out at the end of the day or write private notes after a project to acknowledge he pushed everyone hard but wanted to say thanks, said Ford employees.\n\n“Jim is not a typical executive. He’s definitely a provocative leader. He pushes, he makes you think,” said Sherif Marakby, CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles, who recently returned to Ford after a stint with Uber. “Projecting the future no one knows is something Jim is really good at.”\n\nHaving worked briefly at Uber, Marakby recognizes qualities in Farley that people in Detroit find unusual.\n\n“In Silicon Valley, people are more blunt, more direct, and people don’t take it personally,” Marakby said. “I had to adjust to that, too, when I was there. At the same time, you know where people are coming from and it doesn’t bother you. If you come to a culture of an industry company, and try to do that, people see it as different.”\n\n'Hard to bluff'\n\nFarley enjoys dropping interesting nuggets, like autonomous vehicles are so common in Pittsburgh that people don’t even notice anymore.\n\nPlain talk is comforting to many of the 3,000 Ford dealers who watch to see what the future will bring, said Charlie Gilchrist, who lives in Weatherford, Texas, and runs eight dealerships.\n\n“There were a lot of things dealers had to do to help Ford survive. Hard decisions. Those were rough times,” he said of the Great Recession. “It thrilled us to have someone like Jim.”\n\nWhen dealers hated ads, they told Farley. When dealers attacked Ford’s credibility in the marketplace, Farley listened. And then he would do things like take engineers to dealerships to show farmers about the soybean-based foam-filled car seats. He wanted to instill confidence and enthusiasm.\n\n“Jim wants to know the truth. He wants to know what you feel,” Gilchrist said. “He wants results. You can call him and he’ll be in another part of the world and answer his phone or call you back. And he always answers your question with a question.”\n\nThe style is imported from Toyota. Colleagues say the team is taught never to just accept an answer but to drill down for more. If you say dealers can sell a product for a certain price, Toyota wants to know how many dealers, where they’re based and how their opinions compare to dealers elsewhere.\n\n“It’s hard to bluff a good Japanese businessman,” Danzer said.\n\nMopping, scrubbing\n\nA Ford employee who heard a piece was being written about Farley reached out and said, “Please remember that Jim Farley is a real guy.”\n\nIt seems, as public as he is, few really know him.\n\nHe shows up at 6 a.m. on Saturdays every once in awhile to serve meals at the Pope Francis Center. Or mop the floor. Or scrub the kitchen stove. Or staff the front desk when people come for showers.\n\n“He just wants to be an average Joe helping to serve the vulnerable,” said Father Tim McCabe, executive director of the shelter formerly known as the warming center of Saints Peter and Paul Jesuit Church. \"His grandfather used to bring him down when he was little. Now Jim brings his children.”\n\nOn his first day serving meals, two men started shouting and swearing. The priest was trying to get the situation under control.\n\n“He saw I was embarrassed and said, 'Don’t worry. That happens at Ford all the time,' \" Father Tim recalled Farley saying. “Jim just always puts people at ease. He sees people who struggle with maintaining any kind of sense of reality because of mental illness, like hearing voices and talking to people who aren’t there. These are people who are deeply wounded by their lives. Jim is someone who understands struggle.\"\n\nSaying goodbye to Chris Farley\n\nJim Farley isn't without regret.\n\nWhen he took the job with Toyota, he moved to Torrance and left his cousin Chris Farley behind in LA. That same year, Chris Farley joined the cast of \"Saturday Night Live\" on NBC. He had sought treatment for drug and alcohol addiction throughout his adult life, and Jim Farley tried to protect the family member who made everyone laugh. Between 1990 and 1997, the comedian surged to stardom with TV and film roles. He died at 33.\n\nThe auto executive talks privately of guilt mixed with sadness and wonders whether being closer to his cousin all those years ago, and spending more time together, could have saved his life.\n\n“When I was younger, I was so happy for Chris. We were all happy for Chris in our big, large Irish family. At reunions, Chris was always the star. A lot of other people found that out through 'Saturday Night Live,'” Jim Farley said.\n\n“When he passed away, it was very sad for all of us on a personal level. People would bring it up, and say he was great, but it was a lot of conflicting emotions. I lived in Los Angeles when Chris was doing events and movies. I’d see a lot of Chris. He was going through fame, dealing with being a Wisconsin boy exposed to so much. I’m not just a fan, I’m family. So I’m caring for him, and making sure he was OK. Time heals things. I remember meeting Marino Franchitti, a famous race car driver, and he said, 'Tommy Boy’s my favorite movie.' ”\n\nTommy is the name of Jim Farley’s uncle.\n\n“Chris’ humor, in many ways, came from his dad, my father’s brother,” Jim Farley said. “They loved old movies. I remember hearing so many times Chris talk to his dad about a character he was thinking about, like from old movies. My dad was a senior banker with Citibank. He was very proud of his profession.\n\n\"He lived in South America for 20 years and spoke fluent Spanish. My dad joined the Navy to see the world after he left Wisconsin for Georgetown, and never really came back. He lived in Montreal, New York City. My dad was very dapper, a big city guy. But my uncle graduated from Georgetown, as well, and went back to Wisconsin and started an asphalt company — the premise of 'Tommy Boy' was about Chris’ life with his dad, traveling Wisconsin and selling to local farmers who happened to be county road commissioners on the side.”\n\nAsked about his childhood, Jim Farley stops for a minute to think. He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and spent his early years there. Later, his family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut. His parents met in Grosse Pointe. And his mother always considered herself \"a Detroit girl,\" so happy to come home to friends and family.\n\n“Mom drove one of those monstrous wood-paneled station wagons where we sat in the back facing each other,” he said. \"Every summer we’d travel cross-country and go up to northern Michigan. These are my fondest memories.”\n\nHarsh feedback, tears\n\nBuilding relationships, and investing in them, matters to Farley.\n\nLee Jelenic, 39, of Birmingham surprised friends at Wharton when he chose Ford Motor Co. over Wall Street a decade ago. One factor was the chance to work with Farley.\n\n“I think for a long time he was a misunderstood leader. We've all evolved,” said Jelenic, who recently left Ford to become a chief innovation officer outside the auto industry. “Jim would just call from Europe and offer thoughts with every new job I had. He demands a lot of his team and himself. He pushed me to go faster and think bigger.”\n\nAfter Jelenic packed to go, he requested a final meeting with Farley and described becoming overwhelmed with emotion.\n\n“He was always trying to make me better,” Jelenic said. “Early on, he would say, ‘You talk too much.’ And I did. I needed to get the point. I started as an intern and left as a CEO of Ford Commercial Solutions. It’s easy to pat everyone on the back. He gave harsh, honest feedback. He demands perfection. And he is brilliant.”\n\nJelenic said it was Farley's leadership in digital media that unleashed the Fiesta Movement, the insane idea of giving to 100 millennial drivers the keys to Ford Fiestas, then asking the drivers to post on social media about their experiences. “It was a big risk. They could’ve said whatever they wanted,” Jelenic said. “His vision is always to push to do something different. We used the voice of the customer.\"\n\nThe Harvard Business Review credited Farley's direction on the \"sensational\" strategy, which attracted more than 6.5 million views on YouTube and thousands in immediate car sales for Ford at very little cost.\n\nNo cigars\n\nThese days, Farley lives alone in an apartment near Campus Martius in downtown Detroit. His family is based in London. His travel is so extensive that they could be living anywhere. The Detroit apartment is filled with images of old cars and motorcycles and stacks and stacks of books. After living there 1½ years, he has read about 70 books, and just replaces the finished one with something new each time.\n\n“Not one of them is a business book,” Farley said. “I’m reading one now about the history of our country. Before that? How to raise your daughters. The one before that was a submarine technology book. Every one of these helps me think about my job. I process what to do at work while I read.”\n\nTimes have changed in the auto industry.\n\nBack when a cigar-smoking executive lived in Bloomfield Hills and dreamed up the next fin size and design, well, those days are done, Farley said.\n\nHe feels like he’s a product planner all over again.\n\n“In 1988, there was an emerging segment called crossovers and there were no crossovers. There was a Suzuki sidekick and a couple Jeep products,” he said. “No one dreamed up a thing like a crossover, which was taking a car platform like a Camry, raise it up, improve the interior for the same overall length that’s easier to get in and out of, because the hip point to the seat was more natural to the standing position of a human. Get a higher drive position, so you can look over the sedans. Now it’s the main body style in our industry 20 years later.”\n\nAs for the future, Farley says old cars versus autonomous vehicles presents a false choice. He sees driverless cars as important for commuters who lack mass transit, single parents who can’t leave work to drive children to their lessons, older people needing to get to medical appointments and people who want their freedom but can’t drive.\n\n“AV tech will change lives,” he said. \"I remember my dad was the captain of his Lincoln ship. There came a time it just wasn’t safe. I remember the look on this face, you can’t do this. It’s not fair. “\n\nFamily struggle has shaped Farley, who described his younger brother in Ann Arbor as a wonderful man with a medical condition that has required him to live in a hospital for long periods.\n\n“He has never driven. He will never be able to drive. An automated vehicle will change his life,” Farley said. “My sister is an orthopedic surgeon because of him. He went through so much as a child. And he never complains. When people say ‘Jim’s rather intense,’ if they could see me around my brother or family, I think they’d feel differently.”\n\n'Dirt poor'\n\nIf he wasn’t working for a global corporation, Farley said he would be working on old cars somewhere. He speaks enough Japanese, Spanish and French to get by. He is glad he worked as a janitor at the start of his two-year stint at a restoration shop run by the famous Phil Hill in Santa Monica.\n\n“We took cars that were pieces and created masterpieces,” Farley said. “These were vehicles from the 1920s and 1930s. They were owned by the shah of Iran and the maharishis of India. Phil Hill was the first American to win the Formula One championship. He loved opera, he spoke fluent Italian and he was a car whisperer. And I was dirt poor putting myself through grad school.”\n\nFarley added, “When I meet with my designers now, I think of people like Phil Hill. They can’t even express why they think something looks beautiful but they can create it. You have to let people like that do their job. You can’t overthink it.”\n\nAll these years later, his childhood shapes the present.\n\nAt the end of his summer job working on cars in California, Farley's parents sent him an airplane ticket to go home. So he traded the ticket for gas money and drove his black Mustang cross-country with no spare tire — “I couldn’t afford that” — and a case of Coca-Cola.\n\n“Unfortunately, I had to stop pretty often to go to the bathroom. When I showed up in northern Michigan … my dad was like, 'what are you doing here?' I said, 'I drove.' He said, ‘drove what?’ I said, ‘I drove my car.’ They weren’t very pleased.”\n\nHundreds in the crowd at the Automotive News World Congress during the Detroit auto show cheered the story on that January night. He didn't even have a driver's permit.\n\n“But I never got stopped. I met the most fascinating people. I got terrible gas mileage in Vegas. I went to a gas station, was running out of money, a guy helped me tune it up in the back of his gas station. My lights went out in the middle of the desert. It was an awesome trip.”\n\nHundreds in a ballroom at the Marriott cheered again.\n\nOutside the spotlight, Farley walks parking lots and eavesdrops on people to better understand the way they live. When other car companies are testing autonomy, Farley is urging his team to listen to what people need in their daily routine.\n\n'What are you doing?'\n\n“It’s kind of funny, my dad used to get mad at me for watching racing. He was like, ‘What are you doing?’ I’m like, “I’m watching the Daytona 500.’ He’s like, 'That’s a waste of time.' I said, 'Not to me.' \"\n\nThing is, racing isn’t about who can go the fastest. Racing is an analytical process if you understand how it works, Buhl said. “If you want to be good at it, there are formulas.\" You need to know the radius through a corner to know how fast to go. There’s a lot more to racing cars than who can hold the gas (pedal) down the longest.”\n\nAttention to detail is Farley's money key.\n\n“Jim is an American muscle car guy,\" Buhl said. \"His new role is very challenging. I’m not sure I’d want to try and figure out how to make money and thrive in the new world of automobiles.\"\n\nDon't worry, Farley said. There's no fighting technology, and no reason to be afraid.\n\n“I’m really focused on making change that matters and change is difficult,\" Farley said. \"But for me, it’s why I get up in the morning.”\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: 313-222-6512 orphoward@freepress.com.Follow her on Twitter@phoebesaid.

It’s an intimate – perhaps too intimate – setting for this early in the morning, as the coffee flows, jokes roll and the interview session is almost off the rails a minute after the recorders are turned on.\n\n“Is this all on the record?” one reporter asks, only mildly jokingly.\n\nAnd in the middle of the table sits Rossi, legs crossed, munching on a green apple, stone-faced as can be, sitting next to IndyCar’s two most gregarious stars in Kanaan and Pato O'Ward. In normal interview settings, the 31-year-old IndyCar star will speak when spoken to and give you thoughtful answers (if you don’t ask a dumb question), but he and his fascinating career move are the early focus of this conversation, and you might he'd rather be just about anywhere else.\n\nUntil you start to pay attention and you realize that maybe, just maybe, this is his role.\n\nJust because Alexander Rossi is almost the polar opposite of Kanaan and O’Ward in many ways – interestingly, Kanaan says he longs to be more like Rossi on the radio in his final IndyCar race this weekend – doesn’t mean he’s out of place. Maybe the driver who was once IndyCar’s most misunderstood newbie, turned into its Most Popular Driver (awarded after the 2020 season), has finally discovered who he is.\n\nOr maybe, better put, we have.\n\nAnd now, he seems to have found his home. One that feels as if it’s tailormade for him and his introverted, uber-competitive, at times obsessive personality that, in the IndyCar paddock, is one-of-one.\n\n“I think he’s really embraced the way we all work together. I don’t have experience working in a Ganassi, Andretti or Penske team, but I think the way we work (at Arrow McLaren) is very different from the rest of the paddock,” O’Ward said that morning. “The way we do strategy, we do it together, and we help each other. Ultimately, if we have cars 1st-4th, that’s what we want; and for me, it’s no help if I have teammates that are 15th or 20th, and I’m leading – or vice versa.\n\n“I do think (Rossi gives) an aura of being a bit of a tool, though, but I don’t agree. I think he’s a cool guy.”\n\nOne reporter asks for clarification on just what ‘tool’ means. “Are we talking nerd?”\n\nSays O’Ward: “No, like an (expletive). But I hadn’t personally had time to spend with him, so I think he can come off like that.”\n\nThrough all of this, Rossi continues his work on his morning snack, waiting for his opening, until Kanaan references Rossi’s serenity on the radio (and the Brazilian driver’s jealousy of it) the previous weekend during the GMR Grand Prix. Tire degradation was front-and-center and the typically near-silent driver on the radio actually spoke up, saying, “Guys, I need help.”\n\n“Imagine if you’d had that 30 years ago,” one reporter noted.\n\n“I wish!” Kanaan exclaimed.\n\n“No, 50,” muttered Rossi, referencing the ever-popular birth certificate joke that has followed the 48-year-old through his decades in the paddock.\n\nWhy Alexander Rossi left Andretti\n\nIt’s not so much that Rossi has ‘finally’ found a home, because his seven-year tenure at Andretti Autosport was, quite frankly, all he could’ve asked for, even if he didn’t know it. At 31, Rossi has made what some might view as the first forward-focused career move of his IndyCar tenure. Joining Andretti Autosport was, at least intially, a move of convenience, as he briefly held out hope that the F1 world wouldn’t forget about him.\n\nAnd then, when it did forget about him – and, frankly, to Rossi that past life became the ex-girlfriend whose phone number you finally muster up the strength to delete – and he was winning races, why would he ever leave? His house had become a home.\n\nThat was, until the warranty expired, the basement flooded, fuses blew and the HVAC system came sputtering to a halt.\n\nThere’s the car that wouldn’t start in Texas, which, in 2020, was quickly followed by the mechanical issues on the IMS road course. There were multiple crashes (of no fault of Rossi's) before the green flag. The questionable pitlane penalty in the 2020 500 and the terribly-timed yellow the next (2021).\n\nThe list goes on-and-on, and none of it includes the otherwise forgettable weekends when the team seemed simply unable to figure out how to account for the aeroscreen’s added weight – particularly for one of the paddock’s tallest full-time drivers.\n\nAnd once they did, Andretti’s No. 27 Honda program with Rossi still never could quite find its footing again. Depending on who you talk to – Michael Andretti and Rossi have slightly different recollections -- Rossi had his mind made up (or nearly-made up) about closing the Andretti Autosport chapter early in the summer of 2021 with well over a year left on his deal.\n\nRossi’s time with the team, where he’d found a genuine love for IndyCar, experienced the greatest joy in the series (winning the 100th Indinapolis 500 in 2016) and struck lifelong friendships from engineers and mechanics to the team’s owner (Andretti) and its COO (Rob Edwards).\n\n“It was pretty simple, really. It all came down to the point, ‘Do I want to continue in the current place or take another opportunity now when my contract’s up?’” explains Rossi in a matter-of-fact way. It’s the emotionless – or rather, the way he’s been trained to remove emotion from the equation – view of the world when the situation requires it. It’s not that he’s the robot some perceived him to be in his early IndyCar years, but instead how he's learned through back-stabbing after back-stabbing on the European ladder system, that there’s no room in this business to do something that’s not of your own best interest.\n\nBecause no one else will return you the favor.\n\n“I found myself wanting to be involved in (Arrow McLaren’s) growth and what they’ve accomplished from 2020-22 – in beating Andretti in a lot of ways,\" Rossi said. \"It was a team that was on an upward trajectory with a seemingly infinite runway and opportunity ahead of them. It’s an amazing organization that anyone would be lucky to be a part of.\n\n“When we did this (three-year) extension (with Andretti in 2019), we were coming off two championship-contending years. The momentum was massive, and there were a lot of high expectations and high aspirations from myself, the team, the series, Honda … and none of those expectations were met. So I don’t think it was a shock to anyone when the time came to start having those conversations about renewals or extensions that it wasn’t an instant yes.”\n\nBut in this way, Rossi’s story is unique in this latest era of IndyCar. Stars are born. Stars retire, fade away or hang on for dear life. But stars of this sport never, in the last 15 years, jump from one title-contending ride to another. Dario Franchitti was the last – and even he required a year toiling away in NASCAR to foster his move from Andretti to Ganassi.\n\nThink of the 500 and title winners since:\n\n>>Scott Dixon (still with Ganassi)\n\n>>Helio Castroneves (still around, but not in the same way as his Penske days)\n\n>>Dan Wheldon (tragically passed away)\n\n>>Tony Kanaan (500 win gave his career a second wind, but only after three years in the mid-pack)\n\n>>Ryan Hunter-Reay (down to 500 one-offs after leaving Andretti)\n\n>>Juan Pablo Montoya (down to 500 one-offs after leaving Penske)\n\n>>Takuma Sato (left Andretti after his 2017 500 win for mid-pack RLL, won again, but was rarely relevant)\n\n>>Will Power (still with Penske)\n\n>>Simon Pagenaud (with MSR after his Penske contract ran out)\n\n>>Marcus Ericsson (still with Ganassi)\n\n>>Josef Newgarden (still with Penske)\n\n>>Alex Palou (still with Ganassi … for now)\n\nNone left their cushy seats atop the sport or found another when either they or their bosses felt it was time to part ways.\n\nNot until Rossi.\n\n“You look at the longevity for a Scott (Dixon) or a (Will) Power, there’s championships that went along with that,” Rossi said.\n\nRossi can be the first of that group to choose to walk from one title-contending seat to another without any guilt or second thought to the ride and people that finally gave him a stable home. And, perhaps, that’s precisely because of those unstable seven years spent in Europe on the cusp of childhood F1 dreams he wouldn't reach.\n\nWhy Alexander Rossi didn't make it in F1\n\nHaving won the Formula BMW Americas title and the Formula BMW World Final in 2008, Rossi found himself on a plane to Europe at 17. His teenage life was packed in bags with an F1 test, super license and F1 test driver role with BMW Sauber. He moved in with his trainer for more than six months in Italy, speaking hardly a word of the language before finding his way to England for the better part of his final six years there.\n\nFor an American, in a country dealing with financial crisis at the time, finding backing was incredibly hard, and he bopped around numerous teams between Formula Renault 3.5 and what are now known as Formula 3 and Formula 2. But he kept on winning. Fourth in GP3 (2010). Third in Formula Renault (2011). Second in GP2 (2015). It was enough to catch the eyes of the likes of Ferrari.\n\nFor a moment, his father, Pieter Rossi, told IndyStar, Rossi was earmarked for the young driver academy of F1’s most famous, historic – and at the time, successful – team. As an American driver with Italian roots and deep childhood F1 dreams, what could be better?\n\n“If you go there and pound a big drum, they’ll spit you out like you’re cocky or have a chip on your shoulder. I think he played the game the right way,” the elder Rossi said. “But they don’t play fair. They play fair here. They don’t play fair there, but life’s not fair.\n\n“We were ‘thisclose’ to having him in the Ferrari Academy, but there’re drivers that are still around that are the reason he’s not. We got the phone call, and they wanted to sign him, and it got pulled out for political reasons – money, lot of influence. There were a lot of other opportunities that came forward (with various now defunct F1 teams) and he was the one that built those. But his one clean shot with a works team was with Ferrari, and there was a glimmer of hope, until two other sources that wanted the seat came in.”\n\nOther offers came, including test or reserve driver roles with Caterham and Marussia (and later Manor Marussia), but because these were independently-owned teams run by wealthy owners heavily focused on trying to make a buck, if they were going to run at the back of the grid, they were almost always going to prioritize funding over talent.\n\n“There’s a long list of guys that brought $10 (million), $20 (million), even $30 million a year for those rides,” Pieter Rossi said, noting Alexander was earmarked to land one of Caterham’s F1 seats in 2014. “And at the last minute, it was swept out from underneath us, and he’s doing (practice sessions) as the reserve driver while someone else is bringing a sack of money.\n\n“Did that shape who he is? He realized at that point that he is who he is. He’d do FP1s, and he’d be quicker than the race drivers, and then had to come in, put a headset on and watch it.”\n\nFinally, Rossi got to run five F1 races in 2015, becoming the first American driver in the sport since Scott Speed (2006-07) while finishing 2nd in F2 that season. He was supposed to get a full-time seat in 2016, and then the team went bankrupt. The elder Rossi took the calls from Michael and Mario Andretti far more seriously.\n\nAnd as Rossi's car gently coasted across the Yard of Bricks, miraculously taking the checkered flag of the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500 in one of the all-time strategy thrillers, he finally stopped looking in his rearview mirrors. But the 25-year-old was thrust into Victory Lane with a dumbstruck look and a level of emotions that didn’t quite match the historic moment. Rossi has since explained all of that away, putting to bed rumors he was unappreciative or dismissive of the Greatest Spectacle in Racing, while admitting that, in the moment, he didn’t quite know how to feel.\n\nHe hadn’t grown up dreaming of being an Indy 500 winner, quite frankly, and not until he reached the north short chute on the final lap could he have really though he and Bryan Herta were going to pull off the miracle.\n\n“I think (Europe) shaped who he was a little, to have a bit of a thick skin,” his father said. “What you see on the outside isn’t a chip on his shoulder. It’s a bit of, over there, he built a lot of relationships but also learned you can’t really trust anybody.\n\n“You can trust the people here. You can let your guard down a little and enjoy life. Working in F1 and being in that paddock is very hard. There’s not a lot of happy people in that paddock.”\n\n'The best pool guy in central Indiana'\n\nSeven years later, Rossi is happy, in his own way. The way in which he’s molded the high-class persona of someone who, famously “has never been to Old Navy” with that of a middle-aged midwestern dad who roams his driveway for 45 minutes plucking weeds from the crevices is uniquely Rossi.\n\nHe took a 48-hour crash course on pool maintenance when his pool guy messed things up “to become the best pool guy in central Indiana, and I believe he’s probably done it,” says good friend and former teammate James Hinchcliffe. Rossi finds trimming rose bushes “soothing” and considers himself “an expert.” He loves Tom Brady strictly for his greatness. A couple years ago, he went to a friend’s barbecue, tasted homemade brisket, bought a smoker the next day and soon was inviting friends over for a dinner ... then freaked out last-minute and bought all the fixings for burgers, just in case.\n\nAnd while we were all baking bread and binging Tiger King during the pandemic, Rossi was teaching himself to fly. “I wanted to play a musical instrument, and I tried watching some YouTube videos on that, but to be honest with you, flying a plane is much easier,” Rossi said a couple years back on his weekly podcast with Hinchcliffe and mutual friend Tim Durham, ‘Off Track with Hinch and Rossi.’\n\n“He’s definitely the most competitive person I’ve ever met,\" Durham said. \"We have a joke with my mom and stepdad, that we have to get a tape measurer out when we’re playing bocce and Alex is coming over. He will argue about every point, and I respect the hell out of that. Why get into something if you’re not going to try and be the best?\n\n“I don’t think it’s an arrogance thing. It’s, ‘If I’m going to commit my time to this, I’m going to be the best I can be at it.’”\n\nLater this year, Rossi is scheduled to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, which his good friend believes he’s doing, in the spirit of the famous JFK quote, “Because it’s there.” Rossi began his training in February with the first hike of his life.\n\nHis choice? Hiking rim-to-rim-to-rim at the Grand Canyon, that 43-mile walk-in-the-park with well over 10,000 feet of vertical elevation gain.\n\n“I’m an only-child who’s incredibly competitive with everything I do, so I try to make sure that if there was ever someone who thought they could have a better pool or yard than me, I make sure I beat them,” Rossi said. “That’s really all it boils down to.”\n\nAnd it stands to wonder if that win-at-all-costs, borderline obsessive, quirky, analytical mindset might just be the perfect fit for a team on an upward trajectory like Arrow McLaren.\n\nIronically, his former home has largely upped its game, too, with a public sentiment from its drivers and, Andretti himself, that the vibe, chemistry and atmosphere is better than it was a year ago. Colton Herta said it’s simply because “the best remedy is to have fast race cars,” but given the tensions that had been simmering for months before boiling over at Mid-Ohio last July in an on-track demolition derby, it’s hard not to wonder if there’s some level of causality there.\n\n'What you see is what you get with him'\n\nAsk Rossi’s acquaintances up and down the paddock, and no one believes we’re in the midst of a ‘new Rossi’, even if something feels different. Maybe we’re just seeing more of him. Maybe he’s finally in the midst of a project he feels like has legs and a future and is somewhere he can reach his goals.\n\nMaybe this isn’t so much a ‘new Rossi’, but a ‘real Rossi’ – a version of himself he’s finally found and resurrected, more than seven years removed from the grind of the ‘everyone for themselves’ mentality of the European circuit. He has a chance now to start fresh, in a way, with new people, new teammates, new bosses, new coworkers, a new social media plan and new team gear that makes him hard to miss.\n\nAnd we’re looking for it, too, after a three-year period where he had been more than happy to blend into the background of this sport, while in the middle of a three-year deal he knew halfway through was a dead-end. Maybe the last three years of Alexander Rossi were ‘extra curmudgeon-y’ to those of us who largely only got chances to ask him questions in his darkest moments – or, in his few bright spots, ask him why they weren’t happening more often.\n\nMaybe the driver who’s open in his pessimism has found a home where, though things aren’t always perfect, he feels like there’s a way in which those he’s teamed up with can help him find the answer. And unlike Europe, he knows they’re in all this together.\n\n“I grew up in an environment where your teammate was your absolute worst enemy, and anything you could do on Earth to beat him was acceptable, and this series is very different than that,” he said. “My dislike for people probably comes from my time in Europe – not that European people are bad – but the F1 environment and who I was forced to collaborate with. At this point, more than half of my adult like was centered around people who never had your best interest at heart. They’d be very quick to say one thing to your face, and as soon as you turned around, do the exact opposite, and I dealt with that for a long period of time.\n\n“And you combine that with being generally shy in the first place, you give this perception to people that I don’t really want to talk to them – and quite frankly, that’s probably true. But also, I think when we’re at the race track, people may forget that we’re doing our job, and if I showed up at your job, your accounting firm or law firm or doctor’s office and in the middle of your day pulled you aside, you probably wouldn’t want to talk to me either. I try to be very real with how I answer things, and I think there’s two groups of people: they either love that reality, or hate you because you’re not the bubbly, happy-go-lucky Helio (Castroneves) or James (Hinchcliffe).”\n\nAnd yet, you have to remind Rossi that that either that pool of folks who hate what they perceive to be his “schtick” is shrinking – or, at least, he’s creating brand-new fans, as someone who was voted (or at least named by the series) as it’s ‘most popular driver’ after the 2020 campaign. The presentation on IndyCar’s end-of-year streamed program featured a takeout pizza as a prize and, to this day, lives on as a frequent inside joke across his various group texts.\n\n“I just don’t know how that’s possible, not necessarily because there shouldn’t be a reason people would like me, but it just didn’t make a lot of sense,” he said. “It seemed weird, and I still don’t know I believe the result, or maybe it was a weird COVID thing, and I get made fun of for it to this day.\n\n“But, the little joy I got from it was that I beat Conor, and that really pissed him off, and that made me happy.”\n\nAnd that right there, maybe that’s a window into who Rossi is. He’s unabashedly shy, perhaps not entirely understanding of just how much his real, raw, cutting personality has caught fire here over time, always down to turn something into a competition and always ready for a biting jab or joke.\n\nHe does admit, though he’s not a fan of it all, that he’s starting to grow more comfortable with the massive amounts of social media – in comparison to his Andretti days – that he now has to do as a member of the Papaya Club.\n\n“I don’t have a choice,” he laughs. And you did at Andretti? “Sure did! That was a team built around Marco, so we all had a choice not to do things. Some of them, I actually don’t mind, and some of them are actually pretty funny. The tortilla slapping was pretty hilarious, and I love things with blindfolds. That’s always funny.”\n\nSome around him wonder if there’s an inherent ‘competitive drive’ baked into how Rossi has tackled his willingness and buy-in to Arrow McLaren’s goofy social media video antics, as if now that he has to share a space with the gregarious O’Ward, if he has to step up his game so as not to fall too far behind. O’Ward, though, said this month he knows Rossi “would rather shoot himself in the foot” than do some of the things he’s put through – and the end goal is anything but trying to build those five-deep throngs of diehards that wait for and chant O’Ward’s name after any race, good or bad.\n\n“I’m a very introverted person, and I mean that I don’t go out of my way to try and make new friends or put myself in situations in large social gatherings, unless there’s a greater purpose. I have no interest in being in large crowds of people. That’s just who I’ve been ever since I was a kid.”\n\nBut when those “greater purpose” moments come, those who get the chance to watch him from the sidelines say they feel he genuinely thrives. As someone incapable of hiding his emotions, he was said to have been the sport’s ideal ambassador as he spent hour after hour on the White House lawn introducing kids to the sport at the Easter Egg Roll earlier this spring. Durham says he could rattle off an untold number of memories he has of Rossi making a beeline from pitlane to his golf cart after a less-than-stellar day in the car, only for the driver’s friend to point out he just strode straight through a pack of 7 and 8-year-olds screaming his name and holding a Sharpie in their tiny outstretched arms.\n\nIt completely goes against his professed disdain for strangers, but Rossi says he generally has an exception. “Ultimately, that’s the future of our sport. Those kids haven’t done anything remotely I could think of to make me not like them,” he said. “I have unlimited time for kids and families here.”\n\nAdults? That’s a different story. Hint: Don’t ask dumb questions to the unabashedly devoted intellectual.\n\n“Alex is one of those people who doesn’t suffer fools. He’s open-minded with anyone the first time he meets them, but as soon as you give him a reason to doubt you, fair play,” Hinchcliffe said. “He’s massively intelligent, and I think he gravitates to people that are like-minded, and he doesn’t have time for (expletive).\n\n“And what I love about Alex is, you get him away from the track, and it’s the same thing. What you see is what you get with him.”\n\nAnd should he win on Sunday, Hinchliffe believes the racing world and society at-large will finally get a chance to see that. The almost emotionless 25-year-old who didn’t know what to say, didn’t know how to smile or scream and didn’t know, in the moment, what to make about winning the Greatest Spectacle in Racing in his sixth IndyCar race, while still holding onto fading hopes of leaving and making his way back to Europe.\n\nNow? He’s here to stay, whether you like him or not, still with an overflowing drive to win, but the knowledge now of how to let that ‘Real Rossi’ shine through. He wants to win, in part, because after a combination of six close calls and letdowns, he doesn’t know how many more times he’s going to have the car and the team built to win. He has that now, and Rossi doesn’t want to let that slip away.\n\nFor a change, Alexander Rossi wants to enjoy his moment in the spotlight.\n\n“He’s been through a lot, if you look at his life and how he was shaped to be on his own and be a warrior. And it shaped how he is now,” Rossi’s dad said. “’I’m in my 30s, and I’m not changing.’ People think he has this edge to him, or a chip, or that he’s cocky, and that’s not what it is. He’s just confident.\n\n“And when he wins (another 500), there’s unfinished business of feeling that satisfaction.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2014/04/21/ultimate-list-of-iowa-movies/7913481/", "title": "The ultimate list of Iowa movies", "text": "Adam Wilson\n\nadwilson@dmreg.com\n\nAuthors Marty S. Knepper and John S. Lawrence are putting the finishing touches on a book that includes what must be the most comprehensive list ever compiled of films made in or about Iowa.\n\nKnepper, chair of the English Department at Morningside College in Sioux City, is past president of the American Popular Culture Association and serves on the editorial board of the international academic journal, Clues.\n\nLawrence is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Morningside and coauthor of The Myth of the American Superhero (2002). In addition to a filmography for The Landscape of Hollywood Westerns (2006) he also created filmographies for the Film and History Association books Hollywood's White House (2003), Hollywood's West (2005), and Why We Fought (2008).\n\nThe release of their self-published book coincided with a State Historical Museum of Iowa exhibit, \"Hollywood in the Heartland.\" The exhibit debuted in June, examining Iowa's historical ties to film and featuring \"Field of Dreams\" prominently. It's on the second floor of the museum and is scheduled to run through December 2016.\n\nKnepper and Lawrence shared their list (below) with The Register, with films sorted into six categories, which are:\n\nI. Iowa settings, fictional films. These are fictional stories set at least partially in Iowa.\n\nII. Iowa settings, historical films. These include historic episodes in Iowa, ranging from the Mormon crossing in Brigham Young—Frontiersman to the tragic 1989 air disaster at Sioux City portrayed by Crash Landing: The Rescue of Flight 232.\n\nIII. Traveling Iowans. These feature at least one fictional Iowan as a significant character in a location outside the state.\n\nIV. Iowa documentaries. These films, at a minimum of 30 minutes in length, present some aspect of Iowa in a factually informative style.\n\nV.Made in Iowa. These films are recognizably Iowa in physical setting, but their fictional stories place them elsewhere or give them a generic, \"anywhere\" setting. The fact that they are shot in Iowa often fades into the recollection that they are \"about\" Iowa—particularly when communities remember the experience of filming. An example is Children of the Corn (1984), filmed in Whiting, Hornick, and Sioux City, but set in Nebraska. Many independent films have been shot in Iowa without reaching film festivals or any other kind of distribution. These are the \"ghost films,\" often a tribute to the hospitality, grants, and technical assistance of the Iowa Film Office (now Produce Iowa) and the local communities that assist producers. We have been able to see and to describe quite a few ghost films, thanks to producers who lent them to us, but like much older films, they might be quite difficult to obtain. A few films have been shot by foreign companies, who later distribute their films in other languages; such films rarely migrate back to American screens. One significant exception is Bix: The Interpretation of a Legend (1991), by Italian filmmaker Pupi Avati, who has shot several films in Iowa.\n\nVI. Films that mention Iowa. Numerous films briefly mention Iowa or Iowans to evoke some stereotype of place or character. While such films lack Iowa focus, their references become part of Iowa's cultural identity as safe, nice, or benightedly rural. For example, in Made for Each Other (1939), a character quips that \"Hollywood is the place where people from Iowa mistake each other for stars.\" And the First Husband in Kisses for My President (1964) welcomes a lisping Campfire Girl from \"Thioux Thity\"—perhaps suggesting that kids from Iowa are challenged residents of Greater Hicksville. The \"mention\" films are described only in this list short entry listing, not in the Annotated Library.\n\nTHE COMPLETE LIST\n\n(Copyright 2014, Marty S. Knepper and John S.

The Jereczeks have difficulties finding hired help, too, which means the barn and the fields take over what could be family time.\n\n“Five or 10 years from now, I don’t think we will be milking cows anymore, realistically,\" the 35-year-old farmer said. \"Financially we are fine, but I have four young children who I don't spend nearly enough time with.\"\n\nJereczek is trying to build a bridge to the future even as he crosses it. He has planted more than 1,000 hazelnut trees on 3 acres previously used to grow hay — a small piece of the farm that someday could pay off well if the perennial crop takes hold.\n\nWorldwide, Turkey and Italy dominate the hazelnut industry. Domestically, Oregon has more than 800 growers who produced nearly all of the U.S. crop valued at $92 million in 2018.\n\nHybrids have been developed that thrive in a northern climate and are hardy enough to survive Wisconsin winters. It costs Jereczek about $5 a tree to plant them and there’s nothing to harvest until at least the third or fourth year — which for him is still a couple of years away. But because it takes a while, the marketplace could be less vulnerable to crashing from everyone jumping in at the same time.\n\nHooking the world on dairy: Farmers dealing with customers who are now competitors\n\nThe University of Wisconsin and University of Minnesota are collaborating on a \"Million Hazelnut Campaign\" to plant 1 million trees across the Upper Midwest. They estimated in 2017 the annual net income from fully mature hazelnut trees at between $3,400 and $4,200 an acre. Further, the roots systems prevent erosion, don't need irrigation and are drought resistant.\n\n“Is it going to save the farm? That’s the best-case scenario, but I’m not banking on it yet,” Jereczek said.\n\nStill, he remains hopeful his family's future will unfold on the farm where he grew up and returned to after studying English at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls.\n\n“I want my kids to have a chance to do something with the land, agriculturally, and I don’t see dairy being it, at this level,” he said.\n\nWisconsin has billed itself as America's Dairyland for nearly a century. But with industrial farms on the rise, its next generation of children may never know what it's like to see red barns and Brown Swiss cattle in pastures on hillsides.\n\nDairy farmers \"are pretty exhausted, mentally, trying to figure out how to survive,\" said Angie Sullivan, agriculture program supervisor with the Wisconsin Farm Center, part of the state agriculture department, where farmers can get help untangling their finances and managing stress.\n\nMany are also asking themselves whether surviving is enough, whether an operation of 50, 100, even 200 cows is still the best use of their land and talent.\n\nThis year alone, about 800 dairy farmers in Wisconsin left the business, a rate of more than two per day. Many had small family farms. They joined an exodus from dairy that has sped up in recent years but has gone on for decades.\n\nSome of those farmers are now growing cattle feed for large dairy operations. Some are raising beef cattle. A few have carved out niches that were a surprise, even to them.\n\nOld farm, new use\n\nTom Rohland sells wine these days, along with gourmet olive oils and flavored balsamic vinegar.\n\nHe also rents out his century-old barn, which once housed 55 dairy cows, for weddings, class reunions, maybe a Christmas or retirement party. His manure storage pit is long gone; it's a fishing pond now.\n\nEvery day for about 15 years, Rohland and his family milked cows and tended to their farm in Clark County, where cattle outnumber people 4 to 1. They grew fruit on land not used for cattle feed.\n\nThere were good times in dairy, but they were always followed by low milk prices or poor weather for growing crops. It was hard, relentless work. Rohland, then in his 40s, had metal pins and screws in his hands and ankles, the result of farm injuries.\n\n“As time went on, it seemed like it was always an uphill battle,” he said.\n\nWith his children grown up and off the farm, and his optimism about the future of small dairy operations drained, Rohland sold his cows.\n\nRelying on off-farm jobs for several years, he and his wife, Sheri, turned their wine-making hobby into a full-time business, Munson Bridge Winery.\n\n“Some people thought we were nuts,\" Rohland said. \"There weren’t any wineries in the area.\"\n\nBut the Rohlands had seen wineries in other parts of the state that were so tucked away in the hills they could barely be found — and those were packed with customers. So they gave it a spin themselves.\n\n\"We're still living in the same place with the same buildings, but it's much more enjoyable,\" Rohland said.\n\nFarming evolving\n\nBefore it became the nation’s leader in dairy farming, Wisconsin was known as the wheat state. And for more than 150 years, parts of Wisconsin have grown chewing tobacco, a small-acreage crop that farmers used to say was their \"mortgage payment” because of its profitability. In the 1960s, there was a large loss of dairy farms after the industry transitioned to refrigerated bulk tanks for collecting milk, replacing 10-gallon steel cans.\n\nFarming has been evolving since its very beginning, said Dennis Shields, chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, which has a large dairy science program.\n\n“We’ve always adapted,\" he said. \"You show me a successful farmer, and I’ll show you someone who is able to adjust and adapt.\"\n\nBut farmers are now engaged in a global marketplace marked by overproduction, fierce competition, changing consumer tastes, mega-size farms and environmental issues. A trade war with China, the European Union or Mexico can upend business for months, even years, at a time.\n\nDairy crisis: How trading partners Canada and Mexico are surviving\n\nIndustrial farming takes over: And it's raising environmental concerns\n\nFarms recruit Mexican veterinarians: They accept animal scientist jobs, but end up milking and cleaning\n\nGiven that volatility, one thing seems certain: The small dairy farm from 10 years ago won't be around in another 10 years if it doesn't keep evolving, said Brody Stapel, a dairy farmer from Cedar Grove and president of Edge Dairy Farmer Cooperative. \"Adaptability,\" Stapel says, \"is the key.\"\n\nWisconsin still produces more cheese than any other state — more even than most countries. But in the last few years, thousands of dairy farmers have lost money practically every day they’ve milked their cows, year-round, as an oversupplied market has kept prices depressed. Many farms milking between 50 and 100 cows are at risk of shutting down because they don't benefit from economies of scale.\n\n“As much as I love small dairy farms, we don’t have very many automobile manufacturers that build 400 cars a year. We did at one time,\" said Jack Britt, a dairy consultant and professor emeritus at North Carolina State University.\n\n“So, should dairy farmers move to a new enterprise? Yes, but only if they are innovative and willing to learn new methods and systems. I don’t think there is a single crop or area that could replace dairy … but the opportunities are broad if one focuses on the end market or the emerging markets.”\n\nCan you co-exist with a Walmart?\n\nThe question for many Wisconsin farmers, then, is how to get from point A to point B.\n\n“I would never suggest abandoning the family farm,\" said Gov. Tony Evers. \"I think it’s still a great possibility, a great job for folks. People who raise their kids on farms will vouch for that.\"\n\nEvers grew up in Plymouth, a town once surrounded by scores of dairy farms.\n\n“These were good farm families,\" he said. \"They worked hard and were able to make money. We need to get back to that time.”\n\nThe problem is farmers have been getting a milk price similar to what it was 30 years ago. Expenses are very much up to date.\n\nSmaller dairies can still survive, but only if their operating costs are low enough or they have a unique product that fetches a higher price, said Steven Deller, an agricultural economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “It’s like, can you co-exist with a Walmart? Yes, you can. But you have to change.”\n\nOne of the best ways? \"Make sure there are off-farm employment opportunities,\" Deller said. \"It keeps the family afloat, and therefore it keeps the farm afloat” as farmers try new paths.\n\nNot wanting to exit dairy, but disillusioned with milking cows, some farmers have switched to goats. This year, according to the most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture data, Wisconsin leads the nation with more than 72,000 dairy goats, easily topping California which came in second with 40,000, followed by Iowa and Minnesota.\n\nWorldwide, goat milk is more popular than cow milk and it’s gained ground in the U.S. with a changing consumer marketplace and immigrants accustomed to its taste.\n\nFarmers should be mindful of these kinds of societal adjustments, Britt said, and develop products that respond to them.\n\nNot too many years ago, it was generally accepted that small breweries would disappear as large beer makers kept growing, taking control of the marketplace.\n\n\"Then,\" said Jack Uldrich, a futurist from Minneapolis, \"there was this explosion of microbreweries.\"\n\nDiversification key\n\nThis year, with $8.8 million in state funding, three UW System schools — Platteville, River Falls and Madison — launched plans for a Dairy Innovation Hub that's expected to create an advanced dairy management academy and improve labs and farms devoted to research.\n\nThe hub is looking out 10 or 20 years on \"substantial innovations\" for the industry, said Scott Rankin, chairman of the food science department at UW-Madison. \"The small and medium-size producer is on everybody's mind in these discussions.\"\n\nUW-Platteville has a 400-acre research farm with a 200-cow dairy herd. It's installing robotic milking machines so that dairy science students can learn by using the latest technologies.\n\n“We are not going to come in and save the farms ourselves. But we are going to help them with the intellectual support they need and we’re going to be the source of the workforce — the people who will manage these farms,” said Shields, of UW-Platteville.\n\n\"I think we should be America's Dairyland and other things,\" he said.\n\nThe chancellor said there wasn't much that could be done about small dairy farms already lost. “We can’t sort of resurrect them. But we can make the future dairy farmers much more adaptable and responsive to the cycles in the industry.\"\n\nWisconsin, Evers says, needs a diverse agricultural base that includes farms of all sizes. The state ranks first in the nation for snap beans, cranberries and ginseng, third in potatoes and fifth in cherries.\n\n“In our state, one of the few areas making progress, monetarily, is fruits and vegetables,\" the governor said. \"Not everybody can have an orchard, that’s for sure, but I think we need to help all farmers diversify as much as possible.\"\n\nAt the same time, Wisconsin leaders have continued to invest heavily in dairy, even sending trade missions to China and Vietnam to promote products. They may be encouraging diversification, but they're not walking away from a $45 billion industry.\n\nSearching for new revenue streams\n\nSteve Kelm, a dairy science professor at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls, said he's confident dairy farmers will develop new revenue streams inside and outside the industry.\n\n“In California, that was almond trees, walnut trees and grapes in the Central Valley. Wisconsin is going to be similar in that regard, whether it’s ginseng and things adapted to our environment, or berries, or raising dairy beef cattle,” Kelm said.\n\nAlready, some of the state's biggest livestock farms are moving into energy production by converting manure into renewable gas.\n\nSmaller farms are diversifying out of commodities markets and into areas such as dairy cattle genetics, raising young animals for bigger farms and producing specialty milk for artisan cheese plants. They're looking at raising alternative crops that are on the rise, such as hemp.\n\nLooking further into the future, Wisconsin may be helped by climate change.\n\n\"The biggest impact of climate change is going to be the availability of water,\" Britt said. \"Our forecast is that dairy is going to move north to places that have plenty of it.\"\n\nLeading dairy states such as California, New Mexico, Texas and Arizona will have difficulties getting enough water. Great Lakes states, including Wisconsin, Minnesota and New York, will be magnets for growth.\n\nThat growth, however, would have to be managed — and safe. Some of the nation's largest dairy farms, known as concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, are in the West. One of them, in Oregon, is licensed for 70,000 cattle.\n\nThe average size of a Wisconsin dairy farm is about 150 cows. But that number is rising because the number of CAFOs in the state has jumped 55% in less than a decade to 279 farms.\n\nWith so many cattle, industrial-scale farms run the risk of contaminating groundwater and overwhelming lakes, rivers and streams with runoff manure and fertilizer pollution. Rural water-well contamination is under growing scrutiny in Wisconsin.\n\n\"There's going to be a natural push by the public and the government to insist that we don't contaminate our groundwater,\" Britt said.\n\nCows themselves also will change. Dairy cows of the future will be a milk-producing powerhouse, the result of crossbreeding and gene editing. They will have implantable, microscopic sensors to monitor their health and well-being.\n\nThe data will be integrated with information gathered across an entire farmstead, down to the bacteria in soil where cattle feed grows. Farmers will be able to use epigenetics, in which specific livestock genes are turned on or off, to trigger changes in the animal's biology.\n\n\"Robots and automated systems will do much of the routine work on farms 50 years from now. This will benefit cows because they crave consistency,\" Britt said.\n\nDairy farms of the future could even produce specialty milks that are therapeutic for cancer patients or the elderly. Already, some genetically engineered cows are being used to manufacture human antibodies that could someday be used to treat infectious diseases like Ebola and influenza.\n\n\"Give yourself permission to think differently about the future,\" Uldrich said. \"The one thing I say as a futurist is, if your idea doesn't sound crazy, you're not thinking hard enough. If it sounds plausible, it's already happening.\"\n\nIn the Netherlands, the world's first floating dairy farm has been launched in an urban area where rising sea levels have made farmland prone to flooding. The three-story raft, with glass sides, is home to 32 cows. Its electricity is generated from floating solar panels and drinking water comes from a rainwater collection system.\n\nThe cows can move freely from their stalls to an area where they're milked by robots. When tides allow it, they can cross a bridge to a dock and pasture, according to FarmingUK, a British publication.\n\nThree companies behind the project are considering a floating chicken farm and greenhouse aimed at providing fresh food for local markets as well.\n\nA nuisance becomes a moneymaker\n\nThe move into energy production is a classic example of a new revenue stream emerging from a chronic problem, in this case what to do with the prodigious amount of manure created on livestock farms.\n\nLarge-scale dairy farms are harnessing methane in manure and selling it as an alternative to traditional natural gas. For years, some farmers with anaerobic digesters — there are currently about 40 operating in Wisconsin — have tapped the naturally occurring gases in waste to generate electricity, selling what they didn’t need to utilities.\n\nThe shift to renewable gas, also called biogas, is being driven by federal and state incentives — and in some cases subsidies. Once the methane is pumped into an interstate pipeline, it’s considered a renewable fuel.\n\nBurning renewable gas, rather than allowing the methane to float into the atmosphere, has appeal to companies that need to meet carbon reduction mandates or want to shrink their carbon footprint.\n\n“We went from something that was costing us money, to getting a check back at the end of the month,” said J.J. Pagel, owner of 5,000-cow Pagel’s Ponderosa in Kewaunee County.\n\nPagel has a partnership with DTE Energy, a Detroit-based company, which built a system on his farm to help make the methane marketable. DTE transports the methane to a location in Manitowoc County, where it’s injected into a natural gas pipeline.\n\nThe company has similar deals with four other farms in Kewaunee and Manitowoc counties and has projects in the works with four more farms, including Rosendale Dairy, the state’s largest dairy farm, in Fond du Lac County.\n\nCreating innovative products\n\nMelissa Hughes, the new executive director of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., said one reason she took the job was to address dairy issues.\n\nPreviously, she was a top executive at the billion-dollar cooperative Organic Valley, based in La Farge. During her 15-year tenure there, as general counsel, the number of family farms in the cooperative grew from 500 to 2,000.\n\nHughes said she'd like to help dairy farmers develop markets.\n\n\"I don't see any immediate solutions, which is heartbreaking, but I think that looking at the supply chain and creating innovative products is a way to drive prices up for the farmers,\" she added.\n\nOther states are also trying to find ways to help struggling farmers stay in agriculture.\n\nVermont, the biggest dairy-producing state in New England, has helped some dairy farmers transition into agri-tourism, growing grapes and producing fruit for hard cider. The legalization of marijuana has created another crop opportunity.\n\nHughes took over WEDC as it continues to oversee its largest project to date: the massive Foxconn manufacturing plant in Mount Pleasant. That's in line with the agency's typical formula: offering manufacturers loans, grants and tax credits in exchange for creating jobs.\n\nHughes doesn't see additional loans as especially helpful for dairy farmers. \"Just giving them more debt is not a solution,\" she said.\n\nBut the agency could do more to cultivate the next generation in dairy, said Sarah Lloyd, a dairy farmer from Sauk County and a Wisconsin Farmers Union board member.\n\n“If WEDC can give big chunks of money to Foxconn, why can’t it give small chunks to farmers to re-energize their situation?\" she said.\n\nFrom dairy to berries\n\nRohland, the winemaker, gives some straightforward advice to farmers who want to find that new energy outside dairy. Take stock of your skills and assets, and don't be afraid to try something new. Be careful, financially, and have a backup plan.\n\n\"Unless you try, you'll never know,\" he said.\n\nAfter nearly 40 years as a dairy farmer, Greg Zwald of St. Croix County never imagined he’d launch a new career.\n\n“I really liked dairy,\" Zwald said. \"I expected to retire from it.”\n\nZwald was a partner, with his brother, in a dairy operation that expanded to 600 cows and was doing well. But they didn’t agree on how family members would enter the business and it caused friction.\n\n“I decided it was better that I leave, rather than try to push my way, my thoughts,” Zwald said.\n\nNow, he and his wife, Irma, own White Pine Berry Farm, which sells fruits and vegetables to the general public. They also have a corn maze and pumpkin patch in the fall.\n\nThere was some culture shock going from running a large dairy farm to managing a pick-your-own berries operation.\n\n\"You've got to like people and you have to assume that some of them are going to step on your berries. But one of our goals is to get kids, families, to the farm so they understand this is where their food comes from,\" Zwald said.\n\nStarting over wasn't easy.\n\n“Financially, it’s been kind of break-even. But this year was good, and we’re adding a building that will have a retail center in it,” he said.\n\nZwald has picked up a job managing the UW-River Falls research farm, keeping him involved with livestock.\n\nFor most of his life, his income was at the mercy of commodities markets. Dairy farmers don't know what they'll get paid for their milk until 30 days after it leaves the farm.\n\nWith the UW-River Falls work, Zwald said, “I am actually getting a regular paycheck for the first time in my life and I have more free time.\"\n\nChallenging times\n\nWisconsin's remaining dairy farm families are remarkably resilient. They weathered the Great Depression and the milk strikes of 1933. They've toughed it out through numerous downturns, recessions, poor crop years, trade disputes.\n\n“I wouldn’t bet against anyone who, for the last four years, has gotten up at 5 a.m. on Christmas Day to milk cows and provide for their family the best they can,” said Kelm of UW-River Falls.\n\nWhat's been different about the recent downturn has been its duration, five years, and its severity — the highest number of dairy farm losses in Wisconsin, on a percentage basis, going all the way back to the Great Depression.\n\n\"I think a lot of farmers have already made the choice to quit. They are going to milk cows until their feed is gone and then they're done,\" said Travis Tranel, a dairy farmer and Republican state representative from Cuba City.\n\n\"It's been a challenge and the next six months could possibly be the biggest challenge. It's going to be a long time until May,\" Tranel said.\n\nHe's particularly bothered when he hears that young people don't want to farm anymore. \"That could not be further from the truth. They want to farm, but they just can't afford it,\" said Tranel, whose family has a 600-cow organic dairy.\n\nThe loss of dairy farms is especially noticeable in southwest Wisconsin.\n\n\"Drive around any of these smaller towns. The banks are closing, the car dealerships are closing,\" Tranel said. \"As I drive by those red barns, I always smile and think those were the good old days when a mom and a dad probably raised five or 10 kids in that house on 150 acres and they milked 40 cows. As those barns come down, my kids aren't even going to know that's what Wisconsin used to look like.\"\n\nThe losses could have far-reaching consequences beyond rural communities.\n\n“The success of this nation is because pretty much nobody has to worry about where their food comes from,\" he said. \"If we have gotten to the point where the very people who have made us successful can no longer pay their bills, I think we really have to question if that’s OK.\n\n\"As a society, I hope that we don't find it acceptable.\"\n\nHopeful for the future\n\nSome might think that what Jereczek has done, planting hazelnut trees, goes against the grain of Wisconsin dairy tradition.\n\nBut the Jereczeks understand tradition. Paul’s great-great-grandfather, Jacob Jereczek, moved to Trempealeau County in the early 1860s from Poland. After the Civil War, he and his sons bought three farms and were among the first immigrant families to settle in the area.\n\nPaul and Ken have kept the farm current, investing in technology such as automatic calf feeders and health monitoring devices that are attached to the cows’ ankles.\n\nThey understand that every generation in farming has its challenges. But the record amount of rainfall this year, which kept farmers out of the fields for spring planting and ruined some of the harvest, reminded Paul why he planted hazelnut trees — a crop that keeps on giving year after year once it gets started.\n\n“I am hopeful,\" he said. \"I think it’s a worthwhile investment.”\n\nHe’s recycling dirty livestock bedding from the dairy to fertilize the trees.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, if the market for hazelnuts in Wisconsin fails to materialize?\n\n“I will have a bunch of nuts to feed to the cattle,” he said.\n\nThese days, a dairy farmer can't afford to waste anything.\n\nLee Bergquist of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel contributed to this article.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/texas/2017/12/14/how-federal-government-used-its-power-seize-property-border-fence/950491001/", "title": "How the federal government seized Texans' land for border fence", "text": "T. Christian Miller, ProPublica, and Kiah Collier and Julian Aguilar\n\nThe Texas Tribune\n\nBROWNSVILLE — The land agents started working the border between Texas and Mexico in the spring of 2007. Sometimes they were representatives from the Army Corps of Engineers. Other times they were officers from the U.S. Border Patrol, uniformed in green, guns tucked into side holsters. They visited tumbledown mobile homes and suburban houses with golf course views. They surveyed farms fecund with sugar cane, cotton and sorghum growing by the mud-brown Rio Grande. They delivered their blunt news to ranchers and farmers, sheet metal workers and university professors, auto mechanics and wealthy developers.\n\nThe federal government was going to build a fence to keep out drug smugglers and immigrants crossing into the United States illegally, they told property owners. The structure was going to cut straight across their land. The government would make a fair offer to buy property, the agents explained. That was the law. But if the owners didn’t want to sell, the next step was federal court. U.S. attorneys would file a lawsuit to seize it. One way or the other, the government would get the land. That, too, was the law.\n\nThe visits launched the most aggressive seizure of private land by the federal government in decades. In less than a year, the Department of Homeland Security filed more than 360 eminent domain lawsuits against property owners, involving thousands of acres of land in the border states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.\n\nMost of the seized land ran along the Rio Grande, which forms the border between Texas and Mexico. All told, the agency paid $18.2 million to accumulate a ribbon of land occupying almost half the length of the 120 miles of the Rio Grande Valley in southernmost Texas.\n\nYears before President Donald Trump promised to build his wall, Homeland Security erected an 18-foot-high fence in a botched land grab that serves as a warning for the future.\n\nAn investigation by ProPublica and the Texas Tribune shows that Homeland Security cut unfair real estate deals, secretly waived legal safeguards for property owners, and ultimately abused the government’s extraordinary power to take land from private citizens.\n\nThe major findings:\n\n● Homeland Security circumvented laws designed to help landowners receive fair compensation. The agency did not conduct formal appraisals of targeted parcels. Instead, it issued low-ball offers based on substandard estimates of property values.\n\n● Larger, wealthier property owners who could afford lawyers negotiated deals that, on average, tripled the opening bids from Homeland Security. Smaller and poorer landholders took whatever the government offered — or wrung out small increases in settlements. The government conceded publicly landowners without lawyers might wind up shortchanged, but did little to protect their interests.\n\n● The Justice Department bungled hundreds of condemnation cases. The agency took property without knowing the identity of the owners. It condemned land without researching facts as basic as property lines. Landholders spent tens of thousands of dollars to defend themselves from the government’s mistakes.\n\n● The government had to redo settlements with landowners after it realized it had failed to account for the valuable water rights associated with the properties, an oversight that added months to the compensation process.\n\n● On occasion, Homeland Security paid people for property they did not own. The agency did not attempt to recover the misdirected taxpayer funds, instead paying for land a second time once it determined the correct owners.\n\n● Nearly a decade later, scores of landowners remain tangled in lawsuits. The government has already taken their land and built the border fence. But it has not resolved claims for its value.\n\nThe errors and disparities played out family by family, block by block, county by county, up and down the length of the border fence.\n\nThe Loop family spent more than $100,000 to defend their farmland from repeated government mistakes about the size, shape and value of their property. The government built a fence across Robert De Los Santos’ family land but almost a decade later has yet to reach a settlement for it. Ranch hand Roberto Pedraza was accidentally paid $20,500 for land he did not even own.\n\nRetired teacher Juan Cavazos was offered $21,500 for a 2-acre slice of his land. He settled for that, figuring he couldn’t afford to hire a lawyer.\n\nRollins M. Koppel, a local attorney and banker, did not make the same mistake. A high-priced Texas law firm negotiated his offer from $233,000 to almost $5 million — the highest settlement in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\n“We got screwed,” said Cavazos, 74.\n\nHomeland Security referred questions to the Justice Department. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers declined to respond to written questions from ProPublica and the Texas Tribune.\n\nA Justice Department official, who insisted on anonymity, said all agencies involved in the land seizures followed proper procedures.\n\n“[F]or any large public works project impacting hundreds of properties, the values are likely to cover a large range because so many different kinds of property are being acquired,” the official said. “It is these very differences in uses that cannot be captured in a cursory statistical analysis of the properties acquired and the prices paid for these lands.”\n\nMichael Chertoff, the former secretary for Homeland Security under President George W. Bush who personally approved the condemnations in Texas, declined to comment.\n\nGreg Giddens led the fence building project at Homeland Security. Now retired, Giddens said his team faced pressure from both U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which wanted the fence built quickly to benefit law enforcement, and from Congress, which set a deadline to complete the structure.\n\n“Everybody wanted to do this right. But it was clear that the mission was to get this done,” Giddens said.\n\nHyla Head, the former Army Corps official who oversaw the condemnation process for the agency, said the government did everything according to regulation.\n\n“There is a process that we have to follow and we followed that,” said Head, now retired. “I think we did a damn good job with the constraints that we were under.”\n\nThe fence was born in the middle of a fierce national debate on immigration reform. In 2006, Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, introduced a plan to build hundreds of miles of a physical barrier along the southern border. Although controversial, the proposal won bipartisan support. Then Sen. Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican, led the fight for its passage. Yea votes came from Democratic Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nOn Oct. 26, 2006, President Bush signed the Secure Fence Act. President Obama oversaw the fence’s construction. All told, Homeland Security built 654 miles of fence — just short of the 700-mile goal set by Congress — at a cost of $2.4 billion.\n\nNow Trump has promised to finish the job with a much larger wall — nearly twice the height of the fence, made of concrete, and occupying much of the remaining 1,300 miles of southern border unguarded by a physical barrier. His administration has declared its intent to take more land to build the wall in the central Rio Grande Valley, where much of the property remains in private hands.\n\nFor Trump to succeed, the federal government will have to file more eminent domain lawsuits using the same law that resulted in uneven payments the last time. Many of the players who oversaw construction of the fence are now working on making Trump’s wall a reality.\n\nMauricio Vidaurri’s voice catches when he envisions a wall running across his family farm south of Laredo on the banks of the Rio Grande.\n\nA rancher, Vidaurri strongly supports better border protection. Border crossers constantly trespass on his land, and drug couriers have broken into a home on the ranch.\n\nBut a wall would almost certainly split the ranch that has been in his family since the 1700s. If Homeland Security wants to build a wall, Vidaurri knows he will be almost helpless to stop it.\n\n“That’s a battle that we can’t win,” he said.\n\nA sovereign power\n\n“Eminent domain” probably exists as a phrase in the consciousness of most Americans in some way or another. Maybe you heard it when the government was building a highway, or clearing a route for gas pipelines.\n\nThe sovereign power to seize land — and the need to protect property owners from its abuse — dates to the beginning of modern democracy.\n\nIn 1215, the Magna Carta limited royal power — including curtailing the sovereign’s ability to take property from his nobles. “No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions,” it read. A man’s castle was his home, and not even a king could take it without due process. The language survives unaltered in modern British law.\n\nMore than five centuries later, America’s earliest lawmakers enshrined private property rights in the U.S. Constitution. The Fifth Amendment required that the government provide “just compensation” if it took property through eminent domain — the English rendering of a Latin phrase meaning “supreme lordship.” If the government was going to appropriate property, it had to pay for it, fairly and fully.\n\nOver the decades, eminent domain transformed the American landscape. The U.S. Interstate Highway System and some national parks, NASA’s Cape Canaveral and the U.S. Supreme Court building itself — none would have been possible without federal land condemnation. During World War II, the Justice Department boasted of being the largest real estate broker in the nation. The federal government acquired more than 20 million acres of land to build bases and other military sites — an area the size of South Carolina.\n\nAt the same time, the potential for abuse inspired deep-seated fear. An early Supreme Court justice described eminent domain as a “despotic power.” Property owners — from gigantic timber companies to people evicted from their homes — have fought bitterly to stop the government from taking their land, or to ensure a fair market price.\n\nPolitically, an unusual coalition of the right and the left has resisted the use of eminent domain.\n\nProgressives have argued disadvantaged groups feel the pain of condemnation more than most. In the 1950s and 1960s, officials deployed eminent domain to bulldoze mostly minority, mostly poor inner-city neighborhoods in the name of urban renewal. Government planners called it “blight removal.” Writer James Baldwin had another term: “It means negro removal,” he said after a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy in 1963. “And the federal government is an accomplice to this fact.”\n\nOn the right, conservatives have warned of the so-called “grasping hand” of bureaucratic attacks on private property rights. That concern rose to national prominence in 2005, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against private property owners in the landmark case Kelo v. City of New London.\n\nThe Connecticut city condemned the homes of Susette Kelo and her neighbors to turn the land over to a private developer. The developer planned to build a hotel, housing, and office space to complement a new research center by Pfizer Corp., the pharmaceutical giant. The city determined the new development would generate jobs and tax revenue.\n\nIn a 5-4 decision, the court decided that taking land from one set of private property owners to give to another private entity was permissible as a “public use.” Kelo’s small pink house was relocated and her neighborhood was bulldozed, but nothing was ever built.\n\nThe ruling united ideological enemies. Ralph Nader blasted it. So did Rush Limbaugh. A few property rights activists were so angry they sought to condemn the New Hampshire home of Justice David Souter and replace it with the “Lost Liberty Hotel.”\n\nOne of the few high-profile supporters of the ruling was Donald Trump, then a New York developer. “I happen to agree with it 100 percent,” he said. His opinion was informed by experience. In the 1990s, Trump lost an eminent domain battle when a local agency failed in its bid to tear down an elderly woman’s home in Atlantic City to make room for a limousine parking lot for Trump’s casino.\n\nTrump’s enthusiasm for taking land endures. During a February 2016 presidential debate, Trump described it as almost like winning the lottery. “When eminent domain is used on somebody’s property, that person gets a fortune,” he told the audience. “They get at least fair market value, and if they are smart, they’ll get two or three times the value of their property.”\n\nIn response to the Kelo decision, 45 states, including Texas, passed new laws to improve landholder protections. Some states banned private-to-private takings. Others required “supercompensation” — payments at greater than the fair market value. Those reforms built on others passed over the years. California pays out up to $5,000 for property owners to hire their own appraisers. Texas provides special commissions to review land seizures before the start of costly legal proceedings. Utah created an independent ombudsman to help landowners navigate the process.\n\nBut the furor to fix eminent domain abuse bypassed one important entity: the federal government. After Kelo, President Bush issued an executive order requiring agencies to better monitor land seizures. Congress passed no meaningful legislation.\n\nAnd so, by the time the land agents had finished knocking on doors in the Rio Grande Valley at the end of 2007, the property owners faced a federal government armed with powerful legal tools, many created decades earlier for a very different purpose than building a border fence.\n\nTools for the taking\n\nThe Homeland Security officials in charge of building the border fence were getting nervous.\n\nCongress had set a deadline to complete the project: Dec. 31, 2008. In little more than a year, Homeland Security needed to issue millions of dollars’ worth of government contracts, buy 145,000 tons of steel, and build hundreds of miles of fence across unforgiving terrain.\n\n“The clock is ticking,” Greg Giddens, the executive director of the Secure Border Initiative task force, warned colleagues in a September 2007 email.\n\nThe biggest problem was Texas. Unlike other border states, most of the land where the fence was going rested in private hands. And people in the Rio Grande Valley were refusing to sell. The land agents would close only 22 deals.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 2007, Chertoff announced his decision: If landowners wouldn’t cooperate, the government was going to take the land. They had 30 days to decide. “We would of course like to reach an agreement with the landowner,” he said. “But if we are unsuccessful, we are prepared to use eminent domain,” he told reporters.\n\nOver the following seven months, Homeland Security filed 330 lawsuits against scores of landowners along the Rio Grande. Most of the targeted acreage was farmland. But homes, golf courses, businesses and even nature preserves were sliced into pieces.\n\nAlberto Garza, 91, lost 10 acres that provided access to the sugar cane farm he had worked for 50 years. The De Leons were disowned of four separate tracts that had been in their family since the 1790s, when Spain ruled the region. Ray Loop was forced to give up a swath of property that ran in front of his home near the Rio Grande. The Nature Conservancy, one of the country’s leading environmental organizations, surrendered eight acres of its preserve. The University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley was cut off from the golf course where its team practiced.\n\nAll told, the agency built 50 miles of fence in disconnected strips 40 to 60 feet wide — and seized a total of 564 acres. A process that can take years for a single parcel had been compressed into months.\n\nThe seizures were made possible by a piece of paper called a Declaration of Taking.\n\nThe Taking Act was passed by Congress during the Great Depression to help stimulate the economy. It was designed as an alternative to traditional, slow-moving eminent domain lawsuits. The idea was to expedite land seizures, allowing the federal government to quickly build public works projects and generate new jobs.\n\nBy using a so-called quick-take, a federal agency gained title to a person’s property on the same day it filed a declaration of taking in court. The bulldozers could roll as soon as a judge approved an order to possess the land. The landowner was almost powerless to stop the process.\n\nTo balance this muscular exercise of sovereign power, the law required the government to immediately deposit a check with the court to pay the landholder. The law required the government to pay fair market value. The landowner could take the money, but also could try to convince the government to pay more — a process that could take years.\n\n“They can just grab the property now and worry about the price later,” said Robert H. Thomas, past chair of the American Bar Association’s eminent domain committee. “It’s a pretty potent tool.”\n\nBut not powerful enough for Homeland Security. The agency deployed a second tool to make it easier and faster to seize land. It issued a waiver that eviscerated a federal law designed to protect property owners from unfair seizures.\n\nThe so-called Uniform Act required the government to negotiate with the owners before seizing land. An agency couldn’t take coercive action to force a sale, and owners would receive a detailed description of the property to be seized.\n\nPerhaps the most important provision was that the government had to formally appraise land worth more than $10,000 before taking an owner to court. The appraisal had to be done according to the exacting standards spelled out in the 262-page Yellow Book — the federal government’s bible for pricing land.\n\nThe idea was to prevent lowballing. The government’s initial offer to buy property was not an opening bid in a negotiation. It was supposed to be as close as possible to the final, full value of the land, priced at its “highest and best” economic use. So, for example, if you had fallow land that could be planted with crops, an agency was supposed to pay as though your fields were abundant.\n\nThere was an exception to the law. An agency could bypass any of the law’s requirements, so long as doing so would “not reduce any assistance or protection provided to an owner.”\n\nWith virtually no public notice, Homeland Security took advantage of the loophole. It waived the law’s requirements for negotiation and eliminated conflict-of-interest provisions. The agency also increased the appraisal threshold to $50,000 for property seized along the border.\n\nIn practice, the higher threshold meant that the agency did not have to formally appraise most of the property it wanted. Land is cheap in the Rio Grande Valley, and the government was appropriating only small strips for the fence. Of 197 tracts seized by Homeland Security, 90 percent were valued at less than $50,000.\n\nIn place of formal appraisals, Homeland Security directed the Army Corps to assign values to targeted land. Army Corps evaluators did not have to be certified appraisers. They did not have to abide by Yellow Book standards. They did not have to identify the owners, and they didn’t need precise legal descriptions, called metes and bounds, to spell out property lines.\n\nHomeland Security worried that the Army Corps did not have the expertise or manpower to complete the job, according to a September 2007 report. Giddens, head of the fence project, said Homeland Security directed the agency to gather real estate experts from other Army Corps offices and hire contractors to do the work as fast as possible.\n\nIt was not worth waiting long to conduct the condemnation process, given strong opposition by landowners in the Valley, Giddens said.\n\n“This was not going to get better with time. None of us thought if we waited six months, people were going to say, ‘Hey, I get it now,’ ” he said. “There was no use in prolonging it.”\n\nIn the spring of 2008, the Army Corps representatives fanned out across the Rio Grande Valley to conduct negotiations with holdout landowners.\n\nThey were met with confusion and anger, according to an Army Corps report of the negotiations. Landowners wanted to know where the fence would go, how it would affect their property. They asked for more time to consider the offers. The contractors told them they had just weeks to sign a deal or the federal government would sue.\n\nOne negotiator described a farmer’s distress at being pressured to make a decision in less than two weeks in the middle of his onion harvest.\n\n“He takes this a little more to heart and is a little more emotional about the acquisition than some others,” an Army Corps realty specialist wrote. “He had lost confidence that Congress had any common sense.”\n\nTudor Uhlhorn, 58, a local politician, farmer and business owner, was perplexed by the federal offer to buy land he owned along the Rio Grande. He had been involved in land condemnation cases filed by the state of Texas, and in those cases the state’s attorneys had provided detailed property descriptions and construction plans.\n\nHomeland Security sent him a map that appeared to be taken from Google Earth, with a red rectangle drawn around the targeted tract. When he asked for more information, the Army Corps sent a letter: “The accelerated schedule that is necessary to meet the Congressional mandate will not permit the completion of the ground survey before acquisition,” it read.\n\nHomeland Security would take first, and measure later.\n\nNeither Uhlhorn nor his attorney was informed that Homeland Security had gutted landholder protections, until they argued the case in court.\n\n“They were building the fence on me without a full set of plans. They had no plans they could show me,” Uhlhorn said. “They just said it starts sort of in this area here and it ends sort of over there.”\n\nHomeland Security’s decision — changing a single digit in an obscure line of the federal code — left landowners in the Valley vulnerable to the caprice of federal agencies more focused on fence construction than fair compensation.\n\nThat’s because the Uniform Act contained a final weakness. Even if a property owner could show that Homeland Security had violated the law’s requirements, there was nothing the court — or anyone else — could do to fix it.\n\nBuried deep in the law, Congress had included a sentence that said the Uniform law “creates no rights or liabilities and shall not affect the validity of any property acquisitions by purchase or condemnation.”\n\nIn other words, there was a law. But there was no way to enforce it. In legal terms, it was “nonjusticiable” — beyond the reach of the federal court.\n\n“This is pretty much a very dark corner of the law,” said Gideon Kanner, a professor emeritus at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and a longtime champion of private property rights. “Any notions of due process that you may have will have to be re-examined.”\n\nOut of commission\n\nDelia Perez Weaver, 74, started working on her grandfather’s farm near San Benito in the fourth grade. Back then, Mexican workers would come across the Rio Grande River under temporary work permits granted under the bracero program. They would pick okra and cotton, green beans and tomatoes.\n\nWhen the Army Corps came to talk with her, Weaver had rented out the farmhouse and the land. They told her they needed an acre to construct the fence and secure an access road. As compensation, she would receive almost $15,000.\n\nTo Weaver, the offer seemed low. A relative told her she’d received a larger payment for a similar piece of land up the road. The 18-foot-high fence was an eyesore that would drop the land’s value. And so much of her life, and her family’s life, was wrapped up in her grandfather’s farm. She asked the Army Corps representative for more money. He told her no. So she took the offer.\n\n“This is it,” she remembered him saying. “If you want some more you need to go to court and that’s going to cost you more money.”\n\nThe Army Corps official was right. Property owners sued by the government have no right to be assigned an attorney. They must hire their own, or find one willing to work on a contingency fee. That’s not easy. By tradition, private eminent domain lawyers take roughly 30 percent of the increase over the initial offer. Few will take on cases where the property is worth less than $100,000 — it’s not worth their time.\n\nThe federal courts, however, had developed a solution for owners like Weaver. In projects involving many owners of inexpensive tracts spread out over a large area, a judge could appoint a land commission composed of local real estate experts to determine property values. The commissions allowed small landowners to plead their cases without the expense or formal procedures involved in a judicial hearing.\n\nCommissions were used in the two largest eminent domain cases in U.S. history: the creation of Florida National Everglades Park, which involved more than 40,000 lawsuits over three decades, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, a congressionally chartered hydroelectric power company that required acquiring hundreds of thousands of acres of land. Such commissions have also been used in much smaller condemnation projects, some involving as few as 16 properties.\n\nAs the lawsuits started, the Justice Department, representing Homeland Security, urged the federal judge overseeing most of the cases in the Valley to appoint such a commission.\n\nVirginia Butler, the chief of the Justice Department’s real estate acquisition section, warned in a motion to Judge Andrew S. Hanen that failure to do so would “result in protracted litigation of these matters and disparate awards to claimants — a very unsatisfactory result for all parties involved.”\n\n“In order to achieve fair, uniform compensation awards expeditiously for all affected owners (represented and unrepresented) in the Rio Grande Valley, appointment of a commission is required,” she wrote.\n\nHanen is best known now as the judge who blocked an Obama order to ease immigration laws. But before, he was the “fence judge” — handling nearly all of the cases along the Rio Grande. Hanen rejected Butler’s request. A jury trial, he said, was the best forum for the cases. And there was no need to worry about defendants without legal counsel, according to Hanen, because all the cases before him already had lawyers.\n\nWhen it came to negotiations between the government and landowners, Hanen declared that he would be “hands off.”\n\nHanen’s confidence was misplaced. As the lawsuits played out in court instead of before a commission, Butler’s dire predictions came true. Payments were unequal and lawsuits dragged on for years, according to a review by ProPublica and the Texas Tribune of 197 cases in the Rio Grande Valley where the government took possession of property from landowners. The review did not include cases which remain open, or temporary land seizures.\n\nThe Justice Department takings lawsuits resulted in splitting the community into three groups, not on the basis of the land they owned, but on their ability to retain an attorney.\n\nThe biggest group was made up of landholders of modest means, many elderly, some Spanish-only speakers. They didn’t hire attorneys and took the government’s initial offer. Half the lawsuits had that result. The median settlement was $8,000. The median seizure was just over one-third of an acre.\n\nThose who settled were people like Otalia Perez, 81, and her 85-year-old husband Tomas. They lived in a modest brick home across from their farmland. When the Army Corps approached them, Tomas had long ceased working the land himself, instead renting it out to tenant farmers. Neither he nor his wife felt like fighting the government. They accepted $21,000, and the government took two acres of land.\n\n“My folks are old and didn’t need to be in that legal battle, so we said, “Look, just take whatever they give you now ‘cause it’s gonna happen anyway,” said Joe Perez, their son who handled discussions with the government.\n\nJack Coleman, 77, was a military veteran who retired from the Naval Space Command in 1996. When the government offered him $10,600 for a piece of overgrown land that he used as a personal firing range, it seemed like a good deal. It was almost the same amount that he’d paid for the entire five-acre tract years before. “They offered a more than fair price,” he said.\n\nBut when taking slices of land from larger parcels, as happened in the Rio Grande Valley, the government didn’t price property in the way that real estate transactions are typically valued.\n\nUnder federal guidelines, Homeland Security was supposed to evaluate the worth of a piece of land before building the fence, and do so again after construction. Subtracting the second figure from the first produces an estimate of the damage inflicted on the property by the construction of the fence. The formula is designed to capture price differences caused when land is severed from a parent tract.\n\nBut many in the Valley weighed the offer on a price-per-acre basis at a time when the best irrigated cropland was selling for $10,000 an acre. To those who didn’t know about the formula, the government offers seemed generous — at first.\n\nThe Cavazos family lived in a home on 30 acres wedged between the Rio Grande and Oklahoma Avenue, a two-lane stretch of blacktop on the eastern edge of Brownsville. Much of the land was between the river and a levee — good only for crops.\n\nThe Cavazoses kept cattle, horses and chickens that roamed the thick grassland and pastures behind their single-story tan brick ranch house. The area is rural: horses graze on tall grass on the sides of roads. There are no street lights, and fields of cotton, corn and citrus trees line the road.\n\nThe Army Corps told the family that it would build a fence to run just behind the house, and also put in a gravel side road. To compensate them for the loss of two acres to the project, Homeland Security offered $21,500 and promised to install a gate with a security code that would give them access to their land remaining on the other side.\n\nJuan Cavazos was a teacher. His wife worked as a secretary for the school district. They didn’t want the fence. They thought there were smarter ways to stop the crossers and smugglers who darted across their land. But who were they to fight the government? They figured an attorney would just take a big contingency fee.\n\n“Regardless of whether we were going to be opposed or in favor of it, they were going to build it,” Cavazos said. “We were totally against building the border wall but we couldn't do anything about it.”\n\nThey took the money. Homeland Security built the barrier. It looms in the backyard, sharp and jagged, like a giant’s picket fence. The gate in the middle lets Cavazos stroll the back portion of his property. Border patrols officers race past on the gravel road.\n\nHad he known anything about the law, Cavazos could have argued for more money. For instance, he could have insisted that his land be valued for its farming potential — its highest and best use. Or he could have hired an appraiser to counter the government’s estimate.Cavazos didn’t know any of that, though. The sole burden to prove the full market value lies upon the owner – not the government.\n\nHe learned later that nearby landowners got higher payments than he did for similar parcels of land. He also believes the barrier has permanently reduced the resale value of the land now caught between the river and the fence.\n\n“At the time, we thought it was a fair offer,” Cavazos said. “The people who didn’t hire the lawyers got screwed.”\n\nPeople didn’t have to have a lawyer to prove the government’s offer was too low — in some cases, all they had to do was pick up the phone.\n\nThe De Leons fell into a second group of property owners. Like the first group, they, too, faced Homeland Security without counsel. But they were able to negotiate an increase in their final settlement. Of the 131 lawsuits in which landowners had no attorney, 30 settled for an increase of 33 percent higher than the median government offer. The payment for a median one-third acre tract increased from a median of $6,000 to just under $8,000.\n\nMany of these landowners had some familiarity with the workings of government — they were local, state or federal employees. Or they had connections to power brokers like local attorneys or politicians. Or they were simply comfortable negotiating directly with the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nFrequently, it did not take much to get a higher offer. Landowners who contacted the Justice Department often described a quick, cordial discussion. While few got what they were asking, they usually received some additional money or an agreement to reduce the effect of the fence on their land. For instance, farmers negotiated deals to install electronic gates to allow them to get farm equipment to their fields.\n\nThe government informed Rosalia Gonzalez that it would pay $700 for a little more than a tenth of an acre from a 1.4-acre lot she owned in Brownsville near the Rio Grande. Gonzalez asked for $60,000. “The United States is not aware of any land in the area of your property that has a fair market value as high as what you have requested,” a federal attorney wrote back. He did, however, boost the offer to $1,000. Gonzalez took it.\n\nRetired teacher Josephine Weaver, 80, saw her offer for a little more than a tenth of an acre of her 3.5 acre lot near Los Indios increase from $1,150 to $3,000 after she protested. “They were doing the right thing,” she said.\n\nIn the De Leons’ case, the family had deep roots — historically and politically. The De Leons traced their presence in the Rio Grande Valley to the days of the Spanish empire. One De Leon has a gold-framed family tree on the wall of his home with dates going back to the 1790s, when the family’s ancestors received a Spanish land grant in the Brownsville area.\n\nAt 82, Ernesto De Leon was the family’s patriarch. He once served as a city commissioner in Brownsville. He helped raise money for former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican who is now Trump’s energy secretary.\n\nWhen the land agents came around, they wanted five different parcels of land owned by the family. De Leon picked up the phone and started making calls.\n\n“I got on it and talked to my congressman. Talked to my state representative and county judge, and all the people that could help,” De Leon said. “By the grace of God we were able to make them understand.”\n\nDe Leon wound up speaking to the assistant U.S. attorney assigned to the family’s cases. On one plot of farmland, he convinced the government to raise its offer from $13,700 to $17,000 — a modest 24 percent boost.\n\nBut on another piece of agricultural land — this one closer to Brownsville — he more than quadrupled Homeland Security’s offer from $11,300 to $48,120 for the damage of losing a little more than an acre and a half from a 50-acre tract. He also worked out a deal to ensure that Homeland Security installed an electronic security gate to provide continued access to the land.\n\n“I say, don’t rock the boat. In other words, what they offer you, see if you can negotiate a better price.” De Leon said. “Don’t be greedy, get a reasonable price for your property and move forward.”\n\nFor most people who had the money, hiring a lawyer proved a smart investment. Not everyone with an attorney got more money — but those who did reaped significant returns.\n\nFor about 30 landowners represented by attorneys, the jump between the government’s median opening bid and its final offer was 207 percent — from a median offer of $13,100 to a settlement of $40,305. (In another 20 cases, the final settlement included additional land, making direct before-and-after comparisons difficult.)\n\nThe reason for the huge jumps became apparent during the battles between landholders and government attorneys: The Army Corps’ evaluators had consistently undervalued the land.\n\nAs part of the government’s defense preparations, the Justice Department hired independent appraisers to evaluate the targeted land. In the few lawsuits where those appraisals were made public, the government’s outside experts invariably priced the land higher than the Army Corps’ evaluators.\n\nTake the case of Rollins Koppel. In 2002, Koppel and his investors bought 420 acres of vacant land wedged in a prime location between Brownsville and Matamoros, its sister city across the river in Mexico. They planned a neighborhood of affordable homes. It would be surrounded by a park overlooking the Rio Grande. Koppel successfully lobbied the Brownsville City Commission to establish a special taxing district for the development.\n\nBy 2007, Koppel had managed to install sewer and water lines, and he had platted the subdivision. But it was still just vacant land.\n\nThen the federal government showed up with a Declaration of Taking. The border fence cut up the development and destroyed any chance for a riverfront park. Homeland Security made him an offer: $233,000 in return for a little more than six acres of land.\n\nPerhaps no property owner along the Rio Grande was more savvy about the value of his land than Koppel. With deep roots in Brownsville, Koppel had practiced law in the area for more than 45 years. He had partnered with some of the biggest developers in Texas to build the project.\n\nSo when the Justice Department filed its Declaration of Taking, Koppel hired one of Texas’ top law firms, Vinson & Elkins, renowned for its ferocious litigators, to fight back.\n\nOver the next three years, the two sides faced off in court, even as Homeland Security built the fence. Koppel’s attorneys attacked the integrity of the government’s appraiser.\n\nJustice attorneys argued that Koppel’s appraiser had not properly followed government standards. And Koppel, they said, was overvaluing the market for his development in one of the most economically depressed parts of Brownsville.\n\nOn one point, though, both sides agreed. The government’s initial evaluation had vastly underestimated the damage the fence would do to Koppel’s development. Koppel’s attorneys put the total price at more than $14.6 million. The government’s attorneys said it was $1.4 million.\n\nWhen the two sides finally settled, Homeland Security paid Koppel $4.9 million. That was the highest payout for any property in the Rio Grande Valley, and it represented a 2,043 percent increase from the government’s initial estimate of fair market value.\n\nIn the end, even that might not have been enough. Koppel was never able to get the subdivision built. He died earlier this year at 88. His attorney did not return phone calls seeking comment.\n\nEqual but different\n\nU.S. courts have held that appraisals are more art than science. Actual market sales are the single most important component in most appraisals — but real estate in the Rio Grande Valley did not turn over often. Nor had anyone ever sold property with a border fence on it. The government’s experts were left guessing at values — and often getting them wrong.\n\nA close look at the Loop family’s case exposes the inequity of the government’s work in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nThe Loops have been farming at the very edge of America since the early 1900s. The family’s land runs along the Rio Grande at the southernmost tip of Texas, just a few miles before it unspools into the Gulf of Mexico. Loop brothers, uncles and cousins grew navel oranges and tangerines, cabbages and corn, green peas and cotton — pretty much anything they wanted to put in the ground. The rich soil, bottomland, is blessed with yearlong sunshine and warmth.\n\nThe family lived the border’s problems. Drug couriers hauling duffel bags stuffed with narcotics hiked across their farm. People from Mexico, elsewhere in Central America, as far away as Romania, illegally crossed the border into their land. Every once in a while, dead bodies floated past in the river.\n\nWhen the government came looking to build the border fence in 2007, Ray and Frank and their cousins, Tim and Paul, were working more than 5,200 acres on contiguous properties. Though the barrier didn’t make much sense to them, they welcomed the idea of better border control.\n\n“Good fences make good neighbors; isn’t that what Robert Frost said?” Ray Loop remarked.\n\nThe border fence cutting across the Loops’ land was going to trap most of it between the river and the fence. It would also strand Tim’s home and Ray’s home in the no man’s land that remained. The Loops’ biggest concern was their farms: How would they be able to get to them?\n\nBoth pairs of brothers talked with the land agents sent out by the Army Corps. To a person unfamiliar with the finer points of eminent domain law, the offers looked awfully generous.\n\nIn Ray and Frank’s case, the government announced its intention to take 5.5 acres. The compensation would be $210,000.\n\nBut issues beyond the amount of money bothered Ray Loop. He was having trouble nailing down answers to questions. Was Homeland Security going to build a gate? Would the road be wide and durable enough to accommodate his 42,000-pound, 26-foot-wide John Deere combine? And what about his family? He had three daughters. If they had a code to the gate, wouldn’t they become targets for drug dealers who wanted access?\n\n“The safety issues were terrible,” he said. “I was worried all the time.”\n\nRay Loop talked it over with his family. He decided to fight. He hired one of the best-known eminent domain law firms in Texas, a boutique outfit called Barron Adler. Steve Adler, the politically connected co-founder, would become Austin’s mayor. (Adler also provided initial funding for the launch of The Texas Tribune.)\n\nKim Loessin, the Barron Adler lawyer who handled the Loops’ case, believed the government offer ignored key facts. Loop got money from his farm, and from a sand mining operation and a hunting camp. How would the value of the land between the fence and the Rio Grande be affected?\n\nLoessin hired a professional appraiser to judge the property’s value. Using the government’s formula, the Loops’ appraiser put the total damages across the 630-acre farm at $1.4 million. The damage tally included an additional four acres of land for fence construction, troubles with access to the farmland, and the effect of the fence on the resale value of Ray Loop’s home.\n\nThe government hired its own appraiser. Unlike the Army Corps, he was required to carry out a full assessment using Yellow Book standards. His estimate of the harm done to the Loop farm was just under $1 million.\n\nThe two professional estimates differed — not unusual in a court battle. But both soared far above the Army Corps’ initial estimate of $210,000.\n\n“It was one of the only projects that I had ever encountered in this area of practice where the government just skated on so many things,” said Loessin, who wound up representing dozens of owners in the Rio Grande Valley. “I’m not just generally an anti-government person, but that just infuriated me, with regard to property rights in particular.”\n\nTim and Paul Loop took a different path. They did not respond to requests for an interview, but Tim submitted a sworn affidavit in court files that tells their story.\n\nTim and Paul Loop decided to accept the Army Corps’ initial offer — a payment of $160,000 for the damage to their farming operation caused by the fence. It would run across seven acres on scattered strips of land. The price seemed right.\n\n“It was our desire to not be an obstruction to our government’s getting a job done,” Tim Loop declared in his affidavit. “We wanted to do our patriotic duty.” Nobody told the family that the money was supposed to represent all the losses to their farming operation.\n\nOnly after Ray and Frank’s experience did they realize the government had shortchanged them. After all, they farmed similar crops, on the same land — the Loops’ farms bumped up against each other. Why were the two sets of cousins being compensated so differently? Tim and Paul tried to reopen negotiations. But by then, it was too late. The government already owned the land.\n\n“We trusted our government to treat us fairly,” Tim Loop wrote. “We trusted the representatives of the government to be honest and forthright when dealing with us.”\n\nIn the end, the government took additional land to build the fence. By then, Tim and Paul had hired Loessin. The brothers’ final compensation was $400,000, with a loss of 20 acres.\n\nRay and Frank Loop, on the other hand, settled their case. They received $1.4 million for the loss of 11 acres.\n\nIn the years after construction, Ray Loop learned to live with the fence. Sometimes the gates broke down, but the government sent a contractor to fix it. The added border control was hardly perfect. Homeland Security never closed up access at an old farm road, leaving a yawning, 40-foot-wide gap in the fence where anyone could walk through.\n\nBut earlier this year, one of Ray’s nightmares became real.\n\nRising early one morning in January, he smelled smoke. A few minutes later, a Border Patrol officer texted him: “Sir, your barn is on fire I believe,” it read.\n\nThe barn was actually the Loops’ home — they lived on the second floor, above a space that housed some of their animals. He rushed to wake his daughters and his wife. The family escaped unharmed, but the animals did not. Four of the family’s dogs and a goat burned alive, their cries haunting the family.\n\nRay believes that the fire engines that raced to his home were hindered by the gate. Fire officials dispute that. But Ray is certain that the engines would have been able to respond faster had they not had to negotiate the fence that was meant to block border crossers — not emergency vehicles.\n\nRay and his family have rebuilt their home. They are again living in no man’s land, that slice of America between the fence and Mexico.\n\n“What else are we going to do?” he asked.\n\nComedy of error\n\nIt was Feb. 3, 2009, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Paxton Warner had a confession to make.\n\nFor more than a year, Justice Department attorneys had been seizing property. And for more than a year, they had been paying the landowners for their losses. They had beaten the Dec. 31, 2008 deadline set by Congress. Contractors were digging wide trenches and pouring concrete for the fence.\n\nBut it was only now, in the middle of litigating a case against the Borzynski brothers, two farmers known as the Cabbage Kings of America, that the government realized that it had erred in nearly every single case, Warner told the court.\n\n“I have made a mess of the Borzynski case,” Warner told the court.\n\nThe government had not finished title work on many of the properties until Christmas. In the rush, the attorneys had not realized that they had failed to compensate the owners for water rights to their land.\n\nIt was an almost unbelievable mistake for anybody who knew anything about the American West.\n\nIn Texas, as in many states west of the Mississippi, water rights can be worth more than the land itself. The rights give landowners control over a certain amount of water from the Rio Grande. That allocation can be sold to farmers who need water for their crops. Without water rights, there is no agriculture.\n\nNow, Warner told the judge, the government was going to refile all of its taking cases to ensure that the landholders would retain those rights.\n\nThe congressional deadline “required us to kind of, I guess, essentially work backwards from the way a normal condemnation would have been done,” Warner explained.\n\nJustice Department attorneys discovered another giant mistake. Much of the fence had been built on top of an earthen levee running parallel to the Rio Grande. Only after construction did the government realize that property owners actually had title to the land beneath the levee. The government had not paid for any of it.\n\nDaniel Hu, the U.S. attorney overseeing the condemnation lawsuits, offered an apology.\n\n“We actually built the fence on land that we haven’t finished taking yet,” Hu told Hanen at a hearing.\n\nYet another problem:\n\nThe Rio Grande Valley was famous in Texas for murky land claims — the river shifted constantly, changing property lines. Records were missing. Families often had multiple members claiming ownership. But nobody at Homeland Security or the Justice Department appeared to have prepared for the complexity involved. Years would pass before the government would even know who it was suing.\n\nIn one case in the small town of Eagle Pass, Justice lawyers found 24 heirs to a half-acre tract overlooking the Rio Grande. The case took almost five years to unravel, with a plot worthy of a Gabriel García Márquez novel. The lawsuit involved the Roman Catholic Church, a competing land claim from another family, and a handwritten deed from 1894 that referred to the property line as “beginning at a mesquite tree eight inches in diameter on the east bank of the Rio Grande.”\n\nWhen pressed about problems or delays, U.S. attorneys continually blamed the deadline set by Congress for their mistakes.\n\n“The government had to rush,” Warner explained in defending himself from a sanctions motion.\n\nThe Justice Department, “working within the parameters set by the realities of the world we live in, rather than as we wish them to be, took the subject properties with the information then available.”\n\nSometimes, the mistakes seemed farcical. In one case, Homeland Security offered to pay the city of Brownsville $123,100 for nearly 16 acres abutting the Rio Grande. It turned out the land was owned by the city — but 257 other people also had claim to the property.\n\nWhat’s more, Homeland Security had relied on a mistaken land survey to seize the tract. The new property line had been drawn to cut through the middle of an irrigation pump house owned by Brownsville.\n\n“[W]e inadvertently took half of a pump house that belongs to the city,” Hu told Hanen. “The federal government doesn’t want it. We want to give it back to the city.”\n\n“Why did you only take half? You didn’t want the whole pump house?” Hanen joked.\n\n“We didn’t even want half actually,” Hu said.\n\nMore than nine years later, the case remains open. Justice Department attorneys continue to locate and pay the additional landholders. Just this September, the agency disbursed a payment of $5,750 to two owners.\n\nThe circumstance is not unusual. Pamela Rivas is one of more than 40 property owners who have waited almost a decade for their cases to resolve. Many involve complex ownership claims. The government had to untangle who owned a small tract of land in Rivas’ case.\n\nThat dispute, however, was settled years ago. The United States now owns about an acre of her land near a border crossing. But it has yet to agree with Rivas on a final payment..\n\n“I’m just a nobody and they’re going to do what they want to do,” Rivas said. “I don’t think that’s right.”\n\nRoberto Pedraza, meanwhile, hit the jackpot — just not the way he ever imagined.\n\nPedraza was one of several property owners who were paid by the government for land that they did not own.\n\nPedraza spent most of his life working as a farmer and foreman for rancher Rex McGarr, whom Pedraza affectionately still calls “my boss man.” When McGarr died, he willed 114 acres of Hidalgo County farmland to Pedraza and his wife, Olivia.\n\nBut McGarr’s death led to decades of legal wrangling between other beneficiaries and attorneys for the estate. In 2008, the year Pedraza was first approached by an Army Corps land agent, he still wasn’t clear on what was legally his. But the federal government seemed to have figured that out for him.\n\n“I told him, that person from the government, that [there] was a legal matter on this property,” Pedraza said. “And [the government official] said, ‘Well, according to the records… you own it.’”\n\nIn September 2008, Pedraza was paid $20,500. He and his wife used the money to pay off longstanding bills.\n\nMore than six years passed. Then, one day in 2014, a government representative contacted them. After completing title research, the Justice Department realized that the land had not belonged to him.\n\nThe government offered him a deal. Pedraza could keep the money, so long as he signed a document disclaiming ownership to the land.\n\n“The government came in and said, ‘Look if you give the right of way … then you don’t have to pay,’ ” he said. “I said, ‘Fine,’ because I knew this thing was a big mess.”\n\nThe real owner of the land was Pedraza’s next-door neighbor: Alberto Garza, the 91-year-old sugar cane farmer.\n\nHomeland Security had already paid Garza $45,000 for a total of 3.4 acres from Garza’s sugar cane farm, which stretches on both sides of a highway that parallels the Rio Grande near the hamlet of San Benito.\n\nBorder Patrol officials promised to build a gate in the border fence to give Garza continued access to the land that he had farmed for five decades. But when Homeland Security’s contractors showed up, they ignored the promise, according to his daughter, Norma Longoria.\n\n“When we saw that they were putting the poles up, we tried to stop them,” Longoria, a 62-year-old retired state worker, remembered. “They told us no.”\n\nWhen the government returned years later to pay the family for land that they thought had belonged to Pedraza, it seemed a recompense for the oversight of not installing the gate. Garza got an additional $10,500 out of the deal.\n\nBut Longoria said her father never fully recovered from the shock of being shut off from his own farm. Before, he followed a dirt road behind his house to get to his sugar cane fields or visit his beloved cattle. Now he must drive a mile down the highway until he reaches a gate, then double back. He still visits his land. But not as often as he used to.\n\n“It’s very inconvenient now,” Longoria said. “We didn’t feel it was fair.”\n\nThe Justice Department spokesman explained that the government is not required to provide exact property descriptions or have done research prior to seizing land using a Declaration of Taking.\n\nThe spokesman said that many of the condemnation lawsuits in the Valley were filed to clean up problems with property tiles. In a so-called “friendly” take, the seller makes no objection, but the government files a condemnation suit to make sure that legal ownership is clear and no debts are attached to the property when the federal government takes possession.\n\nThe spokesman declined to comment on any open cases.\n\nPast as present\n\nAbout 20 miles south of Laredo, Texas, lies a forgotten town.\n\nFour crumbling structures cluster around a soft dirt road. The roofs are gone. The stucco has peeled off the walls, revealing hand-carved blocks of dun-colored sandstone. Mesquite trees and thick grass grow all around. Butterflies flit about.\n\nThe ruins are what remain of a town once called Dolores. It was an early settlement north of the Rio Grande, built in the summer of 1750 under the command of José de Escandón, the Spanish conquistador who colonized the region.\n\nFor Mauricio Vidaurri, it is home.\n\nVidaurri is a descendant of one of the pioneers who founded the town. Vidaurri’s family once owned thousands of acres around this spot off a lonely stretch of highway between Laredo and Zapata. Now, they farm some 1,300 acres of watermelon, cucumbers and grazing hay. A power company rents the land to extract natural gas. An irrigation pump draws water from the Rio Grande.\n\nVidaurri likes to come here sometimes and just sit — there is a mystery, a power, about the place that fills him.\n\n“We’ve been here since before the United States,” he said. “One owner.”\n\nThese days, another feeling haunts him: worry. Since the presidential campaign began, Vidaurri has paid close attention to Trump’s promises about building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico. It would be 40 feet high and be made of concrete. It would stretch from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIf Trump were to build that wall, it would run straight through Vidaurri’s ranch, which lies north of the Rio Grande Valley. When constructing the border fence, Homeland Security skipped much of the area around Laredo, deciding it was not a high enough priority.\n\nTrump has not announced any plans to build the wall here — but Homeland Security officials have indicated that the agency will be taking land and erecting a fence about 50 miles to the south, around Rio Grande City.\n\nMark Borkowski, the top contracting official for Customs and Border Protection, told a conference in San Antonio in April that the agency would return to finish what it had started a decade ago. “We’re going to seize more land,” Borkowski said. “We are going to do it.”\n\nVidaurri is a strong proponent of better border protection. Border crossers trespass on his land constantly. Drug couriers have broken into a home on the ranch.\n\nBut Vidaurri thinks the solution lies in the better deployment of technology, like the hidden cameras that Border Patrol has installed throughout his ranch, or the static blimps that hover silently in the sky above, scanning the border.\n\nWith Trump still promising the wall, Vidaurri figures it’s only a matter of time until Homeland Security arrives with bulldozers and pile drivers. When the time comes, he knows there will be no stopping the government. And he doesn’t think any amount of compensation will make him whole.\n\n“We can’t say our land is worth so much. Our land was bought with our blood, sweat and tears,” Vidaurri said.\n\nVidaurri’s concerns are especially personal.\n\nFrom Dolores’ ruins, Vidaurri can walk a few hundred yards to a small, fenced graveyard on a bank overlooking the Rio Grande. Simple white crosses mark some graves. Others are surrounded by elaborate wrought iron fence. Many of the markers date from the early 1800s. In one corner, two flags fly: that of the United States and that of the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nVidaurri stops by the grave of his father, Roberto J. Vidaurri. He served in the Marine Corps during World War II, and was twice wounded in Iwo Jima. The wall would slice right through here, Vidaurri figures, cutting him off from his land, from his father.\n\nIt would be like building a wall through his heart.\n\n“You’ll build a wall on our land and destroy sacred ground for us and tear away our history,” he said. “What good will it do?”\n\nThe Texas Tribune and ProPublica, which produces investigative journalism in the public interest, partnered on this project to expose the federal government’s unsettling use of eminent domain to seize land for a fence along the U.S -Mexico border.

A few of the worst: investments in a rural Up North golf course that never made money, a time-share resort in Hawaii that didn't get built and an energy drink company run by a twice-convicted felon that went bankrupt.\n\nYet other deals were come-from-behind winners, such as financing for the once-troubled Westin Book Cadillac Detroit hotel that finally paid off last year, and an investment in a casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, that was hit by Hurricane Katrina and got a big insurance settlement. Those gains made up for some losses.\n\nDetails and final outcomes for many of the pension fund's deals have not been widely disclosed. Some deals emerged in complex circuit or federal court lawsuits, or in criminal proceedings concerning misappropriation of pension funds. Other deals fell out of public view with the passing of time.\n\nWhy these deals matter\n\nThe Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters and Millwrights receive pension benefits from this fund. The $772 million fund is in \"critical and declining\" status at only 34.5% funded, and projected to run out of money by 2035.\n\nTo stabilize the fund, the pension trustees are seeking permission from the U.S. Treasury Department to slash many of their members' pension checks by amounts such as 16% to 26%, starting in July 2020. The request is pending, and, if approved, would be subject to a vote by the pension fund's beneficiaries.\n\nEven if a majority vote to reject the cuts, Treasury could still force the cuts to take effect through a special rule that applies to the largest pension funds in the country.\n\nRisky deals are not the sole reason for the fund's now-dire trajectory. There were unavoidable losses in the past two recessions, a decline in the carpenters' work hours from past years and a troubling 2.4 pension recipients or soon-to-be recipients for every active contributor, according to documents submitted by the fund's trustees to the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nThe Free Press could not track total losses or gains from all of the union's risky real estate and investment deals in the 2000s. But losses from the known bad deals did pile up over time, representing lost opportunities for better investments and contributing to the pension fund's current crisis.\n\nMany of the questionable deals happened under the leadership of Walter Ralph Mabry, a former chairman of the pension fund's board of trustees who also headed the carpenters' union from the late 1990s until mid-2006, when he was sentenced to prison for two years for receiving Illegally discounted work to his house.\n\nThe deals also were presumably approved by the pension fund's board of trustees.\n\nOne source close to the carpenters' pension fund was \"shocked by how bad the real estate investments were.\"\n\n\"They were investing in some of the riskiest stuff I've ever seen in my life,\" the person said.\n\nA representative for the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters and Millwrights said none of the fund's trustees were available for an interview.\n\nTom Lutz, the pension fund's chairman, said in a statement Friday that the real estate and other deals cited in this story represented less than 8% of the fund's portfolio at the time.\n\n\"Focusing on a handful of investments which produced negative returns, while ignoring those in that same category (private equity and alternatives), or the much larger traditional investment portfolios (such as stocks and bonds) paints a distorted picture of the pension fund's historic investment performance,\" the statement said.\n\nRelying on risky investment tips\n\nOne-off real estate deals can be risky, but can offer the possibility of higher returns than more conventional investments such as stocks.\n\nTurnaround consultant James McTevia, who has worked as an adviser to several public-sector pension funds in Michigan that ran into investment problems, said that pension funds court danger if their trustees rely on nontraditional investment tips or advice from friends or associates.\n\n“Pension funds are generally susceptible to people or institutions that are trying to get the pension fund to invest their money as a result of a relationship they have,\" said McTevia, 83, founder of McTevia and Associates in Bingham Farms. “That’s how a lot of those loans are done, and they don’t always turn out well.\"\n\nThe carpenters' pension fund is classified as a multiemployer plan because multiple companies hire the unionized workers and contribute toward their pensions. Today, such plans are generally in worse shape than those tied to single employers.\n\nThe federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which can step in if pension funds run out of money, says there are about 125 multiemployer plans nationwide that are projected to go insolvent in the next 20 years, affecting 1.4 million people.\n\nYet without federal intervention, the guaranty corporation's multiemployer bailout program is itself projected to run out of money by 2025. If that happens, only a fraction of retirees' promised benefits would be paid out.\n\n'I will lose my house'\n\nCarpenter Frank Vanderhoff, 58, of Rochester Hills, is among the union's members who are anxious and angry about the prospect of a pension cut. He retired in November 2017 after 34 years in the trade because of various ailments picked up during his decades on the job, including bad knees, a bad hip and a damaged rotator cuff.\n\nOn two occasions, Vanderhoff was mere months away from qualifying for a full pension, he said, but each time the fund's trustees changed the plan's retirement age formula to delay the insolvency date. The result was a 28% cut to what Vanderhoff once anticipated that his pension would be. If the pending cuts happen, his pension would be cut even further.\n\n“I will lose my house if this goes through,\" Vanderhoff said. “I’m not looking for a handout, I'm just looking for survival and getting what I deserve.”\n\nDeals gone bad\n\nThe Free Press identified several big deals that soured for the pension fund.\n\nMany of them happened under the leadership of Mabry.\n\nMabry, the former pension fund chairman, had been the best-paid union leader in Michigan with $410,000 in total annual compensation from the carpenters.\n\nHe also had been a trustee in the 1990s for the Millwrights Local 1102 pension fund and health fund, but resigned those positions in 2000 following allegations by the U.S. Department of Labor that he and other Millwrights trustees failed in their fiduciary duties.\n\nForest Dunes\n\nOne of the carpenters' questionable deals involved the Forest Dunes Golf Club, a private golf course and residential development about 16 miles east of Grayling in rural Roscommon.\n\nIn 1998, the pension fund made a $20.6 million construction loan to develop the 600-acre-plus upscale golf course community, which news reports described as the idea of three Arizona developers. The course was designed by famed golf course architect Tom Weiskopf.\n\nMabry told Sports Illustrated that their original plan was to build 1,200 houses at the club with an average cost of $350,000.\n\n\"We didn't have a lot of union activity in the field of residential home building in Michigan, and we thought it would put our members to work,\" he told the magazine.\n\nWhen the construction loan went bad, the pension fund moved to foreclose in March 2000. The carpenters then spent more money to complete the project, including buying another 600 acres or so of adjoining land.\n\nStill, the course struggled to attract members and residents because of its out-of-the-way location. At the time of the 2004 Sports Illustrated interview, only 45 people had golf course memberships and only seven houses were built.\n\nA source familiar with the golf course estimates that the carpenters spent roughly $40 million in total on Forest Dunes, including plugging its yearly operating losses. In 2011, the property was sold for a reported $3.85 million to Arkansas trucking magnate Lew Thompson.\n\nForest Dunes is now a high-end public golf course.\n\nUFC energy drink\n\nIn another deal, the carpenters, along with metro Detroit-based Operating Engineers Local 324, invested a combined $32 million in 2006 in an energy drink company called Xyience, which sponsored Ultimate Fighting Championship cage fights.\n\nXyience was founded in Las Vegas two years earlier by a man named Russell Pike, who had spent time in federal prison in the late 1990s for money laundering.\n\nThe deal was one of several that the carpenters and the operating engineers made through a small and now-defunct Chicago investment firm called AA Capital Partners that catered to pension funds.\n\nShortly before Xyience declared bankruptcy in 2008, the carpenters' pension fund recovered about $5 million of its investment, according to court records. The recovery happened because a receiver for AA Capital Partners, finding the Xyience investment \"highly speculative,\" sought to unwind the funds' investment in it.\n\nIt is unclear how much money the carpenters lost in the energy drink company.\n\nPike was later convicted of income tax evasion in connection to Xyience, which still exists under different ownership.\n\nAA Capital Partners unravels\n\nThe Chicago firm AA Capital Partners was ultimately brought down by fraud allegations.\n\nIn February 2010, AA Capital's president and co-owner, John Orecchio, now 53, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and theft for misappropriating $24.2 million from six union pension funds — including the carpenters' and Operating Engineers Local 324.\n\nIn all, the carpenters' pension fund invested about $75 million through the firm in a joint investment fund beginning in the early 2000s, according to federal court documents.\n\nA pension fund representative would not specify how much money it believes it lost in investments, as well as fraud, through AA Capital Partners. However, the fund says a portion of its investments through the firm went toward private equity and continues to pay dividends.\n\nLutz, the pension fund's chairman, said in a statement that Orecchio \"took advantage of hard-working people and their well-earned retirement and we are glad that the system worked to remove him from that position.\"\n\nSome of the misappropriated money from the six pension funds went toward Orecchio's extravagant lifestyle, including $1 million in jewelry and private airplane flights for himself and his mistress, renovations of the former Crazy Horse strip club on Michigan Avenue in Detroit, and buying a horse farm in Ira Township.\n\nAfter a failed suicide attempt, Orecchio served eight years in prison and was ordered to pay more than $26 million in restitution.\n\nOrecchio also once told authorities he paid $10,000 to then-Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick's nonprofit foundation, in return for the mayor's support of a $20 million investment in AA Capital that he was pitching to one of the city's pension funds. The money was never invested.\n\nHotel losses\n\nThe carpenters' pension fund suffered more loses in downtown Detroit's Detroit Hilton Garden Inn — a $1.6 million loss, according to court documents — and a proposed time-share development in Hawaii called Coconut Beach Resort that was to feature 343 beachfront condos and a restaurant. Coconut Beach was reported as a $12.6 million loss. The resort was never built.\n\nBoth investments happened through AA Capital. The losses were reported by a receiver for AA Capital who calculated the outcome of the pension funds' various investments.\n\nThe operating engineers' pension fund also invested in Coconut Beach in a 44% to 55% split with the carpenters, also losing money.\n\nA representative for the operating engineers wouldn't comment on the resort deal.\n\nHurricane check\n\nNot all of the carpenters' risky deals went sour.\n\nThe winners included an investment in a new Hard Rock casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, that netted a positive $15.9 million for the pension fund with an insurance settlement triggered by the casino's 2005 destruction by Hurricane Katrina, according to court records and the AA Capital receiver's report.\n\nThe casino was rebuilt and is still open today.\n\nBook Cadillac pay offs\n\nThe carpenters also were involved in a complicated 2006 deal to redevelop and reopen the Westin Book Cadillac Detroit hotel. The $180 million-plus project involved seven layers of financing and numerous tax incentives and nontraditional loans, including loans from two City of Detroit public-sector pension funds.\n\nThe deal fell into trouble almost immediately as Detroit's real estate market collapsed and the recession hit. Developer John Ferchill later told DBusiness Magazine that the Book Cadillac's appraised value plummeted from $120 million when the financing was put together to $25 million after the hotel opened in 2008.\n\nAt first, the carpenters' pension fund's involvement in the deal was providing a credit enhancement for the project's senior lender in the form of letters of credit totaling $17.2 million. However, the carpenters lacked a lien position in the hotel's mortgage, even though they were on the hook with the letters of credit if the senior lender didn't get repaid.\n\nIn 2009, with the hotel struggling with debt repayment, the senior lender drew down $3 million from the carpenters' letters of credit. The carpenters then confronted the possibility of eventually losing all of their remaining investment.\n\nTo avoid such a disaster, the carpenters moved to buy out the senior lender, paying a discounted $36.5 million price for the $42.5 million loan balance, according to documents in Wayne County and Oakland County circuit courts.\n\nIt looked to be a genius move. The maneuver gave the carpenters' fund the No. 1 lien priority on the hotel's mortgage. It also allowed them to put their unused letters of credit money toward the buyout. And it provided the carpenters with future interest payments.\n\nHowever, the maneuver prompted the City of Detroit's two pension funds in 2013 to sue the carpenters' pension fund, claiming the buyout deal was unfair to the hotels' subordinate lenders. The lawsuit ended in a confidential settlement, different from that reported by news outlets several years ago.\n\nThe hotel industry in Detroit has done better in recent years and the Book Cadillac's mortgage was refinanced in July 2018 by a commercial lender. The refinancing allowed some lenders, including the two city pension funds, to get back their principal. And the carpenters did even better.\n\nIn the end, the carpenters received $76.3 million from their Book Cadillac investment of essentially $39.5 million, according to court documents and Free Press calculations. Those gains included a $41.3 million payoff from the refinancing, plus $35 million in interest payments collected from late 2009 until the refinancing.\n\nLas Vegas trip\n\nMabry stepped down from his leadership roles with the carpenters after his 2006 conviction for receiving $120,000 in illegally discounted work on his Grosse Pointe Park home between 1998 and 1999. He was sentenced to two years in federal prison.\n\nPrior to that conviction, Mabry had traveled to Las Vegas and met with the fund's Chicago investment manager, Orecchio, and another man named Joseph \"Roxy\" Jewett.\n\nFederal prosecutors claimed that Mabry agreed to a scheme in which he caused Orecchio to hire Jewett in 2004 as a consultant for the pension fund's Hard Rock casino investment in Mississippi.\n\nIn exchange, Jewett allegedly promised a kickback to Mabry in the form of a $266,000 investment in the Xyience energy drink company.\n\nThe Las Vegas meetings came back to haunt the men.\n\nJewett was later convicted of trying to bribe Mabry to gain access to the carpenters' pension fund money.\n\nAnd Mabry went on to plead guilty to accepting more than $5,000 in hotel and entertainment expenses from Orecchio and Jewett during Las Vegas trips. Mabry insisted to the end that he never considered the \"comps\" on the trips or the energy drink investment to be bribes.\n\n\"I have had plenty of offers to take kickbacks, sir. Never took a dime,\" Mabry, now 74, told the judge at his July 2012 sentencing hearing in U.S. District Court in Detroit, referring to his many years as a union leader.\n\nThe judge gave Mabry, who was battling prostate cancer at the time, a sentence of one year supervised released, which was much lighter than what prosecutors wanted.\n\nRelying on investment manager\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Mabry said the pension fund still made money in some investments that it made through Orecchio and the now-defunct firm AA Capital Partners.\n\n\"He did very well with our investments up until the point he got in trouble with some stuff that he was doing, unbeknownst to me,\" Mabry said, according to a transcript of the proceedings.\n\nMabry conceded that the Xyience investment didn't turn out well, and said it was all Orecchio's idea to invest in the energy drink.\n\n\"I told him that we do not invest in that kind of — it was too high of a risk to be getting involved in Xyience stuff,\" Mabry said. \"But he has got the sole discretion on that part of it, and he elected to do that, unbeknownst to me, until I found out about it after.\"\n\nMabry's account is backed up in part by the receiver's investigation into AA Capital Partners, which determined \"that Mr. Orecchio imprudently invested the profits earned by the Carpenters and the Operators in (one investment fund) ... into Xyience.\"\n\n2 more deals\n\nDuring his sentencing, Mabry went on to cite two more investment deals that he said turned out as positives for the pension fund. One was in Detroit's Greektown Casino — \"we made 29% on our money\" — and the other was in a tribal casino within Washington state, he said. Mabry couldn't recall the name of the tribal casino, although receiver records for AA Capital identify an investment in Washington in the Stillaguamish tribe's casino, known as Angel of the Winds Casino Resort.\n\nMabry said the various deals were the sort of alternative investments recommended by the carpenters' pension fund consultant. He did not identify the consultant.\n\n\"Our consultant always tells us, 'listen, you've got to be really diversified in this economy in case something happens,' \" he said.\n\nBoss gets 2 pensions\n\nIt also emerged during Mabry's case that authorities did not intend to go after the former union boss's two pensions — one through the local union, the other through the international union. The prosecutor said Mabry was already getting $11,000 per month in pension checks, a number the former union boss didn't deny.\n\n\"My pension? Yes, I worked from 1970 all the way up,\" Mabry said. \"In our business it is an awfully dangerous job ... and a lot of my members have better pensions than I've got.\"\n\nMabry also claimed in court that if he could run again to lead the carpenters' union, the membership would undoubtedly vote him in.\n\n\"If I ran today, I guarantee you, I would win the election because they know that the Labor Department has been after me for a long time because they don't like some of my politics,\" he said. \"I never did anything to be ashamed of.\"\n\nHis former attorney, Arthur Weiss, said Friday that Mabry declined comment for this article. He said there were never any improprieties involving Mabry and the pension fund.\n\n\"Had their been an impropriety, Mabry would have never gotten his pension, and he got a full pension,\" Weiss said. \"I don’t have any knowledge as to what the current state of affairs is, but trying to tie something from 13 years ago to the present day is a bit tenuous.\"\n\nBigger return, bigger risk\n\nThe carpenters' fund is not the only local pension fund to dabble in risky deals.\n\nThe City of Detroit's two pension funds — the General Retirement System and the Police and Fire Retirement System — made questionable investments in the past, including in a Pittsburgh casino, a planned Texas subdivision, an industrial warehouse lease-back deal and a pitch to buy distressed mortgage loans in Detroit that turned out a scam.\n\nChristian Veenstra, president of Grand Rapids-based Watkins Ross, which provides consulting and actuarial services to pension plans, said real estate investments can be tempting to pension funds because they offer the possibility of above-average returns. But higher returns typically mean there is greater risk.\n\nContactJC Reindl: 313-222-6631 or jcreindl@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @jcreindl.

Ukraine war ‘over by May’\n\nThe war in Ukraine could be over by early May, according to an adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff. Oleksiy Arestovich said the exact timing “would depend on how much resources the Kremlin was willing to commit to the campaign”, Reuters reported. “Almost all” of Russia’s military offensives in Ukraine “remain stalled” after making little progress over the weekend, a senior US defence official said during a press briefing on Monday. The military convoy to the north did not make much progress towards Kyiv over the weekend and Ukraine continues to defend Mariupol.\n\nUkraine peace talks: how long will the war last?\n\n2. Protest interrupts Russian TV news\n\nA woman holding an anti-war sign ran onto the set of a Russian evening news programme on state-controlled media last night. Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One, burst onto the set of the live broadcast, shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” Her sign, clearly visible behind the presenter, read “no war, stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here”. Ovsyannikova’s protest could be “seen and heard for several seconds before the channel switched to a recorded segment”, said The Guardian.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Short notice for low paid workers\n\nHalf of all low-paid workers in the UK are given less than a week’s notice of their shifts, according to a Living Wage Foundation study. A poll of 2,000 adults found that a fifth of workers have had their shifts cancelled unexpectedly and most are not compensated at their full rate of pay. People earning below the voluntary real Living Wage were more likely to be affected by such insecurity. “It costs to be poor, but this research shows it’s even more costly to be both poor and in insecure work,” said a spokesperson.\n\nWhat does Russia’s war in Ukraine mean for UK?\n\n4. Covid travel rules scrapped\n\nAll remaining Covid travel measures, including the need to fill out a passenger locator form and take a post-arrival test, will end this week, the transport secretary has announced. The move means holidaymakers will be able to enter the UK without any restrictions for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The Guardian said the development comes as “Britain’s Covid situation deteriorate[s] further”. In the past week, 444,201 positive cases have been recorded – an increase of 48.1%. The number of patients admitted to hospital has also risen sharply.\n\nThe true Covid-19 global death toll\n\n5. Court denies Assange appeal\n\nThe Supreme Court has refused to allow Julian Assange his latest appeal against extradition to the US. The court said his application did not raise “an arguable point of law”, constituting a major blow to Assange’s hopes to avoid extradition, reported the BBC. The Wikileaks founder, 50, is wanted in the US over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011. His lawyers said Assange, who is currently jailed in London’s Belmarsh Prison, has not ruled out launching a final appeal.\n\nOct. 2021: What is happening to Julian Assange?\n\n6. Mental health referrals at new high\n\nThe number of referrals for specialist NHS mental health care reached a record high in England by the end of 2021. There were 4.3m referrals for conditions such as anxiety and depression that year, with just under a quarter (1.025m) for children or adolescents. The Royal College of Psychiatrists said the pandemic led to unprecedented demand and subsequent backlogs, with services still struggling to keep up.\n\nIs social media bad for your mental health?\n\n7. Civilians burned to death in Ethiopia\n\nThe government in Ethiopia said it would act after a video appeared on social media showing armed men, some in military uniforms, burning civilians to death. The Ethiopia Government Communication Service said “a horrific and inhumane act was recently committed” in the northwestern Benishangul-Gumuz region, but did not say who was responsible. CNN said the region, which is home to several ethnic groups, has seen frequent violence for more than a year, with hundreds of civilians killed.\n\nWhat is happening in Tigray? Ethiopia's brutal civil war explained\n\n8. Abramovich ‘belonged to crime group’\n\nRoman Abramovich is suspected of belonging to an organised crime group that cheated the Russian government out of £2b, reported The Times. The Chelsea owner made billions after buying an oil company from the Russian government in a rigged auction in 1995. He paid around $250m (£190m) for Sibneft, before selling it back to the Russian government for $13b in 2005. His lawyers told the BBC there was no basis for alleging that he had amassed his wealth through criminality. The oligarch was spotted on Monday at an airport in Israel before a jet linked to him landed in Moscow.\n\nChelsea in turmoil: what next after Roman Abramovich sanctions?\n\n9. Mansion protest ends with arrests\n\nA pro-Ukraine protest at a London mansion linked to Vladimir Putin ally Oleg Deripaska ended with eight arrests on Monday. Activists occupied the balcony of 5 Belgrave Square just after midnight on Sunday and stayed most of the following day, despite police efforts to remove them. A spokesperson for the billionaire owner said he was “appalled at the negligence of Britain’s justice system”. The squatters call themselves the London Mahknovists, after Nestor Makhno, who led an anarchist force that attempted to form a stateless society in Ukraine.\n\nLondongrad: what is the cost of Russian-linked illicit finance in the UK?\n\n10. Snacks high in sugar and salt\n\nA new study has found that 70% of snacks sold as part of lunchtime meal deals in UK high street shops and supermarkets contain dangerously large amounts of salt, sugar or saturated fat. The campaign group Action on Salt said a packet of lemon and coriander green olives sold in the Co-op contains 2.02g of salt – the same as in five portions of salted peanuts and a third of an adult’s daily maximum salt intake. “Unbeknown to many consumers, meal combos and snacks are often exceedingly high in salt,” said a spokesperson.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}]}

Citing Iranian authorities, earlier reports by state-run news agency IRNA said dozens of others were injured after prisoners set fire to a warehouse.\n\nThe notoriously brutal facility is known for housing political prisoners in the country, which has seen mass protests in recent weeks against the Islamic regime that has ruled it for decades.\n\nAward-winning film director Jafar Panahi, 62, who is among the dissidents jailed at Evin, said guards fired tear gas at inmates, according to his wife, Tahereh Saeedi.\n\nIn an interview with Radio Farda – the Iranian branch of the US government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty – Saeedi said her husband called her from the prison and told her that he and fellow jailed filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof are in good health.\n\nSaeedi added that from the time the fire broke out Saturday night to when she got a call from her husband the next day were the worst hours of her life.\n\nActivist group 1500tasvir reported earlier that, in videos posted on social media, gunshots were heard and Iranian special forces were seen heading to the area where the prison is believed to be located.\n\nSources inside the prison told pro-reform outlet IranWire that guards fired tear gas all night after the fire broke out. In many cases, prisoners had to break their windows to so they could breathe, IranWire reported.\n\nIn a Twitter post Sunday, human rights activist and former Evin inmate Atena Daemi said tear gas was fired by security officials, citing a woman prisoner.\n\nInmates on Ward 8 have no water, gas, or bread and 45 of them were transferred “to an unknown place,” Daemi said. “Now everyone is fine, but they are worried about being transferred to other prisons, solitary confinement and interrogation.”\n\nMany inmates had been transferred to Rajaei Shahr prison, about 20 kilometers west (12 miles) of Tehran, Mostafa Nili, a lawyer who represents a number of prisoners, said on Twitter.

Two newly published studies take totally different approaches but arrive at the same conclusion: The Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, China, was most likely the epicenter for the coronavirus.\n\nThe studies were posted online as preprints in February but have now undergone peer review and were published Tuesday in the journal Science.\n\nIn one, scientists from around the world used mapping tools and social media reports to do a spatial and environmental analysis. They suggest that although the “exact circumstances remain obscure,” the virus was probably present in live animals sold at the market in late 2019. The animals were held close together and could easily have exchanged germs. However, the study does not determine which animals may have been sick.\n\nThe researchers determined that the earliest Covid-19 cases were centered at the market among vendors who sold these live animals or people who shopped there. They believe that there were two separate viruses circulating in the animals that spilled over into people.\n\n“All eight COVID-19 cases detected prior to 20 December were from the western side of the market, where mammal species were also sold,” the study says. The proximity to five stalls that sold live or recently butchered animals was predictive of human cases.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback A vital clue to where Covid-19 came from may sit in Wuhan hospital 03:28 - Source: CNN A vital clue to where Covid-19 came from may sit in Wuhan hospital 03:28\n\n“The clustering is very, very specific,” study co-author Kristian Andersen, a professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at Scripps Research, said Tuesday.\n\nThe “extraordinary” pattern that emerged from mapping these cases was very clear, said another co-author, Michael Worobey, department head of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona.\n\nThe researchers mapped the earliest cases that had no connection to the market, Worobey noted, and those people lived or worked in close proximity to the market.\n\n“This is an indication that the virus started spreading in people who worked at the market but then started that spread … into the surrounding local community as vendors went into local shops, infected people who worked in those shops,” Worobey said.\n\nThe other study takes a molecular approach and seems to determine when the first coronavirus infections crossed from animals to humans.\n\nThe earliest version of the coronavirus, this research shows, probably came in different forms that the scientists call A and B. The lineages were the result of at least two cross-species transmission events into humans.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the first animal-to-human transmission probably happened around November 18, 2019, and it came from lineage B. They found the lineage B type only in people who had a direct connection to the Huanan market.\n\nThe authors believe that lineage A was introduced into humans from an animal within weeks or even days of the infection from lineage B. Lineage A was found in samples from humans who lived or stayed close to the market.\n\n“These findings indicate that it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 circulated widely in humans prior to November 2019 and define the narrow window between when SARS-CoV-2 first jumped into humans and when the first cases of COVID-19 were reported,” the study says. “As with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 emergence likely resulted from multiple zoonotic events.”\n\nThe likelihood that such a virus would emerge from two different events is low, acknowledged co-author Joel Wertheim, an associate adjunct professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego.\n\n“Now, I realize it sounds like I just said that a once-in-a-generation event happened twice in short succession, and pandemics are indeed rare, but once all the conditions are in place – that is a zoonotic virus capable of both human infection and human transmission that is in close proximity to humans – the barriers to spillover have been lowered such that multiple introductions, we believe, should actually be expected,” Wertheim said.\n\nAndersen said the studies don’t definitively disprove the lab leak theory but are extremely persuasive, so much so that he changed his mind about the virus’ origins.\n\n“I was quite convinced of the lab leak myself, until we dove into this very carefully and looked at it much closer,” Andersen said. “Based on data and analysis I’ve done over the last decade on many other viruses, I’ve convinced myself that actually the data points to this particular market.”\n\nWorobey said he too thought the lab leak was possible, but the epidemiological preponderance of cases linked to the market is “not a mirage.”\n\n“It’s a real thing,” he said. “It’s just not plausible that this virus was introduced any other way than through the wildlife trade.”\n\nTo reduce the chances of future pandemics, the researchers hope they can determine exactly what animal may have first become infected and how.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“The raw ingredients for a zoonotic virus with pandemic potential are still lurking in the wild,” Wertheim said. He believes the world needs to do a much better job doing surveillance and monitoring animals and other potential threats to human health.\n\nAndersen said that although we can’t prevent outbreaks, collaboration between the world’s scientists could be key to the difference between a disease with a small impact and one that kills millions.\n\n“The big question we need to ask ourselves is – the next time this happens, because it will happen – how do we go from detecting that outbreak early and preventing that outbreak so it doesn’t become a pandemic?”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/business/eu-fossil-fuel-exports-russia-ukraine-energy-intl", "title": "Europe has bought $46 billion worth of Russian energy since the ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nRussian revenues from fossil fuel exports to the European Union soared during the first two months of the Ukraine invasion, despite some buyers shunning Russian energy and finding alternative suppliers, a report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) shows.\n\nEuropean Union imports of Russian fossil fuels accounted for 44 billion euros ($46.3 billion) from February 24, the day Russia launched its invasion, to April 24. That’s more than double the value of Russian energy imported by EU states during the same two-month period last year, CREA lead analyst Lauri Myllyvirta told CNN.\n\nHigher prices, rather than volumes, accounted for most of that increase.\n\nThe European Union accounted for around 70% of Russia’s fossil fuel export revenues globally, which amounted to 63 billion euros ($66.3 billion) in the two-month period.\n\nEnergy prices have risen over the past year as nations emerged from lockdowns, pushing up demand. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine gave a further boost to oil and gas prices. OPEC member nations have also failed to deliver promised production increases, further tightening supply.\n\nThe European Union imported 10% more Russian gas through pipelines in the two-month period, and 20% more liquified natural gas, but export volumes of Russian oil and coal to the bloc fell by 20% and 40%, respectively.\n\nThe findings were published as Europe comes under increasing pressure to ban Russian oil imports and expedite its move away from Russian gas to stop enriching the Kremlin, and indirectly financing the war in Ukraine.\n\nIt also comes as Russian energy company Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, in an attempt to pressure European companies more widely to pay in rubles. Russia is trying to prop up its spiraling currency.\n\nThe Russian economy has been side-swiped by Western sanctions that have targeted the county’s central bank and frozen about half of the country’s $600 billion in foreign reserves.\n\n“The fact that their coffers are bulging because of the windfall that they’ve gotten out of the fossil fuel prices is a very perverse outcome,” Myllyvirta told CNN.\n\nWeaning off Russian fossil fuels quickly will be challenging for the 27-nation bloc, which before the war depended on Russia for about 40% of its natural gas imports, as well as 27% of its oil and 46% of coal imports. Abruptly ending these purchases would have serious knock-on effects on consumers and businesses.\n\nIt is particularly challenging for Germany, which has been the largest individual buyer of Russian fossil fuels globally since the invasion, with purchases worth 9.1 billion euros, according to CREA.\n\nThis graph by CREA shows the top 20 importers of Russian fossil fuels by valie in the two months since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It uses data from Eurostat, ENTSO-G and UN COMTRADE. Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air\n\nItaly was the next largest buyer, transferring 6.9 billion euros to Russia, followed by China, the Netherlands, Turkey and France.\n\nThe European Union has pledged to break its dependence on Russian energy by 2027, and is working on an oil embargo that could be announced as early as next week, but the report shows that the diversification measures thus far announced will achieve little in the short term.\n\n“Everything that has been announced around green energy and energy efficiency is impressive, if you look at the potential impact over the next few years,” Myllyvirta said.\n\n“But then as mentioned, the short-term component — that would do as much as possible to limit Russia’s revenues in the immediate term — has been really lacking.”\n\nTo reach its conclusions, CREA researchers tracked seaborne deliveries using ship location (AIS) data, and pipeline deliveries using data from Eurostat and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas.\n\nSeveral European energy companies are now in talks with Gazprom over their gas contracts.

Popes typically hold office until death, and the last pope to step down was Gregory XII, who quit in 1415 to end a civil war within the church.\n\nBookended by globally popular and charismatic popes – St. John Paul II and Pope Francis – Benedict cut a different figure. Friends and biographers described him as quiet and scholarly, more at home among theological tomes than adoring crowds.\n\nIn typical fashion, Benedict announced his unexpected resignation in Latin. He was 85 at the time and cited his advanced age as ill-suited for the demands of running the Catholic Church.\n\nThe German-born Benedict saw himself, and the church, as a bulwark against secular trends in Western society, particularly what he called the “dictatorship of relativism.” He often insisted that Catholics maintain a fortress mentality, saying perhaps a smaller, “purer” church would best maintain Catholicism’s traditions and teachings.\n\nAs Pope, Benedict was a polarizing figure. He was hailed by conservatives who admired his erudite writings and careful theology. But critics, particularly in the postmodern West, called him “God’s Rottweiler” for his staunch insistence on fidelity to church’s doctrine and his willingness to silence dissent.\n\n“He policed the boundaries of the faith,” said David Gibson, author of “The Rule of Benedict,” a biography of the former pope. “He was brilliant and brutally effective.”\n\nBenedict also came under fire for his handling of the sexual abuse crisis that engulfed the Catholic church during his years as a senior cleric. A damning report published in January 2022 found that he knew about priests who abused children but failed to act when he was archbishop of Munich from 1977 to 1982.\n\nThe son of a policeman\n\nJoseph Ratzinger was born and raised in Bavaria, where he briefly served in the Hitler Youth, despite his objections, and the German military during World War II. His father, a policeman, loathed the Nazis, according to biographers.\n\nRatzinger, like his elder brother Georg, saw their future in the Catholic Church, entering a German seminary in 1945. Once ordained, Ratzinger rose quickly through the church, establishing himself as a leading theologian. Originally a liberal thinker, he turned conservative in 1968 in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, which upended a number of Catholic teachings.\n\nIn 1977, Ratzinger was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising. Later that year, former Pope Paul VI made the German scholar a cardinal, a sign of his growing reputation within the church.\n\nFrom 1981 to 2005, Ratzinger ran the Vatican’s influential Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), the office responsible for stating and policing church doctrine. He was, in effect, Catholicism’s chief theologian during this time, said Gibson, Benedict’s biographer.\n\n“His twenty-four years at the CDF were far more influential than his tenure as pope,” Gibson said.\n\nHis influence was certainly felt in the United States. In 1984, Ratzinger told the Order of Preachers, also known as the Dominicans, to investigate one of its monks, Matthew Fox, for heresy. The Vatican expelled Fox from the order in 1993.\n\nIn 1999, Ratzinger effectively silenced an American nun and priest engaged in LGBTQ ministry because they would not affirm the “Church’s teaching regarding the intrinsic evil of homosexual acts.” The nun and priest were “permanently prohibited from any pastoral work involving homosexual persons.”\n\nBut Ratzinger eventually tired of the job, reportedly asking Pope John Paul II to appoint him as a librarian at the Vatican’s library. John Paul refused.\n\n‘Please don’t do this to me’\n\nRatzinger was dean of the College of Cardinals in 2005 when he became the sixth German to be picked as pope, the first since the 11th century. At the time, the church was facing several pressing issues, including declining popularity in parts of the world and a growing crisis over its role in handling sexual abuse accusations against priests.\n\nAs the conclave to appoint Pope John Paul II’s successor went on, Ratzinger said he quickly realized that he would be elected as the new Pope – though he was reluctant to assume the mantel of St. Peter.\n\n“At a certain point, I prayed to God, ‘Please don’t do this to me,’” he told a German audience in 2005. “Evidently, this time he didn’t listen to me.”\n\nUpon his election, Ratzinger took the name Benedict XVI as a nod to church history, he said. He chose the name to honor Benedict XV, who pursued peace during World War I, and the original St. Benedict, a monk “whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe,” Ratzinger said.\n\nAt 78, he was the oldest person to have been elected pope since Pope Clement XII in 1730. Given his age, Benedict XVI was widely seen as a caretaker pope, a bridge to the next generation after the long tenure of John Paul II, a globe-trotting pontiff whose early youth and vigor gave way to such frailty in later years that he required help walking and was often hard to hear during public addresses.\n\nIn his tone, demeanor and actions, Benedict was notably different from his predecessor. Where John Paul wowed crowds around the world with his mastery of numerous languages, Benedict’s influence was felt through his erudite writings and theological rigor.\n\n“In a world which he considered relativist and secular, his main thrust was to re-establish a sense of Catholic identity for Catholics themselves,” said Delia Gallagher, CNN’s Vatican correspondent.\n\nAs Pope, Benedict often championed a back-to-basics approach. Three of his encyclicals – letters from the Pope to Catholics around the world – were based on the theological virtues of faith, hope and love.\n\nBill Donohue, of the conservative US Catholic League, credited Benedict for working to reduce friction among adherents of various faiths, something that was a key part of John Paul’s mission as well.\n\nBut critics say Benedict didn’t always choose his words wisely. During a speech in Regensburg, Germany in 2006, he quoted a 14th century Byzantine emperor who criticized Islam, calling it violent, “evil and inhuman.”\n\nHis remarks were sharply criticized by heads of states in the Middle East and Muslim groups throughout the world. Effigies of Benedict were burnt in Basra, Iraq, and elsewhere in predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nBenedict later apologized, saying he was “deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address.”\n\nCriticism over sexual abuse crisis\n\nBenedict became pope at the height of the molestation scandal involving Catholic priests, as complaints of sexual abuse and related lawsuits tore at the church and threatened its moral standing around the world.\n\nIn 2002, he asked Pope John Paul II to route all accusations of sexual abuse to his office, where he instituted changes meant to deal swiftly with accused priests. From 2004-2014, the Vatican defrocked 848 priests who raped or molested children and sanctioned another 2,572 with lesser penalties, according to the church. During that time, his office had received 3,400 accusations, according to the church.\n\nThe flood of accusations worldwide has waned at times but has never stopped.\n\nIn 2008, Benedict acknowledged “the shame which we have all felt” over abuse reports and said those responsible for the “evils” should face justice. Two years later he said abusive priests “disfigured their ministry” and brought “profound shame and regret” on the church.\n\nThat same year, 2010, he issued new rules aimed at stopping abuse. These included allowing church prosecution of suspected abusers for 20 years after the incidents occurred, up from 10 years previously. The rules also made it a church crime to download child pornography and allowed the pope to remove a priest without a formal Vatican trial.\n\nIn some cases, Benedict acted swiftly, as when he removed Marcial Maciel, a powerful Mexican priest who founded the conservative Legion of Christ, after years of allegations that he had sexually abused children.\n\n“No one did more to successfully address the problem of priestly sexual abuse than Joseph Ratzinger,” Donohue said.\n\nBut others such as the late Barbara Blaine, the former president of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said the opposite was true.\n\n“I would hate for him to be remembered as someone who did the right thing because from our perspective, Pope Benedict’s record has been abysmal,” said Blaine, who died in 2017.\n\nIn 2010, The New York Times reported that church officials, including Ratzinger, had failed to act in the case of a Wisconsin priest accused of molesting up to 200 boys. The Times reported that church officials stopped proceedings against the priest after he wrote Ratzinger.\n\nAlso in 2010, the Times reported that the future pope – while serving as the archbishop in Munich – had been copied on a memo informing him that a priest accused of molesting children was being returned to pastoral work. At the time, a spokesman for the archdiocese said Ratzinger received hundreds of memos a year, and it was highly unlikely that he had read it.\n\nTwelve years later, a Church-commissioned report into abuse by Catholic clergy in the diocese found that Ratzinger had as archbishop been informed of four cases of sexual abuse involving minors – including two that had taken place while he was in office – but failed to act. In a letter published by the Vatican in February 2022, Benedict issued a general apology to survivors of abuse, writing: “Once again I can only express to all the victims of sexual abuse my profound shame, my deep sorrow and my heartfelt request for forgiveness.”\n\nOver the years, victims’ groups pressed the International Criminal Court to prosecute Benedict in the sex abuse scandal.\n\nDavid Gibson, Benedict’s biographer, said that, like many in the Vatican, the former pope was initially slow to recognize the magnitude of the church’s abuse crisis.\n\n“Like so many in the church, he was part of the learning curve,” Gibson said.\n\nThe anti-Francis\n\nUltimately, however, Benedict showed little skill or interest in governing the vast and complex world of the Catholic Church, Gibson said.\n\nIn 2012, his butler was convicted of theft for leaking confidential papal documents to fight what he saw as deep corruption within the Holy See.\n\nA year later, Benedict announced his resignation.\n\nSince then, Benedict, who chose the name Pope Emeritus and continued to wear the traditional papal white, rarely left his monastery high on a hill in Vatican City, where he promised to live a “hidden life.”\n\nStill, conservative Catholics tried to draw Benedict out, or at least use him as counterweight to the more liberal papacy of Francis. Some Catholics looked to him as an anti-Pope, or at least an anti-Francis.\n\nThe contrast between the two men was dramatized in a 2019 Netflix film, “The Two Popes,” which earned Anthony Hopkins an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Benedict.\n\nThe Rev. Joseph Fessio, an American Jesuit who studied under Benedict and has published his works at Ignatius Press, said the former Pope likely knew that conservatives were trying to pit him against Francis.\n\n“In some ways, he has become the face of ‘the Resistance,’” Fessio said, “even though he hasn’t done anything to be a resistor.”\n\nBenedict preferred to be called something more modest.\n\nBefore he left Rome in 2013, a crowd of 10,000 people gathered to bid him an emotional farewell.\n\n“I am no longer the Pope but I am still in the church,” Benedict said. “I’m just a pilgrim who is starting the last part of his pilgrimage on this earth.”", "authors": ["Daniel Burke Hada Messia", "Daniel Burke", "Hada Messia"], "publish_date": "2022/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/asia/cambodia-poipet-grand-diamond-casino-hotel-fire-intl-hnk", "title": "Death toll rises to 24 after deadly Cambodia casino fire | CNN", "text": "Phnom Penh, Cambodia CNN —\n\nThe death toll has risen to 24 following a huge fire that engulfed a casino complex in Cambodia as search and rescue operations resumed Friday with dozens still unaccounted for, according to authorities.\n\nBanteay Meanchey province spokesman Sek Sokhom told CNN that officials were now working to determine the nationalities of those killed in the blaze at the Grand Diamond City Hotel and Casino in Poipet, near the Thai border.\n\nThe cause of the fire remains unknown and the Cambodian government has set up a committee to investigate, he said.\n\nAt least 70 people were injured in the blaze, he said earlier.\n\nThai rescuers who responded to emergency calls from Cambodian authorities said more bodies had been found trapped inside hotel rooms on Friday.\n\nSomboon Kwan-uam, with Thailand’s Poh Teck Tung Foundation, said smoke levels in the corridors were lower Friday after hampering earlier rescue efforts when many of the victims were found dead from smoke inhalation locked inside their hotel rooms.\n\n“We found seven more bodies from rooms on the second floor,” Somboon said.\n\nSome of the victims’ bodies were expected to be transported back to Thailand Friday, he added.\n\nFirefighters work at the Grand Diamond City Hotel and Casino in Poipet, Cambodia on Wednesday night.

He is the spiritual founder of the term “the Russian world.”\n\nAlong the way, this strand has incorporated a deep loathing of Ukraine’s identity outside of Russia.\n\nDugin helped revive the expression “Novorossiya” or New Russia – which included the territories of parts of Ukraine – before the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin used the word in declaring Crimea part of Russia in March of that year.\n\nDugin has long had a visceral loathing of Ukrainians resisting assimilation into “mother Russia.” After dozens of pro-Russian protesters were killed during clashes in Odesa in May 2014, he said: “Ukraine has to be either vanished from Earth and rebuilt from scratch or people need to get it. I think people in Ukraine need total revolt on all levels and in all regions. An armed revolt against junta. Not only in the South-East.\n\n“I think kill, kill and kill. No more talk anymore. It is my opinion as a professor,” he said.\n\nThe following year, Dugin was sanctioned by the United States as “complicit in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, or sovereignty or territorial integrity of Ukraine.”\n\nBoth Alexander Dugin and his daughter have been sanctioned by the United States. Francesca Ebel/AP\n\nThe birth of Eurasianism\n\nThe work that propelled Dugin to prominence was the “Foundations of Geopolitics” in 1997, in which he set out his vision of a Eurasian empire, stretching from Dublin to Vladivostok. The book advocated sowing instability and dissent in the United States – a pre-echo of the disinformation campaign around the 2016 US election.\n\nIn one passage, he wrote: “It is especially important to introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S.”\n\nThe book, penned in the dying days of Boris Yelstin’s chaotic presidency, became a best-seller in Russia.\n\nJohn Dunlop, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, wrote in 2004 that no other book had had “an influence on Russian military, police, and statist foreign policy elites comparable” to “Foundations.”\n\nThe book prodded Dugin towards an academic career – and for a while he was chairman of the international relations in the sociology department at Moscow State University.\n\nDugin has always been one of Putin’s most vocal supporters. In 2007 he said: “Putin no longer has any opponents, and even if they did exist, they are mentally ill and should be sent for medical check-ups. Putin is everywhere, Putin is everything, Putin is absolute, Putin is irreplaceable.”\n\nGradually, inexorably, Dugin’s views have moved from the fringe of political debate in Russia to its center.\n\nIn 2011, when he was prime minister, Vladimir Putin began to talk of a Eurasian Union. Dugin reflected that Putin needed “an ideology, a reason why he needs to come back” for a third term as president.\n\nWhen Russia began supporting separatists in Donbas in 2014, Dugin was prominent in the Eurasian Youth Union, which recruited people with military experience to fight on behalf of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic.\n\nHe also kept up a torrent of propaganda through the website Geopolitica, which the US asserts that he controls. The US Treasury said this year that it is “a website that serves as a platform for Russian ultra-nationalists to spread disinformation and propaganda targeting Western and other audiences.”\n\nGeopolitica, for example, contended this year that the US and NATO sought to provoke war with Russia, in order to “further terrorize the American people in all sorts of malicious ways.”\n\nNot short on enemies\n\nAs one of the ideological architects of Russian expansionism, Dugin has referred to two “versions” of Putin, and wrote a book called “Putin vs. Putin.”\n\nHe described the “lunar” Putin who is pragmatic and cautious, and the “solar” Putin, dedicated to the restoration of a Eurasian empire and confrontation with the West.\n\nIn March, a month into the Ukrainian conflict, in an interview in a Moscow daily, Dugin declared that there was “no doubt that the ‘solar’ Putin has won out, and that this was bound to happen, which I didn’t say just a year ago, but for many years now.”\n\n“Russia has crossed the Rubicon, which I am personally very happy about,” he said.\n\nTo Dugin, that was essential because he says, the West was using Ukraine to try to bring down Russia. “They believe that they have a chance to defeat Russia; not literally, because it is impossible, but to crush and force it to surrender, by excluding it from their global system.”\n\nIt was also essential, in his view, to show “firm opposition to the Junta and Ukrainian Nazism that are annihilating peaceful civilians” as well as rejection of liberalism and US hegemony – language similar to that used by Putin in seeking to justify the invasion.\n\nDugin is certainly not short of enemies within Russia. In a 2019 interview, he said: “Everyone in power in Russia is scum. Except for Putin.”\n\nDugin said earlier this year that his adherence to the notion of “Eurasianism” is as strong now as it was when he wrote “Foundations.”\n\n“Its center is the Russian people. And it is open to those peoples who combine their destiny with the fate of the Russian people.”\n\nTo him, the conflict in Ukraine is part of an existential battle between the lassitude of the West and a society built on tradition, hierarchy and the Orthodox Christian faith.\n\nIn Dugin’s world, Russia’s destiny “will not be complete until we unite all the eastern Slavs and all the Eurasian brothers into one big space. Everything follows from this logic of destiny – and so does Ukraine.”", "authors": ["Tim Lister Josh Pennington", "Tim Lister", "Josh Pennington"], "publish_date": "2022/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/china/china-party-congress-hu-jintao-new-video-intl-hnk", "title": "What happened to former Chinese leader Hu Jintao? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt is a moment that for many observers has come to define strongman leader Xi Jinping’s tightening grip on China: his visibly frail predecessor, Hu Jintao, being escorted out of a key Communist Party meeting during a five-yearly leadership reshuffle – apparently at Xi’s behest.\n\nImages of two men ushering the 79-year-old from his seat and toward the exit were beamed across the world as the party’s National Congress came to a close Saturday, leading to days of speculation over whether Hu was the victim of a deliberately public power play.\n\nThis week, those rumors have only grown – despite a claim by Chinese state media on Twitter that Hu left due to ill-health – and the intrigue is likely to grow further still with the release of footage showing the 90 seconds leading up to his sudden removal.\n\nThe footage, released by Singapore broadcaster CNA on Tuesday, shows a series of high-level exchanges between senior party leaders, in which Hu is repeatedly prevented from looking at official documents in front of him.\n\nIt shows Li Zhanshu, the party’s outgoing number-three official, who is sitting next to Hu at the front table on stage, take the documents from Hu’s hand and place them under a red folder. When Hu then reaches for the documents, Li pulls them away.\n\nXi, who is sat on Hu’s other side, glances at the exchanges and summons a senior aide to whom he speaks briefly. Moments later, a second aide hurries over, receives an instruction from Xi, then speaks to an apparently nonplussed Hu.\n\nAs per the footage that circulated on Saturday, Hu – who appears reluctant to leave – is then lifted from his chair, taken by the arm and escorted out.\n\nChina's former leader Hu Jintao is lifted from his chair by a young aide at the closing of the Communist Party Congress on Saturday. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nNone of the footage – either that released on Saturday or Tuesday – has been broadcast in China. Neither has the incident been reported in Chinese language media, or discussed on Chinese social media, where conversations around senior leaders are highly restricted.\n\nLate on Saturday night, China’s official Xinhua news agency tweeted in English that Hu “insisted on attending” the closing ceremony despite his poor health and was escorted out after feeling unwell. However, within China, where Twitter is blocked, the incident was not mentioned.\n\nOn Weibo, censors even restricted the search results for vague keywords such as “escorted away” or “leaving the meeting,” in an apparent effort to prevent users from making veiled references to the incident, according to Eric Liu, a censorship analyst with China Digital Times.\n\nTuesday’s footage has fueled fervent speculation about what was in the document and why Hu was not allowed to see it – and left observers divided over what sparked his exit.\n\nSome maintain it was likely due to Hu’s poor health or mental state – after retiring in 2013, he has been seen in public looking increasingly frail. Others suggest it could be a deliberate power play by Xi to show his unrivaled authority.\n\nFormer Chinese leader Hu Jintao is taken by the arm and escorted out. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nSymbol of a new era\n\nLike many unexplained episodes in the black box of elite Chinese politics, the true reason behind Hu’s unexpected departure may never be known. But experts say the symbolism – unintended or otherwise – is hard to miss: Having eradicated any vestige of influence from party elders or rival factions, Xi has ushered in a new era of one-man rule surrounded by only staunch loyalists.\n\nMeanwhile, gone with Hu are the many hallmarks that had defined his decade in power during which he presided over a period of double-digit economic growth and comparative openness.\n\nHu also relinquished both his party and military posts when he retired in 2012 after two terms in power – earning him praise from Xi for “his broad mind and noble character.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Xi's broken almost all norms: CNN Beijing Bureau Chief reacts to China's new leadership 03:02 - Source: CNN Xi's broken almost all norms: CNN Beijing Bureau Chief reacts to China's new leadership 03:02\n\nWhile Hu was never as powerful as Xi is now – owing in part to the model of collective leadership and the balancing influence of multiple party factions and elders, including his predecessor Jiang Zemin – he was associated with a faction connected to the Communist Youth League, a once powerful grouping whose influence has diminished considerably during Xi’s rule.\n\nSteve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London, said the latest footage suggests Hu’s dramatic exit was likely not planned.\n\n“For whatever reasons, Xi ordered Hu to be escorted out when he must have thought that Hu might not behave exactly as Xi would have wanted,” he said.\n\nThe new video has been interpreted by some as a sign of Hu’s supposed displeasure with the outcome of the Congress, which saw Xi consolidate his power by stacking the new leadership team with his loyal allies and proteges.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang and Wang Yang, head of China’s top advisory body, both retired from the party’s supreme Politburo Standing Committee, despite being one year below the unofficial retirement age of 68. Both Li and Wang are seen as closer to Hu’s sphere of influence.\n\nIn an even more surprising revelation on Sunday, Vice Premier Hu Chunhua, another protege of the elder Hu (the two are not related), was dropped from the new 24-member Politburo. Once seen as a rising star being groomed for the top leadership, Hu Chunhua’s political future has dimmed under Xi.\n\nBut Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University, said a planned public purge at the closing of the congress was unlikely, given the party’s emphasis on unity.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback China's leader is set for a third term.

Few showed any concern for Hu, and many avoided looking in his direction.\n\n“There’s no empathy,” said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.\n\nTo rise through the party, officials have learned to hide their personal emotions and characteristics, Wu said, “They just try to be like a machine in the party machinery.”\n\nOn his way out, Hu patted the shoulder of his protege, Premier Li, who nodded and turned briefly to watch him walk away. Next to Li, Wang sat upright and stared straight ahead, seemingly frozen in motion.\n\nFormer Chinese leader Hu Jintao pats the shoulder of his protege, Premier Li Keqiang. Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFurther down the edge of the stage, Hu Chunhua did not even cast a glance toward the party elder as he passed by. Instead, he looked straight ahead with a notable frown and arms folded across his chest.\n\nBut even if the real reason for the elder Hu’s departure never becomes clear, the incident has nevertheless sent an unequivocal message about Xi’s absolute hold on power, analysts say.\n\nHu’s undignified exit showed that “Xi had reduced the once powerful (Communist) Youth League faction to insignificance,” said Tsang at the University of London.\n\n“With no successor in sight, and the previous leader humiliated, Xi had projected to the party that…no one in the party should look over his shoulder for another leader, be him the future or the past leader,” Tsang said.\n\n“Now there is only one leader in China.”", "authors": ["Analysis Cnn Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}]}

The Atlas Lions are a side “growing in confidence” under head coach Walid Regragui and 2010 World Cup winners Spain will face a “difficult test” at Education City Stadium.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Midfielder Gavi feels that the 2-1 loss against Japan has to “serve as a lesson” for what is to come in the knockout stages. “Luckily, that defeat has been resolved and we are clear about what we have to do,” the 18-year-old told Spanish newspaper Marca. “We are in the round of 16 and there are some very good teams that haven’t been able to do it. That’s why we have to really think that pressure is a privilege.”\n\nEnrique has warned that Morocco won’t sit back and urged his team to be stronger when under pressure. “If against Morocco we have the fortune to go in front, [they] will risk it all at full pelt again,” said the Spanish head coach. “We have to show more strength in the moments when the opposition is pressing us.”\n\nThe winners of this last-16 tie will face Portugal or Switzerland in the World Cup quarter-finals.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFerran Torres scored twice in Spain’s 7-0 thrashing of Costa Rica (Image credit: Buda Mendes/Getty Images)\n\nMatch facts\n\nWho: Morocco vs. Spain\n\nWhat: Fifa World Cup round of 16\n\nWhen: Tuesday 6 December 2022\n\nWhere: Education City Stadium\n\nKick-off time: 3pm (all times GMT)\n\nHow to watch on TV in the UK\n\nTuesday’s last-16 clash between Morocco and Spain will be shown live in the UK on ITV and ITVX. Coverage begins at 2pm and the match kicks off at 3pm.\n\nTeam news\n\nMorocco right-back Achraf Hakimi played with an ankle knock in the 2-1 win over Canada, but the PSG star is expected to be fit for the clash against Spain. Midfielder Selim Amallah, who played 25 minutes as a sub last time out, is also reportedly fit to feature.\n\nEnrique, who rotated his line-up for the Japan game, is likely to recall Jordi Alba and Aymeric Laporte to the defence. Alvaro Morata and Marco Asensio are also competing to start up front. There are doubts over the fitness of Cesar Azpilicueta, so if the Chelsea defender is not ready to start then Real Madrid’s Dani Carvajal will come in. Dani Olmo and David Raya should be fit despite missing training.\n\nPossible starting XIs\n\nMorocco: Yassine Bounou, Achraf Hakimi, Nayef Aguerd, Romain Saiss, Noussair Mazraoui, Abdelhamid Sabiri, Sofyan Amrabat, Azzedine Ounahi, Hakim Ziyech, Youssef En-Nesyri, Sofiane Boufal\n\nYassine Bounou, Achraf Hakimi, Nayef Aguerd, Romain Saiss, Noussair Mazraoui, Abdelhamid Sabiri, Sofyan Amrabat, Azzedine Ounahi, Hakim Ziyech, Youssef En-Nesyri, Sofiane Boufal Spain: Unai Simon, Jordi Alba, Aymeric Laporte, Rodri, César Azpilicueta, Pedri, Sergio Busquets, Gavi, Ferran Torres, Marco Asensio, Dani Olmo\n\nPredictions\n\nSpain are the “best footballing team in this tournament”, while Morocco are probably “stronger, physically”, said Chris Sutton on BBC Sport. This one is “going to be close”. Prediction: Morocco 0 Spain 1.\n\nMorocco must “harness every inch of their recent defensive resilience” if they are to secure a first-ever appearance in the quarter-finals, said Ben Knapton on SportsMole. A “true force” to be reckoned with in the final third, Spain’s “extensive list of attacking options” on the bench could end up “making the difference” if the teams cannot be separated after 90 minutes. Prediction: Morocco 1 Spain 2 (after extra-time).\n\nIberian giants Spain are “bonafide contenders” to win the World Cup and will need their young guns to “step up on the big stage”, said Aditya Hosangadi on SportsKeeda. Morocco stunned Belgium in the group stage and are “perfectly capable of pulling off an upset on their day”. But Spain are the “better team on paper” and “should be able to win this game”. Prediction: Morocco 1-2 Spain.\n\nIf Enrique’s Spanish side “hit top gear”, their status as favourites will be “well-earned”, said Grey Whitebloom on 90min.com. However, they could “struggle to break down this obviously obdurate opponent”, who will have a “boisterous travelling contingent” roaring them on. Prediction: Morocco 0 Spain 1.\n\nThe Atlas Lions are “riding the crest of a wave at the moment”, said Jonathan Gorrie in the London Evening Standard. “So strong defensively”, and against a Spain team “not packed with goals”, Costa Rica game aside, Morocco “pulling off a shock cannot be ruled out”. Prediction: Morocco 2 Spain 0.\n\nSpain have never lost in their three previous meetings with Morocco and “our prediction model” makes them “strong favourites to advance to the last eight”, giving them a “61.3% chance of victory”, said Harry Carr on Opta Analyst. The Atlas Lions have provided “one of the great underdog stories” of this World Cup, but their chances of a historic victory are rated at “just 14.7%, making them big outsiders”. The draw, which would mean extra-time and potentially penalties, is given a “24% chance”.\n\nThe stadium\n\nEducation City Stadium, located 4.3 miles west of Doha in Al Rayyan, has a capacity of 40,000. Six group-stage matches were held at the stadium, and in the knockouts it will host this round of 16 game and a quarter-final tie.\n\nSquads\n\nMorocco\n\nHead coach: Walid Regragui\n\nWalid Regragui Key player: Achraf Hakimi\n\nAchraf Hakimi One to watch: Sofiane Boufal\n\nSofiane Boufal Goalkeepers: Yassine Bounou (Sevilla), Munir El Kajoui (Al Wehda), Ahmed Reda Tagnaouti (Wydad Casablanca)\n\nYassine Bounou (Sevilla), Munir El Kajoui (Al Wehda), Ahmed Reda Tagnaouti (Wydad Casablanca) Defenders: Nayef Aguerd (West Ham United), Yahia Attiat Allah (Wydad Casablanca), Badr Benoun (Qatar SC), Achraf Dari (Stade Brest), Jawad El Yamiq (Real Valladolid), Achraf Hakimi (Paris Saint-Germain), Noussair Mazraoui (Bayern Munich), Romain Saiss (Besiktas)\n\nNayef Aguerd (West Ham United), Yahia Attiat Allah (Wydad Casablanca), Badr Benoun (Qatar SC), Achraf Dari (Stade Brest), Jawad El Yamiq (Real Valladolid), Achraf Hakimi (Paris Saint-Germain), Noussair Mazraoui (Bayern Munich), Romain Saiss (Besiktas) Midfielders: Sofyan Amrabat (Fiorentina), Selim Amallah (Standard Liege), Bilal El Khannouss (Racing Genk), Yahya Jabrane (Wydad Casablanca), Azzedine Ounahi (Angers), Abdelhamid Sabiri (Sampdoria)\n\nSofyan Amrabat (Fiorentina), Selim Amallah (Standard Liege), Bilal El Khannouss (Racing Genk), Yahya Jabrane (Wydad Casablanca), Azzedine Ounahi (Angers), Abdelhamid Sabiri (Sampdoria) Forwards: Zakaria Aboukhlal (Toulouse), Soufiane Boufal (Angers), Ilias Chair (Queens Park Rangers), Walid Cheddira (Bari), Youssef En-Nesyri (Sevilla), Abde Ezzalzouli (Osasuna), Abderrazak Hamdallah (Al Ittihad), Amine Harit (Olympique Marseille), Hakim Ziyech (Chelsea)\n\nSpain\n\nHead coach: Luis Enrique\n\nLuis Enrique Key player: Pedri\n\nPedri One to watch: Gavi\n\nGavi Goalkeepers: Unai Simon (Athletic Club), Robert Sanchez (Brighton & Hove Albion), David Raya (Brentford FC)\n\nUnai Simon (Athletic Club), Robert Sanchez (Brighton & Hove Albion), David Raya (Brentford FC) Defenders: Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea FC), Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid), Eric Garcia (FC Barcelona), Hugo Guillamon (Valencia CF), Pau Torres (Villarreal CF), Aymeric Laporte (Manchester City), Jordi Alba (FC Barcelona), Jose Gaya (Valencia CF)\n\nCesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea FC), Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid), Eric Garcia (FC Barcelona), Hugo Guillamon (Valencia CF), Pau Torres (Villarreal CF), Aymeric Laporte (Manchester City), Jordi Alba (FC Barcelona), Jose Gaya (Valencia CF) Midfielders: Sergio Busquets (FC Barcelona), Rodri Hernandez (Manchester City), Gavi (FC Barcelona), Carlos Soler (Paris St Germain), Marcos Llorente (Atletico de Madrid), Pedri Gonzalez (FC Barcelona), Koke Resurreccion (Atletico de Madrid)\n\nSergio Busquets (FC Barcelona), Rodri Hernandez (Manchester City), Gavi (FC Barcelona), Carlos Soler (Paris St Germain), Marcos Llorente (Atletico de Madrid), Pedri Gonzalez (FC Barcelona), Koke Resurreccion (Atletico de Madrid) Forwards: Ferran Torres (FC Barcelona), Nico Williams (Athletic Club), Yeremi Pino (Villarreal CF), Alvaro Morata (Atletico de Madrid), Marco Asensio (Real Madrid), Pablo Sarabia (Paris Saint-Germain), Dani Olmo (RB Leipzig), Ansu Fati (FC Barcelona)", "authors": ["Mike Starling", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/961713/beethovens-skull-is-returned-to-vienna", "title": "Beethoven's skull is returned to Vienna | The Week", "text": "Fragments of Ludwig van Beethoven’s skull have returned to Vienna where the rest of the composer is buried.

This loss of ownership combined with nostalgia among older customers and a technological backlash among younger buyers has led to a growing rejection of digital-only media.\n\n“It’s a feeling increasingly shared by consumers and collectors across Canada,” said CBC News. “After years of digitising everything, people are rediscovering the value of physical assets. DVDs, vinyl records and film cameras are all experiencing a renaissance. Even cassette tapes are making a comeback.”\n\nProponents of physical media point to the ever-growing popularity of vinyl albums, with sales increasing for the 17th straight year last year after nearly dying out completely in the early 2000s.\n\nKodak, meanwhile, has said that it “cannot keep up with demand” for photographic film, less than a decade after the company filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMore widely, said Greene, “these trends are transforming the way we relate to our possessions, and thus to ourselves and the world around us”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/961917/england-nigeria-womens-world-cup-lauren-james", "title": "Lionesses dig deep after Lauren James's 'Beckham-esque' red card ...", "text": "BBC commentator Robyn Cowen summed it up as “daylight robbery” as ten-woman England beat Nigeria on penalties to reach the quarter-finals of the Fifa Women’s World Cup.

James, who is England’s top scorer at the World Cup with three goals in the group stage, was “initially given a yellow card for the altercation” in the 87th minute, said Felix Keith on the Daily Mirror, but “VAR intervened” and the card was upgraded to red. She will be given an automatic one-game ban, which “could be extended to three games, meaning that her tournament could be over”.\n\nGoing from “hero to villain”, James’s reckless challenge “brought back memories” of David Beckham being sent off against Argentina at the 1998 men’s World Cup, said Gill Clark on Goal.com.

Premiership clubs were “losing £4m to £5m a year” prior to the pandemic and Covid has “exacerbated that”. The sport has been “relying on wealthy benefactors for some time”.\n\nWhat happened at Worcester?\n\nFounded in 1871, Worcester climbed the rugby pyramid from the eighth tier to the Premiership, said Phil Wilkinson-Jones in the Worcester News.\n\nIn August the club’s accounts were frozen after a winding-up petition was issued by HMRC, then in September WRFC Trading Limited, the company that owns the rugby club, was placed in administration and suspended from all competitions. This month WRFC Players Limited, the company that employs the players and staff, was wound up in court.\n\nWorcester ended up in trouble after being “saddled with more than £25m of debt”, including at least £6m in unpaid tax, said PA Sport. Players and staff “had not received their full wages” and a lack of funds led to “major operational shortcomings”.\n\nWorcester’s director of rugby Steve Diamond said the club’s winding-up order was the “darkest day for English rugby”. On 5 October Diamond tweeted that “we thought we could turn the tanker around”, but it’s ended up “like the Titanic”. The “ship has sunk” and the captains are “nowhere to be seen”.\n\nAnd what about Wasps?\n\nFour-time Premiership winners and two-time European champions Wasps will follow Worcester into England’s second tier – “provided they can find new owners and continue to exist”, said Michael Cantillon on Sky Sports. They are one of England’s “biggest and most famous” clubs, but today announced that 167 staff – including the entire playing and coaching staff – are being made redundant.\n\nWasps have “twice filed notice to get insolvency experts in to help with their debts”, which run to “tens of millions of pounds”, said BBC Sport. The Coventry-based club had been hopeful of “securing new funding to help with a £35m debt owed to bond holders following their relocation from London in 2014”. But despite talks “ongoing” with interested parties, the club “have been forced to take action”.\n\nWhy are clubs struggling?\n\nCovid “undoubtedly exacerbated” the challenges that Premiership rugby clubs were already facing, said Laura Scott on BBC Sport. However, most clubs were “making losses before the pandemic and there were already concerns about the sustainability of what clubs were spending on player wages compared to their incomes”. One club owner told the BBC that the model is “completely flawed”.\n\nWhile the impact of the pandemic “cannot be ignored”, Worcester “cannot hide behind Covid as a catch-all excuse”, said PA Sport. Factors also include “rising wages for top players and coaches”, a “constant contest to lure in punters” and continued battles to “boost match excitement”.\n\nAs league officials “grapple with the crisis engulfing the domestic game”, they “cannot rule out more clubs joining Worcester and Wasps in being suspended from the league on financial grounds”, said Gerard Meagher in The Guardian. Premiership Rugby chief Simon Massie-Taylor warned that he hasn’t been given any “direct red flags” from clubs, but added that until he gets complete financial oversight he can’t give a “direct answer”.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe situation at Worcester and Wasps has “opened up the possibility of long overdue reform at the top of English rugby”, said Brian Moore in The Telegraph. The RFU should “seize this chance” to “extend reform” to the grassroots game and secure rugby’s long-term future.\n\nRFU chief Sweeney believes a streamlined Premiership makes financial sense and would improve overlap between the domestic and international game, Sky Sports reported. A ten-team first division is seen as “viable for a number of reasons”, and “we’ve been saying for quite some time now that less is more”.\n\n“Everything is on the table”, including a number of “nuclear” options to reshape rugby, said Charlie Morgan in The Telegraph. These include central contracts for England players funded by the RFU.\n\nThe financial demise of the clubs has “triggered a review over the sustainability of the sport”, said BBC Sport, and any changes are “expected to happen in time for the 2024-25 season”.", "authors": ["Mike Starling", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/955486/george-best-haunts-ex-wife-home", "title": "George Best 'haunts ex-wife's home' | The Week", "text": "George Best’s ex-wife believes that her former husband’s ghost is haunting her Surrey home. “I’m convinced spirits have come to visit my 200-year-old house, and now I think George could have been one of them,” Alex Best said.

They used two drones to dangle sausages from pieces of string, which lured the dog to safer ground away from the high tide. The team then lit a barbeque and the dog followed the scent before reaching safety.

And the impacts of water shortages “quickly translate into social and political instability”, she said.\n\nLazard points to France, where water shortages have not only caused issues with trade but have also led to “increased political polarisation and civic violence”.\n\nYet despite the gravity of the situation in France, it is “only a teaser for what is to come in future years”, Lazard added.\n\nDuring the UN’s 2023 water conference in March, Secretary-General António Guterres called for massive changes in how the world approaches not just agriculture, but also infrastructure, sanitation and the way water is monitored globally.\n\nAccording to the World Resource Institute, however, of the 719 water commitments that were made at the conference, barely a quarter are likely to be “potential game-changers”. The rest, the institute said, “may not be strong enough to create substantial change in the world”.\n\nFor The Guardian, in an era that is “defined by geopolitical, economic and climate-related upheaval”, the politics that surround water shortages “represent another formidable challenge”.\n\nTo adequately meet that challenge, the newspaper concluded, “a sophisticated and empathetic politics, balancing concerns for food security, rural livelihoods and environmental imperatives, is required”.", "authors": ["Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/06/01"}]}

As Jackson learned more about Colossal – DNA in ancient dire wolf bones helped create a dire wolf genome – he could envision the possible de-extinction of the moa.\n\n“With the recent resurrection of the dire wolf, Colossal has also made real the possibility of bringing back lost species,\" Jackson said in a press release about the new project, announced Tuesday, July 8.\n\nAn advisor on the moa project, Jackson helped involve the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The centre – established in 2011 to support education for the Ngāi Tahu, the main Māori tribe of southern New Zealand – will direct the project, which also includes animal conservation efforts and the biobanking of other native species for preservation.\n\n\"Every decision we make along the way in the research and the de-extinction is being led by them and governed and supported by them,\" said Ben Lamm, CEO and co-founder of Colossal, which is also creating a New Zealand subsidiary of the company. \"It's been massively rewarding, because it also affords us the ability to get so much deeper in the culture in a way that we've never even done when we worked with other indigenous groups around the world.\"\n\nWhat animal is Colossal looking to bring back next?\n\nThe South Island Giant Moa, so named because it was indigenous to New Zealand's south island. While there were nine distinct species of the wingless moa – including birds the size of turkeys – the South Island Giant Moa stood out, approaching 12 feet tall with its neck outstretched.\n\nConsidered the world's tallest bird before it went extinct, \"it's part of a family of large birds that once inhabited our ancestral tribal territories,\" said Kyle Davis, a Ngāi Tahu archaeologist who has helped search for moa fossils as part of the project.\n\nThe Giant Moa was \"gigantic,\" weighing up to 250 kilograms (550 pounds), Paul Scofield, an moa expert and advisor on the project, told USA TODAY. \"It was heavily covered in feathers from the head and even down the legs. It had really very massive feet, far more massive than any bird,\" said Stevens, the senior curator of natural history at Canterbury Museum, which has the world's largest collection of moa bones.\n\nA kick from the moa could be deadly, according to Encyclopedia Britannica, which noted the moa fed on seeds, fruits, leaves, and grasses, and laid one large egg of up to 7 inches in diameter.\n\nExperts say there were about 150,000 of the tall birds when the Polynesian settlers came to south New Zealand. Within about 150 years, they were extinct, said Mike Stevens, the director of the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre, in the press release.\n\n“During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, moa provided meat for sustenance, and bones and feathers for tools and decoration,\" especially in Te Wāhipounamu (the official Māori name for southwest New Zealand), he said.\n\nThe Giant Moa remains a symbol for the people of the south island and its potential resurrection fits within the country's many ongoing conservation efforts including the protection and resurgence of the kākāpō, a flightless parrot.\n\nResearch into de-extinction of the moa will likely shed light on New Zealand's ecological past. \"It's really going to answer so many questions about prehistoric New Zealand,\" Scofield said. \"Every single thing we discover about this amazing animal is really going to help flesh out what New Zealand was before humans arrived.\"\n\nSo far, Colossal has created a genome of the tinamou, thought to be the closest living relative of the moa.\n\nWhile there's a lot of work ahead, Jackson envisions a natural environment for the Giant Moa to roam when it returns, he said in a video posted on YouTube about the project. \"We're now at the point where being extinct isn't really the end of the story.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.\n\nMike Snider is a reporter on USA TODAY’s Trending team.

Since then, the private company, valued at about $10 billion, according to Bloomberg, has expanded its plans to include the de-extinction of the Australian thylacine (Tasmanian tiger) and the dodo.\n\nLast month, Colossal revealed it had genetically engineered the Woolly Mouse, which shared some coat characteristics with a woolly mammoth, including longer, lighter-colored hair with a rough, woolly texture. \"This is a very, very big step for us because it proves that all of the work we've been doing for the last three years on the woolly mammoth is exactly what we predicted,\" Lamm said at the time.\n\nWe've got today's trends: Sign up for USA TODAY's Everyone's Talking newsletter.\n\nWith the reveal of the dire wolf puppies, Colossal shows \"that our end-to-end (de-extinction) toolkit that we talked about with the mouse works, but now it's working with ancient DNA and it's been pretty incredible,\" Lamm told USA TODAY.\n\nWhat is a dire wolf?\n\nMany may have first heard of the dire wolf from HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" and George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series of fantasy novels, on which the TV show is based. (The dire wolf was the sigil, or mascot, of House Stark.) Others may be familiar with the Grateful Dead song, \"Dire Wolf.\"\n\nDire wolves have also appeared in video games including Final Fantasy and World of Warcraft, tabletop game classic Dungeons & Dragons, and card game Magic the Gathering.\n\nBut the dire wolf is an actual real-world predator, which went extinct about 13,000 years ago after roaming North America for thousands of years before that, alongside saber tooth tigers and mastodons.\n\n“Many people view dire wolves as mythical creatures that only exist in a fantasy world, but in reality, they have a rich history of contributing to the American ecosystem,” said the author Martin, who is also an investor and cultural advisor to Colossal, in a statement. “I get the luxury to write about magic, but Ben and Colossal have created magic by bringing these majestic beasts back to our world.”\n\nAbout 25% larger than modern-day gray wolves, dire wolves had thicker, more muscular legs, more powerful shoulders, a wider head and snout with larger jaws and teeth. The dire wolf stood about 3½ feet tall and could be even longer than 6 feet and weigh up to 150 pounds.\n\nResearchers have long been intrigued by the dire wolf because it coexisted with the gray wolf – which did not go extinct – but there hasn't been enough dire wolf DNA found to analyze. Many dire wolf remains have been found in the La Brea tar pits, for example, but the tar pit damages the DNA, said Beth Shapiro, Colossal's chief science officer.\n\nShapiro and the researchers at Colossal contacted museums and laboratories with dire wolf specimens and got access to a tooth thought to be about 13,000 years old, found in Ohio, and a 72,000-year-old skull from Idaho. Inside the skull is the petrous, or inner ear bone, which is a good source of well-preserved DNA, Shapiro said.\n\nFrom those two specimens, Shapiro and the team at Colossal recovered enough DNA to create two dire wolf genomes to compare with other canid species including coyotes, jackals, dholes and, of course, other wolves, Shapiro said. Using the genetic data, researchers could confirm the gray wolf as the closest living relative of the dire wolf – they share 99.5% of their DNA code.\n\nNext, the Colossal researchers edited the gray wolf genome in 20 sites over 14 genes to express specific traits of dire wolves including a light-colored coat, hair length, coat patterning, along with body size and musculature.\n\nFertilized dire wolf eggs were implanted into and born by surrogate dog mothers. Two litters have led to a pair of male dire wolves, Romulus and Remus, now six months old, and a female, Khaleesi (named after the \"Game of Thrones\" character), born in January. These newcomers are not 100% exactly the same dire wolf that roamed the earth ages ago, but look as genetically close as cutting-edge technology could get.\n\n\"Their coat is just absolutely amazing. It's super thick,\" said Lamm, describing the wolves, which live on a 2,000-acre ecological preserve in the northern U.S. \"They are super friendly because we've raised them ... (chief animal officer) Matt (James) bottle fed them when they were just young pups. But they are starting to come into their own, where they're acting more and more like wolves.\"\n\nWhy bring back the dire wolf from extinction?\n\nWolves became a focus at Colossal after Lamm and James had a meeting with The MHA (Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara) Nation in central North Dakota. While talking with the tribal leaders about research on buffalo and bison conservation, \"they told us there's not enough going into wolf conservation,\" Lamm said, and began discussing the dire wolf and wolves' importance to generations of Native Americans.\n\nSoon after that, they met with officials in North Carolina about the state's Red Wolf Recovery Program, which seeks to increase the population of the one-time extinct animal through breeding in captivity and releasing wolves. At about the same time, investors including Peter Jackson and Tom Brady came on board who were \"super excited about this business,\" Lamm said.\n\nWith the dire wolf, Colossal thought \"we could do something that could bring awareness from pop culture to science … and we could build technologies to help wolves, which we did in this process, and do something that the indigenous people were really excited about,\" Lamm said. \"We kind of joke that we didn't pursue the dire wolf, in a weird way it pursued us.\"\n\nThe dire wolf is a symbol that \"carries the echoes of our ancestors, their wisdom, and their connection to the wild,” said MHA Nation Tribal Chairman Mark Fox in a statement. “Its presence would remind us of our responsibility as stewards of the Earth – to protect not just the wolf, but the delicate balance of life itself.\"\n\nDuring the project to de-extinct the dire wolf, the Colossal researchers developed a cloning shortcut using blood instead of tissue samples from wild coyote-Red Wolf mix wolves, which carry Red Wolf DNA, to birth two litters of Red Wolf puppies. \"So we're able to inject these new genetics into the recovery population in a way that can bolster their adaptive ability,\" James said.\n\nColossal plans to breed more dire wolves and study them and how they act in packs. As of now, there's no plan for the wolves to breed.\n\nThey hope North Carolina is interested in using the company's technology to bring more Red Wolves into nature, too. Wolves are \"critical to ecosystems, they're helpful to the planet and they're also an American icon,\" Lamm said.\n\nNews about the dire wolves hit on Monday with stories by outlets such as The New York Times, Time, and People. Colossal will soon publish a paper about the ancient DNA used to create the three dire wolves. And the company has kept experts in the field informed about their advances.\n\n\"I think for me the most exciting thing about this project is that shows how we can use cutting edge technologies in molecular biology to help protect and preserve populations of animals that are at risk of extinction today,\" said Elinor Karlsson, the director of vertebrate genomics at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and a geneticist who's a member of Colossal's advisory board.\n\n\"Colossal produced healthy puppies with genetic variants that haven't existed for over 10,000 years,\" she told USA TODAY. \"To do this, they innovated new methods for sampling, biobanking and cloning. Their work could will help us preserve genetic diversity that is on the brink of disappearing from earth today, which includes a number of Canidae species,\" which includes domestic dogs, foxes, wolves and other mammals.\"\n\n\"I also appreciate how careful Colossal was in the way they approached this work,\" she said. \"They prioritized the health and well-being of both the dog mothers and the wolf puppies.\"\n\nColossal constantly weighs the ethics of its technology in case readers are worried about something as happened in the movie \"Jurassic Park\" coming to fruition. \"We have spent a lot of time thinking about whether we should (bring back a species),\" Shapiro said. \"We weren't just focused on whether we could. We've now proven we can.\"\n\nThe ability to revive and sustain species is important, she said. \"We have to keep in mind and understand that there is an incredible risk in the decision not to use these technologies,\" Shapiro said. \"We know what the consequences of that decision are and it's an increased rate of extinction throughout the world.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.\n\nMike Snider is a reporter on USA TODAY’s Trending team.

Martin made fictional dire wolves integral to his books in the \"A Song of Fire and Ice\" saga, which spawned the HBO series \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nLittle did he know he would eventually get to hold a real dire wolf – well, as close as one likely ever produced – and he would have \"Lord of the Rings\" director Peter Jackson to thank.\n\nJackson is among the investors in Colossal Biosciences, a private company which has seen its value increase to more than $10 billion since 2021 when it was founded by George Church, a biologist at Harvard Medical School, and tech entrepreneur Ben Lamm with the goal of bringing back the woolly mammoth.\n\nWhat Jackson had learned – and Martin didn't know yet – was that Colossal's gene editing advances had made it possible to produce offspring born from surrogate mothers. They had a breakthrough allowing them to create dire wolves, which were actual Ice Age predators until they died out as many as 13,000 years ago.\n\nNeed a break?

Martin ...\n\nMartin detailed how he got to meet the dire wolves in a post on his official website.\n\nIt started with Jackson calling him \"with a mysterious suggestion that I phone this guy named Ben Lamm, who had something huge he wanted to share with me. Peter had taken an oath of silence, so he could not share the secret with me, but I could hear the excitement in his voice, so I made the call. And damn, I am sure glad I did.\"\n\nSubsequently, Martin visited Colossal in February 2025, more than four months after the biotech company's researchers oversaw the birth of two male dire wolf pups and one month after a female pup was born.\n\n\"I’ve been holding my tongue for months now, sworn to silence yet dying to tell the world,\" he said on the site, which had a picture of him holding one of the wolves.\n\nHow did George R.R. Martin come up with dire wolves?\n\nA visit to the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, where the remains of hundreds of dire wolves have been found, sparked inspiration for the author. \"When I saw their direwolf exhibit, four hundred skull arrayed on a wall, something stirred inside me,\" Martin said.\n\n\"Most of my readers will have heard the story of how I (was) writing a science fiction novel in the summer of 1991 when a scene came to me, the first chapter of GAME OF THRONES where they find the direwolf pups in the summer snows. Where did THAT come from? Why did it seize me so powerfully? I have no idea,\" he continued. \"But it grabbed hold of me so hard that I put the other novel aside and began to write A SONG OF ICE & FIRE. The direwolves were a huge part of it. Without them, Westeros might not exist.\"\n\nMartin went on to muse that \"maybe I was remembering a past life, when I ran with a pack in the Ice Age. … Whatever the reason, I have to say the rebirth of the direwolf has stirred me as no scientific news has since Neil Armstrong walked on the moon.\"\n\nMartin had prepared his followers for an upcoming special bit of news, ahead of Colossal's dire wolf reveal, saying it was not going to be an update on \"The Winds of Winter,\" the long-awaited next novel in the Game of Thrones series.\n\nThe news, he said, \"had nothing to do with that. But it was going to be something very cool, something astonishing.\"Remembering Martin's visit, Lamm said, \"George R.R. Martin called us wizards, which is pretty cool.\"\n\nNot all fans were as excited. \"We got Dire Wolves back after 10,000 years before we got the Epstein Files or Winds of Winter,' one person posted on X.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct an inaccuracy.\n\nMike Snider is a reporter on USA TODAY’s Trending team.

And although “attitudes have progressed”, cases of “ginger-bullying and exclusion” are still common.\n\nRights campaigner Meleady spoke out after a teaching assistant at a Sheffield primary school lost an unfair dismissal claim last week. An employment tribunal heard that he was sacked after being accused of bullying and “humiliating” pupils, the Sheffield Star reported.\n\nThe reported incidents included doing an internet search for “gingerphobia” during a lesson, which “led to a child in the class with red hair being teased by his classmates and getting upset”.\n\nAlthough gingerism may be presented as just “banter”, rights campaigner Meleady, “who is ginger herself”, argued that such so-called jokes can “strip red-haired children “of their positive self-identity and confidence”, said The Telegraph.\n\n“And worse, it can lead to school refusal, health problems, self-injurious behaviour and even children wanting and trying to die by suicide,” added Meleady, who was awarded an MBE in 2000 for her services to children.\n\nShe told the Sheffield Star that she had recently witnessed a case of “a family physically abusing their baby for having red hair as they equated her red hair as being the ‘mark of the devil’”.\n\nAnother family, who were seeking to adopt, had said that “they would accept any child of any race, social background, nationality, sexual orientation, diverse genders, disabled, but that they ’could not abide a red-haired child’”, she continued.\n\nMeleady called for action to protect young redheads, “not just from gingerism or anti-red haired prejudice and abuse from other children, but from school and other settings members who model the bullying and abuses to red-haired children”.\n\nBetween 1% and 2% of the global population have red hair, but the figure is much higher in England, at 6%, and higher still in Scotland, at 13%.\n\nIn 2013, genetic researchers believed they had “developed a powerful tool to combat the bullying of some redheads in Britain”, Reuters reported. The Scottish team discovered that as many as one in three Britons carry red-head genes, meaning that even if they are not redheads themselves, “their future children or grandchildren could be”.\n\nAlastair Moffat of ScotlandsDNA, which carried out the analysis, told the news agency that showing how many Brits have the ginger gene could help end the prejudice that “blights the lives” of many redheads.\n\nThe research was published months after of a teenager took her own life after teased about her red hair. Following her death, the father of 15-year-old Helena Farrell, from Cumbria, “demanded discrimination against ginger people to be made a hate crime”, said The Telegraph.\n\nPrince Harry has also spoken about being “bullied for being ginger”, according to the Daily Mail.

But Mohammed’s comments contributed to “widespread concerns” about “a lack of transparency” in the discussions, said HuffPost.\n\n‘Baby steps towards recognition’\n\nThe Taliban’s rule over Afghanistan “is not recognised as legitimate by any country”, said The Independent.

But recognition is the right path, the duo argued.\n\nTo endorse engagement with the Taliban is “not easy for us”, they added, “but the alternative – allowing Afghanistan’s dangerous descent into a hermit kingdom and forsaking the insight and means to influence or shape events – would mean more dire consequences for all”.\n\nMany human rights activists disagree. In an open letter to the UN ahead of the Doha meeting, more than 50 NGOs, civil society organisations and academic institutions warned that “past experiences show that giving into the demands of such regimes by compromising on human rights will only strengthen their grip on power, and prolong the suffering of the people of Afghanistan”.\n\nThey also insisted that Afghanistan’s women should be “meaningfully represented” in all talks regarding their country’s future.\n\n‘A violation of women’s rights’\n\nRecognition could be granted in different ways. The US and its allies could recognise the Taliban without conditions, but this outcome seems “unlikely”, said the Brookings Institute, “given the Taliban’s unwillingness to meet democratic and human rights standards”.\n\nAlternatively, the Washington D.C.-based think tank continued, various models exist in which “there could be extended negotiations with the Taliban over recognition”, forcing the group to meet certain conditions. This might be “the likeliest outcome in the near and medium term” as the US and its allies “try to use recognition as a carrot to urge the Taliban to undertake certain fundamental reforms”.\n\nCritics fear the UN may seek to follow the second path. Ahead of the Doha meeting, a group of Afghan women staged a spontaneous march in capital Kabul, “in defiance of Taliban security forces”, to urge the international community not to recognise the militant group, said Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty.\n\nA woman who was a lawyer before the Taliban takeover told Ms. magazine that since then, “job and profession don’t exist because the judicial system does not exist anymore under the Taliban”. She added: “I have lost my job at a time that is needed the most because women are being discriminated against the most.”\n\nThe unnamed woman added that forced marriages and street courts had become common again.\n\nAnother said: “We want the world to know what’s happening in Afghanistan and to Afghan women. We do not want the Taliban to be recognised.”", "authors": ["Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/26"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/955166/countries-that-support-the-taliban", "title": "The countries that support the Taliban | The Week", "text": "When the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August, the group called on the international community to recognise its government’s legitimacy.\n\nNo country has yet done so and though Russia, Pakistan and China had “all signalled a readiness to transition smoothly into engaging with Taliban authorities” in August, said The Guardian, this has not yet transpired.\n\nA month before the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, met Taliban representatives in Tianjin. At the time, the extremist group was seeking international recognition, and the meeting was “widely seen as a gift from Beijing towards that legitimacy”, said Al Jazeera.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

We will not be the first.”\n\nDuring the Taliban’s reign in the 1990s, only three nations recognised its government: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. And though no country has formally recognised the group’s leadership in Afghanistan since they again took power this year, some have expressed their vocal support for its rule.\n\nIn mid-August, as US and UK troops began evacuating civilians from Kabul, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said that the “Taliban has freed their country from superpowers”, and “broken the chains of mental slavery in Afghanistan”.\n\nPakistan, which neighbours Afghanistan and is a key trading partner, has “long been accused by many in the United States and elsewhere of providing support for the Taliban”, said the BBC. The Pakistani government has continually denied this.\n\nIran and Russia have also been accused by some Afghan and US officials of providing the Taliban with financial aid, a practice “they frequently deny”, said the BBC.\n\nAnd while Iran was “careful” in welcoming the Taliban’s ascent to power in August, “Russian authorities were initially much more positive”, said conflict and security expert Professor Dr Antonio Giustozzi.\n\nWriting for the defence and security think-tank the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), he said: “Both the Russians and Iranians helped the Taliban advance at a breakneck pace in May-August 2021.”\n\nThe two countries supplied funding and equipment, “but perhaps even more importantly they helped them by brokering deals with parties, groups and personalities close to either country, or even both”.\n\nThese “allies and clients” of Iran and Russia were “promised that they would be incorporated into a future coalition government”, he added, which was what both countries and “most actors on the Afghan scene believed” would be the outcome of the Taliban’s advances on Kabul.\n\nHowever, Iran “began to seriously worry” when the Haqqani network, a sub-group of the Taliban with a “record of hostility towards Shi’a Muslims”, began taking control of Afghanistan’s capital city, Giustozzi continued. Like the coalition government many envisaged, the Taliban’s promises of government roles have not materialised.\n\nDuring the Taliban’s reign in the 1990s, “Iran was among the group’s key adversaries”, and Tehran “actively supported” the group’s “ousting by the US in 2001”, said London School of Economics’ Global Risk Insights (GRI).\n\nBut more recently, “Iran has been cosying up to the group, with a significantly different orientation”. Iran remains a key trading partner of Afghanistan, and has continued its fuel exports since the Taliban took power.\n\nThe country’s leadership welcomed the departure of US forces “in its own geopolitical backyard” and its ideological conflict with the group has been “partially lifted thanks to an apparent shift of the Taliban’s treatment towards Hazara people”, the GRI continued.\n\nThe Taliban “will welcome Tehran’s change of heart”, in part because it needs new backers “as a remedy for its over reliance on Pakistan”, though “Iran will have to maintain a careful rhetoric towards the new Afghan leadership” given public feeling towards the Taliban remains negative among Iranians.\n\nRussia wasn’t “racing to recognise the Taliban as Afghanistan’s new rulers” in August, said the BBC, but that stance is softening and in October, Moscow held “the most high-profile international talks on Afghanistan since the Taliban took power”, said The Guardian. Members of the interim government in Kabul were in attendance, as well as representatives from China, Iran, Pakistan and central Asian republics.\n\nVladimir Putin’s representative on Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, told reporters that “a big political bargaining is going on”.\n\n“Not everyone likes the new government in Afghanistan, but by punishing the government, we punish the whole people,” he said. Though Russia has long recognised the Taliban as a terrorist group, its embassy is still open in Kabul and “is in regular contact with Afghanistan’s new rulers”.\n\nThe Taliban also receives some financial support from individuals in several countries.\n\n“Private citizens from Pakistan and several Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are considered to be the largest individual contributors”, said the BBC.\n\n“Although impossible to measure exactly”, it’s thought that these funding streams could provide as much as $500m (£376m) a year.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/08/27/what-know-u-s-withdrawal-afghanistan/5622597001/", "title": "What to know about US withdrawal from Afghanistan", "text": "U.S. troops are withdrawing from Afghanistan after 20 years in the country. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated as the fundamentalist Taliban take over, and dozens of people, including 13 U.S. service members, were killed in an attack Thursday at the Kabul airport by militant group ISIS-K.\n\nU.S. troops are now only four days away from President Joe Biden's Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline//. Here's what we know:\n\nWho are the Taliban?\n\nThe word \"Taliban\" means \"students\" in Pashto, one of two official languages spoken in Afghanistan. The group was officially founded in Afghanistan in 1994.\n\nMany of its leaders were former members of the \"Afghanmujahideen,\" armed rebel groups that fought in the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s against the Soviet Union and Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban declared the country an Islamic Emirate in 1996. They adopted a punitive interpretation of the Quran, the Muslim holy book, that justified torture, mass executions and the subjugation of women. The Taliban also provided a safe haven for al-Qaida, the group that orchestrated the 9/11 attacks.\n\nU.S. forces toppled the Taliban regime in 2001, but the group is stronger now than at any point in the last 20 years, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nWho pulled troops out of Afghanistan?\n\nPresident Biden set an initial deadline of September 11 — the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks — to fully withdraw U.S. troops out of Afghanistan. But the withdrawal was negotiated by former President Donald Trump with Taliban leaders in 2020.\n\nTrump committed to withdrawing the remaining 13,000 troops from Afghanistan by May 1, 2021. In exchange, the Taliban agreed to sever ties with Al-Qaida and stop attacks on U.S. forces.\n\nBiden initiated the U.S. troop withdrawal on May 1. In July, troops had evacuated Bagram Airfield, the largest military installation in Afghanistan since 2001. The withdrawal deadline was moved up to Aug. 31 days later.\n\nHow many U.S. soldiers have died in Afghanistan?\n\nOver 2,400 U.S. service members have died in Afghanistan through April 2021. The 13 troops who died Thursday in the terrorist attack on Kabul's airport marked the first casualties in the country since Feb. 2020.\n\nHow many Americans are still in Afghanistan?\n\nAbout 1,000 Americans are still waiting to be evacuated from Afghanistan. Several hundred American citizens in Afghanistan still haven’t decided whether they want to leave.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press, Donovan Slack and Dennis Wagner\n\nReach out to Chelsey Cox on Twitter at @therealco.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/02/opinions/us-pakistan-relationship-bhutto-dynasty-bergen", "title": "Opinion: The complex US-Pakistan relationship | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, a vice president at New America, and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. Bergen is the author of “The Rise and Fall of Osama bin Laden.” He has made more than a dozen reporting trips to Pakistan since 1983. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn a world that at times seems obsessed with the Windsor dynasty that occupies the British throne, a political dynasty with a history deeply entwined with one of the world’s most politically sensitive countries gets far less attention.\n\nPeter Bergen CNN\n\nPakistan, a country with nuclear weapons that neighbors Afghanistan, China, Iran and India, has been long dominated by its powerful military, which in recent years has put increasing pressure on independent media and dissenting voices.\n\nPakistan’s Bhutto family dynasty, in recent decades, championed a more liberal democratic approach to politics and has provided two of the country’s most important leaders – and today, its youngest foreign minister ever.\n\nI met last week with Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who was visiting Washington. He told me that the assassination of his mother, two-time Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was a turning point for him at 19 that pushed him into public service: “I didn’t choose this life. It chose me. The circumstances of her assassination and the events that followed led me down this path where I am today.”\n\nBhutto Zardari is also the chairman of the left-of-center Pakistan People’s Party, which was founded by his grandfather and is one of the largest political parties in the country.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Pakistan became a key American ally after the Soviet Union invaded Pakistan’s neighbor Afghanistan in 1979. That invasion precipitated a tight alliance between the United States and the military regime of Pakistan’s President, Gen. Zia-ul-Haq. The CIA acted as the quartermaster to the Afghan rebels, funneling billions of dollars of weapons to the Pakistani military intelligence service, which in turn supported several of the Afghan groups fighting the Soviets.\n\nIn 1989, after being defeated in Afghanistan, the Soviets pulled out – a move that hastened the collapse of the Soviet regime. When the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan, the United States closed its embassy in Kabul and washed its hands of the country.\n\nThat move would turn out to be a large blunder because Afghanistan then descended into a civil war, out of which emerged a shadowy group, the Taliban, which by 1996 had taken over almost the entire country. The Taliban also gave refuge to Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda group, which planned the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn the years before 9/11, Pakistan was one of only three countries that recognized the Taliban government in Afghanistan, seeing in them a force on its western border that would not ally with its main enemy, India.\n\nAfter September 11, under intense US pressure, the Pakistanis switched allegiance and, at least initially, supported the US-led war against the Taliban and al Qaeda.\n\nDeeply enmeshed in all this complex history is the Bhutto family, which, even more than the Kennedys in the United States, is a political dynasty that has shaped the history of their country while also enduring considerable personal tragedy.\n\nZulfikar Ali Bhutto, Bhutto Zardari’s grandfather, was the first democratically elected Prime Minister in Pakistan, but he was later deposed and then hanged by the regime of the Pakistani military dictator Zia in 1979.\n\nA little under a decade later, Bhutto’s daughter Benazir Bhutto, then only 35, became the first female Prime Minister in Pakistan’s history and, indeed, the first female Prime Minister of any Muslim-majority country.\n\nShe was a graduate of Harvard and Oxford and orientated to the West, but nonetheless, during her prime ministership, Pakistan’s powerful military began supporting the Taliban as they rose to power in Afghanistan.\n\nIn February 1993, a militant from Pakistan, Ramzi Yousef, masterminded the bombing of the World Trade Center, killing six people. Yousef then went back to Pakistan and began plotting to kill Benazir Bhutto, who was then serving as Prime Minister for the second time. The plan failed when the bomb Yousef was building malfunctioned.\n\nIn 2000, I met with Benazir Bhutto, who explained to me that “the international Islamist movement saw Pakistan as its base. They saw my party as a liberal threat.” She became a fervent public critic of the Taliban and al Qaeda, and the fact that she was the first woman to lead Pakistan made her an even bigger target for Islamist militants.\n\nBenazir Bhutto was assassinated in Pakistan in 2007 when she was campaigning to become Prime Minister for the third time. The Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for her murder.\n\nAll this tangled history was going through my mind when I met with her son at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington. Bhutto Zardari was visiting the US capital as his country faces what is arguably the worst crisis since its founding in 1947; by late August, floods of biblical proportions had submerged a third of the country.\n\nBhutto Zardari told me, “One in seven people, 33 million, are affected. The World Health Organization has warned of a second catastrophe in the form of a health crisis with waterborne diseases. There will also be food insecurity because of the millions of acres of crops destroyed.”\n\nThe flooding over the summer has caused an estimated $30 billion in damage.\n\nIn addition to the immediate crisis, Bhutto Zardari said now was the time to implement a longer-term solution – “a Green Marshall Plan” for climate-stressed developing countries such as Pakistan that have only a small impact on global warming but are disproportionately suffering its costs.\n\nBhutto Zardari pointed out that while Pakistan contributes less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming gases, it is one of the countries most affected by climate change. A “Green Marshall Plan” would allow countries such as Pakistan to build infrastructure more resilient to its effects.\n\nAsked about the Taliban, which now control Afghanistan, Bhutto Zardari surprised me when he advocated for greater engagement with them, even though the Afghan Taliban shelters elements of the Pakistani Taliban, the terrorist group that claimed responsibility for his mother’s murder. “They are our neighbors,” he said. “Our neighbors aren’t going away, and we need a peaceful, stable Afghanistan, so we don’t see an exodus of Afghan refugees into Pakistan, and we don’t see an exponential increase in terrorism.”\n\nBhutto Zardari explained that the dire economic situation in Afghanistan made dealing with the Taliban more important since predictions indicate that more than 90% of the Afghan population may soon fall below the poverty line. “History has shown us that theocratic, autocratic regimes, when faced with tough economic times, tend to contract rights rather than expand rights,” said Bhutto Zardari, who studied history at Oxford.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAt the end of our interview, we returned to the subject of his mother, Benazir, whom I had met many times over the years, including the first time that she was Prime Minister during the late 1980s and had only recently given birth to him.\n\nBenazir Bhutto was assassinated almost two decades later at age 54 when she was a politician at the height of her powers. She was very much an ally of the United States, an enemy of Islamist terrorists such as al Qaeda and the Taliban, and also an advocate for liberal democracy in Pakistan.\n\nI asked her son, “Would Pakistan have had a very different trajectory if she had become Prime Minister for the third time”? The foreign minister replied, “Yes. I think that’s pretty safe to say.”", "authors": ["Peter Bergen"], "publish_date": "2022/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/25/president-joe-biden-holds-first-press-conference/6984142002/", "title": "Live updates: President Joe Biden holds first press conference", "text": "WASHINGTON — Joe Biden held his first solo press conference as president Thursday afternoon – his 64th full day in the White House – as new challenges on gun control and an influx of migrants at the southern U.S. border add to an already busy agenda.\n\nBiden took longer than his predecessors, Donald Trump and Barack Obama, to formally address the White House press corps, fueling extra intrigue and turning the outing into a highly anticipated event.\n\nThe president made news on several issues, including insights into his legislative priorities, foreign policy and the administration’s handling of unaccompanied migrant children at the border. Biden spoke for a little over an hour and fielded a range of issues.\n\nDespite beginning the presser with an update that the administration was increasing its vaccination goal to 200 million doses administered by Biden’s 100th day in office, however, the president did not receive any questions about the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe president was also only asked one question specifically on gun control. While he outlined some potential for executive action or legislation he Congress, Biden quickly pivoted to discus the administration’s upcoming immigration package, underscoring the White House’s legislative priorities.\n\nOn competition with China, Biden emphasized that the current relationship was emblematic of a larger competition between democracy and autocracy, a dynamic Biden cautioned would define the 21st century. The president also said he will soon “invite an alliance of democracies” to a summit to “discuss the future.”\n\nThe president was also pressed about the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan by May, something Biden said would be “difficult.” Biden said he and his aides have been meeting with allies about ways to make the previously negotiated contract feasible, but “could not see” troops still being in the country by 2022.\n\n“I’ve not been able to unite Congress, but I have been able to unite the country,” Biden said of collaboration with Republicans. Though Biden confirmed he agrees with former President Barack Obama’s assessment that the Senate filibuster is a “Jim Crow relic,” he stopped short of calling for its abolition.\n\n\"Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let's figure out how to get this done and significantly change the abuse of the filibuster rule,” the president said. Biden also cautioned Republicans in Congress against pursuing the “politics of division,” saying he was willing to work with any lawmakers on further legislation despite widespread criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill about the White House’s early moves.\n\n— Matthew Brown\n\nBiden: China President Xi 'doesn't have a democratic bone in his body'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said China President Xi Jinping “doesn’t have a democratic bone in his body” as he talked about “holding China accountable to follow the rules.”\n\n“He’s one of the people, like Putin, who thinks autocracy is the wave of the future,” Biden said.\n\nBiden recounted having a two-hour phone conversation with Xi when the Chinese leader called him after he won the election over Donald Trump. Biden said he made clear to Xi that he foresees “stiff competition with China” but insisted they play by international rules.\n\nHe also warned Xi about the repercussion of committing human rights violations, telling him, “As long as you violate human rights, we’re going to call it to the attention to the world.”\n\nBiden affirmed that the U.S. will remain the world’s economic leader despite the efforts of the Chinese to replace it.\n\n“That’s not going to happen on my watch because the United States is going to continue to grow and expand.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden attacks GOP's 'new concern' about federal budget\n\nPresident Joe Biden went after Republicans for being concerned about federal spending when Congress was passing the $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package but not bothered by the budget deficit when they were passing tax cuts.\n\nWhen the spending is saving people’s lives, Republicans don’t think it’s a good idea, Biden said, as he raised his voice. But the GOP has no problem with a lopsided budget when it’s “feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans,” he continued.\n\nBiden said he is trying to “change the paradigm” to reward work, and “not just wealth.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden on GOP voting bills: 'This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle'\n\nPresident Joe Biden slammed efforts in Republican-led states to pass bills making it more difficult for people to vote, calling it “all by design” to suppress voters of color.\n\n“This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle,” he said of the hundreds of bills in GOP-led state legislatures aimed at voter access. “This is gigantic what they’re trying to do. And it cannot be sustained.”\n\nBiden said even his Republican friends have called out what’s happening.\n\n“Republican voters I know find this despicable, folks outside this White House. I’m not talking about the elected officials. I’m talking about voters.”\n\nHe pointed to passage of the voting rights bill H.R. 1 – which passed the Democratic-controlled House but awaits Senate approval – as his top priority to stop the sweeping changes at the state level.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden says he will run for reelection\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been in office just a little over two months, but he said he’s already planning to run for a second term in 2024.\n\n“Yes, my plan is to run for reelection,” he said. “That's my expectation.”\n\nBiden said he also “would fully expect” that Vice President Kamala Harris would remain on the ticket as his running mate for a second term.\n\n“She’s a great partner,” he said.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nBiden: 'Difficult' to meet May 1 troop withdrawal deadline in Afghanistan\n\nPresident Joe Biden conceded that the administration is facing challenges in meeting the May 1 deadline for troop withdrawal in the country.\n\n\"It's going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline,\" the president said of removing American troops from Afghanistan, citing \"tactical reasons.\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have both met with regional leaders and allies in recent days to discuss the peace deal.\n\n\"We will leave. The question is when we leave,\" Biden emphasized.\n\nWhen asked if the U.S. could still have troops in Afghanistan in 2022, Biden said he “can't picture that being the case.\"\n\nBiden also said the deal brokered by the Trump administration that mandated the May 1 troop withdrawal was “poorly designed.” Former President Donald Trump negotiated a deal between the Taliban and Afghani civilian government in 2019.\n\nPeace talks between the Afghani government and the Taliban have deteriorated over the past year, with Taliban forces regaining control of some segments of the country.\n\n— Matthew Brown\n\nBiden will respond if North Korea escalates actions\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he’s consulting with allies on how to respond to North Korea’s recent testing of ballistic missiles, which he said violated a U.N. resolution.\n\n“There will be responses if they choose to escalate,” Biden said.\n\nHe said he would pursue addressing the situation through “some form of diplomacy,” rather than just a military reaction. But that would be conditioned on North Korea being willing to give up their nuclear weapons, Biden added.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden defends response to increase of migrants at border\n\nPresident Joe Biden defended his immigration policy in response to a question about whether he may be sending a message to immigrants that they can cross the border.\n\nBiden said he would never tell an unaccompanied child who ends up at the border that “we’re just gonna let him starve to death and stand on the other side.”\n\n“No previous administrations did that either, except Trump,” he said. “I'm not going to do it.”\n\nBiden said that is why he has asked Vice President Kamala Harris to lead White House efforts to stem migration at the border.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nBiden pushes return to Senate’s old filibuster rules\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he supports a return to the talking filibuster in the U.S. Senate – not getting rid of the filibuster outright – to pass voting rights legislation and other bills that Republicans are resisting.\n\n“It’s being abused in a gigantic way,” Biden said of the current filibuster rules, which require 60 votes in the evenly split Senate to pass most bills.\n\nHe pointed to previous Senate rules that existed when he became a senator in Delaware in the 1970s that required a senator to stand and continue speaking to keep a filibuster alive.\n\n“Guess what?” Biden said. “People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. I strongly support going in that direction.”\n\n“We’re going to get a lot done,” Biden predicted.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden: Increase in migrants is cyclical\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he should be flattered that people think there’s an increase in immigrants coming to the border because “they know Biden is a good guy.”\n\nBut that’s not what’s happening, he said.\n\nInstead, Biden said the recent surge is cycle. There was a similar surge between January and March last year because that’s when it’s safer to travel through the desert heat, he said.\n\n“I’d like to think it’s because I’m a nice guy, but it’s not,” Biden said. “It happens every year.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden cautions Republicans against ‘politics of division’ in first press conference\n\nPresident Joe Biden addressed questions of his policy priorities during his presidential press briefing, noting that the administration would soon pivot from the its focus on the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and economic fallout to other aspects of his agenda.\n\n“The most urgent problem I stated for the American people was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation,” many have experienced during the pandemic, Biden said. The president, however, noted that with its desired stimulus package enacted and being deployed, the administration will now turn to “long term problems” like immigration reform, gun control and infrastructure.\n\n“My Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether we can work together or whether they will decide to … divide the country and only pursue the politics of division,” Biden cautioned about passing legislation in Congress.\n\nThe president said that the administration would “move on these one at a time and we’re going to get to as many of these as we can,” but did not specify any policy prioritization.\n\n— Matthew Brown\n\nBiden sets new COVID vaccine goal: 200 million shots in 100 days\n\nBiden opened his first formal news conference by setting a new goal of administering 200 million COVID vaccine shots in his first 100 days in office.\n\n“I know it’s ambitious, twice our original goal,” he said. “But no other country in the world has even come close. Not even close to what we're doing. I believe we can do it.”\n\nBiden’s original goal was to administer 100 million shots in his first 100 days. The U.S. passed that goal last week and is already on track to reach 200 million shots by the president’s first 100 days.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nBiden holds first press conference as president\n\nOver his long political career, Biden has made his fair share of gaffes. But he's stayed largely on script during his young presidency with a focus on leading the nation out of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThat discipline will be tested Thursday as reporters, for the first time besides brief interactions with the president, have an open arena to question Biden.\n\nIn the wake of two deadly mass shootings in the last week, in Georgia and Colorado, Biden has said \"we have to act\" to pass gun background checks and ban assault weapons. That agenda is already facing resistance from Republicans.\n\nBiden is also facing increasing heat over the increase of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Republicans have called the situation a \"crisis\" of Biden's doing while the White House has resisted that term.\n\nBoth issues are likely to come up Thursday.\n\n— Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/politics/us-weapons-ukraine-intelligence", "title": "What happens to weapons sent to Ukraine? The US doesn't really ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe US has few ways to track the substantial supply of anti-tank, anti-aircraft and other weaponry it has sent across the border into Ukraine, sources tell CNN, a blind spot that’s due in large part to the lack of US boots on the ground in the country – and the easy portability of many of the smaller systems now pouring across the border.\n\nIt’s a conscious risk the Biden administration is willing to take.\n\nIn the short term, the US sees the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of equipment to be vital to the Ukrainians’ ability to hold off Moscow’s invasion. A senior defense official said Tuesday that it is “certainly the largest recent supply to a partner country in a conflict.” But the risk, both current US officials and defense analysts say, is that in the long term, some of those weapons may wind up in the hands of other militaries and militias that the US did not intend to arm.\n\n“We have fidelity for a short time, but when it enters the fog of war, we have almost zero,” said one source briefed on US intelligence. “It drops into a big black hole, and you have almost no sense of it at all after a short period of time.”\n\nIn making the decision to send billions of dollars of weapons and equipment into Ukraine, the Biden administration factored in the risk that some of the shipments may ultimately end up in unexpected places, a defense official said.\n\nBut right now, the official said, the administration views a failure to adequately arm Ukraine as a greater risk.\n\nBecause the US military is not on the ground, the US and NATO are heavily reliant on information provided by Ukraine’s government. Privately, officials recognize that Ukraine has an incentive to give only information that will bolster their case for more aid, more arms and more diplomatic assistance.\n\n“It’s a war – everything they do and say publicly is designed to help them win the war. Every public statement is an information operation, every interview, every Zelensky appearance broadcast is an information operation,” said another source familiar with western intelligence. “It doesn’t mean they’re wrong to do it in any way.”\n\nFor months, US and western officials have offered detailed accounts about what the West knows about the status of Russian forces inside Ukraine: how many casualties they’ve taken, their remaining combat power, their weapons stocks, what kinds of munitions they are using and where.\n\nBut when it comes to Ukrainian forces, officials acknowledge that the West – including the US – has some information gaps.\n\nWestern estimates of Ukrainian casualties are also foggy, according to two sources familiar with US and western intelligence.\n\n“It’s hard to track with nobody on the ground,” said one source familiar with the intelligence.\n\nVisibility Questions\n\nThe Biden administration and NATO countries say they are providing weapons to Ukraine based on what the Ukrainian forces say they need, whether it’s portable systems like Javelin and Stinger missiles or the Slovakian S-300 air defense system that was sent over the last week.\n\nJavelin and Stinger missiles and rifles and ammunition are naturally harder to track than larger systems like the S-300, which was shipped by rail. Although Javelins have serial numbers, there is little way to track their transfer and use in real time, sources familiar with the matter say.\n\nLast week the US agreed to provide Kyiv with the types of high-power capabilities some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago, including 11 Mi-17 helicopters, 18 155 mm Howitzer cannons and 300 more Switchblade drones. But much of that support hasn’t yet come online — and the Switchblades are mobile, one-time use drones that would also likely be difficult to track after the fact.\n\n“I couldn’t tell you where they are in Ukraine and whether the Ukrainians are using them at this point,” a senior defense official told reporters last week. “They’re not telling us every round of ammunition they’re firing and who and at when. We may never know exactly to what degree they’ve using the Switchblades.”\n\nThe Defense Department doesn’t earmark the weapons it sends for particular units, according to Pentagon press secretary John Kirby.\n\nTrucks loaded with pallets of arms provided by the Defense Department are picked up by Ukrainian armed forces – primarily in Poland – and then driven into Ukraine, Kirby said, “then it’s up to the Ukrainians to determine where they go and how they’re allocated inside their country.”\n\nA congressional source pointed out that while the US is not on the ground in Ukraine, the US has tools to learn what’s happening beyond what the Ukrainians are saying, noting the US has extensive use of satellite imagery and both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries appear to be using commercial communications equipment.\n\nAnother congressional source said the US military’s views the information it’s receiving from Ukraine as generally reliable because the US has trained and equipped the Ukrainian military for eight years now, developing strong relationships. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t some blind spots, the source said, such as on issues like the operational status of Ukraine’s S-300s.\n\nJordan Cohen, a defense and foreign policy analyst at the CATO institute who focuses on arms sales, said the biggest danger surrounding the flood of weapons being funneled into Ukraine is what happens to them when the war ends or transitions into some kind of protracted stalemate.\n\nSuch a risk is part of any consideration to send weapons overseas. For decades, the US sent arms into Afghanistan, first to arm the mujahideen in their fight against the Soviet army, then to arm Afghan forces in their fight against the Taliban.\n\nInevitably, some weapons ended up on the black market including anti-aircraft Stinger missiles, the same kind the US is now providing to Ukraine.\n\nThe United States famously scrambled to recover Stingers after the Soviet war in Afghanistan. It wasn’t successful in finding all of them and when the US itself invaded Afghanistan in 2001, some officials feared that they could be used by the Taliban against the United States.\n\nOther weapons have ended up arming US adversaries. Much of what the US left behind to help Afghan forces became part of the Taliban arsenal after the collapse of the Afghan government and military.\n\nThe problem is not unique to Afghanistan. Weapons sold to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates found their way into the hands of fighters linked to al-Qaeda and Iran.\n\nThe risk of a similar scenario happening in Ukraine also exists, the defense official acknowledged. In 2020, the Defense Department inspector general released a report raising concerns about the end-use monitoring of weapons being sent to Ukraine.\n\nBut given the nearly insatiable short-term needs of Ukrainian forces for more arms and ammunition, the long-term risk of weapons ending up on the black market or in the wrong hands was deemed acceptable, the official said.\n\n“This could be a problem 10 years down the line, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be something we’re thinking about,” Cohen, the CATO analyst, said. “Over 50 million rounds of ammunition – all that ammunition isn’t just going to be used to fight Russians. Eventually that ammunition is going to be misused, whether intentionally or not.”\n\nThe Russian Threat\n\nOfficials are less concerned – at least for now – that the weapons will fall into the hands of the Russians. The source briefed on the intelligence noted that Russia’s failure to hold large swaths of territory or force the surrender of many Ukrainian units means that those arms have either been used or remain Ukrainian hands.\n\nAnd so far, it appears that Russia has struggled to intercept or destroy the supply shipments. A third source familiar with the intelligence said that it does not appear that Russia has been actively attacking western weapons shipments entering Ukraine – although it is unclear exactly why, especially since the US has intelligence that the Russians want to and have discussed doing so both publicly and privately.\n\nThere are a number of theories for why the shipments have so far been spared, this person added, including that Russian forces simply can’t find them – the weapons and equipment are being sent over in unmarked vehicles and often transported at night. It could also be that the Russian forces are running out of munitions and don’t want to waste them targeting random trucks unless they can be certain they are part of an arms convoy.\n\nThough on Monday Russian claimed it had destroyed a depot “near Lviv,” which held “large consignments” of weapons provided to Ukraine by the United States and European countries. CNN has not been able to verify the claim.\n\nBut broadly, Russia doesn’t have perfect intelligence visibility into Ukraine, either, this source noted, and their air capabilities over western Ukraine, where the shipments are coming in, are extremely limited because of Ukrainian air defense systems.\n\nPublicly, the Pentagon says it has not yet seen Russian attempts to disrupt the weapons transfers or the shipments moving inside Ukraine.\n\n“Flights are still going into trans-shipment sites in the region. And ground movement is still occurring of this material inside Ukraine. Every single day, there are the security assistance, weapons and material and support equipment that is getting into Ukrainian hands,” Kirby said Thursday.\n\n“We’re going to keep doing that as much as we can, as fast as we can. We have not seen any Russian efforts to interdict that flow. And so we’re just going to keep doing it,” he added. “We constantly look at it every day monitor it, change it, adapt it as needed.”", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis Jeremy Herb Natasha Bertrand Oren Liebermann", "Katie Bo Lillis", "Jeremy Herb", "Natasha Bertrand", "Oren Liebermann"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/politics/westerners-held-taliban", "title": "Afghanistan: At least 7 British citizens and 1 American are being ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt least eight Westerners have been arrested by the Taliban in Afghanistan during different incidents in the last two months, CNN has learned, marking a sharp escalation of Taliban actions against Westerners living in the country.\n\nNo formal charges appear to have been lodged against the detained men. The people being held now include six British citizens, one of whom is an American legal resident, and one US citizen, according to the sources with direct knowledge of the matter in Afghanistan, the United States, and the UK.\n\nThe former vice president of Afghanistan, Amrullah Saleh, tweeted that “nine” Westerners had been “kidnapped” by the Taliban, naming journalists Andrew North, formerly of the BBC who was in the country working for the United Nations, and Peter Jouvenal, who has worked with the BBC and CNN. Both are British citizens.\n\nThe wife of North, Natalia Antelava, had confirmed to CNN that her husband was detained. Antelava tweeted Sunday confirming North’s release.\n\nNorth was in Afghanistan on assignment for the United Nations’ refugee agency (UNHCR).\n\nThe reason for each of the specific detentions is unclear, and they are not thought all to be related.\n\nJouvenal’s detention was confirmed by his family and friends to CNN.\n\n“Peter Jouvenal’s friends are deeply concerned for his safety following his detention by the authorities in Afghanistan in early December. A British/German dual-national, Peter has been travelling to Afghanistan for more than forty years, as freelance cameraman, businessman and investor,” his family said in a statement. “He is a Muslim, knows Afghanistan better than most foreigners, is married to an Afghan (they have three daughters), and speaks both main languages. He is being held without charge, and with no freedom to contact his family or lawyers.”\n\nThe family also said that they believed his detention could have been an error and noted that he has health complications which make his detention more dangerous.\n\n“Peter’s family and friends believe that he may have been detained in error, as he was in Afghanistan to discuss investments in Afghanistan’s mining industry as well as conducting family business. Before his arrest, he was working openly and had frequent meetings with senior Taliban officials. We urgently request that the Afghan authorities release Peter,” the family said. “He suffers from high blood pressure and needs medication. There is a high threat of COVID infection in the Afghan prison system.\n\nEscalation by the Taliban\n\nThe detentions come at a delicate time for the Biden administration which faces a major foreign policy crisis in Ukraine. President Joe Biden withdrew all US troops from Afghanistan six months ago, which paved the way for the Taliban to take over the country.\n\nThe detentions also mark a sharp escalation of Taliban actions against Westerners living in Afghanistan and come at a delicate moment in US-Taliban relations. Since the group swept back into power as the US military withdrew last August, it has been seeking recognition as Afghanistan’s legitimate government.\n\nEmily Horne, a spokesperson for the US National Security Council, called the detentions “unacceptable” and said the US has been contact with the Taliban as it urges the group to release the Westerners.\n\n“It’s completely unacceptable for the Taliban to hold hostage human beings, and completely antithetical to their purported aspiration to be viewed as a legitimate actor on the world stage. Through direct and indirect communications with the Taliban, we have urged the release of any and all individuals who are unjustly being held by the Taliban and their proxies. Due to privacy, safety, and operational concerns, we have no further comment at this time,” Horne said.\n\nSeven of the men were arrested in Kabul in December in separate incidents, and they have been detained for the past two months, the sources told CNN.\n\nThe Taliban have not publicly said that they are holding the men, although they did allow a senior Qatari official to visit some of the detainees in Kabul in mid-January. The Qatari official saw no signs of obvious mistreatment of the men, the sources told CNN.\n\nThe Taliban and Qatari government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA senior British official also visited some of the men in prison this month, two sources told CNN. The detainees are not all being held together, sources tell CNN.\n\nThe UK government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nConditions in Afghan jails are spartan, especially during the cold Kabul winters, and the spread of Covid-19 in the country is worrying the families of the detained men.\n\nFrom 2002, Jouvenal was the proprietor of the Gandamack Lodge hotel in Kabul, which was the key hotel used by journalists who were covering the Afghan War, until it was closed in 2014.\n\nJouvenal also filmed the first television interview with Osama bin Laden in 1997 for CNN.\n\nDuring the war against the Soviets, at great personal risk, Jouvenal traveled into Afghanistan more than 70 times to film the conflict for a variety of Western news organizations, one of the few Western journalists to do so.\n\nThe last time that the Taliban were in power in Afghanistan, before 9/11, Jouvenal maintained a house in Kabul, and over the years he has repeatedly met with Taliban leaders.\n\nSenior US and British officials have been working together to attempt to resolve the matter.\n\nQatari officials who are in frequent contact with the Taliban – as the protecting power of the US in the country – have discussed the issue with Taliban officials. For the last five weeks CNN has withheld reporting about the western prisoners held by the Taliban as diplomatic efforts by American, British and Qatari officials have continued to try and secure their release due to sensitivities around those efforts which have not been successful.\n\nThe Westerners are being held by the Intelligence Directorate of the Taliban in Kabul, according to sources familiar with the cases. The intelligence service is directed by Abdul Haq Wasiq, who was held at the Guantanamo prison camp for 12 years until he was released in 2014 in a prisoner swap for US soldier Bowe Bergdahl, who was being held by the Taliban.\n\nNegotiating with the Taliban presents a huge challenge\n\nAs the US military and diplomats completed their withdrawal from Kabul in August, they worked alongside the Taliban to facilitate the chaotic evacuation of foreigners and Afghans from the country. Since the withdrawal, there have been regular communications between US officials and the Taliban, but the trajectory of the relationship remains unclear.\n\nAs of earlier this year, there were about 80 Americans who wanted to leave Afghanistan but could not because evacuation flights have not been leaving the country regularly. Last month a flight chartered by the US government left Kabul, which marked the first evacuation departure since November, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Taliban Haqqani network also continues to hold US contractor Mark Frerichs, who was kidnapped two years ago while he was doing construction work in Afghanistan before the Taliban had seized the entire country in August.\n\nNo foreign country has recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, and so the Taliban crave any contacts with Western officials in which they are treated as the de facto government.\n\nThe US has made it clear that the Taliban must change their ways before being given any formal recognition.\n\nThe US gave $308 million of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan in January, to assist the Afghan people who are facing a growing humanitarian crisis.\n\nAnd Biden signed an executive order Friday allowing $7 billion in frozen assets from Afghanistan’s central bank to be distributed for humanitarian assistance in the country and to victims of the September 11 terror attacks, senior administration officials confirmed.\n\nThe funds, held in the US, were frozen following the collapse of the central government in Kabul in August. Half the remaining assets – $3.5 billion – will go toward providing relief inside the country, where fears of mass starvation have taken hold in the months since the Taliban took over.\n\nThe Taliban wants this assistance to continue because millions of Afghans face the prospect of starvation this winter. But the Taliban also want other forms of support from the global community.\n\nThe diplomatic efforts to free the westerners are complicated by the fact there are different factions within the Taliban. They are: the Haqqani Network which is the strongest faction militarily; the “Doha Taliban” which is the most pragmatic group; and the “Kandahar Taliban,” named after the region in southern Afghanistan where the Taliban originated in the early 1990s.\n\nThese factions frequently disagree on policy matters, according to senior Qatari officials who facilitated the talks in Doha between the United States and the Taliban that resulted in all American troops being pulled out of Afghanistan in August.\n\nMore than half of the members of the Taliban cabinet who were appointed in September are the subject of UN sanctions, according to Edmund Fitton-Brown, who coordinates the monitoring of Taliban sanctions at the UN.\n\nThe Taliban’s acting interior minister is Sirajuddin Haqqani. His job is the equivalent of running the United States Department of Homeland Security and the FBI. Last year the United Nations reported that Haqqani “is a member of the wider Al-Qaida leadership.” Haqqani is also on the FBI’s most-wanted list, which has a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest, while the US State Department has a $10 million reward.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional information, including Andrew North’s release.", "authors": ["Kylie Atwood Peter Bergen", "Kylie Atwood", "Peter Bergen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/opinions/afghan-refugee-women-albania-naseri-bohn/index.html", "title": "In a hotel room in Albania, Afghan women await new lives – and ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Jameela Naseri is a human rights lawyer and women’s rights advocate from Afghanistan.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe winter sky in Albania is gray and the air is damp. We’re living by the sea. It’s our first time ever actually seeing a sea, but it’s too cold to dip our toes in. It feels expansive and full of possibility, yet devastatingly out of our reach – just like parts of our new lives.\n\nThroughout the day I check in on the fellow Afghan women sharing a roof with me at our hotel in the Albanian resort town of Shengjin. They joke that I am Albania’s new therapist. We play card games and visit Albanian pastry shops where the deserts taste bittersweet, like our exile.\n\nWe try to fill our days with activities to make the time pass more quickly. Last month, I attended a trauma care course, facilitated by the international relief organization Samaritan’s Purse, where we talked – or at least tried to talk – about all we left behind.\n\nIn the courtyard of the hotel there is a strange replica of the Statue of Liberty. My two sons always try to climb it. I try not to take its look of cheap plasticity as some type of omen that liberty in our next home –if there is a next – is just a puffed-up façade like the version we were sold in Afghanistan.\n\nA mock-up of the Statue of Liberty is seen outside a tourist resort in the coastal city of Shengjin, where people evacuated from Afghanistan are sheltered. GENT SHKULLAKU/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThere, the situation is bleak. The United Nations Development Programme projects that by the middle of this year Afghanistan could face “universal poverty,” with 97% of Afghans living below the World Bank-designated international poverty line of $1.90 a day. It’s an increase of up to 25% on the poverty rate prior to the US withdrawal, according to the UNDP.\n\nLast week, the UN launched its largest single country aid appeal ever: $5 billion in the hope of shoring up collapsing basic services, which have left 22 million in need of assistance inside the country, and 5.7 million people requiring help beyond its borders. Afghanistan has become the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. But no amount of money will bring peace to our troubled souls.\n\nWhenever I wash our clothes in the sink of our hotel room, I think about the last day of our old lives. Back in August, I was washing my children’s clothes when a friend texted me to immediately pack my family’s bags. My beloved hometown Herat, a relatively liberal city in western Afghanistan, was most likely going to fall to the Taliban within the next 24 hours. And it did.\n\nForces had been advancing for months, but I wasn’t aware how quickly the situation was deteriorating. Still, I had been worried for some time that the Taliban would try to make a comeback. And as a practicing human rights lawyer, I knew the Taliban would not approve of my career.\n\nIn June, after having led a course on domestic violence awareness with the US government, I applied for a Special Immigrant Visa to America. I never did hear back from the embassy, and fear my application was lost in the administrative mess. But I thought I had the luxury of time. That was until I accepted the reality: the Taliban would surely take my city and most likely Kabul soon after. And upon their arrival, all my dreams of living in a democratic, equal society would vanish.\n\nMy husband and I quickly packed a few suitcases, mostly clothes for our two children and my stepdaughter, and caught the last commercial flight to Kabul. In the rush to leave, I left behind some meaningful items, including my university diploma. I was educated entirely in Afghanistan, and am the first woman in my family to complete secondary education, let alone receive a university degree.\n\nAfter escaping Herat, my family and I spent a month fearfully alternating between a European nonprofit organization office in Kabul and a friend’s apartment. The Taliban know who I am. For the past decade, I have been advocating for domestic abuse survivors and leading informal but determined coalitions of women – psychologists, doctors, activists, lawyers, educators – to take on this country’s endless war against women.\n\nIn Kabul, we attempted to get to the airport some 15 times. Contacts from around the world tried getting us on flights but to no avail. To Qatar? To Mexico? The US? I didn’t care where, I just wanted to get out.\n\nFinally, in August, we got on a plane to Albania, one of the poorest countries in Europe. We’ve been here for the past five months, put up by the Albanian government in a seaside resort along with almost 1,000 other Afghans. I have not been able to reapply for a Special Immigrant Visa, and we’re waiting on word when our new life will begin in America or Canada. We might be here for another year. Maybe two. Or maybe a week. Who controls time? I no longer look at calendars.\n\nIt wasn’t always like this. I knew I wanted to be a lawyer to help women live better lives with the dignity they deserve – to prevent them from being forced into marriages they did not want for themselves and from staying in abusive situations for fear or a lack of other options.\n\nMy mother was forced to marry my father when she was only 12 years old. In order to go to school, my mother and I made up lies so that my father would let me leave the house. We told him I was going to the mosque or to Quran studies. When the Taliban were in power, I was a young teenager, and this became very difficult, but we always found a way for me to learn.\n\nWe eventually convinced my father to let me attend university, but my sister wasn’t so lucky. She was forced into marriage at the age of 14.\n\nWhile I have childhood memories of the Taliban beating women in the streets for not wearing their burqas properly, my later teen years were filled with promise. There was countless international funding for programs targeted at women’s equality and conferences filled with ‘important people’ from foreign countries who told us we could be anything we wanted to be.\n\nWomen’s rights were supposed to be the success story of the 2001 US invasion, but the legacy of war has been killing our women for years. An estimated two-thirds of Afghan girls do not go to school, 87% of Afghan women are illiterate, and more than 70% face forced marriage.\n\nStill, over the last two decades, the US spent hundreds of millions of dollars promoting women’s rights in Afghanistan, and a whole generation of us entered our careers with genuine hope for gender equality. Now, it all feels like empty slogans. What will become of all the impressive women I know who are lawyers, doctors, teachers, politicians? The Taliban claims it won’t hurt them, but the reality is likely to be far different, and already the women of Afghanistan are being forced inside again.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nJust last week, photos circulated on social media of workers at clothing shops in Herat cutting off the heads of female mannequins. Taliban authorities have labeled them “un-Islamic.” Earlier this month, they banned women without male chaperones from entering cafes in the city. CNN has not been able to independently verify these reports, though they tally with what I’ve heard from Afghans living there. Last month, the Taliban also banned women from traveling farther than 45 miles without a close male relative.\n\nFour years ago, on International Women’s Day, I gave birth to my second son. I made a promise to myself that I would never raise my children in a country where women are second-class citizens.\n\nUnfortunately, our country’s future has been decided. And it doesn’t include us. So, I will wait for another plane to take us even farther away from a country I love but that doesn’t love me. I will wait to build us a new life.

What's more, NASA has found itself without a full-time administrator since Bill Nelson stepped down on Jan. 20, the day of Trump's inauguration.\n\nTrump, though, gave Duffy a glowing vote of confidence when announcing his new appointment.\n\n“He will be a fantastic leader of the ever more important Space Agency, even if only for a short period of time,” Trump said in a Truth Social post Wednesday, July 9.\n\nHere's everything to know about Duffy, the former Wisconsin Republican Congressman and reality TV star who will lead the world's largest space agency.\n\nTrump picks transportation secretary Sean Duffy for NASA acting administrator\n\nDuffy will serve as the interim administrator of NASA as the Trump administration continues to search for a candidate to formally take over the post for the rest of the president's term.\n\n“Sean is doing a TREMENDOUS job in handling our Country’s Transportation Affairs, including creating a state-of-the-art Air Traffic Control systems, while at the same time rebuilding our roads and bridges, making them efficient, and beautiful, again,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. \"Congratulations, and thank you, Sean.\"\n\nIn his own post on X shortly after the president's announcement, Duffy said he is “honored to accept this mission. Time to take over space. Let’s launch.\n\nWho is Sean Duffy? What to know about NASA's new head\n\nDuffy, 53, was confirmed Jan. 28 by the Senate as U.S. transportation secretary.\n\nHis tenure was immediately marked by tragedy after a fatal aviation crash near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport that killed 67 people\n\nAt his confirmation hearing on Jan. 15, Duffy said he would prioritize adding more air traffic controllers to improve aviation safety while promising to work with Congress and the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates Boeing, to restore international confidence in the plane manufacturer after fatal crashes overseas.\n\nPrior to serving in the Trump Administration, Duffy represented Wisconsin in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2019.\n\nBut long before his political career, Duffy was a reality television star. He began his television career on MTV's \"The Real World: Boston\" during its sixth season and even met his wife, Rachel Campos-Duffy, who hosts “Fox & Friends Weekend,\" while filming for an MTV show.\n\nDuffy to replace Janet Petro\n\nSince Trump's inauguration, NASA has been led by Acting Administrator Janet Petro.\n\nA veteran NASA executive, Petro will step down from her role to make way for Duffy, the New York Times reported.\n\nWhy did Trump drop Jared Isaacman as NASA nominee?\n\nBillionaire Jared Isaacman, who has been to space twice under missions he bankrolled with SpaceX, had been Trump's first pick to lead NASA.\n\nIsaacman’s nomination was well-received by most of the space community and members of Congress.\n\nBut at a critical time when the U.S. space agency is preparing to return humans to the moon and send the first astronauts to Mars, Trump suddenly pulled Isaacman's bid in late-May. The decision came after Isaacman had cleared the Senate Commerce Committee in April and appeared on track for a full Senate vote.\n\nTrump discussed Isaacman's nomination July 6 in a long social media post bashing his former ally and advisor Elon Musk, saying he thought it would have been “inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon … run NASA.”\n\nTrump further said of Isaacman that he \"was surprised to learn that he was a blue-blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.\"\n\nIsaacman pushed back against Trump's claims in a post Monday, July 7 on X, describing himself as an apolitical \"right-leaning moderate.\"\n\nCould more than 2,000 senior employees quit at NASA?\n\nDuffy is set to take over an agency that has undergone workforce reductions and is preparing for a potential massive looming budget cut.\n\nTrump's proposed budget for the next fiscal year would slash NASA funding by nearly 25% – from $24.8 billion to $18.8 billion – mostly by eliminating a significant portion of the agency's science portfolio.\n\nAnd on July 10, news broke that around 2,145 senior-ranking employees at NASA are set to leave under a push to shed staff, Politico reported, citing documents obtained by the news outlet.

Pending Senate approval, Whitaker would oversee NATO, the post-World War II alliance the U.S. joined as a founding member in 1949 to defend Europe against Russia. Throughout his successful White House bid, Trump has criticized European countries for how much it spends on defense compared to the U.S.\n\nFollowing his election victory and Republican sweep in Congress, Trump has revealed his Cabinet nominations at a faster pace than prior administrations, including his first term.

At the time, Democrats and some Republicans challenged Whitaker's interim appointment because he hadn't served in a Senate-confirmed position.\n\nIn a July 2016 opinion piece for USA TODAY, Whitaker argued that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the Democratic presidential nominee, should have been indicted for how she handled classified documents on a private email server.\n\nTrump's picks so far: What we know\n\nHere are Trump's picks for key positions in his administration, as of Sunday night.\n\nWhat are the Cabinet positions?\n\nThe Cabinet advises the president on issues related to their respective offices.\n\nThese are the Cabinet positions from the 15 executive departments, which must be confirmed by the Senate:\n\nSecretary of State\n\nSecretary of Defense\n\nAttorney General\n\nSecretary of the Interior\n\nSecretary of Agriculture\n\nSecretary of Commerce\n\nSecretary of Labor\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services\n\nSecretary of Transportation\n\nSecretary of Energy\n\nSecretary of Education\n\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security\n\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\n\nSecretary of Treasury\n\nThe Cabinet and presidential advisers can also include the vice president, the chief of staff, the ambassador to the United Nations, the director of National Intelligence, the U.S. trade representative, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, the head of the Council of Economic Advisors, the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the head of the Small Business Administration.\n\nContributing: James Powel, Aysha Bagchi, Zac Anderson, Darren Samuelsohn, Dan Morrison, Karen Weintraub, Alyssa Goldberg, Tom Vanden Brook, David Jackson, Savannah Kuchar, Victor Hagan, Bart Jansen, Fernando Cervantes Jr., Riley Beggin, Michael Collins, Joey Garrison; Kaycee Sloan, the Cincinnati Enquirer; Jim Little; Pensacola News Journal.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/25/arizona-republican-chair-resigns-kari-lake/72350029007/", "title": "Arizona Republican chair resigns after audio surfaces of 'offer' for ...", "text": "Jeff DeWit, a former Arizona treasurer and Trump adviser, resigned as chair of the state GOP on Wednesday following the release of an audio recording in which he offered Kari Lake a lucrative job if she quits her U.S. Senate race.\n\nIn a written statement, DeWit said Lake's team had threatened him with the potential release of a \"new, more damaging recording\" unless he resigned immediately.\n\n\"I am truly unsure of its contents, but considering our numerous past open conversations as friends, I have decided not to take the risk,\" he wrote. He added that he hopes she stops attacking him so he can return to the business world, \"a field I find much more logical and prefer over politics.\"\n\nIn a live video on web-hosting platform Rumble on Wednesday evening, Lake criticized DeWit's remarks as well as his resignation letter for not including an apology to Arizonans.\n\n\"This is one of the worst things I've ever heard,\" Lake said of the recording she made. \"It was so corrupt.\"\n\nDeWit was elected to chair the Arizona GOP in January 2023. He was the chief operating officer for former President Donald Trump’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns. Trump later named him chief financial officer of NASA. He took over the Arizona GOP in January 2023 with a mission to unite and raise funds both from Trump's base and Republicans who don't support the former president.\n\nLake, who lost the 2022 governor's race to Democrat Katie Hobbs, apparently leaked the recording to the Daily Mail, which was the first news outlet to publish it. DeWit tells Lake in the recording that \"powerful people\" don't want her to run for Senate and asked her to consider taking their suggestion for a job and a two-year \"pause.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what I'm offering you,\" DeWit told her, saying there would be companies that could put her on the payroll. He repeatedly told her not to tell anyone about the conversation.\n\n\"I can't be bought,\" Lake responded.\n\n\"C'mon,\" DeWit urged her.\n\nDeWit also said in the recording that he doubts Trump can win reelection due to fundraising problems. Lake responded: “This is about defeating Trump and I think that’s a bad, bad thing for our country.”\n\nDeWit said in his statement that while he said things he regrets, he now believes Lake set up him and was a \"betrayal\" of their friendship. The recording came from a private conversation they had a year ago while she worked for a company he owns. He doesn't say in the statement which company, but in a 2022 financial disclosure, Lake reported working as a communication adviser for FeedMe Inc. in 2021 and 2022. The company is an earlier iteration of Superfeed Technologies, a campaign-promoting app company for which DeWit serves as CEO.\n\n\"I believe she orchestrated this entire situation to have control over the state party, and it is obvious from the recording that she crafted her performance responses with the knowledge that she was recording it, intending to use this recording later to portray herself as a hero in her own story,\" he wrote. \"I question how effective a United States Senator can be when they cannot be trusted to engage in private and confidential conversations.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that he did offer her to leave the Senate race and try again for governor in two years, \"it was a suggestion made in good faith, believe it could benefit both her future prospects and the party's overall strategy.\"\n\nIn her address on Wednesday, Lake did not answer a question about why it took her 10 months to release the recording.\n\nShe said she decided it was something she had to talk about at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., despite DeWit's desire to keep the offer quiet. Her CPAC speech included an allegation that she was \"bribed\" by a powerful person, but she didn't give details then.\n\nShe listened to the recording again only a few days ago, she said.\n\nDeWit took over the party following four years of leadership by former lawmaker Kelli Ward, a prominent Trump supporter who falsely claimed to be an elector for Trump after he lost the 2020 election. The state party moved to a new headquarters last year but nearly went broke as donors wary of racking up more election losses dried up.\n\nFundraising has improved recently, though. The party announced last month it had a \"record-breaking\" last quarter of 2023, collecting more than $670,000 from over 7,500 donors.\n\nDeWit said he remains a solid Trump advocate who is \"eager to see him return to the White House.\"\n\nThe party should focus on unity and selecting quality candidates, he wrote.\n\n\"We are weakened by internal strife, underhanded tactics, and the erosion of trust,\" he wrote.\n\nThe state party's bylaws say the state committee should schedule a special meeting within 45 days to fill a vacancy of the chair, unless a mandatory meeting is scheduled within 90 days. The Republican State Committee is scheduled to hold its annual mandatory meeting on Jan. 27, but officials haven't yet said if a new chair will be appointed or elected then.\n\nFormer state lawmaker Jill Norgaard, the state party's first vice-chair, will serve as acting chair in the interim.\n\nReach the reporter at rstern@arizonarepublic.com or 480-276-3237.

The Apollo 16 capsule, nicknamed “Casper,” is housed at the museum, which cleaned up the spaceship earlier this year ahead of the celebration. Duke and NASA officials are among those who will participate in an event that also will focus on the space agency’s upcoming test of its new, 30-story Space Launch System rocket. NASA is targeting June for a test flight to send the rocket to the moon without a crew. The administrator of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Jody Singer, and James Free, NASA’s associate administrator for exploration development, will discuss the space agency’s work to return to the moon. After the first launch in NASA’s Artemis program, the agency plans to send astronauts around the moon in 2024. A lunar landing attempt is planned for as early as 2025. People last walked on the moon during the Apollo 17 mission in December 1972.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: The final two F-35A Joint Strike Fighter jets have arrived at Eielson Air Force Base, completing the full complement of 54 aircraft. Col. David “Ajax” Berkland of the 354 Fighter Wing at Eielson called it “a really significant day for us in terms of the buildup of Eielson Air Force Base.” The base near Fairbanks was selected in 2016 to host F-35s, spawning a base expansion that cost more than a half-billion dollars and includes 36 new buildings and 54 housing units for the F-35s, Fairbanks television station KTVF reported Saturday, a day after the two final jets arrived. The Air Force says the fifth generation F-35 represents a “quantum leap” in air combat capability. Combined with two squadrons of F-22s at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, will have more operational fifth generation assets than anywhere else in the world, Eleventh Air Force Commander Lt. Gen. David A. Krumm, told Air Force Magazine. Krumm is the senior military official in Alaska. “Gen. Billy Mitchell talked about it in the 1930s that whoever holds Alaska holds the world. So the strategic importance of competing and securing our nation’s interests, which were there then, remains as much now as ever,” Berkland told KTVF. The expansion also includes personnel, with about 3,500 new active-duty airmen and their dependents stationed at the base.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A cannabis dispensary is offering tourists traveling through Sky Harbor International Airport a free shuttle directly to its doors starting Wednesday. The Mint dispensary in Guadalupe is calling the shuttle the #420 and offering it to people 21 and older. The Mint has long captured attention with its kitchen serving marijuana-infused pizza, burgers and other snacks and by offering free marijuana products to people who visited for a COVID-19 vaccination. The Arizona-based dispensary chain is kicking off the service Wednesday, a pseudo-holiday for cannabis consumers sometimes referred to simply as “4/20.” “National Cannabis Day gives us the opportunity to celebrate how much our industry has evolved and grown,” CEO Eivan Shahara said in a statement. “It’s also a great day to make history by delivering more innovation and excitement, while also finding ways to thank our patients, customers, visitors, and the community at large for their support.” The shuttle will pick up at all three Sky Harbor terminals during certain hours, and travelers can reserve a seat online at mintdeals.com/shuttle. Other marijuana-themed airport shuttles exist for a fee in places like Denver, but The Mint claims the free service is the first of its kind.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court has reversed a judge’s decision to block a school district’s mask mandate that was implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Justices on Thursday reversed the temporary restraining order issued against the Bentonville School District’s mask requirement. Bentonville was among dozens of districts that imposed the requirement last year after a state law banning such mandates was blocked in a separate case. A group of parents had sued challenging the mandate. The court said that Arkansas’ laws give schools broad authority to determine their policies. “Based on this precedent, we conclude that the district properly authorized its policy,” Chief Justice Dan Kemp wrote in the court’s ruling. A spokeswoman said the district has no plans to reinstate the mask requirement at this time. In a separate opinion, Special Justice Howard Brill said parents have a right to be informed and to be heard on issues such as whether masks should be worn. But, Brill wrote, that doesn’t mean they have the right to “micromanage” schools. “If parents are dissatisfied with the school board decisions, they have a remedy,” wrote Brill, who was appointed to hear the case after Justice Rhonda Wood recused. “It is the ballot box.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A Northern California woman pleaded guilty Monday to faking her own kidnapping and lying to the FBI about it, leaving her motive unanswered in the carefully planned hoax that set off a massive three-week search before she resurfaced on Thanksgiving Day in 2016. Sherri Papini, 39, of Redding, offered no explanation for her elaborate hoax during the half-hour court hearing. “I feel very sad,” she said tearfully when Senior U.S. District Judge William Shubb asked her how she was feeling. “Were you kidnapped?” he asked her later in the hearing. “No, Your Honor,” she replied. “Did you lie to government agents when you told them you were kidnapped?” Shubb continued. “Yes, Your Honor,” she responded. Papini agreed to plead guilty in a deal with prosecutors reached last week and is scheduled to be sentenced July 11. Prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence on the low end of the sentencing range, estimated to be between eight and 14 months in custody, down from the maximum 25 years for the two charges.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s high school athletics authority has ambitious plans to expand esports into half of Colorado high schools. Rashaan Davis, who oversees esports for the Colorado High School Activities Association, said this year’s season is the busiest yet. “There are over 100 teams playing multiple titles across our state,” Davis said. “We offer League of Legends, Rocket League, Madden and (Super Smash Bros. Ultimate).” Gamers have traditionally been labeled as socially awkward geeks. Harrison High coaches Tom McCartney and Sean Hart want to break that stigma. When they were in high school, they found comfort in video games, but schools didn’t tolerate gaming on school grounds, much less encourage it. As teachers, and now coaches, they want to foster a safe environment for those awkward geeks to develop and build their talents. “Those are the people who ended up being the entrepreneurs, the vanguards for new ideas and opportunities and waves,” said McCartney, an English and drama teacher. “Let’s build their confidence now, so they don’t have to wait until 33 or 34 when they find themselves and accept themselves to finally get started with building a new world.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWest Haven: Members of a state oversight board have decided they need greater control over the finances of the city, which has been under the microscope after a former state representative and others were accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in COVID-19 relief funds awarded to the municipality. The Municipal Accountability Review Board voted Thursday to recommend that West Haven, which is currently under a level of state oversight known as Tier III, be upgraded to Tier IV. That means the state board would have additional management tools, including the ability to hire a financial manager for the city. It will ultimately be up to Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont to decide whether to approve the stepped-up oversight, following a 30-day public comment period. City officials, including the mayor, opposed the move. They argued that West Haven, which has a long history of financial struggles, has made progress in recent years since working with the state board. Michael Last, the city’s treasurer, said he didn’t think the city of more than 55,000 people met the criteria for such a severe step. Board members countered that the alleged theft would not have occurred if proper financial safeguards recommended by the board were put in place.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: People living in the shadows of Croda’s New Castle-area manufacturing plant say it’s not a matter of if but when the plant has another dangerous leak along the Route 9 corridor. And it’s an even bigger concern now, as ethylene oxide, a highly flammable and explosive chemical that has been linked to various types of cancers, was found to be 30 times more cancerous for adults than previously thought, according to a report published by the Environmental Protection Agency’s independent Office of Inspector General. This chemical is the same one that leaked nearly 3,000 pounds into the air in 2018, shutting down the Delaware Memorial Bridge and scaring residents who were told to shelter in place as the flammable chemical leaked from the plant about a mile from their homes. “We’re living with a time bomb in our community – it already exploded one time,” said Jakim Mohammed, a local activist and Dunleith resident, as he stood within eyeshot of the plant. These concerns brought Croda, community members, and state and federal officials together Wednesday for a virtual meeting to discuss the company’s production of ethylene oxide and what that means for the health and safety of nearby residents. The meeting is one of the first sessions officials have held to update residents about the new risks associated with ethylene oxide since the federal watchdog urged the EPA to “promptly” hold public meetings in New Castle and 16 other locations across the country in March 2020.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Undaunted by soggy skies, President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, kicked off the first White House Easter Egg Roll since before the coronavirus pandemic Monday, welcoming some 30,000 kids and adults for the all-day event. The president encouraged one young egg-roller, coaching the child: “Go. You got it.” “My job is to keep it from raining for another two minutes,” he said in opening remarks on the South Lawn. The theme for the day was “egg-ucation.” The first lady, a community college professor, turned the South Lawn into a school community with a variety of educational stations. Besides the egg roll and an egg hunt, the event included a schoolhouse activity area, a reading nook, a talent show, a place to teach about farming, a photo-taking station, a physical “egg-ucation” zone with an obstacle course, and a “cafetorium” where children learned to make treats. The COVID-19 pandemic led the White House to cancel the Easter Egg Roll in 2020 and 2021. But the event is back this year, as the outbreak of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths has eased. “This year we’re finally getting together again, and it’s so special,” the president told the guests. “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon, singer Ciara and actor-singer Kristin Chenoweth were set to add a dash of celebrity splash to the event, which dates to 1878.\n\nFlorida\n\nLake Buena Vista: A baby zebra died at Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom after running full speed into a gate when it was spooked by two ostriches Thursday, a television station reports. WESH reports it spoke with a family who witnessed the incident and was told it happened after the enormous birds were released into the same enclosure. The family said the experience was upsetting and sent the station cellphone video of Disney employees trying to save the animal. “We are heartbroken over the loss of our Hartmann’s mountain zebra that passed away yesterday, and we ask that you keep our dedicated animal care Cast Members in your thoughts,” a Disney spokesperson said in an email to the station.\n\nGeorgia\n\nJekyll Island: A pair of rare sea turtles have returned to the ocean after veterinarians spent nearly a year nursing them back to health on the Georgia coast. The adult female loggerhead turtles were released into the surf Friday on the beach at Jekyll Island. Both had been patients at the Georgia Sea Turtle Center, the island’s hospital for sick and injured sea turtles. One was admitted last May after getting struck by a boat, according to a Jekyll Island news release. The other arrived in July after being found anemic and covered in barnacles and leeches. A few hundred people, including children on school trips, turned out to bid the sea turtles farewell. It was the first time the Georgia Sea Turtle Center had held a turtle release publicly since 2019. The turtles returned to the wild just before the nesting season for loggerhead sea turtles begins in Georgia on May 1.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The head of training at the state Department of Public Safety pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges accusing her of lying about her educational background. Public Training Officer J. Marte Martinez pleaded not guilty to perjury, tampering with a government record and unsworn falsification to authorities, according to her attorney Birney Bervar. Trial is set for June, Bervar said, declining to comment on the allegations. A complaint filed in court said Martinez made false statements about her educational background while testifying under oath before the Hawaii Labor Relations Board. The alleged false statements included having a liberal arts degree from a Virginia university. Martinez is also accused of submitting a transcript to the public safety department purported to be from an Oregon university, “which was falsely made, completed, or altered,” the complaint said. When applying for positions in the public safety department, she submitted an application that contained “statements about her educational background that she did not believe to be true,” the complaint said. The Department of Public Safety oversees Hawaii's jail and prisons, along with law enforcement divisions, including sheriffs.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The National Rifle Association on Monday endorsed Gov. Brad Little ahead of the Republican primary. NRA Idaho State Director Aiobheann Cline said in a statement that the endorsement reflects Little’s A-plus rating in the group and his support of Second Amendment issues during his first term. “Our members will interpret your ‘A+’ rating and endorsement as being a solid pro-gun/pro-hunting candidate who is a staunch defender of the Right to Keep and Bear Arm,” Cline said in the endorsement. Little has signed into law a number of gun-rights bills. Those include legislation protecting gun makers, sellers and weapons carriers during declared emergencies, along with another making it easier for nonresidents to carry firearms in the state. “With me, Idahoans have a governor who will always protect our Idaho way of life, and that includes my unwavering support for upholding our rights established in the Second Amendment,” Little said in a statement. His main challenger in the May 17 Republican primary is Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, who has been endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Almost four decades after a Black student graduated from Springfield High School at the top of her class, she’s finally been recognized as valedictorian. Tracey Meares, now a top legal scholar at Yale College of Law, was denied that honorific for 38 years until Saturday. Springfield School District 186 Superintendent Jennifer Gill presented Meares with the valedictorian medal and certificate after the screening of the documentary “No Title for Tracey” before a crowd of hundreds at the Hoogland Center for the Arts. Gill, who was a freshman at SHS when Meares was a senior, personally dug through old records, some on microfiche, to verify the ranking. “My first reaction is that it’s incredibly gratifying, but it’s also a lot to process,” Meares said after the presentation. Many, including Meares’ parents, believe systemic or institutional racism was behind the snub. The school typically had a valedictorian and a salutatorian, but as graduation neared in 1984, it opted for “top students” for Meares and a white student. It didn’t start naming valedictorians and salutatorians again until 1992. “It was not an individual act,” mother Carolyn Blackwell said. “That’s what makes it systemic.” The Southern Illinois University Institute for Plastic Surgery announced it had set up the “Tracey Meares Representation Matters” scholarship in her honor.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: An upcoming Netflix documentary will take a closer look at a local fertility doctor who for years inseminated patients with his own sperm without their knowledge. Years ago, several Indiana residents found out their father – whom some had believed to be an anonymous sperm donor or the man who had raised them – was actually their mother’s doctor: Donald Cline, once well respected in his field in Indianapolis. Those biological children will soon tell the story in their own words in “Our Father,” coming to the streaming service May 11. Cline’s secret was discovered in 2014, when Jacoba Ballard took a DNA test, expecting to have one or two donor half-siblings, but discovered seven whose mothers had all gone to Cline. He’d told them they’d be inseminated with material from anonymous donor, whose sperm would not be used more than three times to conceive a child. Ballard told the Indiana Senate Judiciary Committee in 2019 that she’s discovered at least 46 half-siblings. A fertility fraud bill to prevent a similar situation was passed and signed into law by Gov. Eric Holcomb that year. Cline’s license was revoked by the Medical Licensing Board of Indiana in 2018, but he did not spend any time in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice after lying to officials.\n\nIowa\n\nDavenport: Armed with grant money, Humility Homes and Services plans to buy 60 housing units in its bid to end homelessness in the Quad Cities, nearly doubling the social service organization’s housing portfolio. In all, Humility Homes received more than $4.2 million from various agencies to help address an affordable housing shortage documented by several area organizations. “This is an important step in addressing the gap we have,” said Leslie Kilgannon, director of the Quad Cities Housing Council. “We have about 6,600 units we need in that extremely low-income category.” The bulk – 35 – of Humility Homes’ new housing units will be supportive housing, which combines services such as help with physical disabilities or health needs as well as mental illness or substance abuse treatment. The goal is to keep people who face challenges qualifying or keeping other housing in a stable place while they transition from an emergency shelter to more permanent housing. To provide the 35 supportive housing units, Scott County awarded Humility Homes $3.1 million from its allotment of federal COVID-19 relief funds from the American Rescue Plan Act. The other 25 units will provide more permanent affordable housing options for low-income families, some that rely on federal housing vouchers to pay rent.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A popular program for children to get free admission to some of the state’s coolest attractions is coming back this summer. Sunflower Summer – a Kansas State Department of Education initiative that gave over 70,000 residents free access to museums, parks and other attractions around the state in 2022 – is funded for the next few summers, Education Commissioner Randy Watson said. “We’re going to be doing it again, and we’re excited about it,” Watson told the Kansas State Department of Education. The department had used federal COVID-19 relief funding to start Sunflower Summer in 2021, in an effort to make sure all Kansas students had access to summer enrichment opportunities. This year, Gov. Laura Kelly decided to reallocate unused federal relief funds for private schools to the education department so it could continue to offer the program. To get free admission to Kansas attractions, parents or other adults download the Sunflower Summer app on their phone and register themselves and their children. The app then provides a single-use, free ticket for the child, as well as free tickets for up to two accompanying adults, to attend attractions around the state. In 2021, about 70 sites participated, including the Kansas Cosmosphere, Kansas Children’s Discovery Center and Eisenhower Presidential Library.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A judge on Monday blocked Republican-backed measures that would weaken Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s contracting authority and prevent him from challenging laws in court. The two new laws were temporarily blocked by Franklin County Circuit Judge Thomas D. Wingate after the GOP-dominated Legislature passed them last week over Beshear’s vetoes. One of the laws being challenged would designate Kentucky’s attorney general as the only statewide constitutional officer allowed to spend taxpayer funds on litigation challenging a bill’s constitutionality. The other contested measure would shift decision-making authority over executive branch contracts to a legislative committee. Both laws took effect immediately. In his order, Wingate said the plaintiffs, including the governor, had “more than sufficiently demonstrated that their rights are being or will be violated.” “Of particular concern to the court is that plaintiffs have alleged that under HB248 their access to the courts has essentially been blocked,” the judge wrote. The governor claims that both measures violate Kentucky’s Constitution. The lawsuit continues the long-running legal fight between Beshear and Republican lawmakers over measures seeking to rein in his executive authority. Wingate will hear arguments in the latest case May 31.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state says its weekends-only red snapper season for anglers will start May 27 in state and federal waters, with a daily limit of three of the popular sport and food fish. The season will run Fridays through Sundays except for three holiday weekends – Memorial Day, which opens the season; the Fourth of July, and Labor Day. Those three weekends extend through Monday. Each licensed angler may take up to three red snapper a day, with a minimum length limit of 16 inches, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said in a news release. The catch limit has been two fish a day for years but was raised to four during a 2021 year-end reopening. The department said anglers went nearly 7,000 pounds over the private recreational allocation last year, so that amount was taken from this year’s total limit. The agency said this year’s season will remain open until recreational landings approach or reach 809,316 pounds. LDWF also reminded anglers that amberjack and gray triggerfish season will overlap the red snapper season on the opening Memorial Day weekend but be closed from June 1 through July 30. Resident and nonresident recreational anglers who fish for offshore species must have both Louisiana basic and saltwater recreational fishing licenses, plus the free recreational offshore landing permit.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined an appeal by the Penobscot Indian Nation in its fight with Maine over ownership and regulation of the tribe’s namesake river. It was a bitter defeat for the tribe that sued a decade ago, claiming the Penobscot River is part of its reservation. Penobscot Chief Kirk Francis said it was a disappointing outcome in a legal case that goes to the “core identity of the Penobscot Nation.” “We see this as a modern day territorial removal by the state by trying to separate us from our ancestral ties to our namesake river,” Francis told the Associated Press. A federal judge previously ruled that the reservation includes islands of the river’s main stem but not the waters. There were appeals to a panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of appeals and then to the full appeals court. On Monday, the nation’s top court, without comment, declined to hear the tribe’s appeals over river regulation. The ruling came as the Maine Legislature was considering several measures that relate to tribal sovereignty. The Penobscots, whose reservation is on an island in the river, sued in 2012 after then-Attorney General William Schneider issued an opinion that the tribe’s territory was limited to islands. The tribe said the lawsuit was necessary to protect tribal authority over its ancestral river and ensure sustenance rights.\n\nMaryland\n\nJessup: The first cohort of students in Georgetown University’s degree program for prisons in Maryland has begun classes, officials announced. In-person classes at the Patuxent Institution, in Jessup, started Feb. 14 for the 25 students accepted into the program. Officials announced the liberal arts degree program last spring as an expansion of the Prison Scholars Program that Georgetown offers at the D.C. jail. Students completing the program will earn bachelor’s degrees from the university. Officials said they expect 125 students to enroll within the next five years in the 120-credit interdisciplinary program. The university’s admissions process for the program began last fall with the help of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, officials said. After more than 300 applied from throughout the state prison system, those selected from other facilities were transferred to Patuxent Institution. Cultural humanities, interdisciplinary social science and global intellectual history are the program’s three available majors, officials said. Students this semester are taking introductory classes in writing and philosophy. The program will take about five years for most students to complete.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLawrence: A wind-fueled blaze that damaged several homes Friday night displaced more than 70 people but resulted in no injuries, with one local leader calling it an “Easter miracle.” In all, 73 people belonging to 17 different families are residing in temporary housing following the blaze, Lawrence officials said Saturday. Fire officials said they believe the fire started on the third-floor balcony of a home in Lawrence before spreading to five other nearby residences. They said high winds helped the fire spread quickly in the densely settled neighborhood. All residents were safely evacuated, and no injuries were reported. No pets were reported missing or injured either. “An Easter miracle,” said City Council President Marc Laplante. “It’s amazing that we were able to walk away from this.” Crews from fire departments in Massachusetts and New Hampshire worked for more than three hours to extinguish the fire. The Red Cross is providing housing and assistance to the occupants of the damaged homes, and local community groups are helping to coordinate donations.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: Funeral services have been scheduled for Patrick Lyoya, an unarmed Black man fatally shot following a traffic stop and struggle with a white police officer. The Rev. Al Sharpton will deliver the eulogy Friday in Grand Rapids for Lyoya, according to Sharpton’s National Action Network and the office of attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Lyoya’s family. Services will begin at 11 a.m. at Renaissance Church of God in Christ in Grand Rapids. Lyoya, a native of the Democratic Republic of Congo, was facedown on the ground April 4 when he was shot in the back of the head. Video footage released Wednesday by the police department showed the officer straddling Lyoya’s back at the time of the shooting. Video also showed the officer stopping Lyoya for driving with a license plate that didn’t belong to the vehicle, Lyoya’s attempt to run away before being tackled to the ground, and a struggle over the officer’s stun gun. The officer could be heard repeatedly ordering Lyoya to “let go” of his stun gun, at one point demanding: “Drop the Taser!” Michigan State Police are investigating the shooting and the events that led up to it. Police Chief Eric Winstrom, citing department policy, said he only would release the officer’s name if and when he is charged. Lyoya’s family and Crump have demanded that the city identify the officer.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Researchers plan to study a group of Minnesotans who dunk themselves in icy Lake Harriet every winter day. The Star Tribune reports researchers from Rockefeller University’s Cohen Laboratory of Molecular Metabolism are studying so-called brown fat that generates heat in cold conditions in humans. They’re currently investigating possible links between controlled exposure to cold such as ice water dips or cold showers and improved health. They’re also investigating blood biomarkers of brown fat in young New Yorkers using cooling vests. The researchers want to validate the study in a larger group of people, so starting this summer they’ll collect blood from a group of 70 people who dip themselves in Lake Harriet at least twice a week for a month in winter. The researchers hope to compare molecules in their blood during the summer and winter months as well as their responses to anxiety, stress and depression. The Minneapolis Park Board allows people to swim in lakes Harriet or Cedar during the winter if they apply for a permit and sign a waiver. Data from the waiver system indicates about 1,000 people have taken dips in the lakes since December 2021.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Archives and History is granting the public access to additional papers from the late author Eudora Welty, including letters written by members of her family. The release came Wednesday on the 113th anniversary of Welty’s birth. She died July 23, 2001. According to her will, the family correspondence was to remain private for 20 years after her death. Welty, who lived most of her life in Jackson, was known for the lyrical quality of her short stories and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her short novel “The Optimist’s Daughter,” published in 1972. While establishing herself as a writer, Welty photographed scenes of everyday life in Mississippi during the Great Depression for the Works Progress Administration. Welty’s niece, Mary Alice White, said in a news release from the archives department that the newly released letters begin with the courtship of Welty’s parents. White said they also include correspondence with relatives and papers and letters from others in the family. The Eudora Welty Collection was established in 1957, when she donated manuscripts, photographs and correspondence to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Hoping to end the tyranny of the Bradford pear tree, the state Department of Conservation is offering free replacements to residents who cut them down. The Bradford pear, also known as the Callery pear, can create unpleasant smells and, more importantly, is invasive and destructive to other plants and animals. While beautiful in bloom, it multiplies quickly and crowds out native plants, according to the Missouri Department of Conservation. “The Callery pear became a popular ornamental landscape tree in the 1960s because it was inexpensive, it grew fast, and provided those eye-catching blooms in the spring,” said MDC Forestry Program Supervisor Russell Hinnah. “But that’s where its benefits end. Different varieties of the tree were planted close to each other, which resulted in cross-pollination, and they took over natural areas.” The Bradford pear also has a poor branch structure, so the trees don’t fare well in storms. MDC encourages homeowners and landscapers to grow native when picking a tree to plant. “There are many great trees to substitute,” Hinnah said. “Serviceberry trees produce similar showy white blooms in the spring and have small red fruits that attract wildlife.” Other great alternatives include American plum, hawthorn, eastern redbud and Missouri’s state tree, the flowering dogwood.\n\nMontana\n\nEnnis: Instead of only responding to 911 calls, some emergency responders in the state are working with patients in their homes to prevent unnecessary medical emergencies. Community paramedicine services can range from home check-ins between doctor visits to follow-up care with discharged hospital patients, Montana Public Radio reports. According to the state Department of Public Health and Human Services, 10 emergency medical service agencies across Montana are doing this work as part of a pilot program established by the 2019 Legislature. The state received federal funding to help set up a training program at Missoula College that could offer its first class later this year. DPHHS also plans to use a separate $5 million federal grant to expand community paramedicine services in Montana. Nicole Steeneken, who works in the state health department’s EMS and trauma section, said the new federal grant will train nearly 50 first responders in community paramedicine services. The grant will also pay for those emergency responders’ salaries for a year and half. “We’re trying to hit at least two providers within each county and then build upon that with larger organizations that might fill in the gaps,” Steeneken said. Nearly 30 EMS agencies in Montana have submitted applications to take part in the program.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts signed a law Monday that will allow the state to move forward with plans to build a canal in Colorado to divert water out of the South Platte River because of fears about its neighbor’s increased water use. Ricketts proposed the canal project to help protect Nebraska’s water rights as the population of Colorado’s Front Range increases, although Colorado officials have questioned the need for it. “Water is our most important natural resource after our people. We need to continue to manage, protect and steward it here in our state,” Ricketts said. The law will allow Nebraska to begin work on the roughly $500 million canal, but the measure includes only $53.5 million to design the project and potentially secure purchase options on land that might be used for it in the future. Officials estimate it will take eight to 10 years to complete the project, and the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources will have to return to the Legislature next year to obtain additional funding. Ricketts, a Republican, has said the South Platte River Compact agreement that was approved by Nebraska, Colorado and Congress in 1923 gives Nebraska the right to build the canal. That would give Nebraska the right to claim some of the water in late fall, winter and early spring and store it for use in drier times.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Officials who run elections are worried supply shortages could bring delays as they order the paper and envelopes needed for upcoming primary and midterm elections. The dilemma is the result of global supply chain issues coupled with an increase in demand for paper brought on by the pandemic, leaving ballot vendors worried about not getting their supply in time for the elections, the Las Vegas Sun reports. Lawmakers in Nevada, which has almost 1.8 million active registered voters, passed a law last year directing election officials to send every registered voter a mail-in ballot unless they choose to opt out. Some counties, such as Nye, are also pushing for 100% paper ballot elections. Both processes will require election officials to increase their paper supply to print ballots. The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office has known about the shortage for months and reached out to county officials to recommend they confirm with their ballot suppliers that they will get their supply in time. Joe Gloria, registrar of voters in the Las Vegas area, said he confirmed with the county’s vendors that the paper shortage would not affect Clark County in printing ballots or sample ballots for the 2022 election. The county, with more than 1.2 million active registered voters, has two different vendors, he said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Three people have pleaded guilty to wire fraud in opening accounts at financial institutions in their names or in the names of churches to allow another person to use the accounts to sell virtual currency. They pleaded guilty in federal court last week and await sentencing in July. Additional counts of wire fraud and conspiracy were dropped as part of a plea agreement. Two admitted to opening accounts in the names of the Crypto Church of NH and the Church of the Invisible Hand. The accounts were not used by churches but by Ian Freeman to trade virtual currency, prosecutors said. The third person signed blank checks and gave Freeman the login information or those accounts, they said. “Each of the defendants was aware that banks would close these accounts if the banks knew the accounts were used to operate an unlicensed virtual currency business,” the U.S. attorney’s office said in a news release Monday. Freeman and two others are scheduled for trial Nov. 1. He’s pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud, money laundering, operating a continuing financial crimes enterprise, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Freeman is a leader of the libertarian Free Keene group and hosts a radio show.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Legislation that proposes a later school start time statewide would not be ideal for all, say some educators who are advocating for the decision to be left up to local districts. Students who participate in after-school activities and sports or have part-time jobs would be at a disadvantage with the later start, some educators said, especially during the shorter days of winter. Some argue the change also won’t be ideal for those parents who have to drop off their children at school on their way to work. The bill introduced last month by Senate Education Committee Chair Vin Gopal and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin proposes requiring all New Jersey public high schools to start later in the morning to benefit students’ mental health. The bill proposes later start times, no later than 8:30 a.m, beginning with the 2024-25 academic year. Currently, most of the state’s high schools start between 7:30 a.m and 8:30 a.m. The choice should be left to individual districts and their school boards, said the New Jersey School Boards Association. Despite “well-documented research indicating that adolescents are not getting sufficient sleep for their health and well-being,” NJSBA spokesperson Janet Bamford said a potential law must deal with practical hurdles such as transportation costs and family schedules.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Organizers of a festival held on the date known for celebrating marijuana have had two permits denied by local police. The 420 Fest, scheduled for Wednesday in downtown Albuquerque, had submitted permit requests for streets to be blocked off. Melissa Thompson, New Mexico 420 Fest organizer, told KOB-TV she and her team have been communicating with the city about this since June. Police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos said the request was rejected because the department doesn’t have the manpower to block off streets in the middle of the workweek. Officers already have to shut down roads in the same area at night because of traffic around the bars. The 420 Fest has been an ongoing event for six years but was shelved during the pandemic. Thompson said thousands of people are expected to show up. While recreational cannabis is now permitted in New Mexico, attendees won’t be able to buy or consume any because they’ll be out in public. This month the state joined 17 others that have legalized recreation pot without significant legal challenges. The change came 15 years after the state first began offering medical marijuana.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A lawyer for recently resigned Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin said Monday that the Democrat has “very lively” legal issues from which to challenge corruption charges brought against him. Attorney Barry Berke told a Manhattan federal judge he expects to challenge on legal grounds the charges brought against Benjamin last week based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s skepticism toward criminal cases against politicians built solely on political contributions. In a statement issued after the hearing, Berke and defense attorney Dani James wrote: “This case is an unprecedented attempt to criminally charge an upstanding state leader for routine fundraising and support of a non-profit providing needed resources to Harlem public schools.” Benjamin’s arrest on charges alleging he promised to trade his political influence for a real estate developer’s campaign contributions created a political crisis for Gov. Kathy Hochul, seven months after she teamed up with Benjamin and pledged to restore order after ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, another Democrat, resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal. Hochul had been lieutenant governor under Cuomo. Benjamin is free on $250,000 bail after he pleaded not guilty last Tuesday following his arrest on multiple charges including bribery, fraud, conspiracy and falsification of records.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHarkers Island: A newborn wild horse will be raised as a domesticated animal after well-meaning tourists took it with them as they left a barrier island, officials at a national park said. The foal followed a group of visitors on Shackleford Banks for two hours March 26 with no other horses around, according to a Monday news release from the Cape Lookout National Seashore. When the visitors moved their boat to leave the island, the young horse tried to follow them. The park said the tourists were worried the newborn would drown, so they lifted it into their boat and left. The tourists were cited for removing the horse, and the park said it’s working with them to assist with future educational opportunities and community service projects that will benefit the banks and its horses. A stallion trying to protect its group of mares might drive them away from where a foal is sleeping, according to the national park. The stallion’s goal is to keep a mare from going back to get her offspring because he doesn’t want to lose her. The newborn might lose its harem in such cases. Dr. Sue Stuska, the park’s wildlife biologist, said in the news release that young horses will follow other horses or even people when separated from their mothers. But visitors shouldn’t come closer than 50 feet to wildlife.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: McKenzie County residents are lukewarm on federal efforts to rename a hamlet on the Montana border. A federal task force is working to replace the names of more than 660 geographic features nationwide that American Indians find derogatory. One of the features is Squaw Gap. The Bismarck Tribune reports the hamlet is little more than a community hall and an old schoolhouse. The community is named for a rock formation that was said to resemble an Indian woman carrying a child, according to the book “North Dakota Place Names” by Douglas A. Wick. McKenzie County Commission Vice Chair Kathy Skarda, who grew up in the Squaw Gap area, said her friends and family thought the renaming effort was a joke. She said she doesn’t think the name was ever meant to deride any ethnicity. People will have to live with the name change, she said, but the area will always be Squaw Gap to residents. Possible replacement names include Spring Creek, One-O-One Creek, Phillip Draw, West Fork Badlands Draw and Phillip Spring. The task force will forward recommendations to the Board on U.S. Geographic Names in the coming months. Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation Tribal Chairman Mark Fox said he supports removing the term from place names. “It really causes serious and strong emotions and resistance to that term,” Fox said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: State regulation of streams that flow temporarily after rainfall would be restricted under proposed legislation months in the works. Construction companies, the mining industry and other business groups say removing so-called ephemeral streams from regulation would make Ohio’s practice consistent with federal law. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency created a permitting system for development projects affecting ephemeral streams after the government removed them from federal oversight in 2020 and left their regulation up to states. The EPA says about 36,500 miles of the state’s 115,200 miles of primary headwater streams are ephemeral streams. Environmental groups largely oppose the legislation, saying the streams play an important role in maintaining water quality. They also question why Ohio would remove the streams from regulation at the same time it’s spending millions to improve water quality under Gov. Mike DeWine’s H2Ohio initiative. The state Senate approved the measure late last month along partisan lines. Some environmental groups softened their criticism after the Senate revised the bill to focus only on streams not already regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A former Kay County corrections officer faces up to 10 years in prison after a federal jury convicted him of excessive force and placing Black detainees in harm’s way by moving them into the same cell row as white supremacist inmates. Matthew Ware, 53, was found guilty of willfully depriving two pretrial detainees of their right to be free from a corrections officer’s deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm and of willfully depriving a third pretrial detainee of the right to be free from a corrections officer’s use of excessive force. Prosecutors said while Ware was serving as lieutenant at the Kay County Detention Center in Newkirk on May 18, 2017, he ordered lower-ranking corrections officers to move D’Angelo Wilson and Marcus Miller to a cell row housing white supremacist inmates who Ware knew posed a danger to Wilson and Miller. Ware later ordered the officers to unlock the jail cells of Wilson and Miller and the white supremacist inmates at the same time the following morning, prosecutors said. When the cells were unlocked, the white supremacist inmates attacked Wilson and Miller, causing injuries to both, including a facial laceration to Wilson that required seven stitches, prosecutors said.\n\nOregon\n\nOntario: Planned Parenthood is renting medical office space in a town on the Oregon-Idaho border. Planned Parenthood has not confirmed its plans for the space but has said it’s preparing for an influx of out-of-state patients seeking abortions in Oregon because of multiple legal challenges to abortion rights, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Earlier this year the group successfully lobbied the Oregon Legislature to set aside $15 million in an unrestricted fund for reproductive health equity. “No matter what happens, we will be there for our in-state and out-of-state neighbors and continue to meet the needs of our patients,” said Kenji Nozaki, the chief of affiliate operations at Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette. “We are prepared to support anyone who seeks their legal right to decide whether and when to become pregnant.” The office space Planned Parenthood is renting in Ontario was previously home to the Four Rivers Health Clinic, a nonprofit serving people without health insurance. Joe Recla, the group’s executive director, said Four Rivers will use the rental income to continue to support uninsured patients. A Planned Parenthood clinic in Ontario could be a significant high desert outpost for access to abortion and other reproductive health care services. The town is about an hour’s drive from Boise, Idaho.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s acting health secretary is leaving the job, and Gov. Tom Wolf said Monday that his physician general will take over leadership of the department. Wolf said Keara Klinepeter’s last day is Friday. He plans to name Dr. Denise Johnson to succeed her as acting health secretary. Klinepeter has been acting secretary since her predecessor, Alison Beam, left at the end of 2021. Klinepeter has been deeply involved in the government’s handling of COVID-19, including as special adviser to the secretary and executive deputy secretary. Johnson said she was honored to lead the Health Department during what she called a transformative time in public health. Wolf spokeswoman Beth Rementer said Johnson will also continue to serve as physician general.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: More than 70 employees at Bally’s Twin River Lincoln Casino Resort are accusing the company of violating federal and state fair labor laws by failing to pay them adequate overtime wages and systematically undercutting their weekly paychecks. Three employees sued Bally’s Twin River last month in U.S. District Court, alleging the casino was willfully and repeatedly miscalculating its pay for hourly, tipped workers. Dozens more employees who worked at Twin River in the past three years are seeking to join the class-action lawsuit. Those affected include dealers and servers and other tip-based employees. “We think there’s substantial money involved,” Chip Muller, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, said Friday. The state-operated casino is privately owned. Patti Doyle, a spokeswoman for Twin River, said the company declined to comment because the matter involves personnel and pending litigation. According to the suit, the employees worked more than 40 hours some weeks but were paid 1.5 times an hourly rate that fell below the required state minimum wage. Federal fair labor and state laws require the employer to pay an hourly rate of 1.5 times the regular rate, which cannot be lower than the state minimum wage, for any overtime hours.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHampton: Authorities are investigating a shooting at a nightclub early Sunday that wounded at least nine people. It was the second mass shooting in the state and the third in the nation during the Easter holiday weekend. No one was reported killed in the violence at Cara’s Lounge in Hampton County, roughly 80 miles west of Charleston, according to an email from South Carolina’s State Law Enforcement Division, which is investigating the shooting. A phone call to the nightclub was not answered. Gunfire had erupted Saturday at a busy mall in the state capital, Columbia, about 90 miles north of Sunday’s nightclub shooting. Nine people were shot, and five people sustained other kinds of injuries while trying to flee the scene at the Columbiana Centre, Columbia Police Chief W.H. “Skip” Holbrook said Saturday. The victims ranged in age from 15 to 73. None faced life-threatening injuries. “We don’t believe this was random,” Holbrook said. “We believe they knew each other, and something led to the gunfire.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The chief federal prosecutor in the state announced Monday that he’s retiring. U.S. Attorney Dennis Holmes spent more than 43 years as a prosecutor in South Dakota. The Custer native began his career as a prosecutor in 1978 as an intern in the Pennington County States Attorney’s Office while he was still in law school at the University of South Dakota. He went on to serve as an assistant state attorney general, rising to become chief deputy attorney general. He joined the U.S. attorney’s office in Pierre in 1988 and moved to the Sioux Falls office in 1995, where he prosecuted a wide array of cases ranging from large-scale drug conspiracies to environmental crimes. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed him as U.S. attorney for 120 days in December following U.S. Attorney Ron Parsons’ resignation.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Demolition of the largest house in the state began Monday. The teardown of the 40,000-square-foot, 86-room Villa Collina is expected to take several days. Total Demolition Services is leading the work. The extravagant structure was purchased by LView Properties LLC for $6.5 million last October, according to Knox County property records. The property will be split into three lots for University of Tennessee board of trustees Chair John Compton, Jimmy and Dee Haslam, and David and Annie Colquitt. Mike and Deane Conley were the first owners of the Italianate-style mansion and built the house in stages between 1993 and 2000. It is the largest house in Tennessee and the 84th largest in the country, according to the Villa Collina website. The mansion has eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a commercial-grade kitchen and a three-story library, among other audacious amenities. Perhaps the most jaw-dropping room is the $5 million master suite, featuring Swarovski crystal chandeliers and $200,000 doorknobs. In December, an auction that gained the interest of people from around the country was held to sell items in the home before demolition. From stained-glass panels to decorative bathroom fixtures, the auction was full of unique, luxury items.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to review the conviction of death row inmate Kristopher Love, who claimed his trial was improperly influenced by racial bias after a juror said he believed nonwhite races were more violent. No reason was given for rejecting Love’s appeal, but the court’s three liberal justices issued a dissenting opinion saying the inmate’s claim deserved closer scrutiny. “Racial bias is odious in all aspects, but especially pernicious in the administration of justice,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. The legal challenge by Love, a Black man, focused on the jury selection portion of his 2018 trial in Dallas, where a potential juror said he believed nonwhite races were “more violent races,” citing statistics seen in news reports and in criminology classes he had taken. Defense lawyers tried unsuccessfully to strike the man from Love’s jury. Sotomayor criticized the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which upheld Love’s death sentence in a unanimous ruling, finding last year that any error made at Love’s trial was harmless because the judge had given defense lawyers two extra peremptory strikes that let them reject potential jurors for any reason. Those two extra challenges, however, had already been used.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The drought-stricken state continues to see below-normal levels of snowpack, and Utah water officials said Friday that they don’t expect the annual spring runoff to provide nearly enough water to refill the state’s reservoirs. Some late-season snow provides some help, but 99% of the state remains in severe drought, according to the Utah Division of Water Resources. Some 95% of the water supplies used by state residents comes from snowmelt that flows into state reservoirs. “Utah has been in drought eight of the last 10 years, and this year’s disappointing snowpack is not going to pull the state out of drought,” said Brian Steed, executive director of the state Department of Natural Resources. “The recent snowstorms were beneficial, however, they added less than an inch of water to our snowpack.” Of the 95 measured streams, 51 are flowing below normal despite spring runoff. Eight streams are flowing at record-low conditions. The statewide snow water equivalent, or how much water would be in the snowpack if it melted, peaked at 12 inches this year, which was 75% of the typical median peak of 16 inches. Twenty-eight of Utah’s largest 45 reservoirs are below 55% of available capacity. Overall statewide storage is 58% of capacity. At this time last year, reservoirs were about 67% of capacity.\n\nVermont\n\nPawlet: The owner of an unpermitted firing range is facing jail time if he won’t allow town officials to visit the property within 30 days, a judge said Monday. The town has been working for years to get Daniel Banyai to comply with its zoning regulations and later orders from the state Environmental Court. During the remote hearing, Environmental Court Judge Thomas Durkin also told Banyai that he must sign a contract within 10 days with a surveyor to complete an assessment of the 30-acre property in West Pawlet to determine what is located there. “I will caution Mr. Banyai that if you do not abide by this interim order in any respect I will then immediately … consider any request made by the town of Pawlet to have you jailed until you comply,” Durkin said. During the three-hour hearing, Banyai’s lawyer Robert Kaplan said he only began representing Banyai last month, but he would work with town officials and his client to find an acceptable date for a site visit. Banyai bought the 30-acre property known as Slate Ridge in 2013 and sometime in 2017 began operating what he calls a firearms training facility. The property is only permitted to have a garage with an apartment. Slate Ridge neighbors have complained for some time about gunfire at the facility and what they claimed were threats and intimidation by Banyai and his supporters. Many of the neighbors of Slate Ridge are afraid to talk publicly because of fears for their safety.\n\nVirginia\n\nBedford: Local officials are citing the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for health care workers among reasons for selling a county-owned nursing home in southwestern Virginia. The Bedford County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to hold a special meeting to consider selling the nursing home. The nursing home was established as the County Poor Farm in 1831. The News & Advance reports that county officials are considering selling the facility to Roanoke-based American HealthCare LLC. County officials released a statement saying that with an increasing regulatory environment surrounding nursing homes, industry experts who specialize in health care compliance, rather than local government officials with no such expertise, are in a better position to make decisions. The statement also noted that the COVID-19 pandemic further prompted local officials to explore their options, and that the vaccine mandate for health care employees is “contrary to the positions of all board members” and has complicated uniformity in how county employees are treated.\n\nWashington\n\nRenton: After years of protest, moratoriums and delays, King County has granted approval for a proposed asphalt plant to be built on the banks of the Cedar River. The county’s Department of Local Services ruled Thursday that the project, which has been fiercely opposed by neighbors and environmental groups, “does not pose a probable significant adverse impact to the environment,” as long as the company takes mitigation measures. The decision comes six years after Lakeside Industries bought the 25-acre parcel on Highway 169 and nearly four years after Lakeside, which has a dozen asphalt plants in Western Washington, first applied to build the plant, the Seattle Times reports. The county also said an environmental impact statement – which had been requested by the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe and others – was not necessary. The site sits about 50 yards from the Cedar River, separated by a five-lane highway and bike path. A traffic study found the plant will require 460 truck trips each weekday. The site was rezoned in 2008, in a little-noticed amendment to a massive piece of mandatory legislation. It was shifted from rural, with only one home allowed every 5 acres, to industrial. Lakeside bought the site in 2016 for $9.5 million, five times its assessed value.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State residents have until close of business Tuesday to register to vote or update their registration for the May 10 primary. It is especially important for voters who have moved to a different address, changed their name or want to change political party to update registration, Secretary of State Mac Warner’s office said in a news release. Registration can be completed online at GoVoteWV.com by close of business Tuesday; by mailing a paper application to the county clerk, postmarked by Tuesday; or in person at the offices of the county clerk, secretary of state, Division of Motor Vehicles, pubic assistance, agencies serving people with disabilities and military recruiting agencies, the release said. More information on the primary election is also available at GoVoteWV.com.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway wants to spend $425,000 to design a system to filter PFAS chemicals out of a city well. The Wisconsin State Journal reports the mayor said the system would be the first in the state designed to filter the so-called forever chemicals out of drinking water. Rhodes-Conway and Alderwoman Nasra Wehelie said they’ve drafted a resolution authorizing city water officials to contract with AECOM for up to $375,000 in design and engineering services for the system. The resolution includes another $50,000 for staff time. City officials say a no-bid contract is necessary in order to submit the project for state grants in October. The money is part of $143 million the state is receiving through the infrastructure aid bill Congress passed last year. The bill provides $12.8 million in each of the next five years for projects targeting emerging contaminants in drinking water. Competition for the grants is expected to be stiff. The city’s water quality manager, Joe Grande, said the filtration likely would cost about $670,000 to install and between $136,000 and $300,000 annually to operate depending on the level of PFAS contamination allowed. The city closed Well 15 in 2009 after tests showed elevated levels of PFAS, likely stemming from the Dane County Regional Airport.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: In honor of National Donate Life Month, Donor Alliance is inviting residents to celebrate the gift of life by raising awareness for organ, eye and tissue donation at events across the state. Ranging from the upcoming Wyoming Donor Dash event – a 5K walk/run April 23 at the Tate Pumphouse in Casper – to celebrations at Driver Services and hospitals across Wyoming, there are plenty of opportunities for Wyoming residents to honor the lives of donors, celebrate the lives of recipients and raise awareness for those still waiting for a lifesaving transplant. “Wyoming continues to make an incredible impact when it comes to residents who have signed up as organ and tissue donors,” said Jennifer Prinz, president and CEO of Donor Alliance. “As we honor National Donate Life Month in Wyoming, we’re aiming to grow awareness and support of the generous gift of organ and tissue donation.” In honor of Blue and Green Day on Friday, twenty-one of the state’s Driver Services offices in addition to hospitals across Wyoming are honoring the day with celebrations and office decorations. Residents are encouraged to join the celebration by dressing in blue and green to raise awareness for organ, eye and tissue donation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/22/sequoia-toll-daffodil-project-ferret-release-news-around-states/49419721/", "title": "Sequoia toll, Daffodil Project: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A television station has donated thousands of items including historic footage from the civil rights era to the Alabama Department of Archives and History, which will make the material available to the public. WSFA-TV in Montgomery announced it had given the agency materials dating to the 1950s, including footage from news conferences by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., coverage of the Freedom Riders in 1961 and original film from the “Stand in the School House Door” by then-Gov. George C. Wallace in 1963. The video also includes scenes from a visit to the NASA center in Huntsville by the President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson in 1962 and special reports on the death of former University of Alabama football coach Paul “Bear” Bryant in 1983. As the TV station was planning to switch locations, managers determined it wasn’t practical to move the large numbers of delicate film reels and boxes full of video and other items. Steve Murray, the state archives director, said archivists had long suspected the WSFA studios held valuable content for historical preservation, and his department jumped at the opportunity to add to its collection when a phone call came in late 2019.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Members of the Biden administration have launched a series of events aimed at exploring the Arctic’s potential to act as a “living laboratory of clean energy innovation.” Officials participating in the online event, billed as “ArcticX,” spoke of the challenges faced by remote communities in Alaska’s Arctic region, such as high energy costs and impacts from climate change. During the event’s broad discussions, they said they see opportunities for sustainable or renewable energy systems. Wednesday’s meeting was the first of four planned online events, with an in-person gathering set for May in Alaska. Among the speakers was U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Offices that fall under the department co-hosted the event. “We hope to combine the world-class expertise of our national labs, of our 17 national labs, with the know-how that Arctic communities have developed over centuries of innovation in the far north so together we can get new technologies out of the lab and into the field and onto the market and support communities in taking control of their own clean energy future,” Granholm said. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, renewable sources accounted for about 30% of Alaska’s electricity generation in 2019. Many rural communities rely largely on diesel electric generators for power.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s Motor Vehicle Division failed to notify more than 34,000 drivers that their licenses had been suspended, revoked or canceled and also lagged for months in alerting prosecutors. The MVD notified county attorney’s offices around the state of the problem Wednesday, saying in an email that notices weren’t mailed “beginning in late 2020 and ending in March.” A glitch with the agency’s mailing process was the cause. “When MVD discovered this issue in February 2021, the first step was to understand what caused the problem, the extent of customers affected and how to resolve the problem,” MVD spokesman Doug Parcey said in an email. “Once those were known, the affected customers were immediately notified.” Some prosecutors learned about the issue from defense attorneys. Potentially thousands of drivers might have been arrested and prosecuted or paid hefty fines because they unknowingly drove with a suspended license. Prosecutors in Maricopa and Pinal counties have already flagged more than 1,000 cases. Municipal and justice courts will also have to review cases involving suspended licenses. “Our first priority is to look at convictions,” said Rachel Mitchell, acting division chief of the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office. “We are focusing on prison. … It is certainly scary for me as a prosecutor.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State lawmakers on Friday delayed a vote on whether to allow state-run health care facilities to require employees to get COVID-19 vaccines – a move officials say is needed to protect millions of dollars in federal funding. The Arkansas Legislative Council voted to delay considering the requests by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the Department of Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs for an exemption from a state law banning vaccine requirements by government entities. The law conflicts with a federal COVID-19 vaccine requirement for health care workers issued by President Joe Biden’s administration that’s set to take effect in January. A group of Republican-led states, including Arkansas, have asked a federal judge to block its enforcement. UAMS could lose $600 million in Medicare and Medicaid funding and another $100 million in federal contracts if it doesn’t comply with the federal rule, Chancellor Dr. Cam Patterson told the panel. Patterson said the exemption was needed to ensure that the university’s workers are in compliance with the federal requirement and that funding isn’t threatened. The panel did not set a date for considering the exemptions. But legislative leaders said they hoped to meet before Dec. 5.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Lightning-sparked wildfires killed thousands of giant sequoias this year, leading to a staggering two-year death toll that accounts for up to nearly a fifth of Earth’s largest trees, officials said Friday. Fires in Sequoia National Park and surrounding Sequoia National Forest tore through more than a third of groves in California and torched an estimated 2,261 to 3,637 sequoias, which are the largest trees by volume. Nearby wildfires last year killed an unprecedented 7,500 to 10,400 giant sequoias that are only native in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range. Losses now account for 13% to 19% of the 75,000 sequoias greater than 4 feet in diameter. Blazes so intense to burn hot enough and high enough to kill so many giant sequoias – trees once considered nearly fireproof – put an exclamation point on climate change’s impact. A warming planet that has created hotter droughts combined with a century of fire suppression that choked forests with thick undergrowth have fueled flames that have sounded the death knell for trees dating to ancient civilizations. “The sobering reality is that we have seen another huge loss within a finite population of these iconic trees that are irreplaceable in many lifetimes,” said Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Denver suburb of Aurora has agreed to pay $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the parents of Elijah McClain, a Black man who died after police stopped him on the street and put him in a neck hold two years ago, the city and family attorneys announced Friday. A federal magistrate judge accepted terms of the settlement after a mediation session, said Qusair Mohamedbhai, an attorney for McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain. Outside court, Sheneen McClain said she was glad to have the agreement finalized but noted the work of fighting for justice for her son just makes her miss him more. “The money is just the world’s way of saying, ‘We’re sorry,’ but it’s not going to help me heal the hole in my heart,” she said. The settlement amount was agreed to in July but not officially disclosed until now because of a dispute between McClain’s parents about how the wording of the agreement could affect their dispute over how the money should be divided. Sheneen McClain said Elijah’s father, LaWayne Mosley, was not involved in raising him. How the money will be divided will be addressed separately. In a statement, Mosley did not address the dispute but said he hoped the settlement would send a message to police. “I hope Elijah’s legacy is that police will think twice before killing another innocent person,” he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nPlymouth: Officials believe nearly 40 drug overdoses across the state since July may be linked to marijuana laced with the powerful opioid fentanyl and are warning the public about the potential danger. State health officials said marijuana seized in Plymouth after an overdose in early October tested positive for fentanyl at the state crime lab. “This is the first lab confirmed case of marijuana with fentanyl in Connecticut and possibly the first confirmed case in the United States,” Dr. Manisha Juthani, the state’s public health commissioner, said in a statement Thursday. Officials had been investigating reports of people across Connecticut who overdosed and were revived with naloxone but denied using opioids. They told authorities they only smoked marijuana. There were 11 such overdoses in July, nine in August, nine in September and 10 from Oct. 1 to Oct. 26. No deaths were reported. Brian Foley, an aide to state public safety Commissioner James Rovella, said the state crime lab will now be testing all marijuana that police submit for fentanyl. An estimated 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in a recent one-year period – a never-before-seen milestone that health officials say is tied to the COVID-19 pandemic and a more dangerous drug supply.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: In October, as the state allocated $78 million in federal money to health care facilities struggling with staffing shortages, hospitals received $25million total – only about one-third of what they requested. Health care workers, who have been fighting the coronavirus for nearly two years, have said they’re burned out and exhausted. Some chose to leave the hospital bedside or the profession entirely. Others declined financial incentives of several hundred dollars offered to fill shifts, citing mental health reasons. Many are jumping ship to other hospitals in Delaware or the Philadelphia area because health systems are providing hefty signing bonuses and significant increases in pay. Hospitals are also relying on travel nurses, who work in three-month shifts, to fill the gaps. Travel nurses can make twice as much or more what permanent hospital nurses take home in pay. ChristianaCare requested $40 million in federal aid, according to documents provided by the governor’s office. Instead, the state’s largest hospital and private employer received $12 million, the biggest sum any health system received. ChristianaCare, like others, continues to offer $10,000 signing bonuses for a number of open nursing positions.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser’s decision to ease mask requirements in the nation’s capital has sparked a public debate about timing, with the majority of the D.C. Council pleading with her to reconsider. It’s a localized debate that reflects a broader national dynamic in the country’s coronavirus-mitigation stance, with some leaders and businesses pushing for more normalcy after the successful reopening of schools and others preaching caution against reckless pre-winter moves. Starting Monday, masks will no longer be required in many indoor spaces in D.C. They must still be worn in multiple settings, including schools, libraries, public transportation, ride-share vehicles, and group-living facilities like nursing homes, dorms and jails. Private businesses will still be able to require customers to wear masks. Bowser has cautiously hailed the step as a “shift in where we are with the pandemic,” saying the return of the mask mandate earlier this year helped blunt the late-summer surge of the delta variant. The nation’s capital originally lifted its indoor mask requirement for fully vaccinated individuals in May but reinstated it in late July as cases began to rise again. According to D.C. Health Department statistics, the current seven-day average of new cases is higher than it was in May but still well below the late-summer delta-variant peak.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed work on a $339 million Everglades restoration project aimed at cleansing water runoff before it flows into a troubled river. Corps and local officials held a ceremony Friday for the 12,000-acre project in Martin County known officially as the C-44 Reservoir and Stormwater Treatment Area. It’s a key part of a broader effort to restore the vast Florida Everglades. The reservoir will capture, store and clean fertilizer-laden runoff from farms and development before it is routed into the St. Lucie River and ultimately the Indian River Lagoon. Both have been plagued by harmful algae blooms and other long-term problems associated with water pollution that threatens wildlife and human health. “I think it’s huge” for the east coast, said Chauncey Goss, chair of the South Florida Water Management District. “Not only symbolically, but it’s also going to be taking water, cleaning it up and helping to get rid of some of these discharges, which is really the goal of all of this.” The project can store 19.7 billion gallons of water, according to state water managers. It will use plants such as cattails to suck up about 35 metric tons of phosphorus every year before the water makes its way into the St. Lucie River.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCumming: Leaders with Forsyth County Schools, Congregation Beth Israel and the OneForsyth Council have planted 500 daffodil bulbs outside the school district’s new Forsyth County Arts and Learning Center as part of the Daffodil Project, a worldwide initiative aiming to plant the flowers all over in honor of each of the 1.5 million children who died during the Holocaust. Thanks to the partnership, Forsyth County will now be home to 500 of those daffodils, which will bloom in the spring on Holocaust Remembrance Day. FCS Superintendent Dr. Jeff Bearden, Rabbi Levi Mentz with Congregation Beth Israel and OneForsyth Council Chair Kristin Cook all gave opening remarks at a Nov. 8 ceremony before county and school district leaders began planting each of the bulbs. Cook said she was proud to be there, speaking on behalf of OneForsyth, the Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce’s diversity initiative, and modeling their guiding principles of uniting, celebrating and promoting inclusion in the county. “Our hope is that, by continuing to support events like these, we will all grow to appreciate the unique identities that embody us all,” Cook said. Metz said he was overjoyed to see the project coming to Forsyth County, his involvement feeling personal to him and his family since his grandfather was a survivor of the Holocaust.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is considering additional protections for waters off the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. NOAA announced the proposal to designate oceanic areas of Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, which is already one of the largest protected natural areas in the world, as a national marine sanctuary on Friday. The agency opened the plan to public comment through January. The designation would build on existing protections meant to maintain marine habitats and wildlife. The new rules would apply only to oceanic areas, not the islands that are already part of the monument. “Papahānaumokuākea’s ecosystems are increasingly under pressure from threats such as marine debris, invasive species, and climate change,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement. NOAA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the state of Hawaii and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs currently co-manage the monument. Papahānaumokuākea is larger than all other U.S. national parks combined and is home to endangered Hawaiian monk seals, green sea turtles, seabirds and extensive coral reef ecosystems. The area is home to many species found nowhere else on Earth.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: If anyone has a good idea on how to put a nuclear fission power plant on the moon, the U.S. government wants to hear about it. NASA and the nation’s top federal nuclear research lab on Friday put out a request for proposals for a fission surface power system. NASA is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory to establish a sun-independent power source for missions to the moon by the end of the decade. “Providing a reliable, high-power system on the moon is a vital next step in human space exploration, and achieving it is within our grasp,” Sebastian Corbisiero, the Fission Surface Power Project lead at the lab, said in a statement. If the effort is successful in supporting a sustained human presence on the moon, the next objective would be Mars. NASA says fission surface power could provide sustained, abundant power no matter the environmental conditions on the moon or Mars. “I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,” Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement. The reactor would be built on Earth and then sent to the moon.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new store at the Illinois State Museum will feature products from the state, along with themed souvenirs, specialty foods and toys. The Shop opened to the public Saturday. Families were invited to attend an opening event in their flannel and fleece pajamas. The store is located in the first floor of the Illinois State Museum, which owns and operates the Shop to fund programs and research. Cinnamon Catlin-Legutko, the museum’s director, called the opening an important moment in the museum’s return to operations. Former Gov. Bruce Rauner’s administration shut down the museum in 2015 during an ongoing budget impasse. It reopened the following year but since then has seen closures related to the coronavirus pandemic. The museum was established in 1877 and has branch facilities in Lewistown and Lockport.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A renewed push for the state to join more than two-thirds of states with some form of legalized marijuana use appears to face the same roadblock from Statehouse Republicans who have opposed such a step for many years. Legislative Democrats and the state Democratic Party united last week in urging approval of marijuana legalization during the legislative session that starts in January, arguing that it could benefit those wanting to use it for medical purposes, create new jobs and become an additional state tax revenue source. The Republican-dominated Legislature has not taken any action on bills submitted over the past decade for allowing medical marijuana or removing criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of the drug, even as recreational marijuana sales have won approval in Michigan and Illinois and as medical use is allowed in Ohio. Legalization advocates haven’t yet changed the minds of legislative leaders, who reject arguments that Indiana is losing money to neighboring states and point to pot still being illegal under federal law. “I think when you make the argument about having that substantial a public policy change just because you’re trying to chase dollars makes no sense to me, so I’m in the same place I’ve been,” Republican House Speaker Todd Huston said.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: A city park will now be named Ioway Creek Park to align with the creek’s name change earlier this year. The Ames City Council voted unanimously last week to change the name of Squaw Creek Park to Ioway Creek Park. In February, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names changed the name of Squaw Creek, a 42-mile-long tributary of the South Skunk River, to Ioway Creek, as the original name is considered derogatory to Native Americans. The Ames Tribune reports that an Indigenous teen, Fawn Stubben, pushed for the change in the 1990s, but the proposal wasn’t considered until Ames resident Jasmine Martin applied to the federal board in 2019. The Ames City Council and Story County Board of Supervisors both voted in support of the change. The current name honors the Ioway, an Indigenous tribe that once lived in parts of Iowa. Creek sign names have since been adjusted around Ames, but there were still remnants of the former name, including Squaw Creek Drive. The street was renamed Stonehaven Drive as part of the meeting’s consent agenda. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on Friday formally declared “squaw” a derogatory term and said she is taking steps to remove it from federal government use and to replace other derogatory place names.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Next year, the state will start requiring employers, individuals and health insurance companies to pay some costs associated with coronavirus testing. The state Department of Health and Environment announced Friday that it will start phasing out free screening tests for people who aren’t showing COVID-19 symptoms or haven’t potentially been exposed. The agency said it expects the policy to begin in March 2022. The department said it can’t sustain having public health agencies cover the cost of all testing indefinitely. The agency said it initially allocated $141 million in federal funds to make coronavirus tests available and support commercial and university labs to expand processing and sampling capacity. But the department said infections from the delta variant depleted the funds faster than expected. “Testing has become an increasingly important way in which those who choose to be unvaccinated may still be able to work, attend events, and travel,” Ashley Goss, the department’s acting secretary, said in a statement. The changes will mainly affect programs used by employers to test 10% of their workers on a regular basis and programs by community organizations to offer free rapid tests.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The city has received a perfect 100 score from the Human Rights Campaign, a national civil rights organization, for its laws, policies, services and programs to protect and support lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. The city received a total score of 106 for additional steps it has taken over the past few years to benefit the LGBTQ community. It’s the highest ranking of any city in Kentucky, though Louisville has received a perfect score for several years. A 100 is considered a perfect score, but cities can earn up to 122 additional points for programs and services. “We’ve worked hard to create an atmosphere welcoming all people,” Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton said. “That hard work has resulted in the highest score received by a Kentucky city.” It’s the first time since the rankings began eight years ago that Lexington has earned a perfect score. In 2020, it received a 95 out of 100. Lexington received high marks despite Kentucky not having a statewide LGBTQ nondiscrimination law. The Human Rights Campaign evaluated more than 506 cities across the country. Other evaluated Kentucky cities include Berea, Bowling Green, Covington, Frankfort, Morehead and Owensboro. Covington’s score was 96. The lowest-scoring Kentucky city was Owensboro with 18.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State lawmakers on Friday lambasted Louisiana’s temporary housing program enacted after Hurricane Ida, saying it continues to move too slowly to help people living in damaged homes and tents since late August. “We’re moving at a snail’s pace. It’s just unbelievable,” said Sen. Mike Fesi, a Houma Republican who represents Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes, which were among the hardest hit by Ida. The state has spent $90 million in federal disaster aid on more than 2,000 trailers to provide temporary shelter to residents in southeastern Louisiana. Half have been placed on residents’ properties and other community housing sites, and 653 families have moved into the trailers so far, the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness told lawmakers. The program has received near-constant criticism about the time it’s taking to place trailers since Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration launched the Hurricane Ida Sheltering Program on Oct. 4. That critique spilled over into Friday’s meeting of the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget, as the homeland security agency asked lawmakers to approve $500 million in authority to spend federal disaster recovery aid. Director Casey Tingle defended the housing program, telling lawmakers: “We have a brand new program that’s never been done before.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The developer of a $1 billion electric transmission line is suspending construction at the request of the governor after she certified election results Friday in which residents firmly opposed the project. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills had urged New England Clean Energy Connect Transmission LLC to stop construction on the 145-mile project until legal challenges are resolved. Thorn Dickinson, president and CEO of NECEC, said work will be temporarily halted until a judge rules on a request for a preliminary injunction in its lawsuit contending the referendum was unconstitutional. “This was not an easy decision. Suspending construction will require the layoff of more than 400 Mainers just as the holiday season begins,” Dickinson said in a statement Friday evening. Mills supports the project but said she also supports “the rule of law that governs our society and the will of the people that informs it.” Funded by Massachusetts ratepayers, the project would supply up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to the New England power grid. That’s enough electricity for 1 million homes. Critics said the project is damaging the woods and changing the character of a part of western Maine with little if any benefit for its residents.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: With sailboats taking over Carroll Creek, a unique holiday tradition has returned to downtown Frederick for its sixth year. About two dozen sailboats were launched in the creek Saturday as part of the annual Sailing Through the Winter Solstice project. Volunteers rushed about Saturday morning, lowering the boats off the banks of the creek into the water. Some volunteers had the unenviable task of wading through the water on the chilly November morning to ensure the boats were anchored in place. Peter Kremers, who co-founded and serves as the chair of the event, said there were about 25 sailboats in and around the creek this year. Now in its sixth year, the project has quickly grown into a beloved part of the holiday season in the city. This year’s event has more sailboats than ever. “We started with one boat in ’16,” Kremers said of the project’s speedy growth. “I think last year we had maybe 19 in the water; this year we have 22 boats in the water and three on land.” The sailboats will stay on Carroll Creek until March, each fitted with lights and decorations to brighten up the dark nights of winter. But the goal isn’t just to make the downtown look nice. The project also helps raise a significant amount of money for a number of local charities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A 48-foot white spruce chosen as the city’s Christmas tree has arrived from Nova Scotia as part of a decades-old tradition. This year’s tree was donated by L’Arche Cape Breton, a nonprofit that provides homes and work for people with disabilities. The 60-year-old tree was on the nonprofit’s property on Canada’s Cape Breton Island. A police escort brought the tree to Boston Common on Thursday, WCVB-TV reports. Nova Scotia donates a tree to Boston every year as a token of gratitude for relief efforts by Bostonians after a munitions ship exploded in Halifax Harbor in 1917, killing or injuring thousands of people. It will be lit Dec. 2. For Massachusetts residents buying a Christmas tree locally, finding the perfect one may prove difficult this year. Tree sellers are expecting one of their busiest and most challenging seasons yet, The Boston Globe reports. Last year, with many people cooped up at home during the pandemic, everyone wanted a tree – sometimes more than one, the National Christmas Tree Association said. Many local Christmas tree farms cut and sold trees they normally would have left in the ground. That means some sellers this year have fewer, shorter trees.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Pure Michigan is marketing the state’s upcoming winter season in an advertising campaign running in key regional and state markets. The Still Pure Michigan campaign is expected to run through the end of February and use broadcast and connected television, online video and digital ads, and social media, the Michigan Economic Development Corp. said. Much of the focus of the tourism and marketing campaign will be on travel and shopping. Advertising spots will run in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Lansing, Flint, Saginaw, Bay City, Traverse City, Cadillac, Marquette and Alpena. They also will be seen in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Kentucky. This year’s total winter advertising budget tops $3 million. The launch of the Pure Michigan campaign comes just ahead of the opening of many of Michigan’s ski resorts for the year, according to the MEDC. “As winter approaches, adventure awaits us in the form of downhill skiing, fat-tire biking or snowshoeing epic backcountry landscapes,” Travel Michigan Vice President Dave Lorenz said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Farmers across the state who grow about 45 million turkeys annually will benefit from higher prices this year, according to agriculture experts. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture said the price of turkeys has steadily increased as demand has risen following a year when there were fewer family gatherings, and restaurant traffic was down due to the coronavirus pandemic. “USDA is actually predicting this year to be a record-high price for turkeys,” said Tim Petry, a livestock marketing economist with the North Dakota State University Extension Service. “From a price standpoint, these are the best prices they’ve seen for a number of years. So, you know, that’s good news for producers.” The good news on prices is tempered somewhat by rising costs to raise the birds on more than 500 farms in the state, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Higher prices for corn and soybeans to feed the turkeys are cutting into profits, growers said. “Those are our two biggest ingredients, and and those prices were substantially higher than last year or past years,” said Jessica Westbrock, the president of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. While turkey prices are up 17 cents a pound from last year, Petry said consumers are still likely to find bargains, as many stores sell turkeys below cost.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi School Boards Association is joining a handful of other states in breaking ties with the National School Board Association after the nonprofit sent a letter to President Joe Biden asking for federal support investigating harassment and threats of violence against school board members. Mississippi School Boards’ leadership wrote this week in a letter explaining the decision that the National School Boards Association’s “inflammatory language and the request for federal agencies to intervene in our communities, was just one in a series of lapses in governance.” It said Mississippi will end its relationship with the nonprofit NSBA on June 30, 2022, the end of the term for which the Mississippi School Boards Association has paid its dues to the national organization. Mississippi will then work with school board associations in other states to form a new organization that “will provide services to its member state school boards associations which are requested by and tailored to each member state school boards associations’ unique needs.” Local school boards across the country have become political battlegrounds over issues such as COVID-19-related mask rules, the treatment of transgender students, and how to teach the history of racism and slavery in America.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A couple who gained fame after waving guns at protesters near their home in 2020 are seeking to keep their law licenses by arguing their actions were justified because they were defending their property from a violent and threatening mob. Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who are both lawyers, made that claim in response to a complaint asking the Missouri Supreme Court to suspend their licenses. The demonstrators went past the McCloskeys’ home June 28, 2020, at the height of racial injustice protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. The couple, who were eating dinner on the patio with their daughter, responded by waving two weapons at the protesters. No shots were fired, and no one was hurt. Their actions gained praise from conservatives, including then-President Donald Trump. Mark McCloskey is now a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate. They contend in their legal response that the demonstrations “involved significant unlawful and violent conduct,” KCUR reports. The response cites a report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association finding nearly 89% of protests in St. Louis in June 2020 involved unlawful activity, and 11% involved some level of violence. Still, special prosecutor Richard Callahan has said his investigation determined the protesters near the McCloskeys’ home were peaceful.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The Biden administration on Friday said it will consider new measures to protect greater sage grouse, a bird species once found across much of the West that has suffered drastic declines in recent decades due to oil and gas drilling, grazing, wildfires and other pressures. The announcement of a range-wide evaluation of habitat plans for greater sage grouse came after the Trump administration tried to scale back conservation efforts adopted when Biden was vice president in 2015. A federal court blocked Trump’s changes. But Biden administration officials said the attempt set back conservation efforts – even as the chicken-sized bird’s habitat was further ravaged by wildfires, invasive plants and continued development. U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., said he believed Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning – a former aide to the lawmaker – would pursue a collaborative, balanced approach that will keep sage grouse from becoming an endangered species. But Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines criticized the action, saying states should be given deference to manage wildlife and federal lands kept open for energy exploration and grazing. Daines said state and local conservation efforts needs to be protected from “federal overreach,” while Brooke Stroyke, a spokesperson for Gianforte, said Montana already has a plan that balances conservation and rural economies.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s unemployment rate fell to a mere 1.9% last month – the lowest any state has reached since data collection began in 1976, according to labor statistics released Friday. The October rate reported by Nebraska’s labor department and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics marked the first time any state’s unemployment rate dropped below 2%. Spokespeople for both agencies confirmed that Nebraska’s rate is the country’s lowest on record. Nebraska has maintained its status as the state with the lowest rate through much of the pandemic. Its 1.9% rate for October was down slightly from the September rate of 2%. Nebraska Labor Commissioner John Albin said total nonfarm employment has risen by more than 30,000 from October of last year. The state reported 1,031,001 filled jobs in October, which was 10,718 more than the previous month. Nebraska has struggled with a chronic worker shortage since even before the pandemic, and it has driven up wages and made it difficult for employers to hire and expand. Earlier this month, the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry released a survey of its members in which 92% said finding skilled workers was a top priority.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A big southern Nevada sewage pumping facility failed last year, spewing an estimated 500,000 gallons of wastewater and leaking into a creek that leads toward the Lake Mead reservoir on the Colorado River, a television station investigation found. Officials want to spend $40 million to rehabilitate the Clark County Water Reclamation District wastewater lift station, where the January 2020 spill was blamed on a corroded underground pipe, KLAS-TV in Las Vegas reports. Most of the spilled sewage was vacuumed up from land outside the Whitney Lift Station, KLAS-TV reports, citing documents, photos and emails obtained with a public records request. But an estimated 10,000 gallons – about enough water to fill an average kidney-shaped backyard swimming pool – went into a nearby creek that feeds the Las Vegas Wash. The wash flows to Lake Mead, the drought-stricken reservoir that provides about 90% of the Las Vegas-area drinking water supply. The Whitney Lift Station is one of 24 similar facilities operated by the reclamation district, which was formed in 1956 to reclaim wastewater from unincorporated Clark County, the largest jurisdiction in the Las Vegas area. The district treats nearly 106 million gallons of wastewater per day, according to its website.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State lawmakers accepted $22.5 million in federal COVID-19 vaccine funding Friday that has sparked intense debate and angry protests for the past two months. The Joint Fiscal Committee had tabled a request from the Department of Health and Human Service in September to spend the money to hire new workers to promote the vaccines and help providers comply with the state’s new vaccine registry system. Meanwhile, the Executive Council, which approves state contracts, initially rejected the money before reversing course earlier this month. On Friday, three Republicans joined the committee’s three Democrats in voting to accept the money. Four Republicans voted no, with some citing concerns that language in the grant would require the state to follow future federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19. “The action we take today will be historic,” said Sen. Bob Giuda, R-Warren. “It will be historic because we will either reject the notion of subservience to government coercion, or it will be historic because we accede to that notion and violate the most fundamental premises of freedom upon which our state and nation were founded and which are imperiled as never before in our nation’s history.” Giuda predicted the vote would become a campaign issue next year. At least one audience member agreed, shouting at Sen. Chuck Morse, R-Salem: “Treason! You will never get elected again, Morse! You’re done!”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The decades­long odyssey to find the remains of Jimmy Hoffa, a tenacious leader of the Teamsters union, apparently has turned to land next to a former landfill that sits below an elevated highway in the Garden State. The FBI obtained a search warrant to “conduct a site survey underneath the Pulaski Skyway” last month, said Mara Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Detroit field office. She didn’t indicate whether anything was removed. The FBI’s disclosure is another turn in a mystery that has gripped law enforcement for more than 45 years. Hoffa was last seen July 30, 1975, when he was to meet with reputed Detroit mob enforcer Anthony “Tony Jack” Giacalone and alleged New Jersey mob figure Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano at a restaurant in suburban Detroit. The focus now is in Jersey City, below a four-lane bridge where the sound of cars and trucks doesn’t stop. Wild overgrown brush thrives in the gritty industrial area, and green dumpsters abound. No one nearby at Interstate Waste Services offered a comment. “I’ve been assured that the body hasn’t been dug up yet,” journalist Dan Moldea said, referring to the FBI’s work in October.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Internet problems continue to slow down many students in the state, but a pilot project using TV signals to transmit computer files may help. On Thursday, state public education officials distributed devices to eight families in Taos that allow schools to send them digital files via television. The boxes the size of a deck of cards allow digital television receivers to connect with computers using technology called datacasting. Many rural areas of New Mexico are too far from internet infrastructure such as fiber cables and cell towers but do get TV reception. In October, local broadcasting affiliates of New Mexico PBS finished testing the technology to make sure they could set aside bandwidth not taken up by TV show broadcasts and dedicate it to broadcast downloadable digital files. The pilot program in Taos relies on a broadcast from northern New Mexico PBS affiliate KNME, while two others are planning to roll out pilot programs in the cities of Silver City and Portales. Remote learning during the pandemic highlighted the digital divide for New Mexico students, many of whom had to learn using paper packets while their peers could participate in virtual lessons via video chat.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The New York Assembly’s investigation into former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s conduct in office concluded the Democrat’s administration misrepresented how many nursing home residents died of COVID-19, according to a lawmaker who reviewed the committee’s still-secret report. Assembly Member Phil Steck was among the Assembly Judiciary Committee members who were able to review a copy of the approximately 45-page report Thursday and Friday in advance of its public release, possibly as soon as this week. The report, compiled by the New York City law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, covers a wide array of allegations of misconduct by Cuomo, including sexual harassment claims and the participation of his staff in writing his book on the coronavirus pandemic. Other topics include the Cuomo administration’s manipulation of data on COVID-19 deaths as presented to the public. Gaps in the state’s statistical accounting of fatalities include the administration’s decision to exclude from its nursing home death totals thousands of patients who died after being transferred to hospitals. The Davis Polk investigators confirmed press reports that the state Department of Health wanted to include those hospital deaths in the state’s nursing home fatality count.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A bear cub wandering around a neighborhood with a jug stuck on its head is running free in the forest again thanks to wildlife biologists and some observant residents. Wildlife biologists with the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission spent two days searching for the bear cub, according to a news release. The commission said the bear likely got stuck while going through some trash and was wandering around an Asheville neighborhood. District Biologist Justin McVey got the initial report about the bear Monday night. Commission officials reached out to the public to help identify its location. McVey said a combination of responses to a message posted to NextDoor by the commission and direct calls to biologists, local residents led personnel directly to the bear cub. The bear was anesthetized before the jug was taken off its head. Biologists performed a health check before relocating it to a remote area in western North Carolina.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMedora: The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library has agreed to take a controversial equestrian statue of the 26th president that has stood on the steps of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City since 1940. The bronze statue, designed by James Earle Fraser, was commissioned by the Board of Trustees of the New York State Roosevelt Memorial in 1929. The library opening next year in Medora will be getting it as a long-term loan. The statue, which depicts the former president on horseback with a Native American man and an African man flanking the horse, has been the subject of years of criticism that it symbolizes colonial subjugation and racial discrimination. Objections grew more forceful after the death of George Floyd sparked a racial reckoning and a wave of protests across the U.S. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to remove the statue in 2020, calling it “problematic,” which drew an angry response from President Donald Trump, who tweeted: “Ridiculous, don’t do it!” With the support of members of the Roosevelt family, the North Dakota library will establish an advisory council composed of representatives of Indigenous and Black communities, historians, scholars and artists to “guide the recontextualization” of the statue.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law a map of new congressional districts Saturday that will be in effect for the next four years, despite objections from Democrats and voting rights groups. DeWine said in a statement that, compared with other proposals from House and Senate lawmakers from both parties, the Senate legislation he signed “makes the most progress to produce a fair, compact, and competitive map.” The redistricting measure cleared the Legislature along party lines with House approval Thursday after a breakneck sprint through both chambers, amid praise from majority Republicans. Democrats blasted the Republican-led mapmaking process as unfair, partisan and cloaked in secrecy. The Senate approved the bill Tuesday, only about 16 hours after the new map was released. The nonpartisan Princeton Gerrymandering Project gave the map an F grade. The new law creates at most three safe Democratic districts out of 15 new U.S. House seats in a state where voters are split roughly 54% Republican, 46% Democratic. Populous Cuyahoga and Hamilton counties – home to Cleveland and Cincinnati, respectively – are divided three ways each. Franklin County, home to Columbus, is divided two ways, and the western Cleveland suburbs in Lorain County are part of a district that stretches to the Indiana border, a nearly 3-hour drive.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s building code commission has undermined the efforts of its own committee tasked with reviewing energy conservation standards by shooting down proposed changes and completing a takeover of the committee itself. Last week’s actions leave green building in Oklahoma a dozen years behind, stuck in 2009, standing pat with current minimum standards, said Kelly Parker, chairman of the committee whose months of work was spurned. The committee started its work in May as part of a state-mandated code review every six years to update the state’s modified versions of various building codes. But committee members had not seen the commission’s recommendations on energy conservation until they were presented Tuesday. Commission Chairman Cary Williamson, Ardmore’s fire chief, wondered why and argued that the energy committee, effectively shut down in October, should have been allowed to do its job. Commissioner Kyle Lombardo, an architect with Rees Associates, complained that he was not given time to review the complex, technical recommendations, which will go to state lawmakers next year. The Oklahoma Uniform Building Code Commission further eroded efforts to make home construction in the state more environmentally friendly, Parker said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A man who was protesting outside the city’s federal courthouse when a federal law enforcement officer shot him in the face with a “less lethal” impact munition is suing in federal court. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the lawsuit filed by Donavan LaBella calls the unnamed officer’s actions “unprovoked, unjustifiable, and unlawful.” LaBella’s injury July 11, 2020, was captured on video and shared widely. The video depicts then-26-year-old LaBella holding a speaker over his head, pointed at the courthouse. Federal officers turn on a bright light, and then an officer fires a less lethal munition striking LaBella. Like other protesters who have tried suing federal law enforcement agencies over injuries at protests for racial justice, LaBella’s attorneys have struggled to identify the officers. The lawsuit names “John Does 1-10″ as unknown federal law enforcement officers, believed to be with the U.S. Marshals Service, present or responsible for shooting LaBella. Desiree LaBella, Donavan’s mother, said the people responsible for injuring her son need to be held accountable. “As much as we wish it didn’t have to come to this, he’s irreparably damaged,” she said. He now suffers from a debilitating, permanent frontal lobe brain injury that has negatively altered the course of (his) life,” the lawsuit says.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Frozen vials labeled “Smallpox” that were discovered in a freezer at a vaccine research facility in the state “contain no trace of virus known to cause smallpox,” federal health officials said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that testing showed the vials contain “vaccinia, the virus used in smallpox vaccine,” and not the variola virus, which causes smallpox. The CDC had said Monday that the vials “were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker” who was wearing gloves and a face mask while cleaning out the freezer. The CDC said no one was exposed to the contents. Mark O’Neill, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, told the New York Times that the vials were found at a Merck facility in Montgomery County. It was not clear why the vials were in the freezer. The CDC said it was “in close contact with state and local health officials, law enforcement, and the World Health Organization” about the findings. Smallpox is a deadly, infectious disease that plagued the world for centuries and killed nearly a third of the people it infected. Victims suffered scorching fever and body aches, followed by spots and blisters that would leave survivors with pitted scars.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority is getting a $900,000 federal boost to develop plans for a high-capacity transit corridor to connect Central Falls to Warwick via Providence, according to the state’s congressional delegation. The corridor was one of five goals included in RIPTA’s Transit Master Plan for the next 20 years. The planning grant could enable RIPTA to complete the preliminary work needed to eventually bring a bus rapid transit or light rail project to the region. The $900,000 planning grant is made available through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity grant program, for capital investments in surface transportation that will have a significant impact on or directly benefit areas of persistent poverty. The state’s congressional delegation and RIPTA CEO Scott Avedisian have scheduled a news conference for Monday at the agency’s Chafee Transportation Center in Providence to discuss the study and its potential impacts.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSeneca: One of the most wanted fugitives in the United States apparently died about four months ago in a South Carolina home about 16 years after he was first wanted in San Diego for sexually assaulting children, investigators said. Frederick Cecil McLean, 70, died of natural causes in July, but his body wasn’t found until Nov. 6, when someone asked deputies to check on a neighbor who hadn’t been seen in a while, Oconee County Coroner Karl Addis said. McLean has been on the U.S. Marshal Service’s 15 Most Wanted list since 2006, a year after the San Diego Sheriff’s Department issued arrest warrants for sexual assaults on a child and determined he was a high risk to continue attacking girls. One girl was assaulted more than 100 times before she turned 13, marshals said in a statement. McLean had been living in South Carolina for 15 years, going by the name of James Fitzgerald, marshals said. “The discovery of Frederick McLean’s body marks an end to the manhunt, but the investigation continues,” U.S. Marshals Service Director Ronald Davis said. Investigators are now trying to determine if anyone helped McLean avoid being found by police. They have determined he used several other aliases and also lived in Anderson, South Carolina, and Poughkeepsie, New York.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nMcIntosh: The work of two wildlife management agencies has resulted in the release of 28 endangered black-footed ferrets on the South Dakota side of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which straddles the Dakotas. The push behind the effort by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is twofold: to maintain control of black-tailed prairie dogs in an area of the reservation used primarily for grazing and to save from extinction the black-footed ferret, considered the most endangered mammal in the U.S. They are yellowish-buff in color and weigh 11/ 2 to 2 pounds. The forehead, muzzle and throat are white, and the feet are black. They have a black mask around the eyes that is well-defined in young ferrets. The ferrets were released Oct. 20 in prairie dog towns between McIntosh and Bullhead, said Michael Gutzmer, ecologist with New Century Environmental, the Nebraska company that provides biological services to the tribe, The Bismarck Tribune reports. Prairie dogs make up 90% of the black-footed ferrets’ diet. The ferrets live in prairie dog burrows, and each eats a prairie dog about every three days, said Seth Gutzmer, biologist on the Standing Rock project and Michael Gutzmer’s son. The ferrets were considered extinct in the wild in 1987.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Friends and associates of slain rapper Young Dolph handed out Thanksgiving turkeys at a neighborhood church Friday, two days after he was gunned down in broad daylight inside his favorite bakery. Known for acts of charity in his hometown, the hip-hop artist and label owner had helped organize the event at St. James Missionary Baptist Church and was going to participate before he was fatally shot Wednesday. Undaunted, members of his music label, Paper Route Empire, along with church volunteers and community activists, distributed dozens of turkeys, stuffing mix and cranberry sauce to people driving past the church. It was the type of event Young Dolph, who grew up in the Castalia neighborhood where the church is located, has been organizing for years, often without the reporters and cameras present Friday. Before the event, volunteers spoke quietly among themselves or sat in solemn reflection as his music played outside the church on the sunny afternoon. Label employee Bee Bee Jones, 38, helped hand out the food, honoring his friend of 30 years. “When I hear his music, I just break down,” Jones said. “The truth in all of it, and where he came from, that’s what really gets to me sometimes. This is what he would want us to do right here, still keep on giving. He came from nothing, but he wanted to make sure everybody got some.”\n\nTexas\n\nBig Spring: A pickup truck heading the wrong way on a West Texas highway slammed into a bus carrying members of a high school band, killing three people, officials said Friday. Two students from the bus were critically injured in the late Friday afternoon crash on Interstate 20 in Big Spring, about 250 miles west of Fort Worth, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. The bus from Andrews High School was headed to a football game with 25 students aboard when it was hit by the wrong-way truck, which burst into flames, killing the truck’s driver, said DPS Sgt. Justin Baker. One of the adults from the bus was also pronounced dead at the scene, he said. A third adult and two students were airlifted to University Medical Center in Lubbock, 95 miles north of the crash site. The adult died at the hospital, and the two students were listed in critical but stable condition, Baker said. Other students were taken to the Scenic Mountain Medical Center for treatment of minor injuries, he said. The football playoff game between Andrews and Springtown in Sweetwater was postponed.\n\nUtah\n\nBeaver County: Climate change has been making droughts more frequent and intense and limiting Utah farmers’ ability to grow crops. In the past two years, a growing number of farmers have signed up for a state program that helps fund projects to increase their water use efficiency, KUER-FM reports. Among them is Trent Brown, a longtime rancher and farmer in Beaver County who’s also the county assessor, since farming doesn’t pay all the bills. It’s a family tradition: His father and grandfather were ranchers and farmers and worked government jobs, too. Brown finished the switch from growing alfalfa to grass five years ago to save water, but it wasn’t enough to overcome this summer’s drought. Earlier this year, he used a grant from the state’s Water Optimization Program to replace the cement in a ditch that brings water from the nearby Manderfield Reservoir to him and other farmers in the valley. “The concrete ditch was put in in the ’60s, and it was just falling apart, failing,” he said. “We were losing a lot of water. We figure probably 20%.” Utah established the Water Optimization Program in 2020. It got $3 million in state funding that year and another $3 million in 2021. During the latest round, the program got 81 applications totaling $10.6 million – more than triple the money available to spend, according to the program’s director, Jay Olsen.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Captain Snowpants; Yo Bro, No Snow; Plow-A-Tron 6,000; and Jennifer Snowpez are among the names that will be on some of the state’s snowplows this winter. Vermont school students participated in the state transportation department’s Name a Plow contest to come up with names for the plows serving their communities. The entries ranged from “creative and clever to cute and silly,” the agency said. Participating schools got a visit from their newly named plows last week. One child was so upset she had missed the visit from the snowplow named Super Snow Storm that the driver and plow will visit again, said Amy Tatko, spokesperson for the Vermont Agency of Transportation. The full list of the Vermont names – including Snowbegone Kenobe, Plowy McPlowFace, Brr-rito and Steve – can be found on the transportation department’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam issued an executive order Thursday aimed at improving how the state receives and evaluates input from tribal nations when making decisions about permits related to environmental, historical or cultural resources. The order directs four agencies to draft their own policies within 90 days for working with tribal nations before a permit is approved or denied. The Northam administration said this would help Virginia identify and understand concerns from tribal nations before finalizing permits, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The directive applies to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Historic Resources, and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. Northam’s executive order also directs the secretary of the commonwealth to appoint an ombudsman who can work with both state agencies and tribal nations. Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin will take office a month before Northam’s deadline and could potentially cancel the executive order. The Youngkin transition team didn’t immediately respond to the Times-Dispatch’s requests for comment.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: As lawmakers prepare for a new legislative session to craft and pass a supplemental budget, they’ll have more money to work with thanks to a steady increase of state revenues over the past year. Updated numbers by the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council released Friday show that projected revenue collections for the 2021-2023 budget cycle are $898 million above what had been originally forecasted in September. And projections for the next two-year budget cycle that ends in mid-2025 increased by more than $965 million. Revenues for the current budget cycle that ends mid-2023 are now projected to be $60.2 billion. And projected revenues for the next two-year budget cycle that starts July 1, 2023, are projected to be about $64 billion. Steve Lerch, the chief economist and executive director of the council, said compared to the first forecast this year in March, overall revenues increased $3.6 billion for the current biennium and $4.1 billion for the next. Republican legislative members of the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council said in response to the strong growth, tax cuts should be part of any final plan. Democratic budget writers said nothing is off the table but expressed caution.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBramwell: A 128-year-old church collapsed suddenly in the middle of the night Thursday, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Bramwell’s historic Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, which has stood since 1893, caved in about midnight, Mayor Louise Stoker told the paper. The church’s original congregation included many of the town’s first residents, Stoker said. The Independent Bible Church later occupied the building before donating it to the town, which had been planning to conserve the historic structure. “I’ve been in dialogue with a preservation contractor,” Stoker said. “This week, in fact, we had sent him photos.” Workers clearing the debris noted things that could be saved such as large wooden beams and the old church bell. Some of the church’s Queen Anne-style stained glass windows were also mostly intact. Stoker said the town council will discuss what to do next, but it’s possible that a portion of the building that didn’t collapse will have to be taken down. Standing outside the church Friday, she pointed out six circular stained glass windows in the remaining structure. “Not one of them has a broken piece,” she remarked.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: As the state kicked off its 170th deer gun season Saturday, some hunters were feeling ill-equipped for the second straight year. A nationwide ammunition shortage due to the supply chain issues affecting other products has left hunters searching far and wide for ammo in the first place and then shelling out more money if they do find it. Randy and Tiffani Rogness, who own Paddock Lake Sporting Goods in Salem, had empty ammunition shelves Friday. When a new supply is delivered, it lasts two to three hours, even with a one-box limit per customer, they said. “We search everywhere. We’ve ordered so much, and it’s just not coming in,” Tiffani Rogness said. One of the nation’s biggest ammunition manufacturers, Vista Outdoor in Anoka, Minnesota, said it’s “ramping production ahead of schedule at its Remington facility to meet unprecedented demand.” The price of almost any caliber ammunition is double what it was a year ago. Manufacturers say the pandemic created new gun buyers, along with more hunters looking for something to do outside, WISN-TV reports. More than 570,000 deer hunters from around the world are expected to try their luck in this year’s nine-day season, Department of Natural Resources officials said. Wisconsin has more than 7 million acres of land open for hunting.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: For the past four months, people have been protesting the presence of sexual education and LGBTQ books in the children’s and teen sections of the Campbell County Public Library. The movement, part of a national trend, is being led by the Wyoming chapter of MassResistance, a national group headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, that prides itself on “pro-family activism.” The local chapter was formed in July. Since then, the group has worked to get its message out to the community that the library is actively corrupting the youth with its books, the Gillette News Record reports. “It’s been hard on the library staff,” said library director Terri Lesley. “It’s been a long time, and I’m very proud of them for how well they’re doing, how well they’re holding up. It’s not easy to be in the middle of a big controversy.” MassResistance’s goal is to protect “the traditional family, school children, and the moral foundation of society.” It believes in marriage between a man and a woman and that people are not born homosexual. Library board member Charlie Anderson said he’s been called names, and Lesley said she and some of her staff have received angry emails and letters, some from out of state. Lesley said she’s also received a lot of support, which has helped balance out the calls for her resignation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/08/24/arizona-senate-race-mcsally-ward-arpaio-putnam-desantis-jeff-flake/1079073002/", "title": "Arizona primary: Will Martha McSally beat Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio?", "text": "WASHINGTON — The final match-ups for what are shaping up to be two of the most competitive Senate races in the country will be decided Tuesday.\n\nVoters in Arizona, Florida and Oklahoma will be the final three states to have a series of big primaries with just over two months to go until the general election Nov. 8.\n\nThe blockbuster race Tuesday is the GOP primary to replace Sen. Jeff Flake who is retiring at the end of the year. Rep. Martha McSally - the establishment pick - will face off against physician and former state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio (yes, the one who President Trump pardoned.)\n\nA similarly heated GOP primary will take place in Florida where the president's pick for governor could beat the establishment's choice of Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.\n\nAnd in deep-red Oklahoma, voters will have resolution after a few races were left hanging because of the state's mandatory run-off rule.\n\nHere's what we're watching for in Tuesday's primary:\n\nArizona\n\nThe GOP Senate race has all of the candidates - including McSally, who, as a centrist House member refused to say if she voted for President Trump in 2016 - running as close to the president as possible. Trump has said favorable things about all of the candidates and hasn’t officially endorsed any of them. McSally may have the closest, though. Most recently he praised McSally during a bill signing this month and has had her frequently to the White House.\n\nMcSally is the favorite to win, the Real Clear Politics polling average has her up 8 percentage points. Political strategists say that if McSally wins the state, Republicans will have a much better chance of beating likely Democratic candidate Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. Sinema is facing off against lawyer and consultant Deedra Abboud, but she’s assumed to win the Democratic nomination and already running as if she’s in the general election.\n\nBoth McSally and Sinema leave behind competitive House districts. Although, McSally’s Congressional District 2 is one of the biggest battlegrounds in the country. McSally is vacating her southern Arizona seat where voters split almost exactly between Democrats and Republicans and it’s a packed primary on both sides of the aisle.\n\nThere are four people running for the GOP nomination, but Lea Marquez Peterson, CEO of the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, is the favorite of national Republicans. Meanwhile, there are seven Democrats trying to be the one to flip the district back to blue, but two favorites. Physician Matt Heinz ran against McSally in 2016 and he’d like to be the Democratic nominee again. But former U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick - who represented a different district in the state - is talked about as the favorite in the crowded field.\n\nRep. Tom O’Halleran is running to keep his seat in Congressional District 1, it’s one of just a handful of districts President Trump won in 2016 but is held by a Democrat. He has no primary opponent, but there are three Republicans vying for the chance to beat him in the general election.\n\nWendy Rogers, a pro-Trump retired Air Force colonel; Tiffany Shedd, a lawyer and cotton farmer, and Steve Smith, a former state lawmaker are all competing for the GOP nomination.\n\nRep. David Schweikert - a conservative member of the House Freedom Caucus - represents a district that has been red for years.\n\nBut Democrats are hoping shifting boundaries and an ethics investigation against Schweikert will combine with an educated electorate to put the district in play this November.\n\nSchweikert is running unopposed on the Republican side for Congressional District 6. Anita Mali, who works in technology and communications, Garrick McFadden, a lawyer, and Heather Ross, a nurse practitioner, are all competing for the Democratic nomination.\n\nGOP Governor Doug Ducey is running for re-election. Even though the state has had a Republican governor for 21 of the last 27 years, Ducey faces headwinds in the general election because of energized Democrats and voters who are unhappy with public education.\n\nDucey is facing a primary challenge from a former Arizona Secretary of State and Arizona Senate president Ken Bennett. There is a three-way primary for the Democratic nomination: state lawmaker Steve Farley, Kelly Fryer who was the CEO of the YWCA of Southern Arizona and army veteran David Garcia.\n\nFlorida\n\nArizona isn’t the only state with primaries set for Tuesday that could determine the control of the Senate in November.\n\nIf Arizona is one of the Democrats’ top offensive states this cycle, Florida offers one of the country’s biggest pickup opportunities for Republicans. But on Tuesday, race watchers don’t expect many surprises in the match-up.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Bill Nelson is unopposed. On the GOP-side Florida Gov. Rick Scott is the clear favorite, though he is facing a challenge from perennial candidate Roque \"Rocky\" De La Fuente.\n\nThe real state-level drama lies in the GOP primary for governor where Rep. Ron DeSantis, a hardline conservative and a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, faces off against Adam Putnam, the state’s agriculture commissioner. Establishment Republicans are hoping Putnam pulls it off because they see him as having the best chance of winning the purple state.\n\nBut President Trump has other plans. The president has endorsed DeSantis and rallied for him in Florida and polling shows DeSantis is ahead. There are a half-dozen other Republicans also vying for the nomination, but the race is assumed to be between DeSantis and Putnam.\n\nOn the Democrats’ side, there are multiple candidates hoping to be the party’s nominee - and three of them have government experience. Former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine and former Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum are all competing for their next job in government. There are also a handful of other candidates running. The Real Clear Politics polling average has Graham as the favorite.\n\nIf the Democratic wave hits Florida there are a handful of Democratic pick-up opportunities in the Sunshine state. But there are three races analysts are watching closely. There are two GOP-held seats won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 and one of them - Florida’s 27th Congressional District - is now open with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen retiring. Rep. Carlos Curbelo is in Florida’s 26th Congressional District.\n\nCurbelo is running for re-election in a district Clinton won handedly. He is facing a challenger from his own party but is expected to win. On the Democratic side, retired Navy Commander Demetries Grimes and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a health care advocate, will face off for their party’s nomination.\n\nRos-Lehtinen’s retirement means the 27th District is now an open race and it’s a packed primary on both sides. National Republicans have recruited former Univision reporter Maria Elvira Salazar, but she must beat eight other candidates on the right.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Donna Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton and former president of the University of Miami, and state Rep. David Richardson have been pulling in the most money but they’ll face off against additional Democrats.\n\nRep. Brian Mast is the GOP incumbent running for re-election in District 18, but first he’s got to make it past two Republicans, entrepreneur Dave Cummings and physician Mark Freeman. Both Cummings and Freeman mounted bids after Mast called for a temporary moratorium on assault weapons sales. On the left, former Obama foreign relations advisor Lauren Baer, has the support of most national Democrats. Baer is running against Navy veteran and lawyer Pam Keith, who previously ran for U.S. Senate in 2016.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma had its primary back in June, but the state requires a run-off if no candidate gets a majority of the vote. So there will be rematches for a handful of races around the state.\n\nThe GOP nominee for governor should be decided Tuesday between former Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett and businessman Kevin Stitt.\n\nIf Democrats take back the House, it likely won’t be through Oklahoma, a state that has no Democratic members of its congressional delegation. Race handicappers say no Oklahoma seat is in much danger of turning red.\n\nBut the state does have an open seat in the 1st Congressional District after former Rep. Jim Bridenstine became director of NASA. Tuesday will cement that match-up. Tulsa County District Attorney Tim Harris and McDonald’s franchiser Kevin Hern will battle for the GOP spot. On the left, education advocate Amanda Douglas and lawyer Tim Gilpin will go head-to-head.\n\nContributing: Ledyard King and Herb Jackson in Washington, Yvonne Wingett-Sanchez, Ronald J.

In his first Oval Office appearance, before heading to inaugural balls, he signs an executive order directing agencies to find ways to \"ease the burden\" of Obamacare.\n\nDay 2: Jan. 21\n\nTrump makes an appearance at CIA headquarters, expressing his support for the intelligence community while attacking the media for reporting that he had a \"feud\" with them over investigations into Russian hacking and the election. He also criticizes media coverage of his inauguration, echoed later by press secretary Sean Spicer in an angry briefing room debut. Meanwhile, millions of people join Women's March protests around the world, including in Washington.\n\nDay 3: Jan. 22\n\nTrump starts the day with tweets touting his inauguration TV ratings and weighing in on the weekend protests against him: \"Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote?\" Top aide Kellyanne Conway makes waves with a Meet the Press appearance in which she says Spicer \"gave alternative facts\" in his press briefing in regard to inauguration crowd sizes.\n\nDay 4: Jan. 23\n\nTrump signs three presidential directives: withdrawing U.S. support for a Pacific trade deal; imposing a hiring freeze in civilian agencies; and restoring the so-called Mexico City policy that prohibits U.S. aid from supporting international groups that promote abortion. In a meeting with congressional leaders, Trump revives claims of voter fraud, blaming his popular vote loss on 3 million to 5 million people voting illegally.\n\nDay 5: Jan. 24\n\nTrump signs five executive actions on energy and infrastructure projects, including two memoranda intended to expedite the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. In a late-night tweet, he references plans to address one of his key campaign promises the following day: \"Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!\"\n\nDay 6: Jan. 25\n\nTrump starts the day with tweets vowing a \"major investigation\" into alleged voter fraud. In the afternoon, he visits the Department of Homeland Security and signs executive actions aimed at building a wall on the Mexican border and clamping down on \"sanctuary cities.\"\n\nDay 7: Jan. 26\n\nTrump floats a proposal for a 20% tax on imports from Mexico to pay for his planned border wall. His plans for the wall drive a divide between the two countries and lead Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to cancel a meeting between the two leaders. Trump takes his first Air Force One ride, traveling to Philadelphia to speak at the GOP congressional retreat.\n\nDay 8: Jan. 27\n\nTrump has an hourlong phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. He has his first official meeting with a foreign leader, British Prime Minister Theresa May. During their news conference, Trump declines to say whether he supports a reduction of sanctions against Russia. He visits the Pentagon to charge his new Defense secretary with rebuilding the military and announce an executive action to clamp down on refugee admissions in the U.S.\n\nDay 9: Jan. 28\n\nTrump's executive order from the previous evening — which suspends the U.S. refugee program for 120 days, bans all immigrants from seven Muslim countries for 90 days, and orders the administration to develop \"extreme vetting\" measures — causes reverberations across the country, with stranded travelers, airport protests and legal challenges. The president makes a round of phone calls to world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also signs more executive orders: one to reorganize the National Security Council, another to strengthen ethics rules for the executive branch, and a third directing the military to present him a plan to defeat the Islamic State.\n\nDay 10: Jan. 29\n\nTrump, the target of protests, lawsuits and global criticism over his new refugee policy, takes to social media to defend it as a counter-terrorism measure. Some congressional Republicans suggest the order may have been too broad and hastily written. The president also faces blowback after giving chief strategist Steve Bannon an elevated role on the National Security Council.\n\nDay 11: Jan. 30\n\nAmid continued criticism over his temporary travel ban, Trump says that stopping terrorism involves hard choices and adds that he's following through on campaign pledges. Former president Barack Obama's office releases a statement that applauds those protesting the ban. That evening, acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, says she won't defend the president’s travel ban in court. Three hours later, the White House announces that she's been relieved of her duties.\n\nDay 12: Jan. 31\n\nThe morning after firing his acting attorney general, Trump mocks his Democratic congressional critics and demands that the Senate confirm his attorney general pick, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. He meets with drugmakers and pledges to cut taxes and streamline regulations for the pharmaceutical industry in a bid to drive down drug prices. The president caps off the day with his long-awaited Supreme Court nomination, announcing his selection of Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nDay 13: Feb. 1\n\nTrump says the Senate should \"go nuclear\" and eliminate Democratic filibuster rights if that's what it takes to confirm Gorsuch. His nomination of Betsy DeVos for Education secretary takes a hit when two Republican senators say they'll vote against her. The president makes an unannounced trip to a Delaware military base to receive the remains of a Navy SEAL killed during a counter-terrorism raid.\n\nDay 14: Feb. 2\n\nIn remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump references leaked conversations between himself and Mexican and Australian leaders, telling attendees not to worry about his \"tough phone calls\" and that the country has to be \"tougher\" in meeting its challenges. He raises eyebrows by also asking for prayers for his Apprentice successor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the show's ratings, which Trump said have gone \"down the tubes\" in his absence. And he vows to make good on his promise to overturn the so-called Johnson Amendment, which bans public charities — including churches — from campaigning for or against a candidate for elected office.\n\nDay 15: Feb. 3\n\nThe Trump administration imposes new sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing the Tehran government's missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The president signs executive actions rolling back key financial regulations of the Obama era, including restrictions on Wall Street banks and on financial advisers who sell clients expensive financial products with higher commissions.\n\nDay 16: Feb. 4\n\nTrump spends his weekend at Mar-a-Lago, the \"Winter White House.\" He asks a federal court to overturn a Seattle judge’s injunction halting his immigration ban, after he criticized the judge’s ruling as “ridiculous” and a “terrible decision.” In excerpts of a Fox News interview with Bill O'Reilly set to air before the Super Bowl the following day, Trump reiterates his desire to improve relations with Russia and dismisses concerns that Putin is a “killer.”\n\nDay 17: Feb 5\n\nTrump continues to attack the federal judge who voided his travel ban. \"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,\" he tweets. \"If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" As the Justice Department appeals the judge's decision, Trump also tweets that he has \"instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!\"\n\nDay 18: Feb. 6\n\nAs an appeals court reviews his travel ban, Trump claims that the public is with him, despite polls indicating otherwise. \"Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election,\" Trump tweets. \"Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.\" In a visit to the headquarters of the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Trump tells troops he is 100% behind them in the fight against \"radical Islamic terrorism\" and claims that \"in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report\" on terrorist attacks.\n\nDay 19: Feb. 7\n\nTrump tells a group of county sheriffs that he will help them fight terrorism and illegal immigration, and he vows to take his travel ban all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. DeVos is confirmed as Education secretary after a contentious battle in the Senate, with Vice President Pence breaking a 50-50 tie vote. Later that day, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hears oral arguments over a lower court's decision to halt Trump's travel ban.\n\nDay 20: Feb. 8\n\nTrump urges the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold his travel ban, arguing that national security is at stake and suggesting that judges sometimes act politically. The president attacks Nordstrom for dropping daughter Ivanka's fashion line, drawing criticism for mixing government and his family's business interests. The Senate debate on the Sessions attorney general nomination turns ugly after Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is silenced by the GOP during a speech for \"impugning\" Sessions.\n\nDay 21: Feb. 9\n\nTrump accuses Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., of distorting what Gorsuch said about the president's attacks on judges, even though administration officials and fellow senators confirm the gist of Gorsuch's comments.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit weighs in that evening, refusing to reinstate Trump's travel ban.\n\nDay 22: Feb. 10\n\nIn a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump reaffirms the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan but says both countries need to contribute more to military cooperation. He says he’ll take action the following week to strengthen border security in the wake of the appeals court ruling against his travel ban, but he declines to specify what that action might be. Meanwhile, a federal judge in Virginia blasts his travel ban, citing a lack of evidence that travelers from the seven Muslim-majority countries represent a specific threat.\n\nDay 23: Feb. 11\n\nTrump golfs with Abe at Trump National Jupiter Golf Club in Florida, while Melania Trump and Abe’s wife, Akie, spend the morning touring the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Palm Beach County. It's a relatively quiet day for the president on Twitter, with Trump vowing that cost estimates for his border wall will \"come WAY DOWN\" once he is involved with design and negotiations.\n\nDay 24: Feb. 12\n\nTrump takes to Twitter in the morning to again defend his travel ban. In Sunday show appearances, policy adviser Stephen Miller says the president is assessing all of his legal options on the ban, ranging from appealing to the Supreme Court to revising the executive order.\n\nDay 25: Feb. 13\n\nAfter a day filled with mounting questions and criticism, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigns, citing \"incomplete information\" that he provided White House officials about his dealings with the Russian ambassador. Earlier that day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visits the White House. Trump pledges \"bridges of commerce\" with Canada and says he wants relatively minor changes to NAFTA, adding that most of his problems with the trade deal involve the third partner, Mexico.\n\nDay 26: Feb. 14\n\nIn the aftermath of Flynn's exit, Spicer says Trump knew for more than two weeks that Flynn lied about his contact with a Russian ambassador and demanded his resignation because he could no longer trust him. That night, The New York Times reports that phone records and intercepted calls show members of Trump's campaign team \"had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.\"\n\nDay 27: Feb. 15\n\nAmid the renewed questions about contacts between Trump's associates and Russia regarding the 2016 election, the president denounces \"conspiracy theories\" about his relationship with the Russians and said \"illegal\" news leaks brought down Flynn. Trump hosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House for a series of meetings. Andrew Puzder, the president’s embattled pick to become Labor secretary, withdraws his nomination.\n\nDay 28: Feb. 16\n\nIn a lengthy, fiery, wide-ranging news conference, Trump defends his administration as a \"fine-tuned machine,\" laments the \"mess\" he inherited from his predecessor and excoriates the \"fake news\" media. He says he asked Flynn to resign because he misled Pence about his phone calls to the Russian ambassador, but Trump says he didn't believe Flynn did anything wrong by making the calls and faults leakers for providing contents of the intercepted calls to the media.\n\nDay 29: Feb. 17\n\nThe Associated Press reports on the details of an internal Department of Homeland Security memo from January that proposes calling up as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up undocumented immigrants; it draws an angry response from the White House, with Spicer calling the AP report \"100% not true\" and insisting the memo is “not a White House document.” Trump conducts his first presidential visit beyond the Beltway with a stop in the Boeing facility in North Charleston, S.C., where he stresses his \"America First\" trade and economic policies.\n\nDay 30: Feb. 18\n\nTrump kicks off his third straight weekend at Mar-a-Lago seeking to calm reports of turmoil within his administration. \"Don't believe the main stream (fake news) media.The White House is running VERY WELL. I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it,\" he tweets that morning. He holds a campaign-style rally in the evening in Melbourne, Fla.\n\nDay 31: Feb. 19\n\nTrump is ridiculed for apparently denouncing a non-existent terrorist attack in Sweden in his rally the night before but says he was referring to a Fox News report on violence in Sweden allegedly perpetrated by refugees. In New York City, more than a thousand people protest Trump's travel ban in the \"I Am A Muslim Too\" rally.\n\nDay 32: Feb. 20\n\nAcross the country, anti-Trump activists mark Presidents Day with “Not My Presidents Day” protests.

The president, while meeting with budget officials, doesn't give specifics, but he tells reporters that \"our moral duty to the taxpayer requires us to make our government leaner and more accountable” and “we must do a lot more with less.” Later that evening, the Trump administration issues new guidance on transgender students' restroom use, rolling back the policies put in place by the Obama administration last year.\n\nDay 35: Feb. 23\n\nTrump meets with manufacturing executives at the White House and later holds a listening session on human trafficking. The Conservative Political Action Conference kicks off just outside of Washington. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Bannon make a joint appearance at the annual confab, in which they dispute media reports casting them as rivals and say they are working together to advance the president's agenda.\n\nDay 36: Feb. 24\n\nTrump starts off the day criticizing FBI \"leakers\" as he and aides push back on news reports that his chief of staff asked the bureau to \"knock down\" stories about investigations into possible contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials. At his CPAC speech later that morning, Trump launches into a full-throated attack on journalism, saying some reporters make up unnamed sources for \"fake news\" and describing the media as \"the enemy\" of the American people. News organizations protest a White House decision that afternoon to hold a news briefing by invitation only.\n\nDay 37: Feb. 25\n\nThe president takes to Twitter in the morning with further complaints about the media. “The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo,” he tweets. In the evening, he announces via Twitter that he will not attend the annual White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in April.\n\nDay 38: Feb. 26\n\nThe president tweets that the Democratic National Committee election \"was of course, totally 'rigged' \" and takes another swing at the media, tweeting, \"Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!\" In the evening, Trump hosts the nation's governors for an annual dinner at the White House.\n\nDay 39: Feb. 27\n\nTrump signs off on top-line numbers in a budget outline that bolsters military spending while making deep cuts to other federal agencies. \"This defense spending increase will be offset and paid for by finding greater savings and efficiencies across the federal government,\" he says. \"We're going to do more with less.\" The president rejects the idea of a special prosecutor to look into Russian connections during the election and says, “I haven’t called Russia in 10 years.\"\n\nDay 40: Feb. 28\n\nTrump uses his first address to Congress to proclaim American greatness and push an ambitious agenda of economic nationalism, declaring, \"The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.\" He opens the possibility of a comprehensive immigration deal, pitches $1 trillion for \"Buy American, Hire American\" infrastructure spending, and says he will propose \"historic\" tax cuts. Earlier that day, the president signs executive orders targeting a water-protection rule and elevating an initiative on historically black colleges and universities.\n\nDay 41: March 1\n\nA day after Trump struck a more conciliatory tone in his address to Congress, critics predict he'll revert back to the more combative and divisive approach that characterized much of his first month in office. Aides, however, say the president is focused on enacting his campaign agenda. White House Deputy Counsel Stefan Passantino says in a letter that Conway did nothing \"nefarious\" when she promoted Ivanka Trump's fashion line on television and that a White House inquiry \"concluded that Ms. Conway acted inadvertently and is highly unlikely to do so again.\"\n\nDay 42: March 2\n\nThe news of Sessions' 2016 meetings with the Russian ambassador, contradicting his testimony during his confirmation hearing that he had no contact with the Russian government during the campaign, dominates the day. Trump says he \"wasn't aware at all\" of the meetings. Speaking to reporters during a tour of the USS Gerald Ford in Newport News, Va., the president says he still had \"total\" confidence in his attorney general. Later that afternoon, Session recuses himself from the Russia investigation.\n\nDay 43: March 3\n\nSeeking to get past stories about Sessions and Russia, Trump spends the day visiting a school in Florida. He uses Twitter to express his displeasure with Democrats, knocking them over his full Cabinet having not yet been approved and calling Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer a \"hypocrite\" in a tweet displaying a 2003 photo of Schumer and Putin.\n\nDay 44: March 4\n\nIn a morning tweetstorm, Trump accuses Obama of wiretapping him at Trump Tower prior to the November election: \"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\" the president tweets. An Obama spokesman rejects the accusation as \"simply false.\" Thousands of Trump supporters convene near Trump Tower and in other cities around the U.S. in what organizers bill as \"March 4 Trump\" demonstrations on behalf of the president.\n\nDay 45: March 5\n\nIn the morning, the president calls for a congressional investigation of his claims that Obama had him wiretapped during the election — while critics accuse Trump of trying to distract from the investigation into his own relationship with Russia. That evening, news reports indicate that FBI Director James Comey over the weekend sought a public rebuke from the Justice Department of Trump's wiretapping claim.\n\nDay 46: March 6\n\nTrump issues the long-awaited revised version of his travel ban, which no longer restricts travel from Iraq, one of the seven majority Muslim countries listed in his original order. The new order, set to take effect 10 days afterward, includes Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen as part of the 90-day ban. Meanwhile, when White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders is asked on ABC's Good Morning America whether the president accepts Comey's statement that Obama did not authorize any wiretaps, she says: \"You know, I don't think he does.\"\n\nDay 47: March 7\n\nTrump kicks off the day by using Twitter to again bash Obama — this time in a false claim about Guantanamo Bay prisoner releases. He also denies reports of dissension within his staff. \"Don't let the FAKE NEWS tell you that there is big infighting in the Trump Admin,\" the president tweets. He praises the House GOP health care bill amid pushback from conservatives attacking the new plan. \"We're going to do something that is great,\" the president says during a meeting with House deputy whips. The plan is \"complicated, but it's very simple ... it's called good health care.\"\n\nDay 48: March 8\n\nWhile refusing to confirm or deny the authenticity of CIA documents released by WikiLeaks, Spicer says that \"this alleged leak should concern every single American in terms of the impact it has on our national security\" and says there's a \"massive, massive difference\" between exposing the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and other Democratic officials, and leaking national security secrets. The president dines with former foe Sen. Ted Cruz. Sens. Lindsey Graham and Sheldon Whitehouse send a letter to the FBI director and acting deputy attorney general asking for specific information on Trump's wiretapping accusation against Obama.\n\nDay 49: March 9\n\nTrump meets with his National Economic Council and representatives of community banks. As GOP leaders try to quell concerns about the new health care legislation, the president tweets, \"Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!\" Meanwhile, legal challenges mount from several states for Trump's revised travel ban.\n\nDay 50: March 10\n\nAs the president reaches the halfway point of his first 100 days, administration officials kick off a plan to use social media and interviews to promote \"50 days of action.\" Trump meets with House committee leaders and predicts a fairly rapid approval of the GOP health care bill. \"This is the time we’re going to get it done,\" he says. \"I think it’s just something that’s going to happen very shortly.\" He welcomes a better-than-expected jobs report showing that the economy added 235,000 jobs the previous month.\n\nDay 51: March 11\n\nTrump has lunch with a group of White House staff and Cabinet members at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va. His administration moves forward with plans to dismiss 46 U.S. attorneys held over from the Obama administration amid criticism, and news reports emerge that an intruder was arrested on the White House grounds after scaling a fence the previous evening.\n\nDay 52: March 12\n\nTrump administration officials mount a vigorous defense of their effort to repeal and replace Obamacare while bracing for what could be a skeptical assessment from the Congressional Budget Office the next day. Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price says the bill would lead to \"more people covered than are covered right now, and at an average cost that is less.\"\n\nDay 53: March 13\n\nThe CBO releases its analysis of the GOP health plan, determining that the bill would lead to 14 million fewer Americans with insurance by 2018 and 24 million by 2026. Price calls the projections \"just not believable.\" Trump launches an ambitious effort to reorganize the federal government, signing an executive order that he said would \"make it less wasteful and more productive.\"\n\nDay 54: March 14\n\nA senior White House official confirms that Trump paid $38 million in taxes in 2005 on an income of more than $150 million. The rare acknowledgement came in anticipation of a report by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow in which she disclosed a portion of the return. The news capped off an otherwise relatively quite day for the president during which Spicer pushed back against the CBO analysis of the Obamacare repeal and Trump hosted the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia for lunch in the State Dining Room.\n\nDay 55: March 15\n\nA federal judge in Hawaii issues a nationwide halt to Trump's second travel ban. Earlier that day, the president spars on Twitter with journalist David Cay Johnston over the previous night's leaked tax return, tweeting, \"Does anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, 'went to his mailbox' and found my tax returns?\" Trump also travels to Detroit to speak to autoworkers before heading to a rally in Nashville.\n\nDay 56: March 16\n\nIn his first formal budget proposal to Congress, Trump seeks to increase defense spending by $54 billion and offsets that with cuts to non-defense spending, including steep cuts to education, environmental protection, health and human services and foreign aid. Senate Intelligence Committee leaders say in a statement that there are \"no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance,\" a day after the House Intelligence panel offered a similar assessment. Trump also meets with Irish leader Enda Kenny and attends the Friends of Ireland Luncheon on Capitol Hill.\n\nDay 57: March 17\n\nDisputing media reports that the GOP health care bill is in political trouble, Trump says he is \"100% behind\" the plan and is working with skeptical conservatives. He welcomes German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the White House after months of back-and-forth between the two leaders. During their news conference, Trump again defends his surveillance allegations. \"At least we have something in common, perhaps,\" he says, referencing past disclosures during the Obama administration that Merkel's cellphone had been monitored.\n\nDay 58: March 18\n\nThe president spends the weekend at Mar-a-Lago. In a pair of morning tweets, Trump lashes out at the media and Germany: \"Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Nevertheless, Germany owes ... vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!\" Meanwhile, at the White House, the Secret Service apprehends a person who jumped a bike rack near the security perimeter.\n\nDay 59: March 19\n\nA day before a high-stakes hearing featuring Comey's testimony, the leaders of the House Intelligence Committee say on Sunday talk shows that there's no evidence to back Trump's claims that Obama wiretapped him, though the committee's chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, says investigators are looking at other types of possible surveillance of Trump and his aides during the campaign.\n\nDay 60: March 20\n\nAppearing before the House Intelligence Committee, Comey says the FBI and DOJ have \"no information to support’’ Trump’s assertions that Obama wiretapped him, and he also confirms for the first time publicly that the FBI is investigating Russian interference in the election. Trump heads to Kentucky to take part in a rally to build support for the GOP health care bill.\n\nDay 61: March 21\n\nThe morning after congressional Republicans released a modified version of their health care legislation seeking to win more conservative votes, Trump meets with GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill, emphasizing how important it is that they stay united to pass the legislation. The president also signs a $19.5 billion bill to fund NASA programs and reaffirm what he called a \"national commitment\" to \"human space exploration.\"\n\nDay 62: March 22\n\nThe White House dismisses a report that Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, received a $10 million contract a decade ago to advance the interests of Putin. Nunes says communications involving members of Trump's transition group were \"incidentally collected'' by intelligence officials after the election. The president meets with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and negotiations continue over the looming health care vote in the House.\n\nDay 63: March 23\n\nIn a setback to Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan's efforts to repeal Obamacare, the House postpones its vote on the bill as negotiations continue with both conservative and moderate groups. The president touts the House Intelligence chairman's assertion that spy agencies engaged in \"incidental collection\" of Trump associates' communications, saying it's evidence to support his claim that Obama \"wiretapped\" Trump Tower. Trump also holds a listening session on health care at the White House with truckers and trucking CEOs.\n\nDay 64: March 24\n\nAs the Obamacare repeal bill bleeds GOP support ahead of its rescheduled vote, Ryan pulls the legislation from consideration — a major bump in the road for Trump's campaign promise to repeal and replace the health care law. The president blames the bill's failure on the lack of Democratic support. Earlier that day, Trump signs a permit to allow the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, calling it \"a great day for American jobs.\"\n\nDay 65: March 25\n\nThe morning after Republicans' Obamacare repeal plan fell apart in Congress, Trump tweets, \"ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!\" The president stays in the D.C. area for the weekend, venturing to Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va.\n\nDay 66: March 26\n\nTrump takes aim at the House Freedom Caucus in a morning tweet: \"Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!\" In Sunday show appearances, Priebus and budget director Mick Mulvaney say Trump has not blamed Ryan for the failure of the Obamacare repeal bill.\n\nDay 67: March 27\n\nTrump taps son-in-law Jared Kushner to lead a new White House office designed to bring ideas from the private sector into the federal government. The president rolls back more Obama-era regulations, signing four bills that reverse rules on education, land use and federal purchasing, and he holds a meeting at the White House with female small-business owners.\n\nDay 68: March 28\n\nTrump signs an executive order on energy independence, a sweeping repudiation of Obama-era environmental initiatives that substitutes a strategy of combating climate change through international cooperation for an America-first energy policy. Nunes faces pressure to recuse himself or step down as leader of the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDay 69: March 29\n\nThe president kicks off the day with complaints on Twitter about the media. \"Remember when the failing @nytimes apologized to its subscribers, right after the election, because their coverage was so wrong. Now worse!\" he tweets. Trump later holds an opioid abuse listening session, joined by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, leader of the White House's new commission to combat the opioid crisis.\n\nDay 70: March 30\n\nTrump takes to Twitter to threaten the conservative group that opposed him on health care: \"The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018! \" Later that day, The New York Times reports that two White House officials played a role in providing intelligence reports to Nunes. The president meets with Denmark’s prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen.\n\nDay 71: March 31\n\nWhile Trump encourages Flynn to offer testimony to investigators in exchange for immunity, congressional leaders investigating Russia's interference in the election signal that it's too early to consider such an agreement. Trump promises to crack down on \"foreign importers that cheat\" with two executive orders that he said would lead to a historic reversal of the nation's trade deficit.\n\nDay 72: April 1\n\nTrump kicks off another Saturday with tweets attacking the media, with NBC's Chuck Todd as the target: \"When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story?\" The president also uses Twitter to praise a New York Times article on Obamacare, though he still describes the newspaper as \"failing.\"\n\nDay 73: April 2\n\nTrump expresses confidence, both on social media and at the golf course, that he and aides can resurrect their attempt to repeal Obamacare. Before hitting the links with one of his critics on health care, Republican Sen. Rand Paul, the president tweets: \"Anybody (especially Fake News media) who thinks that Repeal & Replace of ObamaCare is dead does not know the love and strength in R Party!\"\n\nDay 74: April 3\n\nTrump welcomes Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to the White House, praises him for doing a \"fantastic job,\" and solicits his help in the fight against terrorism. The president donates $78,333.32 — his salary since taking office — to the National Park Service. Senate Democrats reach the threshold required to block Gorsuch's confirmation, setting up a major Senate rules change later in the week for the GOP to advance the Supreme Court nomination.\n\nDay 75: April 4\n\nFormer national security adviser Susan Rice, appearing on MSNBC, says she didn't seek to \"unmask\" the names of Trump associates for political purposes. Meanwhile, in a statement on a chemical attack in Syria, Trump blames the Assad regime and calls it a consequence of the Obama administration’s “weakness and irresolution.” The president promotes his \"America First\" domestic plan at the North America’s Building Trades Unions national legislative conference.\n\nDay 76: April 5\n\nA senior White House official confirms Trump has removed Bannon from the National Security Council and says Bannon was given the post as a check on Flynn. In an interview with The New York Times, Trump floats the possibility that Rice committed a crime, but he provides no evidence. In a news conference with Jordan's King Abdullah, the president denounces the chemical attack in Syria and suggests his administration will develop a new policy toward Bashar al-Assad's government.\n\nDay 77: April 6\n\nTrump orders a cruise missile strike against Syria, saying \"no child of God should ever suffer\" the horror of the chemical weapons attack Syria launched on its own people. Earlier that day, Trump meets with Wounded Warriors at the White House before heading to Mar-a-Lago to host a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Senate Republicans invoke the \"nuclear option\" to strip Democrats of their power to block Trump's Supreme Court nominee from being confirmed.\n\nDay 78: April 7\n\nTrump's decision to strike Syria in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack draws wide political support, though some lawmakers say he should have consulted with Congress, while Russia said the strike would undermine international cooperation. The president concludes his meetings with the Chinese president at Mar-a-Lago, and his Supreme Court nominee is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nDay 79: April 8\n\nTrump does not rule out additional military action against Syria, telling Congress that he was acting \"in the vital national security and foreign policy interests of the United States\" when he ordered the launch of cruise missiles at a Syrian air field. He provides his justification in a letter to Congress under the War Powers Resolution. Kushner and Bannon hold a negotiation session to try to mend a rift that triggered speculation about a White House staff shakeup.\n\nDay 80: April 9\n\nAdministration officials confirm that Trump will ask K.T. McFarland to step down as deputy national security adviser and serve instead as ambassador to Singapore, giving McMaster a chance to pick his own lieutenant. The president heads back to D.C. in the afternoon following a weekend at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nDay 81: April 10\n\nTrump takes part in the swearing-in ceremony for Gorsuch. The White House echoes its threat of additional missile strikes against Syria if Assad's government again uses chemical weapons, and Trump aides say the administration is reworking its tax reform plan and doesn't know whether it can put together a final proposal before Congress' August recess.\n\nDay 82: April 11\n\nSpicer makes waves during the daily briefing when he states, while comparing Assad and Adolf Hitler, that Hitler \"didn't even use chemical weapons.\" He attempts to clarify by saying Hitler \"was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing.\" In a second attempt to clarify, he says he was \"trying to draw a contrast of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on innocent people.\" Meanwhile, the White House says there's overwhelming evidence that Syria used a sarin nerve agent to attack opponents of the government and that Russia is trying to help Assad's government cover up the illegal use of chemical weapons.\n\nDay 83: April 12\n\nTrump meets with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and says at a press conference afterward that he's satisfied that NATO has responded to the criticism he leveled at it during his campaign: \"I said it was obsolete. It is no longer obsolete.\" He also says relations with Russia \"may be at an all-time low\" following Syria's use of chemical weapons the previous week and the U.S. airstrike that followed.\n\nDay 84: April 13\n\nThe U.S. military announces an attack on an Islamic State tunnel complex in Afghanistan, and Trump says he endorsed the strike. Asked about the use of the \"mother of all bombs,\" Trump says \"what I do is I authorize my military. ... We have given them total authorization and that’s what they’re doing and frankly that’s why they’ve been so successful lately.\" The president tweets on foreign policy, including on North Korea: \"I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. If they are unable to do so, the U.S., with its allies, will! U.S.A.\"\n\nDay 85: April 14\n\nTrump hits the golf course at Mar-a-Lago as he and his aides braced for what North Korea calls a \"big event.\" Administration officials say they are hopeful that China can dissuade its communist neighbor from conducting a nuclear explosion or a missile test. The Trump administration says records of visitors to the White House will stay secret until at least five years after Trump leaves office, a reversal of policy quickly denounced by advocates of transparent government.\n\nDay 86: April 15\n\nNorth Korea attempts to launch a new missile, but the device blows up almost immediately. Pence arrives in Seoul hours after the failed missile test and says U.S. resolve to support and defend South Korea is unwavering \"in these troubled times.\" Meanwhile, thousands of protesters gather in U.S. cities for Tax Day rallies and marches, demanding that Trump release his tax returns.\n\nDay 87: April 16\n\nThe Trump administration takes a low-key approach to the previous day's failed missile test in North Korea and continues to express hope that China will rein in its nuclear-armed neighbor. The president says he's unimpressed with tax protests over the weekend and indicates he has no plans to release his tax returns anytime soon. \"Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over!\" Trump tweets. He returns to D.C. after spending Easter weekend in Mar-a-Lago.\n\nDay 88: April 17\n\nTrump marks his first Easter Egg Roll by defending his record in office. \"We will be stronger and bigger and better as a nation than ever before and we are right on track,\" he says during remarks on the South Portico balcony. The White House declines to detail Trump's future strategy toward North Korea, even as its government threatens more missile tests. \"I think that the action that he took in Syria shows that when appropriate this president will take decisive action,\" Spicer says.\n\nDay 89: April 18\n\nTrump heads to Snap-On Tools in Kenosha, Wis., to speak about manufacturing and sign a \"Buy American, Hire American\" executive order. The order clamps down on guest worker visas and requires agencies to buy more goods and services from U.S. companies and workers. Watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington expands a lawsuit against the president, adding new plaintiffs who claim they are hurt by the \"unfair\" advantage he enjoys in the hotel and restaurant industry.\n\nDay 90: April 19\n\nWith the closely watched special election in Georgia headed to a runoff, Trump pats himself on the back: \"Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG \"R\" win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help!\" he tweets. He signs the Veterans Choice Program Extension and Improvement Act and welcomes the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House.\n\nDay 91: April 20\n\nThe Trump administration launches an investigation into whether steel imports threaten national security, a move aimed at China's growing dominance in steel production. The president welcomes Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni to the White House. During their joint press conference, Trump says he's confident he can block North Korea's nuclear program, get a health care bill though the House, and avoid a looming government shutdown.\n\nDay 92: April 21\n\nWith a little over a week before Trump hits the 100-day mark of his presidency, he tweets, \"No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!\" Trump aims to dismantle even more financial regulations with executive orders, directing Treasury officials to take another look at tax rules and oversight of \"too big to fail\" financial institutions. The president also says he intends to unveil a tax reform plan the following week.\n\nDay 93: April 22\n\nTrump announces his plans for the night of the annual dinner of White House correspondents — and the 100th day of his presidency. \"Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!\" he tweets. He makes his his first official visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, awarding a Purple Heart to a soldier injured in Afghanistan. People take part in protests across the country as part of the the March for Science.\n\nDay 94: April 23\n\nAs the 100-day mark approaches, Trump and his staff plan a busy week of events — including a new tax reform outline, a renewed effort to get a health care bill through the House, a high-profile National Rifle Association speech and a 100th day rally in Pennsylvania — all topped by the need for a new spending bill to keep the government open.\n\nDay 95: April 24\n\nTrump speaks with astronauts aboard the International Space Station, lauding NASA's work and praising a crew member who set a record for longest time spent in space. As his administration slaps new sanctions on Syria, Trump tells a group of U.N. diplomats that they need to work harder to confront the Syrian government and other \"serious and growing threats\" such as North Korea. He attempts to atone for past blunders on the history of the Holocaust with a strongly worded Week of Remembrance proclamation, pledging that \"we must never forget\" the annihilation of 6 million Jews by Nazi Germany.\n\nDay 96: April 25\n\nTrump vows to fight anti-Semitic violence during a ceremony at the U.S. Capitol to commemorate the memory of the Holocaust. \"Those who deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to this horrible evil, and we will never be silent,\" Trump says.

The administration pitches a tax reform outline calling for big corporate rate cuts, a simpler tax code and big increases in standard deductions. After briefing senators at a White House meeting, members of Trump's national security team said they're trying to coerce North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons program by cutting off foreign money they need to finance it.\n\nDay 98: April 27\n\nTrump signs an executive order seeking to provide more protections to whistle-blowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs. A week after directing a wide-ranging investigation into whether foreign steel poses a threat to U.S. national security, Trump signs an order doing the same for aluminum. He welcomes Argentinian President Mauricio Macri and first lady Juliana Awada to the White House.\n\nDay 99: April 28\n\nCongress passes a stopgap funding bill to keep the government open another week, eliminating the threat of a shutdown starting on Trump's 100th day in office.

Emig and Paskaly, who have lived on Sanibel for the last two years, said they did not expect it to be unrecognizable.\n\n“I can’t believe the destruction,” Emig told CNN through tears as she and her wife looked at the field of debris in front of them. “It’s incomprehensible that a storm, a hurricane, can wipe us all out like this in just a few hours.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly returned to Sanibel Island by boat to check on their home. CNN\n\nThe walk from the shoreline of Sanibel Island to Emig and Paskaly’s home was less than a mile along a windy, sandy road. On the way, the couple saw a familiar bright blue street sign lying mangled in the mud in a pile of twisted gutters, blankets and branches. They also passed a large banyan tree that had many of its branches twisted and snapped, with one large branch lying in front of a neighbor’s garage.\n\nAs they neared their home, Paskaly said with a heavy sigh: “I’m afraid to turn the corner.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly saw this mangled sign on Sanibel Island as the couple returned to check on their home. CNN\n\nSanibel’s reopening to residents came the same day President Joe Biden visited Florida to see Ian’s destruction first-hand. The President, who received an aerial tour of the damage in Fort Myers, was also briefed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Florida officials on the response to the storm and recovery efforts.\n\n“Today we have one job and only one job,” Biden said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. “That’s to make sure the people of Florida get everything that they need to fully, thoroughly recover.”\n\nEvery single home on Sanibel Island is damaged in one way or another, and people have lost everything in some cases, Vice Mayor Richard Johnson told CNN’s Pamela Brown Wednesday. Ninety-five percent of homes on Sanibel Island have been visited by urban search and rescue teams, Johnson said, adding that the city is now looking forward to rebuilding, which brings its own concerns.\n\n“We’re absolutely concerned about rebuilding. This could happen again, and it will happen again,” Johnson said. “However, we will be prepared. We will rebuild, and we will rebuild stronger and better than we were before.”\n\nAt least 125 people have been reported killed as a result of the storm – 120 of them in Florida and five in North Carolina. As of Tuesday night, Florida data provided to CNN reflected at least partial information for 72 of the state’s storm victims. Of those 72 deaths, drowning was listed as a “possible” or known “circumstance” in the deaths of 40 people.\n\nMore than 1,000 search and rescue personnel have combed through 79,000 structures across the Sunshine State, DeSantis told reporters Tuesday, with more than 2,300 rescues logged.\n\nSearch and Rescue teams will begin secondary searches of damaged and destroyed homes on Sanibel Island Thursday, according to city manager Dana Souza. Teams will not enter homes unless they have reason to believe that someone needs assistance.\n\nBut it’s still unclear how many people remain missing.\n\nOfficials are compiling a list of those who remain unaccounted for, Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said Monday.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\n\nPeople load supplies Tuesday onto a boat in Matlacha, Florida, to be taken to Sanibel Island. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nStatewide, more than 270,000 customers still have no power Wednesday, according to PowerOutage.us, many of them in hard-hit Lee and Charlotte counties. Many schools also remain shuttered, some hospitals are still struggling to provide care and boil-water notices remain in place in some areas.\n\nHurricane Ian hit the area just before tourist season. Johnson said Sanibel will feel an economic impact.\n\n“Unfortunately, this tourist season will be nonexistent,” Johnson said. “We are not going to be prepared to accept our tourists at this time.”\n\n‘How do you even start with this?’\n\nWhen Emig and Paskaly finally made it to their house on Sanibel, they were in awe of the damage.\n\nTheir “dream home” was still standing, but the lower level was “unlivable.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly's pool was covered with metal and wood debris when they returned for the first time a week after Hurricane Ian hit Sanibel Island. CNN\n\nAs Paskaly walked around the debris that was their front yard, Emig looked over the couple’s pool, now covered with warped metal and trees.\n\n“It’s gonna be a long time before we swim in it, huh?” Emig said, adding they need to be careful of displaced alligators.\n\nThe chaotic scene left Paskaly in a trance. She had only expected parts of their screen enclosure to have fallen, she said, covering her mouth – “How do you ever start with this?”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly look at their displaced mailbox amid the destruction outside of their home one week after Hurricane Ian pummeled Sanibel Island. CNN\n\nIn their garage, the couple found an item on top of a shelf filled with water, leading them to believe the surge reached at least 5 feet. The floor was slippery from being covered in sludge. Their Mini Cooper – filled with mold and water – was ruined.\n\n“I knew I was going to lose it, but you just look at all of this and it’s like 5 or 6 feet of water in here and it’s like where do we start?” Emig said through tears.\n\nInside, they discovered their refrigerator in their lower level apartment was on top of the counter and their kitchen island was on its side.\n\nOthers also felt the wrath of Ian. Anddy Garcia, owner of property management company Sanibel Home Concierge, had to tell several clients what they had been dreading to hear: Their homes were beyond saving.\n\n“It’s totally devastating to hear them on the other end of the phone, just gasping for air, and you’re telling them their home was destroyed,” Garcia said. “It’s totally heart-wrenching for me.”\n\nSteve and Lori Schulz rode out the storm at their friends’ house on the island. They were securing homes for neighbors who weren’t on the island, and by the time they finished, they no longer felt like they had time to leave, the couple told CNN.\n\nThe Schulz’s home took on several feet of storm surge and “pretty much everything” in the house is ruined.\n\nDespite all the destruction, Emig told CNN she remained hopeful her community would rebuild. “Sanibel’s full of a lot of working people who care about the island and we’ll be back,” she said. “Sanibel will be back.”\n\nFor now, many homes in that once-tranquil island community “are not livable,” Sanibel Fire Chief William Briscoe said previously, also noting many homes are off their foundations and alligators and snakes are present across the island.\n\nIn addition to the devastation on the island itself, Ian ripped away several parts of the causeway that was Sanibel’s only access to Florida’s mainland, leaving dozens of people stranded and hindering recovery efforts.\n\nOn Wednesday, DeSantis also toured the damage on Sanibel Wednesday for the first time.\n\n“You can go over it in a helicopter and you see damage, but it does not do it justice until you are actually on the ground, and you see concrete utility poles sawed off right in half, massive power lines everywhere, massive amounts of debris,” he said.\n\nOfficials said most electrical poles, transmission lines and wastewater systems remain down, meaning a return to normal is still a while away.\n\nIan damaged the Sanibel Causeway that connects Fort Myers to the island community. Joe Cavaretta/South Florida Sun-Sentinel/AP\n\nIt could take a month or longer just to restore power to some areas of Sanibel and Pine islands, Lee County Electric Cooperative spokesperson Karen Ryan told CNN. “It will be much easier to restore power once we can gain access to the island,” she said.\n\nAn estimated 6,400 people lived in the City of Sanibel as of April 2021, according to the US Census Bureau. The island is also home to a number of hotels and resorts and sees a significant amount of tourists each year.\n\nDeSantis has directed transportation authorities to prioritize the repair of the Sanibel Causeway.\n\nNeighboring Pine Island residents should be able to access their community by car later Wednesday, DeSantis announced, when crews are expected to complete a temporary fix for a part of a damaged bridge washed away in the storm.\n\nResidents lost both their homes and their jobs\n\nAt Salty Sam’s Marina in Fort Myers, owner Darrell Hanson and many of his employees – about 120 at this time of year and up to 200 at the height of tourist season – are working to salvage what they can, some of them dealing with the loss of their livelihoods and personal property.\n\n“In the parking lot, we must have had about 12 feet of water. Everything on the first floor was … destroyed,” said Hanson, who has so far been unable to access his own home on Sanibel Island. “All our gift stores and restaurants and everything, they’ve lost all their inventory. It’s hundreds of thousands of dollars that each business lost.”\n\n“But the employees have all come together,” he said, choking back tears. “They’re all out there working their butt off.”\n\nEmployee Ty Landers, who works on a pirate cruise at the marina, rode out the storm at his family’s home in Fort Myers. Fortunately the home and his family are safe, he said.\n\nBut some of his coworkers weren’t so lucky.\n\n“Many of our employees, even on the pirate ships, my crewmates, they lost their houses, they lost everything,” Landers told CNN. “Hopefully when the time’s right they’ll come back. But right now their lives fell apart, and they’re putting it back together.”\n\nSalty Sam's Marina, which employs about 120 people this time of year, was heavily damaged by Hurricane Ian. CNN\n\nDespite ongoing struggles, ‘there’s hope to rebuild’\n\nMany areas remain under boil water notices since the storm made landfall, damaging critical infrastructure, as well as homes.\n\nResidents of Lee and Charlotte counties – the two counties with the highest death tolls from the hurricane – will be able to get temporary blue coverings with fiber-reinforced sheeting at no cost for their roofs to help reduce further damage, according to a Charlotte County news release.\n\nIn Charlotte County, which is north of Fort Myers, public schools will be closed until further notice after several of its 22 schools were damaged by Ian. “The storm lasted here for over 12 hours, just hammering away. Nothing is safe right now,” Charlotte County public schools spokesperson Mike Riley said.\n\nPublic schools in Collier County are set to open Thursday, according to district spokesperson Chad Oliver, who added he did not know how many kids will show up for classes. More than than 22% of the district’s teachers live in hard-hit Lee County, but Oliver says the district is confident it is ready to reopen with the help of more than 800 substitute teachers.\n\nFlorida hospitals have also been struggling. Emergency departments sustained damage, staffing is impacted as hospital workers were displaced or lost their vehicles, and some facilities lost reliable access to water.\n\n“We were ready, we had our generators all ready. We had plenty of fuel. What we couldn’t anticipate and didn’t anticipate was the loss of water from our utility companies,” said Dr. Larry Antonucci, president and CEO of Lee Health.\n\nMembers of the Miami-Dade Task Force 1 Search and Rescue team look Tuesday through debris for victims in Matlacha, Florida. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nJessica Hernstadt, a resident of Fort Myers Beach in Lee County, said the community “looked like an apocalyptic disaster” when she made her way there after Ian slammed the shore, with cars, pots, pans and clothing littering the area.\n\nHomes the storm tore from their foundations blocked the streets leading to her house, which she found ablaze when she arrived, she told CNN in an interview Wednesday.\n\nLater, combing through the ashes, Hernstadt found just one item unscathed: a candlestick holder her great-grandmother carried in her pockets as she emigrated from Poland to the US.\n\n“It was the simplest, most prized possession that I had, and it gave me a sense of hope, especially today being Yom Kippur,” she said Wednesday. Yom Kippur is the holiest day of the year in Judaism.\n\n“We will survive. Our town will survive, and there’s hope to rebuild,” she said.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Randi Kaye Laura Dolan", "Amir Vera", "Randi Kaye", "Laura Dolan"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}]}

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe controversy over Joe Rogan’s repeated past use of the n-word on his podcast is about more than racist language or cancel culture – it speaks to deeper truths and persistent lies that help define contemporary America. Rogan, who was already under fire earlier this year for being a conduit for misinformation brandished by anti-vaxxers on his popular show, faced immense backlash after a video compilation of him using the n-word, which he said were compiled over a span of 12 years, was widely shared on social media.\n\nPeniel Joseph Kelvin Ma/Tufts University\n\nRogan apologized Saturday and vowed to do better, and Daniel Ek, the chief executive of Spotify – which distributes Rogan’s podcast and invested $100 million dollars to do so, according to the Wall Street Journal – addressed the issue in a memo stating he found Rogan’s words “incredibly hurtful” and inconsistent with company values but did not believe “silencing” Rogan was the answer. Ek also promised to launch an “incremental $100 million” dollar investment designed to elevate marginalized voices on Spotify. Spotify, without detailing specifically why, also removed more than 100 of Rogan’s episodes from the platform, according to JRE Missing, a website that tracks the show.\n\nConservatives who are defending Rogan with cries of free speech are being disingenuous. For one thing, it comes at a moment when conservatives have mastered the art of legislative cancelation, passing laws that threaten to fine and fire teachers who teach aspects of America’s brutal history of racial inequity that might cause discomfort among White students or parents.\n\nThe real issue isn’t about whether to cancel Joe Rogan (although some have advocated for Spotify to end its relationship in wake of the controversy). It is about exposing who Rogan really is and admitting that his brand of conversation, which at times traffics in conspiracy theories, cultural intolerance and blatant racism, attracts millions of avid listeners and corporate sponsors hungry to advertise their wares to such followers. Rogan is, in fact, an agent of these social ills, which he packages and sends out to his audience clothed in the language of moderation and moral equivalence. For example, in addition to his uses of the n-word, Rogan has made waves by suggesting that because “you can never be woke enough … it’ll eventually get to [where] White men are not allowed to talk.” Rogan laughed uproariously when comedian Joey Diaz, one of his guests, described pressuring women into performing oral sex on him. Rogan has horribly and deliberately misgendered a trans MMA fighter. He’s discouraged young people from getting the Covid-19 vaccine, hosted guests who question its validity and given a platform to climate skepticism from controversial clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson.\n\nThe question of “silencing” Rogan is nevertheless a fraught one. In opposition to Rogan’s platforming of Covid misinformation, a wide range of popular musicians, from the legendary rock n roll artist Neil Young to the Generation X soul icon India Arie, have demanded that Spotify remove their music from its site. They did not want their work to share digital space with the loquacious podcaster – who, beyond the n-word and misinformation criticisms, has also helped build the profile of Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes, whose group has used violence to foster political support for a racially intolerant agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, public figures including former President Donald Trump and Republican Governor Ron DeSantis have implored Rogan to stop apologizing for using the n-word. Trump told him to “stop apologizing to the Fake News and Radical Left maniacs and lunatics,” while DeSantis urged, “Do not apologize. Do not kowtow to the mob. Stand up and tell them to pound sand.”\n\nThe far right-wing conservative support for Rogan belies the myth that his show represents a reasonable middle or common ground uniting average Americans untethered to the left-right spectrum of American politics.\n\nThis myth reflects the lies Americans tell themselves about to race, democracy, free speech and capitalism. Rogan’s genius lies in the fact that he presents himself as an everyman throwback to a quieter age – an era without pandemics or Black Lives Matter protests shining a spotlight on racial privilege.\n\nFolks who enjoy Rogan’s political unpredictability, down to earth quality, and frank discussion about politics ignore the fact that he’s one of the wealthiest people in America, that his independent perspective often skews far-right (as evidenced by some of his guests, who have included Roseanne Barr, Ted Nugent, Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens and Steven Crowder) and his everyman demeanor is the perfect shtick for a 21st century pitchman able to convince the have-nots that they share a common history, rapport and destiny with the haves.\n\nNo wonder Trump loves him.\n\nRogan also seems to delight in contradicting himself, posting a now-deleted tweet in 2012 to add fuel to the false birther conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama while also proclaiming Obama to be the best president in his lifetime and insisting that Michelle Obama could defeat Trump in a presidential election.\n\nIn another episode Rogan said aired 11 years ago, he recalled being accidentally dropped off in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Philadelphia with some disbelieving White friends. He likened the situation to being in “Planet of the Apes,” the 1968 science fiction classic starring Charlton Heston as an astronaut who travels in time to a future earth ruled by intelligent simians. Rogan’s comparison of Philadelphia’s Black community to the “Planet of the Apes” is morally reprehensible, politically indefensible, and yes, racist.\n\nRogan apologized for this clip in an Instagram video he posted Saturday, noting that he was trying to “make the story entertaining” but also realized “that’s a racist thing to say.” But his audience of eleven million embraces these seeming contradictions. Rogan’s popularity has increased amid the rightward drift and segmentation of social media and popular culture. He has been consistently able to draw a robust number of guests across the polarized American political spectrum.\n\nEven Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, who is multi-racial, initially defended Rogan – the same podcaster who introduced the leader of Proud Boys. When a writer pointed out Rogan’s multiple uses of the n-word last week, Johnson thanked him, writing, “I was not aware of his N word use prior to my comments, but now I’ve become educated to his complete narrative. Learning moment for me.”\n\nAny public personality attracting effusive support from Trump and DeSantis, two exemplars of racial and cultural intolerance, can not purport to be, as Rogan does, an independent thinker.\n\nRogan’s everyman persona is attractive to millions who view themselves as fed up with perceived liberal and conservative media biases. Yet Rogan, in many instances, amplifies partisan divides by offering an unvarnished platform for some of the worst impulses in American culture. From Proud Boys to anti-vaxxers, Rogan has helped spread misinformation, furthered the coarsening of popular culture and trafficked in a kind of racial bigotry soft-pedaled in some corners of social media as merely the byproduct of speaking one’s mind.\n\nCritics of Rogan have a right, like musicians have, to disassociate themselves from platforms that carry his brand of discourse. That’s not canceling, that’s consumer choice, a right everyone ostensibly enjoys in a free society.\n\nSpotify, in trying to preserve their profits and their image by enabling Rogan and censoring the worst parts of his act (they have removed 113 podcast and counting from his archive) – while also trying to elevate the voices of marginalized groups – is an illustration of how far capitalism will bend to use race and Blackness for its own purposes.\n\nMeanwhile, Rogan’s and Spotify’s ability to monetize the most noxious and racially intolerant parts of American history and culture has, if anything, been amplified, rather than suppressed, by this latest uproar. Political controversy sells, racial controversy even more so, especially when used to fly the banner of free speech.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nJoe Rogan’s platform, it has now been revealed for the world to see, is less a bastion of independence of mind and free expression of thought and more a haven for racial intolerance, sexist insults and the kind of so-called “locker room talk” that made Trump a hero to many among his base – and helped turn Rogan into a social media sensation in the first place.\n\nEnter at your risk or pleasure (or both), but don’t pretend that you don’t know what you’re listening to.", "authors": ["Peniel E.

Stone was behind the “Stop the Steal” movement that falsely claimed Trump won the 2020 election and had close contact with two right-wing extremist groups involved in the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nHearing day 8 recap: What we learned from the eighth Jan. 6 hearings\n\nSince the committee's last hearing in July, the legal landscape for one of the committee's key targets – Trump – has shifted significantly following the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate and a lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Trump, his company and three of his adult children alleging fraud.\n\nWhat happened at Thursday's hearing:\n\nRep. Liz Cheney said 30 individuals asserted their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in testimony before the Jan. 6 committee, and several did so related to questions about their “dealings with Donald Trump directly.”\n\nFormer White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said he was “stunned by the violence” as well as Trump’s “indifference” to it. “I thought he failed at a critical time to be the sort of leader that the nation needed.”\n\nThe committee showed footage of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer asking acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to get Trump to call off the rioters, as well as videos of Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence conferring on the state of the Capitol.\n\nWhite House security officials were “in a state of shock” about the idea of Trump walking from the rally to the Capitol, one official testified, because it meant the event was no longer a rally, but “this would move from a normal, democratic, public event into something else.”\n\nBy 9 a.m. Jan. 6, the Secret Service noted some of the crowd was gathered outside a security perimeter at the rally and speculated “they have stuff that can’t come through? Would prob be an issue with this crowd.”\n\nRepublican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel said Trump called her, along with John Eastman, who explained to McDaniel the need for the RNC to help Trump’s campaign gather “contingent electors” in case the results of any elections changed. That was part of fake electors scheme, Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., explained.\n\nTrump’s “false victory speech” was planned well in advance of Election Day, regardless of results, committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren said.\n\nTrump confidant Roger Stone told Danish filmmakers on Nov. 1, 2020, that then-president needed to declare victory no matter the results. “Possession is nine-tenths of the law,” he said.\n\nJan. 6 committees votes to subpoena Donald Trump\n\nThe House Committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol took the extraordinary step of subpoenaing Donald Trump, voting unanimously 9-0 to call the former president to appear before Congress to testify.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, vice chairwoman of the committee, said the committee has enough evidence to “make criminal referrals for multiple individuals” to the Justice Department and recommend policy changes to Congress but a “key task” remains.\n\n\"We must seek the testimony, under oath, of Jan. 6's central player,\" said Cheney, vice chair of the committee. “We are obligated to seek answers directly from the man who set this all in motion.”\n\nIt’s very likely Trump will ignore the committee’s subpoena, similar to Steve Bannon, Mark Meadows and other Trump aides who have refused to testify.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nRaskin: Trump excused and glorified Jan. 6 attack\n\nCommittee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., blamed an unrepetant Trump for the attack on the Capitol building.\n\n“These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously and viciously stripped away from great Patriots,” Raskin said, reading a tweet from Trump.\n\n“Trump was telling us that the Vice President, the Congress and all the injured and wounded cops, some of whom are with us today, got what was coming to us,” said Raskin. “According to Trump, January 6 should not be a day that lives in shame and infamy in our history, but rather in glory.”\n\n“Trump did nothing to stop the deadly violence for obvious reasons,” Raskin continued. “He thought it was all justified. He incited it and he supported it.”\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nChao: It was impossible for me to continue given my personal values\n\nThe Jan, 6 committee is playing up criticism of Trump from fellow Republicans, a presentation that included new testimony from Elaine Chao, who resigned from the Cabinet right after the insurrection.\n\n“I think the events at the Capitol were shocking and it was something that as I mentioned that I cannot put aside,\" Chao said on videotape.\n\nChao, who is married to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, told the committee \"it was impossible for me to continue given my personal values. I came as an immigrant. I believe in the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nTrump has often criticized Chao, and made a racist crack about her just this month.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump tweet about Pence ignited security concerns, calls for execution\n\nWithin a minute of former President Donald Trump sending out a tweet calling Vice President Mike Pence weak for not overturning the results of the electoral college, a Secret Service agent became concerned about the vice president’s safety.\n\n“POTUS just tweeted about Pence, probably not going to be good for Pence,” the agent wrote in a message shared by the Jan. 6 committee. Five hours later, another Secret Service message read, ““Potus said he he lacked courage. Over 24k likes in under 2mins.”\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said the tweet ignited “violent hashtags” such as “execute Mike Pence.” Anika Collier Navaroli, a Twitter employee who testified in front of the committee, said, Twitter users were “literally calling for his execution.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nNew video shows Pelosi on phone with Pence discussing resuming election certification\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee showed never before seen video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling Vice President Mike Pence during the attack on the Capitol to determine whether lawmakers would be able to return to the building to resume certification of the Electoral College votes.\n\n“We’re trying to figure out how we can get this job done today,” Pelosi said on a call to Pence.\n\nPence later told Pelosi that law enforcement officials believed the House and Senate would be able to reconvene that evening.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\n‘They’re your people,’ McCarthy told Trump during attack\n\nRepublican House Leader Kevin McCarthy was among those urging former President Donald Trump to call back his supporters who were attacking the Capitol, according to testimony to the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nIn a phone call as the attack was happening, according to a witness, Trump told McCarthy that the rioters were members of the group Antifa.\n\nMcCarthy responded: “No, they’re your people.”\n\nTrump fired back to McCarthy, “I guess they’re just more upset about the election than you are.”\n\nThe committee showed video of McCarthy’s congressional staff in hiding as the attack unfolded.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nPelosi: 'Clean up the poo poo'\n\nThe Jan. 6 hearing featured same-day video of congressional leaders reacting to the attack on the U.S. Capitol, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi lamenting the rioters' damage to the U.S. Capitol – including defecation.\n\nIt will take time to \"clean up the poo poo that they’re making ... literally and figuratively in the Capitol,\" Pelosi said at one point.\n\nPelosi is shown speaking on the phone with local leaders about the security situation, saying at one point: \"Do you believe this?\"\n\nChuck Schumer, the Senate's top Democrat, is seen at one point telling the acting attorney general Jeff Rosen to tell President Donald Trump to call off the protesters at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPelosi, Schumer plead for National Guard reinforcements\n\nThe committee played never-before-seen video of congressional leaders calling for military reinforcements to the Capitol Police and how to resume counting Electoral College votes after evacuating the House and Senate chambers under siege from the rampaging mob.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was walking in a hallway at 2:23 p.m. – soon after the mob breached the building – and talking on the phone. “We have got to finish the proceedings or else they will have a complete victory,” she said.\n\nShe and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are shown at 2:57 p.m. urging military leaders to send National Guard troops from Maryland and Virginia. Pelosi urged military officials to treat the situation as if the White House or Pentagon were under siege.\n\n“We need them there now,” Schumer said at 3:46 p.m.\n\nTroops didn’t arrive until after 5 p.m.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchumer and Pelosi called multiple officials to send help to Capitol\n\nIn new footage revealed by the Jan. 6 committee, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer made calls to various officials to send help to the Capitol as rioters entered the building.\n\n“I’m gonna call up the effin Secretary of DOD,” said Schumer, before calling acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller and tellnig him: “We have some senators who are still in their hideaways. We need massive personnel now, can you get the Maryland National Guard too?”\n\nPelosi contacted Mayor of Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan and Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam.\n\n“They’re breaking windows and going in, obviously ransacking our offices and all the rest of that,” said Pelosi in a call to Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. “That’s nothing. The concern we have about personal safety just transcends everything but the fact is that they’re breaking the law in many different ways.”\n\n“Quite frankly, much of it at the instigation of the President of the United States,” said Pelosi.\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nTrump watched Fox News after learning about violence, Raskin says\n\nTrump watched Fox News in a dining room attached to the Oval Office for 2 hours and 40 minutes after he was told that there was violence ongoing at the U.C. Capitol, said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.\n\nTrump returned to the White House at 1:20 p.m. that day, Raskin said, and “was told right then about the onset of violence at the Capitol.” He went to the dining room and stayed until about 4 p.m. as he watched the event unfold.\n\n“President Trump refused entreaties from his closest advisors and family members to tell his supporters to stand down and leave the Capitol,” Raskin said, referencing testimony from White House staff, including Pat Cippollone, Cassidy Hutchinson, and “an employee with national security employee duties,” among others.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nSecret Service was ‘concerned’ Trump would go to Capitol even after returning to White House\n\nEven after Trump returned to the White House after his speech on the morning of Jan. 6, the former president wanted to lead his supporters into the Capitol, according to Secret Service agents and White House officials.\n\n“Front office concerned about OTR to (the Capitol)” one Secret Service agent wrote in an email to Bobby Engel, the head of the president’s security detail. OTR is short for “off the record.”\n\nFormer Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany testified to the Jan. 6 committee that Trump wanted to physically walk to the Capitol or ride “the beast,” the nickname for presidential limousine, if he needed.\n\n“The people sworn to protect the safety of the president of the United States and who routinely put themselves in harm's way were compared this was a bad idea,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., one of the committee members.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nJan. 6 panel to recall witnesses, conduct further depositions based on Secret Service material\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee will be reviewing testimony regarding potential obstruction, including testimony about advice given not to tell the committee about the events surrounding Jan. 6, Rep. Pete Aguilar said during the hearing.\n\nThe committee plans to obtain further information from witnesses who provided testimony and conduct further investigative depositions after obtaining “voluminous” material from the Secret Service.\n\nAguilar said the committee will provide greater details in their final report.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nTrump’s physical altercation with Secret Service was ‘water cooler talk’ in White House\n\nTrump’s physical altercation with the Secret Service on Jan. 6 later became “water cooler talk” among White House employees according to committee member Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.\n\nAn anonymous former White House employee told the committee that “they remember hearing in the days after Jan. 6, how angry the President was when he was in a limo that afternoon.”\n\nSecret Service Agent Robert Engel and former White House aide Anthony Ornato “expressed to me that the President was irate, you know, on the drive up,” the employee told the committee.\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nAgencies obtained tips of attack prior to Jan. 6\n\nIntelligence about the Jan. 6 attack was available to Secret Service and others in the White House more than 10 days before the march to the Capitol, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee found evidence that Trump was aware of the risk of violence along with the FBI, U.S. Capitol Police, Metropolitan police and other agencies through intelligence prior to the attack.\n\nTrump’s senior advisors at the Department of Justice and FBI received an intelligence summary days before Jan. 6 indicating certain people traveling to Washington were making plans to attack the Capitol.\n\nThe intelligence cited online calls to occupy federal buildings, rhetoric about invading the Capitol and plans to engage in political violence, Schiff said.\n\nOn a call with Trump’s White House national security staff in early January of 2021, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense David Norquist warned about an attack on the Capitol.\n\n“Norquist says during one of these calls the greatest threat is a direct assault on the Capitol, I’ll never forget it,” Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an audio recording played during the hearing.\n\nIn a report from the Secret Service field office, a tip that had been received by the FBI included information from a source that said the Proud Boys planned to march armed into Washington and outnumber police.\n\n“Their plan is to literally kill people. Please, please take this tip seriously and investigate further,” the source said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nSecret Service knew the crowd had weapons 'as early as the night before'\n\nThe Secret Service knew before the attack on the Capitol that the crowd forming for Trump’s rally had guns, as early as the night before the attack, according to evidence presented by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nA Secret Service briefing said that in demonstrations on the night of Jan. 5, 2021, there were “multiple weapon offenses to include Carrying a handgun w/out a license, possessing a high capacity feeding device, and unregistered ammunition.” The following day, the Secret Service and other federal agencies would find a similar situation.\n\nSchiff said the Federal Protective Service, a law enforcement agency that protects federal buildings, found a man with a handgun in his waistband. The U.S. Parks Police arrested a man with a rifle in front of the World War Two memorial that day, he said.\n\nSecret Service agents Jan. 6, 2021 texted with each other about all the weapons, with one saying, “With so many weapons found so far, you wonder how many are unknown. Could be sporty after dark.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\n‘Calm before the storm,’ Secret Service member texted Jan. 6 morning\n\nSecret Service members exchanged texts on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021 warning each other of weapons spotted among supporters of President Donald Trump and the threat of violence at the Capitol.\n\n“Calm before the storm,” one Secret Service agent texted another early that morning, according to evidence reviewed by the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nAnother wrote in a Secret Service chat, “Pulling up live-streams and watching the crazies.”\n\nBy 9:30 a.m. on Jan. 6, Secret Service agents reported more than 25,000 people outside the Ellipse, where Trump later gave a speech that encouraged his loyalists to march to the Capitol.\n\nAgents observed some Trump supporters with guns and others wearing body army, ballistic helmets, pepper spray, and holding riot shields.\n\n“The documents we obtained from the Secret Service make clear that the crowd outside the magnetometers was armed and the agents knew it,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., one of the committee members.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nGOP chairwoman was pressured on fake electors\n\nOne of the blockbuster witnesses the committee presented on Thursday was Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who testified via videotape how Trump, along with his attorney John Eastman, tried to recruit her to join the plan to overturn the 2020 results.\n\nThe plan, based on a debunked legal theory, relied on key states finding Trump-supporting electors who would go to Washington to swing the Electoral College.\n\nMcDaniel told the committee how Trump called her and turned the phone over to Eastman, who explained it was important for the national GOP to get behind the plan and help “gather these contingent electors.”\n\nThe plan also required former Vice President Mike Pence to toss out the real electors, which he refused to do and later called the idea “un-American.”\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nAfter Georgia call, Meadows said Trump ‘knew’ he lost 2020 election\n\nAfter Trump’s phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger where Trump pressured him to just “find 11,780 votes,” former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Trump “knew” he already lost the 2020 election.\n\n“He can’t possibly think we’re gonna pull this off. That call was crazy,” former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson told Mark Meadows after the call ended.\n\n“He (Meadows) started shaking his head and he’s like ‘No Cass, he knows this is over,'” Hutchinson recounted. “He knows he lost.”\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nCommittee: Trump knew he lost, but still lied to overturn the election\n\nIf there's one point the committee wants to drive home, it is this: Trump knew he had lost the 2020 election, yet still made improper - and possibly illegal - efforts to overturn that loss to President Joe Biden.\n\nThe hearing has included videos from a variety of former aides, from Attorney General William Barr to lower-level lawyers, explaining why Trump's claims of voter fraud were mistakes or simply lies.\n\nWho's on : Meet the members of the January 6 House select committee ahead of first public hearing Thursday\n\n“Donald Trump maliciously repeated this nonsense to a wide audience over and over again,\" said Rep. Elaine Luria. D-Va. \"His intent was to deceive.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nScalia told Trump to concede to Biden\n\nEugene Scalia, the Trump administration’s Labor secretary, told the committee he spoke with Trump on Dec. 14, 2020 – the day Electoral College votes for president were certified, and told him the time had come to concede.\n\n“I conveyed to him that I thought it was time for him to acknowledge that President Biden had prevailed in the election,” said Scalia, the son of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nScalia said the campaign was over if legal challenges were exhausted and fraud not established.\n\n“Unfortunately I believed what had to be done was concede the outcome,” Scalia said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump rushes to complete unfinished business, signs memo for large-scale troop withdrawal\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger said once Trump knew he had lost the election, he rushed to complete unfinished business.\n\nHe cited how Trump acted immediately and signed an order on Nov. 11 requiring immediate withdrawal of troops from Somalia and Afghanistan to be completed before the Biden inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\n“I personally thought it was militarily not feasible, nor wise,” said Gen, Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nGen. Keith Kellogg, the national security adviser for the president, said in video testimony he thought the memo “was a tremendous disservice to the nation.”\n\n“An immediate departure that that memo said would have been catastrophic,” Kellogg said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nAide: Angry Trump told Meadows 'I don’t want people to know that we lost.'\n\nAfter the Supreme Court stopped his lawsuit related to the 2020 election from going forward, Trump became angry and tried to stop people from finding out that they lost the election, according to evidence presented by the Jan. 6 committee.\n\n“Just FYI potus is pissed – breaking news – supreme court denied his law suit,” an email from a Secret Service agent on Dec. 11, 2020 said. “He is livid now”\n\nPOTUS is an acronym for President of the United States.\n\nFormer White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson said she and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows crossed paths with a “raging” and “fired up” Trump that day as he walked out of the oval office, who then told Meadows something to the effect of, “I don’t want people to know we lost, Mark. This is embarrassing. We need to figure it out. I don’t want people to know that we lost.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nTrump campaign aides repeatedly told him voter fraud claims were baseless\n\nTrump’s campaign aides exhaustively reviewed each of the former president’s baseless claims of voter fraud but found nothing to invalidate the results of the 2020 election results, according to witnesses who spoke with the committee.\n\n“There’s no ‘there’ there,” Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows told the former president, according to testimony.\n\nTrump campaign manager Bill Stepien also relayed the reality to the former president. The Trump campaign team lost 65 lawsuits between the November election and Jan. 20 that sought to overturn election results.\n\n“It's an easier job be telling the president about, you know, wild allegations. It’s a harder job to be telling him on the back end that, yeah, that wasn't true,” Stepien said to the committee.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nAides said Trump admitted he lost 2020 election\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., one of two GOP members on the panel, outlined how after the election the former president’s campaign aides knew his chances of pulling out a victory were slim.\n\nThe committee showed a videotape testimony by former Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller, who said how they told Trump, “the odds of us prevailing… were very small.”\n\nKinzinger then played a clip of Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, saying how he lost and letting the “next guy” deal with foreign affairs.\n\nOther former White House aides also told the committee how Trump acknowledged losing but wanted to keep fighting.\n\nAlyssa Farah, a former White House communications director, said a week after the election was called, she “popped in the Oval (Office)” and that Trump said: “Can you believe I lost to this f-ing guy?”\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nThe committee showed clips of Roger Stone, a Republican political operative who is a confidant of Donald Trump, from a Danish documentary from director Christoffer Guldbrandsen\n\n“I really do suspect it’ll still be up in the air,” Stone said of his expectations for election night 2020. “When that happens, the key thing to do is to claim victory. Possession is nine-tenths of the law. No, we won. You’re wrong.”\n\nStone was previously convicted of lying to Congress and other crimes, and sentenced to three years in prison. Trump pardoned him Dec. 23, 2020. Stone refused to answer questions from the committee by invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nBut Stone met with Trump allies at the Willard Hotel near the White House on Jan. 5 and 6, according to Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. And he posted his advice to Trump on social media Dec. 27.\n\n“I also told the president exactly how he can appoint a special counsel with full subpoena power to ensure those who are attempting to steal the 2020 election through voter fraud are charged and convicted and ensure Donald Trump continues as our president,” Stone said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nStone had close associations with Oath Keepers and Proud Boys\n\nIn the days leading up to and the day of the Capitol attack, longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone maintained direct connections to the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, far-right extremist groups that were on the Capitol on Jan. 6, according to the panel.\n\nMembers of those groups have been charged with seditious conspiracy – conspiring against the U.S. government.\n\n“Multiple associates of Roger Stone from both the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have been charged with this crime,” said committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.\n\nLofgren pointed to Stone’s associates who are currently under trial or who have already plead guilty to charges of seditious conspiracy such as Joshua James, leader of the Alabama Oath Keepers who pled guilty earlier this year.\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nPence staff did not want to declare victory prior to official results\n\nStaff members to Vice President Mike Pence were concerned with what Trump might do on election night regarding the results of the election, Rep. Zoe Lofgren said. She added that the vice president's staff took steps to ensure Pence would not echo a false victory announcement from Trump.\n\nThe vice president’s staff indicated there was a possibility that there would be a declaration of victory, prior to election results being known, within the White House, she said.\n\nVice President Pence’s counsel Greg Jacob worked with Chief of Staff Mark Short to avoid Vice President Pence from being thrust into a position of having to comment on the election results without efficient information.\n\n“It is essential that the vice president not be perceived by public as having decided questions concerning disputed electoral votes prior to the full development of all relevant facts,” according to a memo sent on election day that the Jan. 6 committee obtained from the National Archives.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nDraft statement ahead of election urged Trump to declare victory\n\nAn outside advisor to former President Donald Trump sent a draft statement to aides Molly Michael and Dan Scavino days before the 2020 election with language Trump could use to declare victory.\n\n“We had an election today – and I won,” the draft statement from Tom Fitton sent Oct. 31 said. “The ballots counted by the Election Day deadline show the American people have bestowed up on me the great honor of reelection to President of the United States.”\n\nThere is no deadline to count ballots only on Election Day, and “everyone knew that ballot counting would lawfully continue past Election Day, said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. “Claiming that the counting on election night must stop was, as we now know, a key part of President Trump’s premeditated plan.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nLofgren: Trump's declaration of victory was part of plan to steal the election\n\nThe committee is revisiting one of the famous events of Election Night 2020 – Trump's false declaration of victory.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., noted that Trump and aides planned their \"victory speech\" well in advance, trying to convince Americans that the election was over and further counting of mail-in ballots was an effort to rig the result.\n\nCalling the false declaration part of an effort to steal the election, Lofgren noted that allies like Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, and Brad Parscale helped prepare Trump's premature declaration of victory.\n\n“It was a premeditated plan by the president to declare victory no matter what the actual result was,\" she said. \"He made a plan to stay in office before Election Day.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump had ‘pre-meditated plan’ to reject election results, committee says\n\nTrump campaign advisors told the former president on election night that it was premature to declare victory but he did anyway as part of a “pre-meditated plan,” according to the committee.\n\n“It was far too early to many any calls like that,” Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien told the committee in videotaped testimony.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a committee member, said Trump planned to exploit a “red mirage” that would show him ahead of Joe Biden before mail-ballots were counted. Trump attacked mail-ballots throughout the campaign, giving Biden a massive advantage among voters who voted absentee.\n\nAnd yet Trump advisors advised the former president in the months before the election that mail-ballots could actually help him win.\n\n“Mail-in ballots can be a good thing,” Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner told the committee, describing what was told to Trump\n\nStepien gave a similar account to the committee but said “the president’s mind was made up.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nCheney: Trump wasn’t ‘dupe’\n\nIn a blistering opening statement, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who serves as the panel's vice chair, warned that if some sort of action isn’t taken against the former president “another Jan. 6 could happen again.”\n\n\"President Trump knew from unassailable sources that his election fraud claims were false. He admitted he had lost the election,\" she said.\n\nCheney, who lost her reelection bid in a GOP primary to a Trump-backed contender in August, has been a chief target of the former president’s ire. She reiterated during Thursday’s hearing how the former president was solely responsible for the attack.\n\n\"There is no defense that Donald Trump was duped or irrational,” she said. “No president can defy the rule of law and act this way in a constitutional republic—period.\"\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nCheney says “no guarantee” institutions will hold next time\n\nVice Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., warned of future presidencies that could emulate Trump’s efforts to overturn the election.\n\n“A key lesson of this investigation is this: our institutions only hold when men and women of good faith make them hold, regardless of the political cost,” said Cheney.\n\n“Any future president inclined to attempt what Donald Trump did in 2020 has now learned not to install people who could stand in the way,” Cheney warned.\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nCommittee to present evidence from Secret Service\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee will present “new materials produced to the committee by the Secret Service,” Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said Thursday.\n\nThe committee found out after subpoenaing Secret Service records earlier this year that the agency had deleted text messages that staff made on Jan. 5 and 6, leading the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general to launch a criminal investigation.\n\nHowever, since the last hearing, the committee received about 800,000 pages of documents from the Secret Service, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in September.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nCheney: Trump ‘central cause’ of Jan. 6 Capitol attack\n\nThe committee will explore during the hearing former President Donald Trump’s state of mind, intent and motivations in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to the vice chairwoman, Rep. Liz Cheney.\n\nShe said Trump made his claims of a stolen election without evidence in hand and then spurred aides to spread lies about fraud.\n\n“The vast weight of the evidence so far has shown us that the central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, Donald Trump, who many others followed,” said Cheney, R-Wyo. “None of this would have happened without him. He was personally and substantially involved in all of it.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nThompson hints at 'further investigative action' by the committee\n\nCommittee chairman Bennie Thompson previewed coming attractions by noting that this hearing is a also a \"business meeting\" – meaning the committee could take votes today on future investigative steps.\n\n\"In addition to presenting evidence, we can potentially hold a committee vote on further investigative action based upon that evidence,\" Thompson said.\n\nPossible actions range from new subpoenas to criminal referrals to the Justice Department.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTestimony came mostly from Republicans, chairman says\n\nThe evidence obtained by the Jan. 6 committee is not partisan and testimony came almost entirely from Republicans, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in his opening statement.\n\nThompson said testimony came from former President Donald Trump’s closest aides and advisors, the highest officials in the Department of Justice, Republican state officials, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and members of Trump’s own family, among others.\n\n“It’s tough for any congressional investigation to obtain evidence of what we’ve seen, least of all such a detailed view into a president’s inner circle,” Thompson said.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nJan. 6 panel promises ‘never-before-seen footage’ before hearing begins\n\nThe House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol says it will show “never-before-seen footage” during Thursday’s public hearing and “more details about the ongoing threat to American democracy.”\n\nThat’s according to a tweet from the Jan. 6 committee posted shortly before the hearing is set to begin at 1 p.m. EDT.\n\nThursday will mark the 9th hearing of the committee, which has worked to highlight the central role former President Donald Trump played ahead of and during the attack.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nWhat is the future for Jan. 6 committee members?\n\nWeeks away from the midterms, seven Jan. 6 committee members are gearing up for key races in their home districts while three others will not be returning to Congress next term.\n\nCommittee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., was defeated in Wyoming’s GOP primary race this August against Trump-backed candidate Harriet Hageman.\n\nBoth Republican Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger and Democrat Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida announced did not seek reelection.\n\nThe remaining committee members face bids to keep their seats on Nov. 8.\n\nCommittee chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., faces GOP military veteran Brian Flowers, who won the Republican primary earlier this summer.\n\nIn Virginia, Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria is running against Navy veteran and Virginia state Sen. Jen Kiggans in Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin is running against republican Gregory Coll, a rocket scientist, to keep his seat in Maryland’s 8th Congressional District.\n\nIn California, Democrats Adam Schiff, Pete Aguilar and Zoe Lofgren are facing off against Republican primary winners to remain in office.\n\nWho are the members of the January 6 committee?\n\nThe committee is composed of nine members of the House — seven Democrats and two Republicans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., appointed each member.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi serves as the committee chair. He previously worked on legislation to create a bipartisan commission to investigate Jan. 6, but it died in the Senate. Thompson, who also serves as chair of the Homeland Security Committee, sued Trump after Jan. 6 and accused the president of inciting the attack and conspiring with extremist groups.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., serves as the vice chair and is one of two Republicans on the committee. Cheney condemned Trump for his role in the attack and voted to impeach him, resulting in her being ousted from GOP leadership for criticizing the former president and those who remain loyal to him.\n\nIllinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger serves as the other Republican on the committee. Kinzinger was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. He has condemned members of his own party and has been an outspoken member of the GOP.\n\nAlso on the committee are Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Adam Schiff of California, who both served as lead impeachment managers for Trump’s first and second impeachments.\n\nOther Democrat House members include Stephanie Murphy of Florida who co-chairs the Blue Dog Coalition; Pete Aguilar of California, the only Latino representative on the committee; Zoe Lofgren of California, who was involved in prosecuting one of Trump’s impeachment trials and retired Navy commander Elaine Luria of Virginia.\n\nWho else is the committee seeking to testify?\n\nThe committee sought testimony from Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, specifically over a phone call Trump made to Vos asking to overturn the results of the election.\n\nThe committee expressed interest in speaking again with two Secret Service officials who protected Trump – Anthony Ornato and Robert Engel – after former Trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony.\n\nNeither have testified under oath. Cheney said the committee received 800,000 pages of communication from the Secret Service after committee members filed a subpoena in July for text messages reportedly deleted.\n\nThe committee also requested former House Speaker Newt Gingrich provide information related to Jan. 6.\n\nWho has testified since the last hearing?\n\nMembers of the committee interviewed additional witnesses since the last public hearing in July.\n\nThe committee heard from Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, on Sept. 29. She voluntarily agreed to appear before the committee and repeated claims the 2020 election was stolen during her testimony.\n\nThomas's lawyer said she voiced concerns over election fraud, condemned the violence on Jan. 6 and answered the committee's questions.\n\nThe committee also heard from Kelli Ward, the head of Arizona’s Republican Party, who declined to answer questions during her subpoenaed testimony, according to a government attorney. Ward was part of a group that cast fake electoral votes for Trump after he lost the state.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee sought a log of her phone calls and text messages.

They also demonstrate how he played a key role in the attempts to stop Biden’s certification on January 6.\n\nThe never-before-seen texts include messages from Trump’s family – daughter Ivanka Trump, son-in-law Jared Kushner and son Donald Trump Jr. – as well as White House and campaign officials, Cabinet members, Republican Party leaders, January 6 rally organizers, Rudy Giuliani, My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell, Sean Hannity and other Fox hosts. There are also text exchanges with more than 40 current and former Republican members of Congress, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\nThe texts include everything from plans to fight the election results to surprising and unexpected reactions on January 6 from some of Trump’s staunchest allies. At 2:28 p.m., Greene, the conservative firebrand who had helped to plan the congressional objections that day, texted Meadows with an urgent plea for help as the violence was unfolding at the Capitol.\n\n“Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn’t the way to solve anything,” Greene wrote. Meadows does not appear to reply.\n\nMore messages flooded in.\n\n“Mark: he needs to stop this, now. Can I do anything to help?” Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former acting White House chief of staff, texted Meadows.\n\n“It’s really bad up here on the hill. They have breached the Capitol,” Georgia Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk wrote.\n\n“The president needs to stop this ASAP,” texted GOP Rep. William Timmons of South Carolina.\n\n“POTUS is engaging,” Meadows sent in response to Loudermilk. “We are doing it,” he texted to Timmons.\n\n“Thanks. This doesn’t help our cause,” Loudermilk replied.\n\nShortly after, Donald Trump Jr. weighed in: “This his(sic) one you go to the mattresses on. They will try to fuck his entire legacy on this if it gets worse.”\n\n“TELL THEM TO GO HOME !!!” texted Trump’s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus.\n\nHeated rhetoric and conspiracy theories\n\nThe text messages CNN obtained begin on Election Day, November 3, 2020. Even before the election was called, Meadows was inundated with conspiracy theories about election fraud, strategies to challenge the results and pleas for Trump to keep fighting. The messages – from GOP activists, donors, Republican members of Congress and state party officials – appear to act as an echo chamber affirming Trump’s false claims that the election was stolen. For months leading up to Election Day, Trump had claimed the only way he could lose was if the election was rigged.\n\nPreviously disclosed text messages showed that former Trump administration Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., each texted Meadows on November 4 and 5 with ideas for overturning the election.\n\nOn November 7, hours before the election was called, Perry texted Meadows again: “We have the data driven program that can clearly show where the fraud was committed. This is the silver bullet.”\n\nWhile Perry has previously denied CNN reporting about his text messages to Meadows, CNN has confirmed it’s his cell phone and he signed this text, “Rick Perry,” including his number.\n\nOther texts, however, include hints of doubt expressed by members of Trump’s team and even Meadows himself about the veracity of conspiracy theories being spread by Trump’s “kraken” team – outside attorneys working for Trump that included Giuliani and Sidney Powell.\n\nSome key congressional allies who worked with Trump’s campaign initially in its efforts to overturn the election, such as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, ultimately soured on the approach as the January 6 congressional certification neared, CNN previously reported.\n\nThe texts also show how Trump allies were quick to deflect responsibility for the January 6 attack. Shortly after pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol, one of his top aides began crafting a counter-narrative.\n\nAt 3:45 p.m., Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller suggested to Meadows and Trump aide Dan Scavino that Trump should tweet: “Call me crazy, but ideas for two tweets from POTUS: 1) Bad apples, likely ANTIFA or other crazed leftists, infiltrated today s peaceful protest over the fraudulent vote count. Violence is never acceptable! MAGA supporters embrace our police and the rule of law and should leave the Capitol now! 2) The fake news media who encouraged this summer s violent and radical riots are now trying to blame peaceful and innocent MAGA supporters for violent actions. This isn’t who we are! Our people should head home and let the criminals suffer the consequences!”\n\nTrump’s allies in Congress appeared to get the message. At 3:52 p.m., Greene told Meadows: “Mark we don’t think these attackers are our people. We think they are Antifa. Dressed like Trump supporters.”\n\nFive minutes later, Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, texted Meadows: “Cap Police told me last night they’d been warned that today there’d be a lot of Antifa dressed in red Trump shirts & hats & would likely get violent.”\n\nIn the 16 months since January 6, hundreds of indictments have shown nearly all of those who breached the Capitol were in fact pro-Trump supporters.\n\nWhile Greene was alarmed on January 6, by the next day she was apologizing that the efforts to block Biden’s certification had failed.\n\n“Yesterday was a terrible day. We tried everything we could in our objection to the 6 states. I’m sorry nothing worked. I don’t think that President Trump caused the attack on the Capitol. It’s not his fault,” she wrote the morning of January 7. “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.”\n\nMeadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) wears a \"Trump Won\" face mask as she arrives on the floor of the House to take her oath of office as a newly elected member of the 117th House of Representatives in Washington, U.S., January 3, 2021. Erin Scott/Reuters\n\nGreene is currently facing a legal challenge to disqualify her from running for Congress because of her alleged role in January 6. In court testimony Friday, the Georgia Republican repeatedly deflected or said she didn’t remember what she had said around the events of January 6. The Meadows text logs offer a new glimpse into what she was telling the White House chief of staff in real time.\n\nOn December 31, Greene reached out to Meadows for advice about how to prepare for objections to certifying the election on January 6.\n\n“Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,” Greene wrote. “I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board. And we need to lay out the best case for each state.”\n\nMeadows does not appear to respond.\n\nBy January 17, Greene was suggesting ways to keep Trump in office, telling Meadows there were several Republicans in Congress who still wanted the then-President to declare martial law, which had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month earlier.\n\nGreene texted: “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law. I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!”\n\nAgain, Meadows does not appear to respond.\n\nWhat Meadows turned over\n\nMeadows provided the cache of 2,319 messages to the January 6 committee in December 2021. But soon after, he stopped cooperating and refused to appear for a deposition. Ultimately, the House voted to hold the former White House chief of staff in contempt of Congress. The Justice Department has not yet announced whether it will charge Meadows.\n\nMeadows has sued the House committee in an attempt to block the congressional subpoenas. And in a late-night court filing on Friday, the committee responded with new details revealing Meadows was warned ahead of time that January 6 could turn violent, according to testimony from Cassidy Hutchison, one of Meadows’ former White House aides.\n\nIn addition, the committee released text messages Meadows exchanged with Republican members of Congress, including texts with Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania about a scheme to replace Justice Department leaders who opposed Trump’s claims of election fraud.\n\nIn late December, Perry reached out to Meadows, connecting him to then-DOJ official Jeffrey Clark, who was pushing unfounded claims of voter fraud inside the Justice Department. Trump was considering firing the acting attorney general and installing Clark instead. Clark invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 100 times when he spoke to the January 6 committee in February.\n\nOn December 26, Perry texted Meadows, “Mark, just checking in as time continues to count down. 11 days to 1/6 and 25 days to inauguration. We gotta get going!”\n\n“Mark, you should call Jeff,” he continued. “I just got off the phone with him and he explained to me why the principal deputy won’t work especially with the FBI. They will view it as as (sic) not having the authority to enforce what needs to be done.”\n\n“I got it,” Meadows responded. “I think I understand. Let me work on the deputy position.”\n\nOn December 28, Perry reached out again: “Did you call Jeff Clark?” Meadows does not appear to respond.\n\nMeadows withheld more than 1,000 messages from the committee on claims of privilege, the panel said in Friday’s court filing. In his lawsuit, Meadows’ attorney argued the former White House chief of staff “has been put in the untenable position of choosing between conflicting privilege claims.”\n\nHannity to Meadows: ‘Yes sir’\n\nIn addition to the texts the committee has released, CNN and other news organizations have previously published selections of text messages Meadows received from Lee, Roy, Trump Jr., Perry and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ wife, Ginni Thomas.\n\nThe logs obtained by CNN include numerous messages from official White House cell phone numbers. Some have been identified by CNN, others are unknown.\n\nThere are also numerous group texts with Trump’s inner circle. The various group chats include Meadows, Ivanka Trump, Trump Jr. and Kushner, as well as top advisers such as Hope Hicks, campaign manager Bill Stepien, Miller and Scavino, among others.\n\nSome texts only include links to news reports and social media. Others appear to contain content that was cut-and-pasted and forwarded. The logs do not contain images or attachments.\n\nSupporters of U.S. President Donald Trump watch a video featuring Fox host Sean Hannity ahead of Trump's arrival to a campaign rally in Michigan on October 30, 2020. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nMeadows’ messages also include dozens of exchanges with Fox hosts, as well as journalists from the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, Politico, Bloomberg, NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN.\n\nAmong Meadows’ most frequent interactions were those with Fox’s Sean Hannity, a well-known friend of Trump. Throughout the logs, Hannity both gives advice and asks for direction.\n\nOn the afternoon of Election Day, Hannity texted Meadows to ask about turnout in North Carolina.\n\nMeadows responded: “Stress every vote matters. Get out and vote.”\n\n“Yes sir,” Hannity replied. “On it. Any place in particular we need a push.”\n\n“Pennsylvania. NC AZ,” Meadows wrote. “Nevada.”\n\n“Got it. Everywhere,” Hannity said.\n\nFor the most part, Meadows’ texts are short, and frequently he does not appear to reply at all. Some conversations include non sequiturs. It’s unclear whether Meadows did not respond to the messages or if the logs are incomplete, because texts could also have been deleted or withheld for claims of privilege.\n\nCNN reached out for comment to all individuals who sent text messages quoted in this story. Meadows and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the January 6 committee declined to comment.\n\nThe fight to ‘stop the steal’\n\nThe text messages provide a timeline showing how Trump’s team searched all corners for evidence of election fraud and tried to overturn the election. Beginning on Election Day, Meadows was in the middle of it all, from connecting activists pushing conspiracy theories to strategizing with GOP lawmakers and rally organizers preparing for January 6.\n\nThe texts also show Meadows was dealing with everything from mediating a fight over who would be on the speaker’s list for the January 6 rally to fielding requests to pay Giuliani’s bills.\n\n“Sir, we are airborne on the way to Michigan from Arizona. We’re going to need a hotel for the team and two vehicles to pick us up,” Bernie Kerik, a Giuliani associate, texted Meadows on December 1.\n\nReached for comment by CNN, Kerik confirmed the text was his and said that he never received a credit card for those travel expenses, paid for it himself and was later reimbursed.\n\nOther texts show Meadows coordinating with GOP activists in the immediate aftermath of the election.\n\n“Pls get 4 or 5 killers in remaining counts. Need outsiders who will torch the place. Local folks won’t do it. Lawyers and operators. Get us in these states,” American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp texted Meadows on November 4.\n\n“I may need to get you and mercy (sic) to go to PA,” Meadows responded, referring to Schlapp’s wife, Mercedes, who is a former Trump White House aide.\n\nOn a few occasions, Trump family members weighed in. Ivanka Trump sent a note on November 5 to a group that included Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Miller and Meadows: “You are all WARRIORS of epic proportions! Keep the faith and the fight.”\n\nDozens of Republicans also offered support and advice to Meadows – as well as perpetuated conspiracy theories that were gaining traction in right-wing media.\n\nFor instance, Rep. Ted Budd, a North Carolina Republican now running for Senate, suggested in a text on November 7 that Dominion Voting Systems could be connected to George Soros’ company. Dominion has no corporate ties to Soros, a billionaire and frequent target of baseless conspiracy theories, according to a CNN fact check.\n\nOn November 6, Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, appeared to suggest that state legislatures should appoint electors “in the various states where there’s been shenanigans,” a move he acknowledged would be “highly controversial.” In his text, he wrote the legislatures could appoint “a look doors,” which is phonetically similar to electors.\n\nOn December 1, then-Attorney General William Barr infuriated Trump when he publicly stated that the Justice Department did not find widespread evidence of voter fraud. Nevertheless, Meadows received multiple texts pushing back, including from Schlapp later that day: “Happy to walk ag through our evidence. Its (sic) overwhelming.”\n\nThe texts also show Meadows reached out to GOP officials in multiple states to lobby for Trump’s cause. On two occasions, Meadows attempted to contact Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was under attack from Trump for certifying Georgia’s election for Biden.\n\n“mr Secretary. Can you call the White House switchboard,” Meadows wrote on December 5. “Your voicemail is full.”\n\nRaffensperger does not appear to reply to the messages.\n\nTrump’s efforts to overturn the election results in Georgia are under investigation by a district attorney in the Atlanta area.\n\nMeadows also received text messages from GOP activists and local officials making outlandish claims, including allegations that “traitors inside our intel agencies” were committing election fraud, as well as baseless charges that voting equipment companies Dominion and Smartmatic had manipulated votes – the same false claims being pushed by Giuliani and Powell.\n\nBoth companies have filed billion-dollar lawsuits over the false election claims, including against Fox News, right-wing media organizations, Giuliani, Powell and Lindell.\n\nThroughout the two months, Meadows received dozens of messages from Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward, who offered what she claimed were examples and sources of voter fraud.\n\nOn December 9, she sent a text to Meadows letting him know she’d already reached out to Trump’s executive assistant: “This guy says he’s cracked the whole election fraud and wants to speak to someone. I sent his info to Molly Michael a few days ago, but I’m not sure it went anywhere.”\n\n“I will call him,” Meadows responded.\n\nMyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell, speaks to reporters outside federal court in Washington, Thursday, June 24, 2021. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nAnother frequent texter was Lindell, one of the most vocal proponents of baseless election conspiracy theories. Even after courts had dismissed dozens of Trump’s legal challenges, the My Pillow CEO was still pressing the White House.\n\n“Everything Sidney has said is true! We have to get the machines and everything we already have proves the President won by millions of votes!” Lindell texted Meadows on December 20. “This is the biggest cover up of one of the worst crimes in history! I have spent over a million$ to help uncover this fraud and used my platform so people can get the word not to give up!”\n\nMeadows replied, “Thanks brother. Pray for a miracle.”\n\n\n\nReached for comment by CNN, Lindell confirmed the text was his. He told CNN that he has not spoken to Meadows since before January 20, 2021, and that at the time he was “just trying to get an appointment with the President.”\n\nDoubts about election fraud\n\nWhile Trump and his allies publicly stuck by their claims that the election had been stolen, behind the scenes, Trump’s inner circle – including Meadows – expressed some doubts. Trump’s aides also questioned whether lawyers like Giuliani and Powell were doing more harm than good.\n\nOn November 6, Miller, Trump’s campaign spokesman, texted a group, which included Ivanka Trump, Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Scavino and Meadows, suggesting that the numbers in Philadelphia didn’t back up claims about alleged election fraud there.\n\n“One other key data point: In 2016, POTUS received 15.5% of the vote in Philadelphia County. Today he is currently at 18.3%. So he increased from his performance in 2016. In 2016, Philadelphia County made up 11.3% of the total vote in the state. As it currently stands, Philadelphia County only makes up 10.2% of the statewide vote tally. So POTUS performed better in a smaller share. Sen. (Rick) Santorum was just making this point on CNN - cuts hard against the urban vote stealing narrative,” Miller wrote.\n\nJason Miller talks on the phone in a meeting room for lawyers of former President Donald Trump during his Senate Impeachment trial on Capitol Hill, February 12, 2021 Jabin Botsford/AFP/Pool/Getty Images\n\nA week later, Miller wrote to Meadows again, this time saying that campaign research did not find any evidence of a conspiracy involving Soros, the Democratic donor. Miller also said he was concerned about sharing the findings with Trump.\n\n“Lots there re: functionality problems, not much there on Dem/Soros conspiracy connections,” Miller wrote on November 13. “Will defer to you on whether or not to share full report with POTUS. POTUS is clearly hyped up on them, not just from his tweets, but he also called me and Justin separately last night to complain. JM.”\n\nOn November 20, Meadows was asked by a Florida contact how confident he was about fraud related to Dominion. Meadows texted back: “Dominion, not that confident. Other fraud. Very confident.”\n\nTwo days later, Ginni Thomas messaged Meadows with apparent concerns, asking, “Trying to understand the Sidney Powell distancing…”\n\nMeadows responded: “She doesn’t have anything or at least she won’t share it if she does.”\n\n“Wow!” Ginni Thomas wrote back.\n\nIn one of the few messages Meadows received from Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law shared a fact check on December 4 debunking one of the most prominent election fraud claims from Georgia. The article showed that despite inflammatory claims of poll workers stashing suitcases filled with ballots under a table, that did not, in fact, occur.\n\n‘Hoping the VP sticks with us’\n\nAfter the Electoral College affirmed Biden’s win on December 14, Trump’s allies turned their attention to January 6: the congressional certification of the electors and the rally that Trump said on Twitter “will be wild!”\n\nOn December 21, Brooks, the Alabama congressman, wrote to Meadows and others in a group text asking whether he should engage with the media about the “formulation of our January 6 strategies.”\n\n“Does the White House want me to reply or be mum?” Brooks wrote. A staunch Trump ally running for Senate this year, Brooks gave an incendiary speech on January 6 but recently fell out of favor with Trump after suggesting Republicans should move on from 2020.\n\n\n\nIn response to CNN’s request for comment, Brooks said he had “no regrets” about his speech on January 6 and that he was “shocked” by the violence. “I had no inkling,” Brooks added.\n\nCruz, a Texas Republican who pushed a plan inside the Senate that would have delayed certification of the election, exchanged just a few messages with Meadows – links to his statements posted to social media.\n\nOn January 2, the senator sent Meadows his tweet proposing a 10-day audit of the election results.\n\n“Here’s the statement,” Cruz wrote.\n\n“Perfect,” Meadows responded.\n\nThe texts also make frequent reference to then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to go along with Trump’s plan to try to block the certification on January 6. On December 30, Rep. Brian Babin of Texas expressed concern that congressional leaders might try to short circuit their objections – and that Pence was not on board.\n\n“Dems and some Republicans may well try to shortstop our objection efforts. Hoping the VP sticks with us,” Babin wrote.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, Miller shared a news article with Meadows that Pence opposed a lawsuit intended to help overturn the election. Miller warned that it could be used “to drive a massive wedge between POTUS and everybody else in the party.”\n\n“He’s absolutely going to blow his stack on this if he isn’t already aware,” Miller said of Trump. “Oh boy I don’t understand what the VP was thinking here.”\n\nOn January 5, Jordan, the Ohio congressman and close GOP ally of Meadows, weighed in.\n\n“On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all – in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial precedence,” Jordan wrote.\n\nMeadows responded the morning of January 6: “I have pushed for this. Not sure it is going to happen.”\n\nThe January 6 committee included the text exchange in its Friday court filing as evidence of Meadows’ alleged involvement in the effort to overturn the election.\n\nThe logs also show Meadows was involved with planning the rally on January 6, helping to mediate a fight over the speakers list. Trump adviser Katrina Pierson was alarmed at some of the proposed fringe figures who wanted to speak.\n\nCrowds arrive for the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nOn January 2 and 3, Pierson wrote to Meadows looking for help.\n\n“Good afternoon, would you mind giving me a call re: this Jan 6th event. Things have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction. Please,” she asked on January 2.\n\nThe next day, she reached out again: “Scratch that, Caroline Wren has decided to move forward with the original psycho list. Apparently Dan Scavino approved??”\n\nShe continued: “So, I’m done. I can’t be a part of embarrassing POTUS any further.”\n\nWren was a fundraiser for the Trump campaign and helped organize the January 6 rally. She has been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee.\n\nLess than an hour later, Pierson wrote Meadows that she told Wren she was talking to the White House in order to get her to back down.\n\n“I let her know that I was going to reach out to WH and her tone changed,” Pierson wrote. “So, I’ll continue to build a proper event.”\n\n“Thank you,” Meadows responded.\n\n‘As bad as this can get’\n\nIn the aftermath of the violence at the Capitol on January 6, Trump’s inner circle discussed in a group text how to deal with the fallout – and Trump’s suspension from Twitter. At 10:10 p.m. on January 6, Kushner texted the group: “Why don’t we post on his Facebook page since he isn’t locked out there.”\n\nIn the final days of Trump’s term, as he faced impeachment for a second time, Meadows received words of encouragement from staunch allies, as well as caution from advisers.\n\n“I would like to pass to POTUS that we are still with him, I believe in him and I want to encourage him,” Rep. Andrew Clyde, a freshman Georgia Republican, wrote on January 9. “I truly hope he does create a new platform to complete (sic) with Twitter and I hope he calls it ‘Trumpet’ and then we can send out ‘notes’ to each other!”\n\n“I will share it with him. Thanks Andrew,” Meadows responded.\n\nOn January 13, the day the House voted to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol – with 10 Republicans joining Democrats – Miller shared polling data in a group text with Meadows, Scavino and Kushner that showed “2/3 of the MAGA base wants us to move on.”\n\n“I tried to walk the President through this earlier but he won’t have any of it,” Miller said.\n\nAs Trump prepared to leave power, he appeared to be a pariah in the Republican Party. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy had said during the House’s January 13 impeachment debate that the outgoing President “bears responsibility” for the riot. Six days later, on January 19, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell denounced Trump from the floor of the Senate, saying the mob that attacked the Capitol was “provoked by the President and other powerful people.”\n\nNevertheless, Trump’s standing in the Republican Party quickly recovered, especially after McCarthy’s January 28 visit to Mar-a-Lago and the February 2021 acquittal of Trump in the Senate impeachment trial.\n\nBut before Trump left office, the Meadows text logs show some of Trump’s staunchest allies were dejected. On January 19, in one of the final texts Meadows received as chief of staff, Fox’s Sean Hannity shared a video of McConnell’s floor speech.\n\nHannity texted Meadows: “Well this is as bad as this can get.”", "authors": ["Jamie Gangel Jeremy Herb Elizabeth Stuart", "Jamie Gangel", "Jeremy Herb", "Elizabeth Stuart"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}]}

But a new wave of cuts targeting career government workers has begun and will intensify after Trump ordered federal agencies on February 26 to undertake large-scale layoffs.\n\nThe Trump administration has yet to give a total number for how many people it has fired.\n\nHere are details on some of the layoffs at federal departments and agencies gleaned by Reuters reporters so far.\n\nVeterans Affairs\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs is planning to cut more than 80,000 workers from the agency, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.\n\nThe VA's chief of staff, Christopher Syrek, sent the memo to senior agency officials, telling them the goal was to return the agency to 2019 staffing levels of just under 400,000. That would mean cutting about 82,000 staff.\n\nDefense Department\n\nThe Pentagon says it will cut 5,400 jobs. The cuts are a fraction of the 50,000 job losses that some had anticipated, but they might not be the last. Darin Selnick, a top Pentagon official, said the agency will implement a hiring freeze and could ultimately reduce its 950,000-strong civilian workforce by 5% to 8%.\n\nUSAID\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which oversees the delivery of American humanitarian assistance, has said that all direct hires except essential workers will be put on leave and 1,600 USAID personnel in the U.S. will be cut.\n\nInternal Revenue Service\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service has started the process of firing about 12,000 employees, largely affecting workers hired under the Biden administration as part of an effort to target fraud among wealthy taxpayers. Republicans opposed the expansion, arguing it would lead to harassment of ordinary Americans.\n\nOverall, the tax-collecting agency has about 100,000 employees.\n\nThe 12,000 cuts include roughly 7,000 probationary employees and 5,000 workers who have accepted a buyout program, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nCIA\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency fired a slew of recent hires this week, three people familiar with the matter said, cuts that current and former U.S. intelligence officers warned would risk damaging U.S. national security.

Trump says he wants a workforce that will not dither in implementing his policies.\n\nSome embassies had been asked to look into reducing both U.S. staff as well as locally employed staff by 10% each.

Ron DeSantis declaring a state of emergency and visiting on Easter Sunday.\n\nBy the way: DeSantis mobilizes state resources for Piney Point response\n\nYet while officials celebrated the determination that a breach in an earthen containment pond wall no longer would result in catastrophic flooding if it grows, there still is a daunting amount of work to be done on the property and urgent environmental issues impacting the entire Tampa Bay estuary to address.\n\nThat was underscored by state officials taking command of the response this week and working to mitigate the immediate and long-term environmental impacts.\n\nFlorida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Noah Valenstein said Tuesday that his agency’s “focus continues to be assisting on preventing an uncontrolled release of water.”\n\nOfficials discussed efforts to store, clean and safely dispose of water from the site Tuesday. They also are working to patch the pond’s leaking liner with a submersible.\n\n“I think we’re going to see over the course of the next few days a decrease of what’s going in the bay,” Hopes said during the Manatee County Commission’s first meeting since the crisis began last week. “The goal is to keep as much of this onsite as possible.”\n\nIs the wastewater radioactive? Your questions about the leak answered\n\nDEP official says: no second breach in Piney Point retention pond wall\n\nNutrient-rich industrial wastewater from the containment pond currently is being dumped into Tampa Bay to alleviate pressure on the breached wall, and there is even more polluted water in other ponds on the site.\n\n“It is a big problem,” Hopes said. “The other ponds on that property, and the property in and of itself, is a problem. It is a wastewater compound. We do have everyone’s attention from Washington, D.C., to Tallahassee, down to the regional level.”\n\nThe breached containment pond held roughly 480 million gallons before the discharges began, but was below 300 million gallons by Tuesday afternoon. There are more than two dozen pumps deployed to the reservoir, increasing the amount of water being released into the bay to roughly 23,500 gallons per minute.\n\nEnvironmental advocates are concerned that the wastewater could feed harmful algae blooms, which have devastated the region’s environment in the past.\n\nEven as they work to stop the wastewater dumping, authorities are formulating plans – likely funded by roughly $200 million in federal stimulus money – to close the phosphogypsum stack holding the water and dispose of all the water at the site permanently. Florida Senate leaders are pushing legislation to pay for the full Piney Point cleanup with money from the recent $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus bill.\n\nThe Manatee County commission also moved forward Tuesday with a key piece of the proposed long-term solution, advancing plans for a deep injection well near the site that would take treated wastewater from the property and inject it underground.\n\nAs elected leaders work to ensure Piney Point is finally dealt with once and for all after decades of inaction, there are a variety of methods being explored to manage wastewater on the property, including the possibility of shipping it in barges for deep well injection in Louisiana. Hopes also told the County Commission that he’s working with a company that can store 150 million gallons of water in portable tanks on the property.\n\nAnd DEP is setting up a reverse osmosis treatment system on the Piney Point property to clean up some of the wastewater on the site, Hopes said. That system eventually will be used to clean the water before it is injected into the deep well.\n\n“Right now, we’re also working with multiple innovative technologies; I know some of those were onsite yesterday figuring out logistics on where they could locate and where they could run pipes,” DEP Deputy Secretary John Truitt said Tuesday morning while briefing the Manatee commission. “Those technologies are other methods that they can use to treat the water to surface water standards, to again augment the removal of … the water from that system.”\n\nCommission Chair Vanessa Baugh said that she had been against using a deep well injection to dispose of the water because she worried that polluted water could compromise the surrounding aquifer, but she changed her position because the water now will be treated.\n\n“The main thing here is this water will be cleaned before it’s put down the well, so we do have a little added protection for our aquifer,” Baugh said.\n\nBy the way: Accountability a looming question with Piney Point leak, Tampa Bay wastewater discharge\n\nCommissioner Kevin Van Ostenbridge also said its important that the county do “everything we can in our power to treat the water before it goes down the well.”\n\nCommissioners voted unanimously to have Hopes secure the services of ASRUS LLC to complete the design, permitting and services for a deep well injection site on county-owned property on Buckeye Road, and to secure a qualified contractor to build it.\n\nA county official said it typically takes about 12 months to get a deep injection well approved, but permitting will be expedited because of the emergency situation. Regardless, the well likely won’t be ready to accept water for months.\n\nIn the meantime, officials are pursuing various solutions to avoid dumping wastewater into Tampa Bay and ensure that any water that is dumped is less harmful. There also are a number of water quality monitoring efforts occurring.\n\nTruitt said DEP has multiple boats taking water samples. Manatee County also has a sampling program, as do surrounding counties. The data will be posted on the Tampa Bay Estuary Program’s website.\n\n“Right now, from what I’ve been told, there are not concerns on the water quality, that EPA and DEP have tested the water, they still feel it’s at pretty safe levels,” Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the lone statewide elected Democrat, said after touring the Piney Point property and speaking with scientists. “But of course, they’re going to continue to monitor it to make sure that nothing escalates.”\n\nFried said she has concerns about the deep well injection plans.\n\n“I don’t think that is a solution at all and that there’s got to be a better way to clean this water – to either dredge it out, clean it and then, if they have to put it someplace else, at least the water is clean,” she said. “But dredging it and putting it in deep wells I don’t think is a solution.”\n\nThe crisis at Piney Point shined a spotlight on the long-festering problems at the former fertilizer site, which was built in the 1960s near the southern shoreline of Tampa Bay, had a previous owner that went bankrupt and has long been viewed as a potential environmental disaster.\n\nState and federal agencies have adopted a new organizational structure and are now in charge of emergency response. Previously, first responders were relying on property owner HRK Holdings’ staff and third-party engineers hired by HRK to respond to the incident.\n\nThe new structure puts officials with the Florida Department of Emergency Management, the DEP and Manatee Public Safety in charge of a “unified command” between those agencies and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n“This is an important transition,” Hopes said.\n\nThe new response team evaluated the stability of the Piney Point containment walls and the potential flood risks, allowing for the evacuation orders and road closures to be lifted. Early on Monday there were reports that a thermal imaging drone detected a possible second breach at the facility; however, the new engineering team determined that it was “a particular type of vegetation” picked up by thermal imagery.\n\n“Fortunately, it was a plant and not a leak,” Hopes said.\n\nWhile controlled discharges into the bay continue, Hopes said controlled discharge from the breach at Piney Point has been kept on HRK Property and is being trucked by the Mosaic Company to Mosaic sites. If that wastewater had not been diverted, it would have spilled into Tampa Bay through Piney Point Creek. Hopes said wastewater from the breach is of greater concern because it has seeped through the phosphogypsum, giving it an opportunity to pick up dissolved solids from the hazardous material.\n\n“All of the water that is breaching out of the side that is flowing in what now is somewhat of a canal,” Hopes said. “With the state’s assets and some of these pumps, it is being diverted around the stack then being pumped and lifted into another channel. It is going into – there is a 35 million gallon pond that has a liner in it that has not been used on the Piney Point site. So everything that is coming out of the bottom is staying on the site. That is not going into the bay.”\n\nHopes said there are additional efforts unfolding to bring storage tanks, tankers and barges into the response arsenal to address wastewater at the Piney Point site that is not leaking or being released. He said those details are being worked out by the DEP and related private parties such as the Mosaic Company.\n\n“The aim of some of those efforts would be to ship that wastewater to the Louisiana coast to dispose of that wastewater in deep injection wells there,” Hopes said.\n\nHowever, he said some of those ships, owned by Mosaic, are flagged in other countries, making it necessary to attain a federal waiver for the initiative.\n\n“What is taking place right now is in preparation for those other holding ponds,” Hopes said. “That’s why you have this water treatment, because before that water leaves to go anywhere, it has to be treated because of its acidity and alkalinity, ammonia and nitrates.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/crime-and-courts/2019/09/03/asbestos-cleanup-former-power-plant-cost-millions/2200754001/", "title": "Asbestos cleanup at former power plant to cost millions", "text": "Cleaning up nearly 224,000 square feet of asbestos-containing material at a former power plant in southern Ohio is expected to cost millions of dollars, a federal judge said Tuesday at the sentencing for the site's onetime owner.\n\nMark Harris, the majority owner of the company that bought the former power plant in 2006, had directed his son and others, according to court documents, to remove the asbestos-containing material from pipes and other equipment inside the facility, which was then sold as scrap metal.\n\nAsbestos was left scattered throughout the building and on the surrounding grounds, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe site, in South Point, which is in Lawrence County, is about 140 miles east of Cincinnati.\n\nWhen EPA officials went to the site in 2013, prosecutors said in court Tuesday, Harris' adult son wasn't wearing the necessary protective gear.\n\n\"Only time will tell if his son and the other workers suffer from the serious health problems common with such exposure to asbestos,\" prosecutors said in documents filed in advance of the sentencing. \"Harris put the financial gain of stripping the scrap metal out of the facility over both the safety of his son and the community.\"\n\nIf not handled correctly, asbestos fibers when breathed become trapped in lung tissue and can cause mesothelioma, an aggressive form of cancer.\n\nHarris, 58, who lives in Versailles, Kentucky, pleaded guilty in January in federal court in Cincinnati to a charge related to mishandling asbestos.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott sentenced him to two days in jail, 58 days of house arrest and ordered him to perform 200 hours of community service.

The survey estimated the cost of removal to be millions of dollars.\n\nHarris' attorneys said because of financial pressures he eventually realized that converting the plant wasn't possible. Between 2011 and 2013, court documents say Harris, his son and others removed about 2.5 million pounds of metal from the facility and sold it.\n\n\"The asbestos was stripped from the metal while dry and left on each of the…floors of the power plant,\" the documents say.\n\nThe scrap metal was sold for nearly $350,000, according to the documents.\n\nIn early August, the EPA began the cleanup.

Much of the improvement was achieved by extending inspection frequencies for 1,500 establishments, to as long as every three years.\n\nBut in March program managers said there actually were still 2,294 inspections past-due by 90 days or more, even with the frequency adjustments.\n\nThat number now stands at 1,966, said Rusty Rock, the program’s field operations manager.\n\nRock said it’s unlikely that number will change significantly soon.\n\nTwo of the program’s 26 inspectors are on maternity leave, Rock said.\n\n“That has really impeded our forward progress,” he said.\n\nAnd inspectors have recently spent time fielding questions from food producers about Salem’s water crisis, Stapleton said.\n\nOn May 29, Salem issued a do-not-drink advisory for children, pets and sensitive individuals after an algae bloom at Detroit Reservoir contaminated the water with toxins.\n\nAfter consulting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Oregon food safety officials advised Salem food processors that they could suspend production or use an alternate source of water.

They’re found in everyday items like non-stick pans, waterproof outerwear, food packaging and firefighting foam.\n\nGrowing evidence points to health effects including increased cholesterol levels, changes in liver enzymes, small decreases in infant birth weights, decreased vaccine response in children, increased risk of high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia in pregnant women, and increased risk of kidney or testicular cancer.\n\nThe Oregon Department of Environmental Quality’s laboratory tested drinking water samples for 25 PFAS compounds, in partnership with OHA.\n\nOHA has established drinking water health advisory levels for four PFAS compounds most commonly found in people. They are PFOS, PFOA, PFNA and PFHxS.\n\nThe advisory level is exceeded when the sum of the four compounds combined is over 30 parts per trillion.\n\nHealth advisory levels are not regulatory. Instead, they provide information on health risks so health officials can take steps to protect consumers.\n\nLocally, the water systems that were tested included those serving the Covanta Marion garbage incinerator in Brooks, the MacLaren Youth Correctional Facility in Woodburn, the NORPAC processing plant in Salem, a handful of mobile home parks, and water systems operated by the cities of Aurora, Hubbard, Independence, Jefferson, Monmouth, St. Paul and Sublimity.\n\nOne local system, Lakewood Utilities, had three detections, with a total of 16.6 parts per trillion.

It tested a sample of water systems across the country for six PFAS compounds between 2013 and 2015.\n\nIn Oregon, the EPA tested a total of 65 systems, including those in Salem and Keizer. It tested major drinking water systems (those serving populations over 10,000) and some smaller systems, for a total of 65 systems.\n\nThe federal government is in the process of setting some regulations for PFAS in drinking water.\n\nLast month, the Biden administration announced new steps to protect drinking water from PFAS contamination, as well as allocating $5 billion toward addressing PFAS and other contamination in drinking water.\n\nOregon will get a share of that money, which it will use to offer grants to drinking water systems with PFAS detections. Salis said she expects a first round of grants will be offered this fall.\n\nPFAS can be removed through treatment with activated carbon, ion exchange or high-pressure membranes.\n\nThe latest PFAS testing results are available at https://yourwater.oregon.gov/pfascounty.php.\n\nTracy Loew is a reporter at the Statesman Journal.

The wreck impacted 38 train cars, 11 of which were carrying hazardous materials. Vinyl chloride in five cars was released and burned after the derailment to prevent an explosion.\n\nWeeks later, East Palestine residents remain concerned about their long-term health and some officials have voiced concerns about dioxins, a type of toxic substance that can stay in the environment for long periods of time.

Brown and Vance introduced a bipartisan bill, The Railway Safety Act of 2023, Wednesday, which aims to prevent train derailments and address issues found in the aftermath of the East Palestine wreck. The proposal came after Gov. DeWine said the train that derailed in the village was not considered a high-hazard flammable train, and called on Congress to examine these classifications.\n\nThe federal bill would:\n\nRequire trains carrying hazardous materials to give advance notice to states, even if they aren't high-hazardous flammable trains.\n\nRequire trains with these materials on board to be scanned by hot bearing detectors every 10 miles.\n\nUpdate inspection rules and ensure they're conducted by qualified rail car inspectors.\n\nRequire two-person crews.\n\nIncrease the maximum fine for railroads that break the rules to 1% of their annual operating income, instead of $225,000.\n\nIncreases HAZMAT registration fees paid by railroads to fund grants for emergency response training.\n\nRail unions: Workers have fallen ill at Norfolk Southern derailment site\n\nJonathan Long, general chairman of the American Rail System Federation of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said rail workers have continued to experience migraines and nausea after working to clean up the train derailment site.\n\nIn a letter addressed to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, Long also claimed Norfolk Southern failed to provide appropriate personal protective equipment to workers at the site and said the railroad uses a \"cost-cutting business model that disregards the sanctity of human life for the sake of more record profits.\"\n\nRail union: Workers are ill at derailment site\n\nLeaders from 12 unions met with Buttigieg and Amit Bose, administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, in Washington, D.C., Wednesday to discuss the derailment and necessary safety improvements.\n\nNorfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw to testify in Congress\n\nNorfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw has agreed to testify on the East Palestine train derailment in Congress, the company said Wednesday.

Reuters earlier had reported the Krause Group was seeking $2 billion.\n\nThe deal includes Kum & Go's roughly 400 stores, as well as the Krause Group's fuel distribution and logistics company, Solar Transport. Maverik CEO Chuck Maggelet was in Des Moines Tuesday at Krause Group’s headquarters meeting with Kum & Go employees. He wore a Kum & Go t-shirt and Maverik vest.\n\nMaverik plans to move Kum & Go’s offices out of the Krause headquarters at 1459 Grand Ave. and lease a space a few blocks from there by year's end, Maggelet said. It's not clear how many of Kum & Go's 250 administrative employees will retain their jobs, with Maggelet telling Axios that the merger could lead to \"limited\" downsizing.\n\nThe number of permanent Des Moines employees has not been determined, he said.\n\nMaverik’s Salt Lake City office is downtown, and the company wants its Des Moines “base camp” to be downtown, as well, he said.\n\n“We’re into being downtowners,\" Maggelet said, adding, \"We think it’s a great vibrant place in which to operate. ... I think we have a lot of personal enthusiasm for being part of the downtown scene here in Des Moines.”\n\nExisting Kum & Go stores will be rebranded in Idaho, Utah, Colorado and Wyoming — all states where Maverik has stores. But for now, it will remain Kum & Go in Iowa and the other eight states where the chain operates, Maggelet said.\n\n\"It could happen,\" Maggelet said. \" I don't know. I think we'll learn an awful lot when we do these first 120, 130, 140 stores. I think it will help us form an opinion. We are very much prepared to operate as two different brands. So we know we can go either direction, but we think we're going to be focusing on rebranding, learning from it and then if it makes sense maybe pushing a little further east.\"\n\nCustomers will notice some changes. Food offerings at both stores will change somewhat, Maggelet said, citing Maverik's pizza and Kum & Go's burrito and pretzel roll sandwich offerings as items that could be shared.\n\nHe said shoppers also will see new payment systems and technology at Kum & Go locations. Maverik has self-checkout lanes at all of its stores, and the technology will be rolled out in January at Kum & Go stores in Colorado and Utah, he said, with more to follow over next year.\n\nMaggelet said he found out about the opportunity to acquire Kum & Go on his birthday in February. He contacted Kum & Go CEO Tanner Krause, who he had met at a conference about four years ago.\n\n\"Two months later we had struck a deal with Kyle (Krause), and now we find ourselves here today having closed the transaction, he said.\n\nHe told the National Association of Convenience Stores on Tuesday that he wanted to acquire Kum & Go because the Des Moines company's stores are \"attractive,\" with similar design standards to those of Maverik. The average Kum & Go store is three years newer than the average Maverik location, he said.\n\nTanner Krause will remain on board through the transition, according to the Krause/Maverik news release. The merger will give Maverik 14,000 employees and about 800 stores across 20 states, making it the 12th largest convenience store chain in the country, according to trade publication Convenience Store Products.\n\nMaverik's parent company, FJ Management, owns oil refineries, banks and insurance businesses.\n\nMaverik announced Tuesday it also will donate $50,000 to The Des Moines Public Schools Foundation as a gesture to its new community.\n\nLevel of convenience store competition in Des Moines 'very unusual'\n\nThe merging of the two brands, while not unusual, is still big news in the convenience store industry, said Jeff Lenard, a spokesman for the National Convenience Store Association.\n\n“All of a sudden you have the nation’s 12th biggest convenience store chain,” said Lenard.\n\nDes Moines is among the three most unique areas in the country when it comes to convenience stores because of the number of big national chains competing there, he said.\n\n“Most markets are dominated by a single chain, but in Des Moines you have several big brands competing which is very unusual. Iowa has a lot of high level performers doing a great job. It’s a pretty robust market in the convenience store industry,” he said.\n\nLenard had high praise for Kum & Go, saying that the company passed through multiple generations of the Krauses while the family built a successful brand and brought new concepts to the business.\n\nIowa chain dates back to 1959\n\nKum & Go was founded by Bill Krause and his father-in-law, T.S. Gentle, in 1959 as Hampton Oil Co., with a single gas station in the northeast Iowa town of that name. Gradually, the business expanded and adopted the Kum & Go name in the 1970s.\n\nThe family later launched the Krause Group, a parent company that owned Kum & Go and a diverse group of holdings that now include an Italian pro soccer team, wineries, a hotel and ranches.\n\n“Together over four generations ― from my grandfather Tony and my dad, Bill, to me and my son Tanner ― we built these businesses over 64 years through shared vision, collective entrepreneurship and teamwork,\" Kyle Krause said in a joint news release with Maverik.\n\nKrause told the Business Record that he will give Krause Group employees bonuses and expand other businesses as a result of Tuesday's sale. In particular, he is eying a new stadium for Parma Calcio 1913, the Italian soccer team he purchased in 2020.\n\nHe also said he wanted to buy more Italian wineries and add more hospitality holdings in that country, where his mother's side of the family lived before emigrating to the United States.\n\nKrause Group remains active in Des Moines\n\nThe Maverik deal, announced in April, comes as Krause continues to negotiate financing for a soccer stadium with Des Moines city officials. USL Championship, the second tier of U.S. professional soccer, awarded Krause a franchise in January 2022 on the condition that he build a new stadium.\n\nThe Iowa Soccer Development Foundation, a nonprofit that would own the stadium, projects construction will cost $95 million. The nonprofit has received $25 million from the private sector and up to $7 million from Polk County. The Iowa Economic Development Authority allocated $23.5 million in future sales tax revenue to the project.\n\nMeanwhile, Des Moines city officials have offered an undisclosed amount of money for the project, which would put the 6,300-seat stadium south of downtown at the former location of the Dico tire and pesticide factory, a remediated U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site.\n\nWhile Des Moines officials have not said how much money they have offered, city and county elected leaders told the Des Moines Register in July that Krause asked both governments to increase their offers. Polk County Administrator John Norris said at the time that Krause was trying to close a $29 million funding gap.\n\nAn Iowa Soccer Development Foundation spokesperson told the Register at the time that \"there are discrepancies with the information you were provided.\" However, the foundation declined to provide more information. Krause declined to tell the Business Record how big the funding gap was.\n\nHe did, however, tell the publication that he was \"optimistic\" that he would raise the money to build the stadium. The Business Record reported that he and his wife, Sharon Krause, have committed $23 million to the stadium. Krause also added that local officials also gave public money to Principal Park and the Wells Fargo Arena.\n\nKrause: 'This is our home'\n\nThe stadium is part of a planned $550 million redevelopment from Krause+, the company's real estate arm. The plans include restaurants, offices, apartments, a plaza, a music venue and hotels.\n\n\"Right or wrong, when you look across North America, the funding model for these types of projects include government support,\" Krause told the Business Record.\n\nAs Kum & Go is sold, here's a look at other Iowa-born, but no longer based, companies\n\nNorris told the Register in July that Krause wanted the city to renegotiate an incentive agreement on Krause Gateway Center, the Renzo Piano-designed building overlooking the Pappajohn Sculpture Park in downtown Des Moines. However, the company's current development agreement required the Krause Group to maintain a headquarters for Kum & Go at the office.\n\nIn his interview with the Business Record, Krause said he could add employees at the office to oversee the development of the stadium. He also said he plans to host public events at the building.\n\n\"This is our home,\" Krause said.\n\nWhat to know about Kum & Go's sale to Maverik convenience stores\n\nThis article has been updated to correct the ownership of Pilot Flying J.

Shoppers returning to the Riverchase Galleria in suburban Birmingham found most of its roughly 150 stores still closed and many people wearing face masks. Chairs were missing in the mostly empty food court because of state rules, but only a couple of restaurants were open for lunch anyway. Some stores were empty save for an employee or two, but there were lines at a jewelry kiosk and an athletic shoe store, where a worker raised and lowered a metal gate to let one customer enter at a time. Meanwhile, in Montgomery, about 60 people attended a rally outside the Capitol to express frustration with the continuing state-ordered closures of businesses that had previously been categorized as nonessential, such as hair salons and gyms. One woman carried a sign reading, “We don’t buy the lie,” and a man shouted “Freedom!” and “Read our Constitution.”\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: The U.S. Census Bureau plans to restart its efforts to personally reach residents without a listed physical address. The agency was expected to renew its door-to-door canvassing Wednesday after hand delivery of census materials that began March 15 was postponed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, KYUK-AM reports. Teams delivering the materials have been trained to observe social distancing and will following federal health and safety guidelines, the Census Bureau said. Temporary field staff will also use protective equipment provided by the government while distributing census materials to households, the agency said. The bureau expects its field operation to deliver materials to 110,000 households in Alaska as part of the national census conducted every 10 years.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Nearly half of nonprofits in the state will be unable to serve the public within the next month because of the heavy toll brought by the coronavirus pandemic. Arizona State University released a survey Tuesday that found many nonprofits are facing bleak prospects due to losses in revenue and volunteering. While some programs like food banks and child care are seeing their demand balloon, other nonprofits such as performing arts groups continue to spiral. Those surveyed cited cancellations of major fundraisers and few donations because of rising unemployment. Stay-at-home orders also forced groups to cease regular in-person activities. The report found more than 40% of nonprofits believe they will stop offering services in the next four weeks. Furthermore, nearly 20% expect to be able to cover payroll for only another eight weeks.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Prison staff who test positive for the coronavirus have been allowed to work at a facility where at least 876 inmates have the virus, a correction official said in a court document filed Tuesday. Arkansas Division of Correction Director Dexter Payne said the agency has allowed staff who have tested positive to work at the Cummins Unit if they are asymptomatic. The staff are only allowed to work with inmates who have tested positive for the virus, he said. Payne’s comments detailing the policy were among documents filed in response to a lawsuit by inmates that accuses the prison system of not doing enough to prevent the virus’s spread. Payne said the agency is following recommendations by the Health Department that positive, asymptomatic staff be allowed to work only if there is a critical shortage of workers and as long as they follow other safeguards. Dr. Nathaniel Smith, the state health secretary, said the “ideal” would be for staff who test positive to stay home.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A plan to temporarily move homeless people into a Ritz-Carlton hotel has gotten pushback from residents of multimillion-dollar apartments on the upper floors of the Los Angeles high-rise, according to a news report. City Councilman Mike Bonin said luxury hotels should not be exempt from Project Roomkey, a statewide effort to shelter some of the most vulnerable homeless people in empty hotel rooms during the coronavirus pandemic. KABC-TV obtained an email from the Homeowner’s Association for the Ritz-Carlton Residences that said it’s resisting Project Roomkey at the Ritz and the adjoining J.W. Marriott hotels. The email lists concerns about safety, security, property values and overall lifestyle. Bonin has asked city and county entities to report which hotels are not participating. Bonin’s motion also directs them to create a list of hotels that have received any sort of “public subsidy, tax breaks, or economic development incentives.”\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The Colorado Attorney General’s Office issued a cease-and-desist letter to Functional Medicine Center of Fort Collins for false or misleading marketing of coronavirus antibody tests, reflecting elevated scrutiny of a testing approach currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Antibody tests, also known as serology tests, analyze a person’s blood for the presence of antibodies that indicate they were previously infected with a disease. For some infections, the presence of antibodies indicates some level of immunity to the disease. But it’s still unclear whether that’s the case for coronavirus. That uncertainty, paired with limited regulatory oversight of the tests, has cast doubt on the idea that they could be used to determine who can safely return to work. Even high-quality tests are likely to yield some inaccurate results, experts say.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont on Tuesday canceled in-person classes at all of the state’s K-12 public schools for the rest of this school year amid the coronavirus pandemic, requiring districts to continue distance learning for the final weeks. “It breaks my heart,” Lamont said during his afternoon news briefing. “I wanted to do everything I could to find some way to keep the school year at least partially open, just for a couple of weeks, some sense of conclusion for our students.” But Lamont said he and his education commissioner heard concerns from school superintendents, parents and teachers about a continuing increase in COVID-19 infections in some parts of Connecticut and determined that “this was no time to take that risk” of reopening schools. Lamont’s reopening committee is expected to make recommendations in the coming weeks about summer school, which could open in July.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Some small businesses will be allowed to resume limited operations starting Friday, Gov. John Carney said Tuesday. The announcement is aimed at gradually starting to lift restrictions the Democratic governor imposed more than seven weeks ago in an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus. “I’ve heard the anguish in the small-business owners’ voices about just the economic carnage that has visited on them and their employees and their businesses in every corner of our state,” Carney said, describing the change as a “baby step” toward a broader reopening of the economy while carefully monitoring the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Under the new state guidelines effective Friday morning, retailers such as department stores, tobacco shops, bookstores and thrift stores will be allowed to do business using curbside pickup. Hair salons can resume operations by appointment, but only for people who work at businesses deemed “essential.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district has released neighborhood coronavirus data that shows the number of positive COVID-19 cases in specific areas of the city, WUSA-TV reports. Data from DC Health shows that the 16th Street Heights and Columbia Heights neighborhoods in Wards 4 and 5 have the largest numbers of cases, followed by Chinatown, Brightwood and Logan Circle/Shaw. Wards 2 and 3 continue to have the lowest rates of infection in the city, according to the neighborhood-specific data, which the city released in an effort to monitor key areas in the district that may be disproportionately affected by the coronavirus, Mayor Muriel Bowser said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: As the state slowly reopens, officials are now contemplating what they should do if the coronavirus outbreak lingers into hurricane season, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday. Hurricane season begins June 1 and usually peaks from late August through September. Florida is often a target for storms, forcing thousands of people to evacuate, with many fleeing to shelters. “This virus really thrives and transmits when you have close sustained contact with people inside an enclosed environment,” DeSantis said. “As you’re looking at sheltering for a hurricane, you have to keep that in mind.” Florida emergency management Director Jared Moskowitz is working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency on potential changes to how the state handles evacuations and sheltering. Moskowitz said that might include shelters that only accept people infected with the virus, or orders for people to shelter in place depending on the strength of the building and the power of the storm.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp warned Tuesday that a growing coronavirus outbreak is stressing resources in northeast Georgia. Kemp has moved aggressively to allow businesses to reopen even though infections are on the rise in some areas of the state. He made his remarks about northeast Georgia while touring a temporary medical pod in the southwestern city of Albany, one of the state’s earliest and worst hot spots for COVID-19. The state Department of Public Health reports nearly 30,000 Georgians have had coronavirus infections confirmed by a test. About 1,300 in the state of 10.6 million people have died. Gainesville, a city about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta that is synonymous with Georgia’s large poultry industry, is quickly becoming one of the state’s most affected areas.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A streak of more than two weeks of single-digit daily new cases of coronavirus is allowing the state to take the next step in reopening its economy, Gov. David Ige said Tuesday in announcing more businesses that will be allowed to operate. Starting Thursday, businesses including some shopping malls, astronomical observatories, car washes and pet groomers may reopen, Ige said. Shopping malls will be limited to retail and repair services, according to a supplementary emergency proclamation. Retail businesses won’t open in Honolulu until May 15, and Maui County won’t allow its shopping malls to reopen yet, according to the proclamation. Patrons must practice social distancing and wear cloth masks, Ige said. The governor previously allowed businesses such as golf courses, some real estate services and car dealerships to reopen. Ige’s stay-at-home order that allowed for activities such as outdoor exercise will now be called a “safer-at-home” order, he said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will give coronavirus economic relief grants up to $10,000 to small businesses, and no other state in the country is putting up more money in direct cash support for small businesses. Gov. Brad Little announced the Idaho Rebound Grant program at a press conference last week. Idaho will use $300 million of the $1.25 billion it received from the federal government through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. “Small businesses will be eligible to receive the Idaho Rebound Grants if they haven’t already received a Small Business Administration grant (through the Paycheck Protection Program) or received less than $10,000,” Little said. The state will open up the application process May 11 for the rebound grants, which will be run by the State Tax Commission.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday outlined a five-phase plan for reopening the state as the threat from COVID-19 subsides, but there were no surprises – the speed with which people may resume former activities remains dependent on vigilance against the coronavirus. Under pressure to show signs of a return to normalcy, the Democrat unveiled “Restore Illinois,” which indicates the state has already entered the plan’s second phase. It’s defined by loosened restrictions on the governor’s stay-at-home order, allowing more social interaction while wearing face coverings. “We all have a passionate desire to return to the sense of normalcy that we felt before the world knew of COVID-19,” Pritzker said in Chicago. “Here’s the truth, and I don’t like it any more than you do: Until we have a vaccine, or an effective treatment or enough widespread immunity that new cases fail to materialize, the option of returning to normalcy doesn’t exist.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Hoosiers should be wary of false or misleading claims some companies are making about their ability to combat the spread of the coronavirus with disinfectants or cleaning services, state officials said. The Office of the Indiana State Chemist said cleaning services and cleaning product manufacturers have claimed they can disinfect homes, workplaces, hospitals, cars and other spaces with products that will specifically kill the coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19. “Companies are using a variety of marketing opportunities to advertise these claims – websites, TV, radio, flyers, mailers and social media,” said Sarah Caffery, a pesticide product registration specialist with the State Chemist’s office. Consumers are urged to visit the Office of the Indiana State Chemist website to find a list of products that are effective against the virus, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency criteria.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Des Moines Public Schools has opened the door to in-person graduation ceremonies after previously saying ceremonies would be held online to reduce the potential spread of novel coronavirus. “I very much want us to have an in-person, live graduation where our students can walk across the stage and be recognized for their accomplishments,” Superintendent Tom Ahart said at a Tuesday night school board meeting. A final decision on live graduations has not yet been made, “but we’re trying,” Ahart said. The city school district announced last week that it would hold virtual graduation ceremonies in June – a decision that prompted parent Uniz Ceballos to start a Change.com petition calling for live graduations that has garnered more than 1,600 signatures. Several districts in the Des Moines metro, including Ankeny and West Des Moines, have announced plans to hold in-person graduations over the summer.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Taiwan is donating 100,000 surgical masks to Kansas to help medical and meatpacking workers amid the coronavirus outbreak. U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, announced Wednesday that the shipment of masks is expected to arrive next week. The move comes as Taiwan seeks to be included in the upcoming World Health Assembly. Moran, who requested the masks, has been supportive of including Taiwan. He thanked the country’s President Tsai Ing-wen in a statement, saying it is “another great reminder that we are all in this together.” Four counties with meatpacking plants – Seward, Ford, Finney and Lyon – have a combined 2,258 confirmed cases, 41% of the state’s total. And an outbreak at the state’s largest prison in Lansing has now infected 551 inmates and 88 staff members. Most of the infected inmates don’t have symptoms.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A prison has been hit by hundreds of coronavirus cases, prompting action to separate inmates into housing units based on their health conditions to try to contain the outbreak. Testing of inmates and staff at the Green River Correctional Complex in Central City revealed more than 300 additional virus cases, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. The prison accounted for nearly half the statewide total number of cases reported Tuesday, resulting in a one-day high for the state. Beshear called it a “concerning situation” as his administration takes steps to contain the virus’s spread at the western Kentucky prison. When factoring in previous coronavirus cases, the infection rate has reached about 40% at Green River, he said. J. Michael Brown, secretary of Beshear’s executive Cabinet, said at least least two people at the prison have died from COVID-19. A third death last weekend is potentially virus-related, he said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: With fewer cars on the road because of the coronavirus outbreak, the state’s transportation department is taking the opportunity to clean up those areas that are normally filled with traffic. The agency said its maintenance crews will spend the next two weeks launching an extensive cleanup effort of usually high-traffic state roadways. The crews will be picking up litter, removing debris, trimming overhanging trees and removing overgrown vegetation. The Department of Transportation and Development is urging those who are driving to use caution when traveling through the work zone areas with crews and equipment.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers held an “emergency meeting” Wednesday to delve into delays in the processing of unemployment claims. More than $200 million has been distributed to more than 70,000 Mainers since the global pandemic forced the governor to declare an emergency and impose a stay-at-home order, according to the labor department. Since March 15, more than 100,000 claims have been filed, compared with 35,000 for all of last year. The agency is trying to keep up with demand, said Jessica Picard, spokeswoman for the department, which enlisted a private call center to help handle the massive volume of calls. Meanwhile, a high school in Norway, Maine, has come up with a novel way to hold graduation despite the pandemic. Oxford Hills Comprehensive High School will hold its ceremony next month at a drive-in movie theater. Families will be able to bring one vehicle, and the school will mail home caps, gowns, sashes, cords and tickets, school officials announced.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state has missed out on more than $60 million in revenue from its casinos being closed last month due to the coronavirus, compared to how much the state generated last April. The state lottery said in a news release Tuesday that the state’s six casinos generated no revenue in April. In April 2019, total revenue was about $145.2 million. Contributions to the state in that month were about $60.2 million. That includes $45.2 million set aside for the state’s Education Trust Fund. Casino revenues also support jurisdictions where the casinos are located and Maryland’s horse racing industry. The casinos were closed March 16. “These are truly unprecedented times,” Maryland Lottery and Gaming Director Gordon Medenica said. “The casinos generate vital revenue for the state, but we remain focused on the health and safety of the casinos’ patrons and employees as we plan for reopening.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston Pops Orchestra has released a musical tribute to health care workers, first responders, supermarket clerks and other critical personnel on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. The performance of “Summon the Heroes” released Tuesday was composed by John Williams for the 1996 Olympic Games and includes an introduction from conductor Keith Lockhart, as well Williams himself, recorded at his home studio in Los Angeles. The virtual performance includes 78 musicians playing from their living rooms, kitchens, basements and bedrooms. A recording engineer and a video engineer edited the piece from their homes. Williams compared workers on the front lines of the pandemic to the athletes for whom the piece was composed. “Like our wonderful athletes, they are performing Olympic feats of their own, tending to our health and wellbeing, and by doing so lifting all our spirits through the care and compassion they show the world each and every day,” he said in a statement released by the Pops.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The Republican-led Legislature sued Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday, asking a judge to declare invalid and unenforceable her stay-at-home order and other measures issued to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The lawsuit, filed in the state Court of Claims, says a 1945 law that gives the governor broad emergency powers to order such restrictions governs local, not statewide, declarations like one that has been in place since March. A 1976 law gives Whitmer emergency authority only for a limited period that expired when the House and Senate did not extend her emergency and disaster declarations last week, according to the suit that alleges a “patent disregard for the law.” Whitmer spokeswoman Tiffany Brown called the suit a “partisan game.” Whitmer’s “No. 1 priority is saving lives,” Brown said. “She’s making decisions based on science and data, not political or legal pressure.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A coalition of hospitality organizations is urging state legislators to provide an economic relief package to help save the industry’s businesses. The coalition includes Hospitality Minnesota, the Minnesota Licensed Beverage Association, the Community of Minnesota Resorts and the Craft Brewers Guild. A recent survey by Hospitality Minnesota says more than half of hospitality businesses may be forced to close permanently in the next two months because of the effects of the coronavirus and the state’s stay-at-home order. Minnesota Hospitality says federal relief so far is not tailored to work for hospitality businesses. The coalition said that in addition to reopening businesses safely and swiftly, many will also need additional financial support. “Hospitality businesses and jobs are teetering on an economic cliff,” said Liz Rammer, President and CEO of Hospitality Minnesota.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State legislators will be back at work Thursday to consider proposals to help businesses that have been hurt by the coronavirus outbreak, House and Senate leaders said Tuesday. It will be the second time in less than a week for legislators to return to the Capitol after putting their session on hold in mid-March because of the pandemic. They passed a bill Friday to give the Legislature control over spending $1.25 billion that Mississippi is receiving from the federal government in a massive coronavirus relief package. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has called that bill a power grab by the Republican-majority Legislature, saying he’s best positioned to spend the federal money as needs arise. During a news conference Tuesday, Reeves mentioned the possibility that he would veto the bill, setting up further confrontation with lawmakers.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: St. Louis and St. Louis County will both begin easing stay-at-home orders starting later this month, but officials caution that the process will be slow for the area of Missouri most ravaged by the coronavirus. St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis County Executive Sam Page both announced late Tuesday that public health restrictions would be reduced starting May 18. Page said Wednesday that the reopening process will be driven by metrics like hospitalizations, ventilator usage, and rises or falls in confirmed cases. The city and county are coordinating their plans, and Page and Krewson said details will be released soon. But Page said the plan will include a recommendation that workers wear masks “and we will request everyone out in public wear masks, especially when social distancing measures, being at least 6 feet away from someone else, can’t be easily followed.” The mayors of 25 St. Louis County municipalities want those details immediately.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock on Tuesday announced $123 million in grants for small businesses, nonprofits and state residents affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The spending is the first phase of distributions of the state’s $1.25 billion in federal coronavirus relief funding. Applications can be submitted starting Thursday via covidrelief.mt.gov. “I want to be clear that this is just an initial round of funding based on the immediate needs identified by Montanans, small businesses,” Bullock said. The governor is creating a $50 million grant fund for small businesses who have lost revenue due to the coronavirus and another $50 million in rent or mortgage assistance for people who have lost jobs or substantial income. Other funding includes $10 million for nonprofit social service agencies and $2 million for food banks.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state has opened a new lab to analyze the results of about 3,000 coronavirus tests per day and will launch more testing sites beyond those operating in Omaha and hard-hit Grand Island, officials said Tuesday. CHI Health St. Elizabeth in Lincoln will serve as the state’s lab under the TestNebraska program, which state officials launched through a contract with a Utah startup. “This is going to allow us to greatly expand our testing,” Gov. Pete Ricketts said. Nebraska officials have sought to increase the state’s testing capacity to get a better sense of where the coronavirus is and how quickly it’s spreading. Under the $27 million, no-bid contract with Nomi Health and other firms, Nebraska received 540,000 tests, plus equipment needed to analyze them and website support to help people enroll. Ricketts said about 122,000 Nebraska residents have signed up so far.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: MGM Resorts International has announced that the furloughs of more than 60,000 employees caused by the coronavirus pandemic could turn into layoffs. Acting company CEO Bill Hornbuckle sent a legal notice Tuesday to employees saying a tourism forecast predicts some furloughed workers might not be back for more than six months and some not at all. “When we first furloughed our employees, we hoped the spread of the virus could be contained or that an effective treatment would emerge quickly,” Hornbuckle said. “Based on the current situation, we now believe that some of our colleagues may not return to work this year.” Employees will remain on furlough status until Aug. 31, then the company is allowed to begin layoffs. The notice complies with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which is intended to ensure employees have advance notice before significant layoffs.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Drive-thru ceremonies with no handshakes, hugs or high-fives may mark the end of high school for some of the state’s graduates. The Department of Education has released guidance to school districts about how to plan graduation ceremonies in light of the state’s prohibition on gatherings of more than 10 people. Officials said schools should consider limiting audience size to a maximum of two guests per student, depending on the ability to practice safe social distancing. The department said one option could be to have people stay in their cars, parked in every other spot, and graduates would exit in small, appropriately spaced groups, to get their diplomas. Diplomas also could be distributed “drive-up” style, or participants could be spread out among classrooms within a school.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Wednesday extended the public health emergency declaration stemming from the coronavirus outbreak for another month. He first signed the declaration in March and renewed it in April. The declaration allows the Democrat to invoke emergency powers, like ordering businesses to close. Murphy said he decided to extend the declaration because it automatically expires after 30 days, and the underlying conditions making it necessary haven’t changed. He also announced about 1,500 new positive cases, putting the total at about 132,000, along with 308 new deaths, for a death toll of 8,549. Despite the climbing death toll and increase in positive cases, Murphy said the number of people in hospitals with the virus continued to decline, as did the number of patients on ventilators.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A rural sheriff has deputized about 20 church members at an in-person church service, working around Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s public health order designed to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Sierra County Sheriff Glenn Hamilton said the effort is about recruiting help and preparing for the worst, but he also noted that law enforcement is exempt from the governor’s stay-at-home order, meaning people can now attend future services, KOB-TV reports. Sierra County, about 140 miles south of Albuquerque, is one of many rural counties that often use law enforcement volunteers because there are not enough deputies to cover the territory. “Should riot conditions start existing, should civil disobedience, it could be everything from crowd control measures to as simple as administrative staff duties,” Hamilton said. Hamilton has extended the deputization offer to all churches in Sierra County and expects more to sign up.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The great majority of people being newly hospitalized with the coronavirus in New York either are retired or are unemployed and were avoiding public transit, according to a new state survey, the first such look at people still getting seriously ill despite six weeks of severe social distancing. The survey of 1,269 patients admitted to 113 hospitals over three recent days confounded expectations that new cases would be dominated by essential workers, especially those traveling on public transportation. Retirees accounted for 37% of hospitalizations during the survey period. Another 46% were unemployed. Almost three-quarters were 51 years or older. Only 4% used public transportation in their daily life, according to the survey. “It reinforces what we’ve been saying, which is much of this comes down to what you do to protect yourself,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at his daily briefing. “Are you wearing a mask? Are you doing the hand sanitizer?”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: The North Carolina Air National Guard will conduct flyover salutes to food bank workers, medical staffs and other front-line workers in the fight against COVID-19. The flyover Thursday will be performed by a C-17 plane, according to a release by the Guard. The planned route will start over Asheville in the western part of the state before heading to Wilmington and circling back to Charlotte. Along the way, the route will include medical facilities in Morganton, Winston-Salem, Chapel Hill and Greenville. It will fly over food banks in Asheville, Raleigh and Charlotte, among other cities and facilities. The North Carolina flyover is part of a project called Operation: American Resolve, and the Guard says it will cost no additional taxpayer money.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Backers of paid family leave will again push legislation to establish a program in the state, saying the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened awareness of its need. “The coronavirus, or a health crisis of any type, can put a family in extreme financial difficulty,” said Kristie Wolff, executive director of the North Dakota Women’s Network. The nonprofit and the North Dakota AFL-CIO on Wednesday launched their renewed effort for a paid family leave law, saying the state “must do more to protect workers during critical life-changing circumstances.” Paid family leave legislation in North Dakota has been largely backed by Democrats but has failed in the Republican-controlled Legislature over the years. That includes in 2019 with a bill to use $5 million of earnings from the state’s voter-approved oil tax savings account to start the program, to be paid off by contributions from employees and employers after 20 years.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican lawmakers frustrated with Ohio’s aggressive stay-at-home orders voted Wednesday in the GOP-controlled House to limit the authority of the state’s health director. The move seeks to restrict mandatory closure and stay-at-home orders issued by the health department to 14 days. After that, the orders would need approval from a legislative rule-making body. Gov. Mike DeWine blasted the move, saying his fellow Republicans should be focused on increasing coronavirus testing, dealing with a $775 million budget deficit and reopening the economy. Republican backers said the measure was an appropriate legislative check on the power of DeWine and his health director, Dr. Amy Acton, who issued Ohio’s orders. Acton has won praise for her aggressive decisions to combat the coronavirus’ spread, but those who think the state is moving too slowly in reopening its economy have directed their anger toward her in recent weeks.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state is reopening businesses that were closed due to the coronavirus pandemic at the right time, U.S. Sen. James Lankford said Tuesday. “I don’t think it’s soon. We’ve already got about 15 states in the same process,” and even hard-hit New York is considering how to follow suit, Lankford said. “There will always be second-guessing on the timing … it’s still the right time.” Gov. Kevin Stitt in April announced plans to allow a phased reopening, first of businesses such as barbershops and hair and nail salons, followed by restaurants, malls, gyms and churches. Stitt said the state has met White House criteria for reopening, including fewer new coronavirus cases and deaths, and a decline in hospitalizations. Oklahoma’s official count of people who have contracted the coronavirus has topped 4,200, and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 has surpassed 250, the state State Department of Health reported Wednesday.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The first person in the state to be diagnosed with the new coronavirus has been discharged from the hospital more than two months after being admitted, the hospital said Tuesday. Hector Calderon spent many days in the intensive care unit, where he was sedated and intubated, before he recovered enough to be transferred to a skilled nursing facility Monday, Kaiser Permanente Northwest said in a statement Tuesday. Calderon, who is a janitor at an elementary school in Lake Oswego, tested positive for COVID-19 in late February. He was listed as the state’s first confirmed coronavirus case Feb. 28, prompting the school where he worked to close for several days. In addition to being the state’s first confirmed case, he was the second patient in the U.S. determined to have contracted the virus through community spread and not from direct contact with another infected person or from travel to a country with an outbreak.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state reported another 554 deaths from the coronavirus to pass 3,000 total, while Gov. Tom Wolf said Tuesday that he is not committing to a particular schedule to lift stay-at-home pandemic restrictions in the state’s counties or regions. The large number of new deaths reported Tuesday by the state Department of Health was spread out over the previous two weeks, the agency said, as it reconciles its data with deaths being reported by local agencies or hospitals. Still, it was as stark a figure as the state has reported since the first case of the new coronavirus was detected in Pennsylvania in early March. It comes as the growth in cases appears to slow down in many parts of Pennsylvania and as Wolf’s administration moves to lighten its restrictions on movement and business activity.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: An investigation into possible unemployment benefits fraud related to the coronavirus pandemic is expanding with as many as 2,000 cases in the state, authorities said. State and federal law enforcement agencies are investigating fraudulent unemployment insurance claims submitted to the state Department of Labor and Training. The department has received roughly 2,000 reports to date from people who say they have been the victims of “imposter fraud,” agency spokeswoman Angelika Pellegrino said in an email. Anyone who believes their personal information has been used to file or secure a false claim is being asked to call the FBI’s Providence office or the state Department of Labor and Training. Ellen Martin told WPRI-TV she received a letter last week informing her that her jobless benefits had been approved even though she was still working.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina plans to return to on-campus classes in the fall, although with plenty of changes to protect students, professors and employees from the coronavirus. The college announced its intention Wednesday, the same day a group of education leaders met remotely to talk broadly about what public schools for children may look like next fall – teachers changing classes instead of students, children not going to the cafeteria for lunch, and maybe fewer class periods and semester courses in high school. The key from both groups of educators was flexibility. While plans are to be back in the classrooms in August, a lot could change in three months. The University of South Carolina is the first major college in the state to announce a plan to reopen. President Bob Caslen said that depends on the ability to test any student or worker and, if they test positive, to trace everyone with whom they were in contact.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials on Wednesday reported five more deaths from COVID-19, along with 58 new confirmed cases. All five deaths were in Minnehaha County, which has seen most of the infections in South Dakota. A total of 2,779 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed statewide, but the actual number of infections is thought to be far higher than the number of confirmed. Health officials reported that most people who have tested positive have recovered, but 29 people have died in South Dakota from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. A Smithfield pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, where over 800 employees became infected with COVID-19, is reopening this week. The state has tested nearly 2,500 people as part of a mass testing event set up for Smithfield employees and their family members, which health officials said will likely result in another spike in testing.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Officials have reported the first death of a state inmate who tested positive for the coronavirus: a man who was among the nearly 1,300 inmates who tested positive at one prison. The state Department of Correction said Tuesday that the 67-year-old man was an inmate at Trousdale Turner Correctional Center, run by the Tennessee-based private company CoreCivic. The inmate was taken to the hospital April 25, tested positive there and died Monday, the department said. The inmate had underlying health conditions, said state Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey. Officials say six inmates who tested positive in Tennessee’s prison system are hospitalized, including one in serious condition. In recent mass testing, nearly 1,300 inmates – about 50% of all prisoners – and 50 staffers tested positive at the facility, while 583 – or about 25% – of the Bledsoe County Correctional Complex’s 2,322 inmates tested positive. Most had no symptoms.\n\nTexas\n\nWest Odessa: A bar owner and armed protesters were arrested in western Texas after the bar reopened despite the governor’s orders to remain closed amid the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Ector County Sheriff Mike Griffis told the Odessa American that authorities on Monday apprehended Gabrielle Ellison, the 47-year-old owner of Big Daddy Zane’s Bar, in West Odessa for violating Gov. Greg Abbott’s order that prohibits drinking establishments from opening until mid-May. Six men who had loaded “AR-15-type weapons” were also arrested for possessing firearms on a licensed property, Griffis said, adding that one observer was detained for interfering with a peace officer’s duties. More than 20 people participated in the protest with help from Open Texas, an armed group that travels around the state trying to help reopen the doors of businesses that Abbott deemed “nonessential.”\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Dozens of workers tested positive for the coronavirus after two Utah County businesses instructed employees not to follow quarantine guidelines and required people who tested positive to continue reporting to work, leaders said. Nearly half the employees at one business were infected, authorities said. One establishment was temporarily closed, and both have been required to follow strict cleaning and inspection requirements, the Daily Herald reports. “This is completely unacceptable,” Utah County commissioners wrote in a Monday letter also signed by the mayors of all the cities in the county. A total of 68 people tested positive, the letter says. Health department officials made the connections through contact tracing. Neither business was named due to privacy concerns, said Carrie Bennett, chronic disease prevention program manager for the Utah County Health Department. She also declined to say what services they provide.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Department of Public Service is proposing a plan to provide broadband internet service to everyone in the state. About 23% of the state, or 70,000 homes and businesses, doesn’t have access to high-speed internet service. That’s defined as speeds of 25 megabits per second for download and 3 megabits per second for upload. “The internet is necessary infrastructure that is essential for Vermonters to stay safe when they shelter at home during a crisis, such as the COVID-19 emergency,” June Tierney, the commissioner of the Department of Public Service, said in a statement announcing the plan. The cost estimate is approximately $300 million. The plan assumes that Vermont will receive an additional infusion of federal aid to support recovery from the pandemic.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Mental health experts say military families and veterans are reaching out more for assistance during the coronavirus pandemic. The Virginian-Pilot reports clinicians providing help online have seen requests skyrocket. Sarah Pitzen, the lead clinician at the Steven A. Cohen Military Family Clinic at The Up Center in Virginia Beach, said staff have had to provide additional support to current clients because their “preexisting conditions had worsened.” Pitzen said they’re also seeing a rise in risks associated with domestic violence, suicide, child abuse, and drug and alcohol addiction. They’re also seeing more stress, anxiety and depression. “There’s just an increased need for connection, to be quite honest,” she said.\n\nWashington\n\nWalla Walla: Some people are intentionally flouting health recommendations by exposing themselves and others to COVID-19 in Walla Walla County, officials said. Meghan DeBolt, director of the county’s Department of Community Health, told the Union-Bulletin this week that contact tracing has revealed some are attending parties with the idea that it is better to get sick with the virus and get it over with. New positive test results in the county have resulted from such gatherings, she said. “We ask about contacts, and there are 25 people because: ‘We were at a COVID party,’ ” DeBolt said. She called the parties irresponsible and unacceptable. Walla Walla Police Chief Scott Bieber noted that disobeying Gov. Jay Inslee’s March 23 “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” order is illegal.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Two cities are giving some employees a one-time extra payment for continuing to work with the public during the coronavirus pandemic. Huntington City Mayor Steve Williams announced $900 will be awarded to all the members of unions representing city police, firefighters and administrative employees who did not work remotely during the virus outbreak. Nearly 285 employees will receive the extra-duty pay in May. Administrative staff who changed their schedule for remote work will receive 50% of the payment, the city said in a statement. The more than $200,000 needed for the extra payments will come from the city’s budget. In Charleston, the City Council on Monday approved Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin’s request for $100,000 to match a $100,000 grant from the Kanawha County Commission to go toward police officers, firefighters, and members of the refuse and recycling department.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Nearly all hospitals must affirm they can treat all patients without crisis care in order for the first phase of Gov. Tony Evers’ coronavirus reopening plan to be met, state health officials said Tuesday. Ninety-five percent of the state’s hospitals would also have to arrange for testing for all symptomatic clinical staff treating patients to meet the first phase under Evers’ plan. A third criteria – a downward trend in COVID-19 cases among health care workers calculated weekly – has currently been met, but it could be reversed if cases start to increase, said Wisconsin Department of Health Services Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk. Other previously announced criteria for entering the first phase of the reopening plan include fewer new diagnoses of coronavirus, fewer new reports of flu-like symptoms, and a downward percentage of positive coronavirus tests over 14 days.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Frustration and displeasure with changes in the rules governing Wyoming antler hunting was nearly unanimous in recent days among the many hundreds of people who flocked to the forest adjacent to the National Elk Refuge, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Most came from out of state, and their presence and inkling to continue an annual Jackson Hole tradition was an act of defiance and disregard for requests to stay home while the novel coronavirus was keeping the community largely closed. Gov. Mark Gordon had issued an unenforceable directive that instructed people crossing state lines before May 8 to quarantine themselves for 14 days. Teton County law enforcement officers, who corral the shed hunters every spring, echoed that request over social media and in advertisements for weeks leading up to the hunt. Driving the concern was COVID-19, which has hit Teton County worse on a per-capita basis than anywhere else in Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/07/31/lawsuit-national-environmental-policy-act-pipelines-utah-highway-projects/5545882002/", "title": "Lawsuit to uphold environmental law has implications for three ...", "text": "A group of environmental and outdoor organizations filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration over its efforts to dismantle elements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, specifically the requirement that federal agencies consider public input before breaking ground on new projects.\n\nFor decades, NEPA has been the major law promoting environmental protections in the face of new highway construction, oil infrastructure installation and other large government-sponsored development projects. It requires an assessment of potential damages to the natural environment that may result from proposed federal agency actions and, for larger projects, the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement that is made available to the public before construction begins. The agencies are then required to take comments from the public into consideration before moving forward with construction.\n\nLake Powell Pipeline: Officials take input on latest environmental statement\n\nNEPA is the reason the public has a say in the progression of three major local projects that are all currently in the public comment phase: The Lake Powell Pipeline project, the Northern Corridor project and the Pine Valley Water Supply project.\n\nLocal projects moving forward\n\nA 313-page draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Lake Powell Pipeline project was released to the public on June 8, 2020, kicking off a 90-day period closing Sept. 8, 2020 when the public can submit comments on whether or not this project should progress given known impacts to the natural environment. The document outlines the likely environmental damages of two different routes being considered for the approximately 140-mile long pipeline proposed to bring water from Lake Powell to Washington County.\n\nJust four days later, on June 12, 2020, the draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Northern Corridor Project became available to the public. Because of NEPA, the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are required to accept and consider public comments on this project, which seeks to route a highway through territory currently protected for the benefit of the threatened desert tortoise, until Sept. 10, 2020.\n\nThen, on July 15, 2020, the Bureau of Land Management issued a Notice of Intent to prepare a draft Environmental Impact Statement for Cedar Valley's Pine Valley Water Supply project, which intends to transport water approximately 66 miles in a buried pipeline from Pine Valley in Beaver County to central Iron County. This began a 30-day public comment period mandated by NEPA that ends Aug. 14, 2020.\n\nAn increased pace\n\nFor all three projects to move forward so quickly after having each been under consideration locally for more than a decade appears very sudden, Susan Jane Brown, staff attorney with the Western Environmental Law Center, said.\n\n\"The President's various executive orders are putting pressure on the agencies to move faster, particularly with those big-ticket construction projects,\" Brown said. \"So I'm not surprised that things that may have been moving more slowly in the past have been moved to the front burner and may be moving more quickly.\"\n\nBut local officials say they are still evaluating how the NEPA rule changes may, or may not, influence the ongoing process for current controversial projects.\n\n“Our environmental policy folks are taking a look at the new rules coming out of the White House, but from what we can tell right now, it’s probably not going to have an effect on the Lake Powell Pipeline timeline or process,” said Marlon Duke, a public information officer for the Bureau of Reclamation.\n\nStill others are left unclear on how they would begin to change the processes that have guided federal projects for decades. Keith Rigtrup, field manager for the BLM’s St. George office, said he’s waiting for guidance on how the changes might affect projects that are “midstream” in the review process.\n\n“There are some questions out there on the implementation side — when is it effective; what NEPA process does it affect,” Rigtrup said. “Obviously, anything we start from today forward it’s pretty clear we’re under those changes.”\n\nA chaotic approach\n\nThis confusion over when and where the new rules should apply is, Brown suggested, a familiar chaotic approach from an administration seeking to \"upended 40 years of case law and agency practice, particularly around how federal agencies consider the environmental consequences of their actions and how those agencies then involve the public in those decisions.\"\n\nBrown said that, in addition to lifting requirements for environmental review, the Trump administration has also overhauled the culture of how environmental assessments are conducted by local agencies. Where there is wiggle room around implementing the new rules, local managers may feel encouraged to skip public involvement whenever they have that option so as not to \"buck their secretary,\" said Brown. This means that, even though the rule changes still allow agencies to pursue public comment as they have for decades, local bureaus may increasingly opt to bypass public involvement in favor of expediting projects.\n\nFor now, southern Utah remains in the midst of three public comment periods for major local projects. But Brown warned that the process in the future might look very different.\n\n\"Things may change a lot. And you may not be given notice of them,\" she said. \"You may actually be out on the ground someday and be like, 'Oh, hey, this project got built and I was never notified.' And that would be consistent with the new rule.\"\n\nBrown's group filed its challenge to NEPA changes Wednesday in the Northern District of California. Add that to similar lawsuits recently filed in other states, including one in Virginia filed by the Southern Environmental Law Center and one in New York filed by the National Resource Defense Council, and it seems that opposition to the Trump administration's efforts against NEPA is mounting.\n\nIt may, however, be many months before any action is taken to reinstate NEPA's protections for the environment, said Brown, because courts might want to hold off until after the upcoming presidential election. In the meantime, federal projects are allowed to progress without public involvement.\n\nSam Gross contributed to this report.\n\nJoan Meiners is an Environment Reporter for The Spectrum & Daily News through the Report for America initiative by The GroundTruth Project.

O'Neill\n\nStaff Writer, @JamesMONeill1\n\nThis story was first published Jan. 6, 2013\n\nWhen superstorm Sandy knocked out North Jersey's largest sewage treatment plant, billions of gallons of raw or partially treated sewage poured into rivers and bays, setting off alarms from health and environmental officials. But while the event was dramatic, it was not unique.\n\nMore than 23 billion gallons of raw sewage and other pollutants pour into New Jersey's rivers and bays each year because aging sewer systems are overwhelmed during heavy rains. The raw sewage and toxic waste -- enough to fill the Oradell Reservoir nearly seven times over -- spill from 217 outfall pipes into the Passaic, Hackensack, Hudson and other rivers and bays, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe overflows occur dozens of times each year, whenever there's a significant rainfall.\n\nThe sewage puts human health and the environment at risk -- particularly at a time when more people are discovering North Jersey's rivers for recreation and the state's beaches remain a vital economic engine.\n\nFederal law had called for such spills to be eliminated by 1985, but the sewage continues to flow because local governments say they can't afford to repair the systems. In Ridgefield Park, such a project could cost as much as $100 million. The price is estimated at $1 billion in Paterson. Federal and state money to address the problem has been made available over the years, but environmentalists and politicians alike said it has not been nearly enough. Even less costly stopgap measures, such as adequately identifying the outfall pipes with signs, have not been properly addressed, environmentalists argue.\n\nFor the increasing numbers of people who use the rivers, the sewage can cause illnesses such as gastroenteritis -- a stomach inflammation that causes vomiting and diarrhea -- as well as hepatitis and skin, respiratory and ear infections. The sewage also can inflict economic pain, such as lost revenue from beach closures, fish kills and closed shellfish beds.\n\n\"The release of large quantities of raw sewage into New Jersey waters is a serious problem that needs to be solved sooner rather than later,\" said Judith Enck, regional administrator of the EPA. \"It has dragged on for too long.\"\n\nThe outfall pipes are part of older systems in Ridgefield Park, Hackensack, Paterson and other communities that rely on sewage lines to handle both sewage and storm-water runoff from roadways and parking lots. Normally, the lines carry the sewage and storm water to wastewater treatment plants. But when heavy rains hit, these systems can't handle the deluge. The excess is dumped out of the system through outfall pipes, called combined sewer overflows, which empty into local waterways.\n\nNorth Jersey's annual sewage overflow runs into the billions of gallons, but varies year to year based on the number of storms and amount of rainfall.\n\nAlong with the untreated sewage, the overflow pipes dump other pollutants into the rivers. The runoff from a rainstorm carries everything that has dripped onto roadways -- grease, oil and benzene from cars and paint and chemicals people may have poured down storm drains. It also carries fertilizer runoff, including phosphorous and nitrates that cause algae blooms, spawning fish kills.\n\nMonthly water sampling along the Hudson, including several locations where the river borders Bergen County, often shows dramatic increases of enterococcus -- a bacterial component of sewage -- in the days following a heavy rainfall, with rates often in violation of federal standards.\n\nWhen superstorm Sandy crippled the state's largest sewage treatment plant, the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission's facility could no longer accept the 250 million gallons of sewage it normally handles each day. Raw sewage backed up in the lines, and for several days 840 million gallons of it poured -- untreated -- into local waters, much of it into the Passaic River.\n\nColiform is a bacteria associated with human waste. Even a week after the storm, federal officials measured coliform levels at the mouth of the Passaic as high as 1,500 units -- the acceptable level is considered 14 units. During the three weeks after Sandy, as the facility was brought back into service, an estimated 4.4 billion gallons of partially treated sewage was released into New York Harbor, said Mike DeFrancisci, the commission's executive director.\n\n\"The discharge of raw sewage and other contaminants into water bodies is one of the most serious threats to water quality facing the state of New Jersey,\" Enck said in a letter last year to New Jersey environmental officials.\n\nThe concern comes as North Jersey's rivers are generally getting cleaner as industry leaves the region and sewage treatment facilities -- though not sewer systems -- have improved. That improving water quality has drawn more people to the rivers to canoe, kayak, boat or participate on crew teams. But while much of the remaining industrial pollution is trapped in the sediment of the rivers, it is the bacteria in the water from the sewage that can cause the most immediate harm to residents.\n\nBill Sheehan, the Hackensack Riverkeeper, said people don't seem to know about the dangers posed by the sewer outfall pipes. \"I've got dozens of pictures of people in canoes who jumped out, people using Jet Skis who fell off or waded into the river to cool off,\" Sheehan said. At Laurel Hill Park in Secaucus, he saw a family set out blankets on the riverbank. \"The kids had water toys and they'd dive off the dock and swim, unaware of the potential health danger,\" he said.\n\n\"I bring up the issue and people always look at me with a blank stare or say, 'I thought they fixed that problem years ago,' \" he said.\n\nMany people who suffer cases of swimmer's ear or gastrointestinal illness after swimming in polluted water at beaches or in rivers may never make the connection, so numerous cases go unreported, environmental groups said. The EPA has said the likely range of illness attributable to sewage contamination at the nation's beaches is between 1.8 million and 3.5 million cases. And a growing number of academic studies have linked human illness to storm runoff.\n\nFor instance, a University of California, Irvine study that looked at rates of gastrointestinal illness among surfers at Southern California beaches between 2008 and 2010 found higher occurrences shortly after storms than during dry conditions. And a look at cases of gastroenteritis and diarrhea at a children's hospital in Wisconsin from 2002 to 2007 found an 11 percent increase after rainstorms.\n\nOfficials at the state Department of Environmental Protection agree the overflows need to stop. \"It's not acceptable to have untreated sewage going into our water bodies,\" said Michelle Siekerka, the DEP's assistant commissioner for water management.\n\nBut the state hasn't ordered communities to remove the outfalls and install separate lines to handle sewage and storm water because of the cost, she said. \"Many community governments are cash-strapped right now and local sewer authorities have not set aside money for capital improvements,\" Siekerka said.\n\nEnvironmental advocacy groups have grown impatient -- and have taken the state to court to force the state into action. The DEP \"has developed a catalog of excuses instead of water protection measures,\" the environmental groups said in court documents. The groups say the DEP does not require public notice about overflows and that in some cases there aren't even any signs to let the public know that raw sewage was coming out of the pipes.\n\nSiekerka said the DEP requires signs at outfall pipes, but acknowledged they are often small and the print is hard to read. The state is considering new rules about the minimum size of the print for signs, she said. The DEP is also assessing how to provide timely public notification when overflows occur, through an emergency notification system or posting notices on the Web, she said.\n\nWhile they haven't been able to remove the pipes, Siekerka said the DEP has made progress on the overflow problem by requiring the installation of netting or other devices at outfall pipes to prevent solids and floatables -- cans, bottles and other debris -- from flowing into the rivers.\n\n\"We've been successful in getting nets installed on 91 percent of combined sewer overflows. That's huge,\" Siekerka said.\n\nRidgefield Park has six combined sewer outfalls and averages 48 overflows each year -- which dump 2.2 million gallons of sewage and storm water into the Hackensack. In 1999, the town spent $1.5 million to install nets at each outfall pipe, along with giant concrete chambers that hold the nets in place and the winch mechanisms needed to lift them for cleaning.\n\nThe nets have captured everything from plastic bottles to dead rats -- 21 tons of debris a year, said Alan O'Grady, the village public works superintendent. Ridgefield goes through about 100 nets -- at $140 each -- annually because they get torn by the flow of water and trapped debris, he said.\n\nBut the nets don't keep raw sewage out of the waterways,\" said Debbie Mans, the NY/NJ Baykeeper. \"The DEP has required the towns to install netting to catch floatables, but they haven't dealt with the bacteria side of things,\" she said.\n\nTo end the overflows from Ridgefield Park's six combined sewer pipes would cost between $31 million and $100 million, depending on the chosen remedy, O'Grady said. Options include building small facilities at each outfall to treat the water before it enters the river, which would cost up to $50 million. A tunnel running 4,900 feet along the river's edge to temporarily hold the storm runoff would cost $74 million. The most complete option would be adding a separate storm-water line so there would be one dedicated solely to sewage and one for storm water. That would cost up to $100 million.\n\n\"Either way it's going to be a lot of money,\" O'Grady said. \"It's not like we're trying to duck the problem. We'd love to have the use of the river again. But we need guidance -- and some financial help.\"\n\nHackensack is in the midst of rehabilitating a section of Main Street and plans include separating sewer lines there. \"It won't eliminate our combined sewer overflow discharges but will significantly reduce what's going into the river,\" said City Manager Stephen Lo Iocono.\n\nThe cost of other work has proved to be overwhelming. The city studied separating a 10-square-block section of line in 2006 and found that it would cost $30 million, he said. \"The numbers are so overwhelming,\" Lo Iocono said. \"The financial burden is just too great.\"\n\nPaterson, which has 26 sewer outfall pipes along the Passaic River, budgets $1.2 million in capital projects each year for sewerwork. Over the past few years, the city has turned several thousand feet of combined lines into separate lines, said Christopher Coke, Paterson's director of public works.\n\nBut to separate all the lines would cost in excess of $1 billion, he said. \"It will be a long process.\"\n\nIn 2000, the EPA estimated that nationally, it would cost more than $50 billion to fix the combined sewer problem. Some federal money has been made available over the years -- through 2006, states funneled about $5.3 billion in federal money as loans to combined sewer projects, but a 2009 congressional report conceded that \"federal assistance has been small relative to the overall needs.\"\n\nThe 2009 economic stimulus bill included $30 million for eight New Jersey combined sewer projects.\n\nTo spur local governments to tackle the issue, the Christie administration plans to make partial loan forgiveness available. \"We are looking to incentivize right conduct rather than mandate it,\" Siekerka said.\n\nState Sen. Bob Smith, D-Piscataway, has introduced a bill that would create a $5 million fund to help pay for the work. Another bill would create a more permanent source of money by letting communities create storm-water utilities, which could charge fees to facilities that generate the most storm-water runoff -- office parks and shopping malls, for instance.\n\nThe Legislature passed a similar measure last term to help reduce pollution in Barnegat Bay, but Governor Christie vetoed it, arguing that it was another tax.\n\n\"He's not wrong,\" Smith said. \"But there's no free lunch.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/02"}]}

But how easy is it to form a separate one? Can anyone form a political party? Here's what to takes to start your own in Ohio.\n\nWhat is Elon Musk's 'America Party'?\n\nFounded by Elon Musk, the America Party critiques both the Republican and Democratic parties. \"The America Party is needed to fight the Republican/Democrat Uniparty,\" Musk wrote in a separate X post. According to Reuters, the new party carries a tech focus, while being \"budget-conscious, pro-energy and centrist.\"\n\n\"When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,\" Musk wrote on X, his social media platform. \"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.\"\n\nMusk has strongly opposed Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" which includes tax cuts, increased spending on immigration enforcement and military, and deep funding cuts to Medicaid, according to USA TODAY. The bill increases the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.\n\nWhat does it take to start a political party in Ohio?\n\nStarting a political party can be an uphill and expensive challenge, though not impossible.\n\nAt the state level, there are two major political parties: Republican and Democratic. Other political parties would fall under the minor political party, according to the Ohio Secretary of State. There is a formal process to petition your party.\n\nPaperwork for a \"petition to form a minor political party\" should be submitted to the Ohio Secretary of State. According to the state office, you must gather signatures from qualified electors equal to at least one percent of the total votes cast for governor or presidential electors in the most recent election for that office. (The 2022 Ohio gubernatorial election saw 4,201,368 voters cast ballots.) Additionally, the petition must have \"at least 500 qualified electors from each of at least a minimum of one-half of the congressional districts (CD) in the state.\"\n\nAccording to the Ohio House of Representatives, time is also of the essence, and you must petition your political party to the Secretary of State at least 125 days before the general election. The House adds that to maintain your party's status for future elections, \"a party’s candidate for governor or president must receive at least 3 percent of the total vote cast in the most recent election.\"\n\nOhio's petition process also includes designating a committee of three to five people to represent the petitioners, and naming your prospective political party which must be different from an existing party name. If successful, the Secretary of State notes that the new political party comes into legal existence and can nominate candidates to appear on the ballot at the general election.\n\nHow easy is it to form a national political party?\n\nOn the federal level, starting a political party typically requires forming a committee, lots of fundraising, gathering widespread support and registering with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). According to the FEC, this includes getting a tax ID and bank account, appointing a treasurer, and following specific criteria set by the agency.\n\nSeveral newly formed political entities referencing America Party, Musk or one of his businesses appeared in the FEC database in the wake of the billionaire's declaration, according to PBS reporting. However, email addresses and addresses listed in the filings indicate that those are false and not actually affiliated with Musk.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/09/trump-to-give-super-bowl-message-pledges-to-root-out-fraud-in-nation/78373612007/", "title": "Trump gives Super Bowl message, pledges Musk will probe Education", "text": "President Donald Trump gave the nation on Sunday a report of his first weeks in office, using his attendance at the Super Bowl to tout some of his priorities and make predictions - not just about the championship game but also what's ahead for the nation.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier that was taped at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, the president picked the Kansas City Chiefs to beat the Philadelphia Eagles. He also said that he expects the changes that he's implemented since taking over the White House three weeks ago to continue.\n\nBefore 8 p.m. and the start of the third quarter, Trump had left, with the Chiefs trailing by 24 points.\n\nTrump told Baier in the seven-minute clip that he plans to direct tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is leading Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, to review the military and the Department of Education \"very soon.\"\n\n\"We're going to find hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse,\" he said.\n\nTrump became the first sitting president to attend the National Football League's title game.\n\nTrump arrives at Super Bowl\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrived at the Super Bowl, but reporters accompanying him said it wasn’t clear how many fans knew he was on the field because Philadelphia Eagles players were on Caesars Superdome’s large screens.\n\nTulsi Gabbard, Trump’s nominee to become director of national intelligence, was seated in the front row wearing an Eagles cap.

But without naming Mahomes, he said after seeing him win as many games as he has, Trump had to pick Kansas City.\n\n“The quarterback really knows how to win,” Trump said. “He’s a great, great quarterback.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nA blowout, and Trump has left the building\n\nPresident Donald Trump left the stadium a little before 8 p.m., according to reporters traveling with him. The Eagles were leading the Chiefs, the team Trump picked to win, by a wide margin.\n\nA man with the Palestinian flag got onto the field at Caesars Superdome during halftime but was tackled by security, according to reporters.\n\nTrump spent the first half of the game mainly seated in the front row of his box next to his daughter, Ivanka, according to reporters who accompanied him. Visitors would stop by and chat with him and sometimes take pictures, according to the reporters.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nWhat did Travis Kelce say about Trump before Super Bowl?\n\nKansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce told reporters this week that it is \"pretty cool\" that Trump will attend the game on Sunday.\n\n\"That’s awesome. It’s a great honor,\" he said, according to videos posted by multiple media outlets Wednesday. \"I think, you know, no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there, you know, it’s the best country in the world. So, that’d be pretty cool.\"\n\nKelce is the boyfriend of pop star Taylor Swift, whom Trump slammed late last year, even writing \"I hate Taylor Swift\" on Truth Social in September.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTrump declares 'Gulf of America Day' on his way to Super Bowl\n\nAboard Air Force One on his way to New Orleans, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation declaring Feb. 9 as the inaugural “Gulf of America Day,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Sunday.\n\nTrump signed the proclamation as he flew over the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump required the federal government in a day one executive order to rename the “Gulf of America” on official maps.\n\n“We’re flying right over it right now, so we thought it would be appropriate,” Trump told reporters.\n\nInterior Secretary Doug Burgum told reporters aboard Air Force One he issued an order directing the U.S. Geological Survey, which holds the database for location name, to change the name of the body of water Sunday. Burgum said staffers at his department are contacting map apps from Google and Apple to have the name changed.\n\nHowever, the change could take months to enact and may or may not be immediately reflected on the digital maps Americans use daily.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTrump steel tariffs: President to impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Sunday he will impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Monday and announce “reciprocal” tariffs the next day.\n\nTrump made the remarks aboard Air Force One on his way to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl.\n\nThe moves come after Trump had previously promised tariffs on metals and other goods such as microchips and pharmaceuticals. Trump on Friday said he would impose “reciprocal” tariffs that would affect all countries.\n\nTrump described the “reciprocal” approach as tariffs that would be applied to imports from other countries if they place tariffs on U.S. exports. “If they charge us, we charge them,” Trump said.\n\nLast week, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, only to hold off on the tariffs after leaders of both countries agreed on efforts to reenforce their borders with the U.S.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nCBS poll finds 53% approval rating for Trump\n\nLess than one month into Trump’s second presidency, 7 in 10 Americans say he is following through on his campaign promises, according to a new CBS News/YouGov survey.\n\nWith a 53% job approval rating, the poll of 2,175 U.S. adults found Trump draws overall majority support for some of his actions on immigration and the war in Gaza. But 66% say he hasn’t focused enough on lowering prices, and most Americans don’t approve of new tariffs except on goods from China.\n\nAbout 60% agree with Trump’s program to deport unauthorized immigrants and with sending troops to the southern border, the poll found. But a slight majority of respondents oppose holding people in mass detention centers while authorities determine who should be deported.\n\nTrump’s newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which he has tapped tech billionaire Elon Musk to head, draws mixed support. Nearly a third of respondents say Musk and DOGE should have zero influence on government operations and spending, while 23% say they should have “a lot” of influence. Support for DOGE is driven by Republicans, the poll found.\n\n- Minnah Arshad\n\nTrump says he trusts Elon Musk to cut spending\n\nTrump told Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that he trusts Elon Musk, his head of the Department of Government Efficiency, to find ways to cut federal spending and will turn the spotlight on the Education Department and the Pentagon next.\n\nMusk has been criticized for sending staffers to gather sensitive information at government agencies and he blocked temporarily in court from gaining access to secure systems at the Treasury Department. But Trump said he asked Musk for the help and will ask him to review Education and Defense next.\n\n“I've had a great help with Elon Musk, who's been terrific,” Trump told Bret Baier of Fox News. “Trust Elon? Oh, he's not gaining anything. In fact, I wonder how he can devote the time to it. He's so into it. But I told him do that.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump disagreed with court blocking Musk access to Treasury\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Fox News he has to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, so it was a mistake for a federal judge to block Elon Musk’s access to Treasury Department systems looking for problems.\n\n“I disagree with it 100%,” Trump told Bret Baier of the ruling. “I think it’s crazy.”\n\nTrump argued that hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on the wrong priorities. He said he would move funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development to the State Department, for example.\n\n“I think I’d rather give it to Marco Rubio over at the State Department, let him take care of the few good” programs, Trump said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump doubles down on desire to annex Canada\n\nDuring an interview with Fox, Baier asked Trump whether his desire to make Canada the 51st state was real.\n\nTrump reaffirmed that, saying: “We lose 200 billion dollars a year with Canada and I'm not gonna let that happen.\"\n\nCanada would “be much better off being a 51st state,” he said. “Why are we paying 200 billion dollars a year essentially in subsidy to Canada? Now, if they’re a 51st state I don't mind doing it.”\n\n- Minnah Arshad\n\nTrump says Canada, Mexico must take action to avoid tariffs\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Fox News he “got a lot of good action” from Canada and Mexico on border security after ordering 25% tariffs on goods from those countries, which he paused for 30 days, but he said more action was necessary.\n\n“No, it’s not good enough,” Trump told Bret Baier.\n\nTrump complained about a $200 billion U.S. trade deficit with Canada and a $350 billion trade deficit with Mexico that he said he wouldn’t allow to continue.\n\n“Something has to happen,” Trump said. “It’s not sustainable.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says 'just something special' about his dance at rallies\n\nOn a lighter note during the Fox News interview, Bret Baier asked President Donald Trump what he thought about UFC fighters and NFL players imitating his swaying and arm-waving dance from his political rallies.\n\nTrump often danced to the Village People’s “YMCA” at the end of his rallies. While perhaps not the same cultural touchstone as John Travolta’s dancing in “Saturday Night Fever,” the dance caught on among Trump’s followers.\n\n“I don't know what it is,” Trump said. “I try and walk off sometimes without dancing, and I can't but I have to dance because it's just that something special about it.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security promotes safety at Super Bowl\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security promoted a video on social media about safety measures it is taking to protect 100,000 people visiting New Orleans for the Super Bowl.\n\nSecurity has been enhanced in the weeks since a follower of ISIS drove a truck through a Bourbon Street crowd on New Year’s Day, killing 14 people and forcing a one-day postponement of the college Sugar Bowl in the same stadium, Caesars Superdome.\n\n“We have a big event coming on Sunday and we are committed to having a safe environment for everyone that attends,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in the video.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nSecret Service recruits at Super Bowl\n\nA Secret Service recruitment video to be played on the jumbotron during the big game chronicles how the agency has protected “the most important people and events” since 1901, including Super Bowl LIX.\n\nThe one-minute video features inspirational speeches from former Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. The video also has darker themes, including the assassination attempts against Reagan and President Donald Trump, and the terrorist hijackings Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n“America’s Secret Service protecting the Super Bowl is asking a few more to step forward,” the video said in closing.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump joins Super Bowl for ‘patriotic values’\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued a statement he was looking forward to joining fans at the Super Bowl for the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles for a sense of national unity and patriotism.\n\n“The coaches, players, and team staff on the field tonight represent the best of the best in professional football, but they also embody the best of the American Dream,” Trump said.\n\nTrump noted the 14 deaths and 35 injuries from the “senseless” truck attack in New Orleans on New Year’s Day. He said the football game provides an annual opportunity to transcend differences and strengthen communities.\n\n“This annual tradition transcends our differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family, faith, and freedom heroically defended by our military service members, law enforcement officers, and first responders,” Trump said. “We value their devotion to protecting our great Nation and salute their selfless service.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump is commander in chief but didn't serve in military\n\nPresident Donald Trump is commander in chief of the military by virtue of his office, but he never served in the military.\n\nTrump received five deferments from the draft for military service during the Vietnam War. He received four educational deferments while he was a college student and a fifth deferment in 1968 for a medical exemption after he graduated, for a bone spurs in his heel.\n\nDuring an interview with NBC News in 1999, Trump went into detail about the war and him not serving.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump golfs with Tiger Woods\n\nAhead of the Super Bowl Sunday night, the president played golf with professional golfer Tiger Woods, according to pool reports.\n\nThe acclaimed golfer was spotted on the green with the president at Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach, Florida, Sunday morning.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTrump's travels prevent basketball coach from attending\n\nSouth Carolina women's basketball coach and Eagles fan Dawn Staley planned to attend Super Bowl 59, but said she can't anymore because of flight restrictions due to Trump's arrival.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration puts flight restrictions in place when the president is traveling, and on Friday officially confirmed the temporary flight restrictions for New Orleans from 3:45-5 p.m. ET and 10:15-midnight on Sunday.\n\n– Lulu Kesin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/10/29/why-mark-cuban-supports-kamala-harris/75790293007/", "title": "Opinion: Why Elon Musk and Mark Cuban are split over Trump and ...", "text": "Mark Cuban might make a good president someday, but he hasn't ventured far into politics.\n\nAt least, until this year.\n\nThe part owner of the NBA Dallas Mavericks and a \"Shark Tank\" investor isn't exactly a Republican. But I've interviewed him several times since 2015, and I've never seen him until now campaign hard for a Democrat, especially not a progressive ticket.\n\nYet, Cuban has been on the campaign trail for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and just interviewed the vice president for her YouTube page.\n\nWhat does the Texas billionaire see in the Harris campaign? And why is he at war with another famous Texas billionaire, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk?\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nI asked Cuban about his recent foray into politics.\n\nMark Cuban: 'I know Harris would make a better President'\n\nCuban had for years feuded off and on with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, even before the New Yorker's venture into politics. But in 2015, Cuban said Trump was \"probably the best thing to happen to politics in a long, long time.\"\n\nCuban originally thought it would be good if Trump, a fellow businessman, could shift the state of American politics.\n\n\"I was like, ‘He's great. He's not a typical Stepford candidate. I thought that was a positive,' \" Cuban told former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy in a recent interview.\n\nHe quickly changed his mind.\n\nIn a 2017 column I wrote for the Daily Beast, Cuban told me that Trump was an \"idiot,\" but that he himself wasn't a “liberal.”\n\n\"Are you a liberal now? Or even a far-left progressive?\" I asked him in an email this month in light of his active support for Harris.\n\n\"lol. No. I’m still independent and make up my mind on a position by position basis,\" Cuban wrote back. \"I know Harris would make a better President. That’s the only reason I’m supporting her.\"\n\n\"If it were up to me they could make political parties illegal and I would be happy,\" Cuban added.\n\nThat sentiment will likely disappoint conservatives, confuse liberals and excite libertarians.\n\nMany conservatives believed that he seemed like one of them. And it turns out, even though he's campaigning for Harris, he still aligns with conservatives on some ideas.\n\n\"I would prefer smaller and more effective government, \"Cuban said. \"But I prefer being pragmatic over dogmatic.\"\n\nHe said that government programs can help people in need, and that philanthropic enterprise is something he values. His Cost Plus Drug Co. is a real-life example. The online pharmacy boasts pharmaceutical drug prices at a fraction of the normal cost.\n\n\"We as a country are only as good as our children. When children and their parents struggle, it makes life harder for them and those that love and help them,\" Cuban told me. \"When we solve some of our basic issues, then we can start removing those programs. ... I’ve had this very conversation with Kamala. About the need to improve efficiency of government programs so we can get better results for the people who need them.\"\n\nDespite Harris' policy positions that advocate for $25,000 in down payment assistance for qualified first-time homebuyers and handing out 1 million \"fully forgivable\" loans of up to $20,000 for Black entrepreneurs, Cuban still thinks she is better for the job than Trump.\n\n\"I want a president that is honest, ethical, open minded, not an ideologue or dogmatic,\" Cuban wrote. \"Pragmatic, analytical and learns from her experiences and from others.\"\n\n'It's the Harris campaign versus Elon'\n\nCuban isn't the only billionaire engaging in this presidential fight. Elon Musk, another Texas billionaire, has been campaigning hard for Trump.\n\n\"Elon has taken over the ground game of the Republican Party,\" Cuban told me. \"I believe this election will be won by the organization that does the job best.\"\n\nHe recognizes Musk's influence. \"It's the Harris campaign versus Elon, not even versus Trump,\" Cuban said during a recent appearance on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nBut he still doesn't understand why Musk is campaigning so hard for Trump. \"I don’t know. It doesn’t make sense to me,\" Cuban wrote.\n\nMusk's advocacy could be related to his hatred of government censorship. He now owns X, formerly Twitter. The Washington Post called Musk \"the world's wealthiest flag-bearer for free speech.\"\n\nHarris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have questioned the limits of free speech, a sentiment that has conservatives anxious about their leadership should they win.\n\nI've interviewed Cuban enough to appreciate his views on politics and policy, even though I don't share many of them. I also appreciate Musk's commitment to free speech. When I see the two of them feuding, it feels like two uncles are fighting.\n\nSo I had to ask Cuban: Musk is worth about $270 billion. Cuban is worth approximately $6 billion. How can voters know this isn't just a personal standoff between Texas billionaires?\n\n\"None of this is about Elon to me,\" Cuban said. \"He is a great entrepreneur, a world class troll, but that doesn’t (change) the fact that Kamala Harris is a far better candidate.\"\n\nMark Cuban on Trump's tariffs and paying taxes\n\nCuban clearly enjoys being in the middle of the political fray, but he's nothing if not a businessman first.\n\nCuban co-founded the first commercial streaming company, which he sold in 1999 for almost $6 billion, turning 91% of his employees into millionaires.\n\nAs the first billionaire investor on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" Cuban has been a major reason for the show's success. In the past, I've asked him about how everyday Americans should handle a possible recession. (Pay down debt and save cash.) I was curious now about his thoughts on some of Trump's more controversial economic policies and how they'd affect the finances of everyday folks.\n\nTrump, for example, recently promised he'd impose a baseline tariff of up to 20% on imports to the United States and 60% on those from China.\n\n\"We actually asked entrepreneurs that came on the show how tariffs would impact their business. They all said it was a negative for them that would increase their costs and their uncertainty of capital allocation,\" Cuban said. \"When you don’t know if tariffs will happen or what they will cost you can’t run your business as usual. And when across the board tariffs hit, more often than not they will reduce your sales and profits.\"\n\nTrump's tariff proposal is disappointing. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said it is American consumers who will \"bear the brunt\" of such a policy.\n\nConservatives who like Trump cite his tax breaks, which are set to expire in 2025, as one example of why he should be president.\n\nIn the spring, Cuban posted on X that he was proud to pay almost $300 million in taxes. I asked him why he thought the top 1% should pay more than their fair share of taxes.\n\n\"Because to a certain extent we got lucky,\" Cuban said. \"I start the streaming business right as the stock market for internet companies was exploding. That’s luck. The only reason I was in that position was because of all the amazing things this country has given me. Because of all the people who put their lives on the line to protect us. None of that is free. I truly believe that after military service, paying your taxes is the most patriotic thing you can do.\"\n\nIs paying taxes and helping others become millionaires as far as Cuban will go for America? Or would he ever put his name on the ballot as an independent?\n\nIn a 2016 interview, Cuban told me he'd never run for president but would consider vice president. The 2028 election is only four years away.\n\n\"Who would be your running mate?\" I asked.\n\nEver charming and shrewd he answered, \"Are you available?\"\n\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY.

Troy Nehls, R-Texas, said to Musk.\n\nThe tiff began earlier this week when Musk, newly departed from the administration, called Republicans' sweeping tax bill a \"disgusting abomination\" because it is expected to increase the federal debt by $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\nBut it escalated into an all-out war over the course of a few hours on the afternoon of June 5, after Trump said in Oval Office remarks that he is \"very disappointed\" with Musk's comments and suggested he wanted to kill the bill to keep electric vehicle tax credits that benefit his company Tesla.\n\nMusk said Trump wouldn't have won a second term without the quarter of a billion dollars he spent on his 2024 campaign. Trump suggested going after Musk's companies and their federal contracts. And then Musk alleged that Trump's name was in the Justice Department's files related to the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\"Now (Musk is) calling for his impeachment. I mean, it's just going off the deep end,\" said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tennessee.\n\nAnd some Republicans who had been raising concerns about the package's price tag welcomed Musk's criticism of GOP spending, avoiding commentary on the rest of the billionaire's posts.\n\n\"Elon is not wrong that we should go further, and I've said that all along,\" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas said. \"It would have been nice if he would have spoken up three or four weeks ago when we were in pitched battle over here in the House.\"\n\nDemocrats watched the feud unfold with glee. \"This is like the Real Housewives of Foggy Bottom,\" quipped Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Florida, referencing a Washington, D.C. neighborhood near the White House and lobbyist hot spots.\n\nHowever, Republicans said they weren't concerned that the spat would make it harder for them to pass their signature bill, which would extend 2017 income tax cuts and pour more money into border security while implementing new restrictions on Medicaid and food stamps.\n\n\"Every tweet that goes out, people are more lockstep behind President Trump and (Musk) is losing favor,\" said Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Oklahoma. \"I've talked to Elon Musk, he's super smart.

I helped Elon a lot,\" Trump said during a lengthy answer.\n\nFor days, Trump had remained silent as Musk called Trump's reconciliation bill \"a disgusting abomination\" and later urged his more than 200 million social media followers to lobby their representatives to \"kill the bill.\" Musk has objected to the deficit implications of the legislation ‒ fiscal concerns that the White House rejects.\n\nThe bill, which cleared the House last month with only Republican support, looks to cement Trump's domestic agenda by extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, implementing new tax breaks for tipped wages and overtime, overhauling Medicaid and food stamps, beefing up border security and significantly increasing military spending. Trump wants Congress to complete its work and send the legislation to his desk for signature into law by July 4.\n\nTrump said he'd \"always liked Elon\" and noted Musk's criticism hadn't been directed at him but rather the legislation. \"I'd rather have him criticize me than the bill, because the bill is incredible,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump later accused Musk of opposing the legislation because it would end a $7,500 consumer tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles, a policy of former President Joe Biden that has benefited electric car companies like Musk's Tesla.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than anybody sitting here,\" Trump said. \"He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to cut the EV mandate.\"\n\n'Whatever,' Musk tells Trump\n\nMusk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, was also quick to respond on the merits of the legislation.\n\n\"Whatever,\" he said on X. \"Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.\"\n\nMusk added: \"In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this!\"\n\nHe also disputed Trump's assertion that Musk was kept abreast of the bill's details. \"False,\" Musk said. \"This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!\"\n\nTrump: 'I think he misses the place'\n\nMusk left the White House last week after leading the government-slashing Department of Government Efficiency during the first four months of Trump's second term. Although Musk first voiced criticism of Trump's bill before his exit, Trump had seemed to smooth things over when he welcomed him to the Oval Office for a friendly send-off news conference on May 30.\n\nYet the gap between Musk and the White House had started to widen.\n\nMusk, before his White House departure, asked for his special government employee status to be extended beyond 130 days to allow him to continue to lead DOGE, but the White House declined, a source told USA TODAY.\n\nLast weekend, Musk expressed disappointment after Trump withdrew his nominee for administrator of NASA, Jared Isaacman, a billionaire commercial astronaut with close ties to Musk.\n\nThen came Musk's attacks on Trump's legislation, jeopardizing the fate of the second-term president's domestic agenda. Musk's criticism has given Republican senators the courage to voice their own fiscal concerns with the bill's price tag.\n\n\"I'll be honest,\" Trump said of Musk. \"I think he misses the place. I think he got out there, and, all of a sudden, he wasn't in this beautiful Oval Office.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/12/wisconsin-supreme-court-debate-between-susan-crawfprd-brad-schimel/81772335007/", "title": "Testy moments, abortion and billionaires. Takeaways from the ...", "text": "Supreme Court candidates Brad Schimel and Susan Crawford crossed swords repeatedly during a testy Wednesday debate, arguing with one another about abortion, union rights and Elon Musk.\n\n\"That's a lie,\" Schimel, a conservative Waukesha County judge, said at one point.\n\nAt another, Crawford, a liberal Dane County judge, accused Schimel of having a \"very active imagination.\"\n\nDuring the hourlong debate, Crawford accused Schimel of backing away from his support of an 1849 law banning abortion except when the mother would die without one. Schimel, meanwhile, suggested that Crawford was retreating from her opposition to voter ID and the Act 10 public union law, two measures that she went to court to try to overturn.\n\nBoth tried to distance themselves from their biggest financial supporters — Musk in Schimel's case and Democratic megadonor George Soros for Crawford.\n\n\"Elon Schimel is trying to buy this race, and people are very upset about that,\" Crawford said, mixing the names of Schimel and his biggest patron.\n\nThe debate is the first and only time the two candidates face off before the April 1 election. The event was hosted and moderated by Matt Smith and Gerron Jordan, co-hosts of the station's public affairs show \"UPFRONT\" on WISN-TV (Channel 12).\n\nSchimel and Crawford are vying for the seat being vacated in the upcoming departure of liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, who is not seeking re-election. All seven members of the Supreme Court attended the debate at Marquette University.\n\nPartisan spending and advocacy in the only nominally nonpartisan race have highlighted the stakes of the election, in which voters will decide whether liberals or conservatives control the state's highest court.\n\nHere are takeaways from the debate:\n\nDebate comes as poll shows candidates are not well known to voters\n\nThe debate comes just a week after the release of a Marquette University Law School poll that found a large percentage of Wisconsin voters still don't have an opinion about the two candidates.\n\nSchimel was viewed favorably by 29% of the registered voters and unfavorably by 32%. About two out of five said they had no opinion of him.\n\nCrawford was given favorable ratings by 19% of the voters, compared to 23% who viewed her unfavorably. Nearly three out of five said they don't know enough about her.\n\nCrawford accuses Schimel of backpedaling on 1849 abortion ban\n\nCrawford attacked her opponent early in the debate for weighing in on Supreme Court cases before the election, pointing at his past comments on the 1849 abortion ban. She noted that he once said the measure was \"valid.\"\n\nBut Schimel said he simply meant the bill had been passed by both houses of the Legislature and signed by the governor. The question, he said, is whether the law reflects the will of the voters today. He has said he would support a referendum on abortion, though the state doesn't have a system that allows voters to pass legislation on their own.\n\n\"My opponent has said he believes the 1849 law in Wisconsin is valid law.\" Crawford said. \"He's trying to backpedal from that position now.\"\n\nOverall, Crawford and Schimel are deeply divided on the issue of abortion.\n\nSchimel opposes abortion but recently said he would respect voters' \"will\" on the issue.\n\nCrawford has called the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade that struck down the constitutional right to abortion \"wrong.\" She says she's proud of her record \"fighting for our fundamental rights and freedoms.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court will decide soon whether it believes an 1849 abortion ban is the law of the state. The court will also hear a separate case on whether the Wisconsin Constitution protects the right to an abortion.\n\nSchimel has come under criticism for saying that the liberal majority, made up of four women, were \"driven by their emotions\" during oral arguments. He has said he did not point to the justices' gender while leveling the criticism.\n\nBoth candidates have said they will not let their personal beliefs affect their rulings if elected to the high court.\n\nBillionaires come under attack for their support of two candidates\n\nSchimel emphasized that he doesn't control how outside groups and individuals, including Musk, express their support for him. He declined to disavow his backing from Musk.\n\n\"I'm looking for the endorsement of the Wisconsin voters,\" Schimel said. He said he would treat Musk like anyone else if he were to appear in his courtroom.\n\nSchimel then attacked Crawford for her support from Soros, saying the billionaire had favored defunding police and allowing felons on the streets. \"He's a dangerous person,\" Schimel said.\n\nCrawford turned the conversation back to Musk. She said he has made cuts to the federal government that could impact people, including trimming the number of air traffic controllers and those studying avian flu.\n\n\"Talk about somebody who's been dangerous,\" Crawford said.\n\nShe also noted that Musk's spending comes as one of Musk's companies, Tesla, is suing the state in Outagamie County Circuit Court to overturn a decision that blocks the company from opening dealerships in the state.\n\nSchimel said he did not know if he would recuse himself if that case were to come before the Supreme Court. He said he had not seen the lawsuit.\n\nTwo Musk-funded groups — America PAC and Building America's Future — have spent more than $10 million helping Schimel in the race by airing TV and digital ads, canvassing and texting. America PAC, Musk's super PAC, has tried to turn the race into a forum on President Donald Trump by saying Schimel will support the Republican president's agenda on the court.\n\nMusk has become a highly controversial figure nationally for slashing the federal government in his role as head of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Musk, the wealthiest person in the world, spent some $288 million helping Trump's election victory in November, including paying for voter outreach in Wisconsin.\n\nFor her part, Crawford has come under fire for receiving money from prominent billionaires, including $1 million from Soros, $500,000 from Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and $250,000 from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, donations to the state Democratic Party that were funneled to Crawford's campaign.\n\nCrawford defends her record on sexual assault cases\n\nSchimel criticized Crawford for the sentence she handed down in the case of Curtis O'Brien, who was convicted of repeatedly raped a 5-year-old. He said the victim had to testify at trial, and a jury convicted O'Brien. But under the sentence handed down by Crawford, the felon spent only two years behind bars.\n\n\"This is a dangerous flaw in my opponent's judgment,\" Schimel said.\n\nCrawford pushed back, saying her opponent and other conservative groups are hitting her over her sentences in just two cases. She said the men convicted in the two cases are still on extended supervision and will be on the sex offender registry for the rest of their lives.\n\nNeither individual, she said, has re-offended. She said the same could not be said in some of Schimel's cases.\n\n\"They have focused on two cases out of thousands that I have handled, where I have sentenced people to prison and then followed that with several years of extended supervision,\" she said.\n\nIn fact, both sides have criticized the other as being soft on crime. At the debate, the two even got into whether Crawford was officially a prosecutor when she worked at the Justice Department. She said she was, while he said she was not.\n\nSchimel responds to criticism over untested rape kits\n\nAs she has throughout the campaign, Crawford accused Schimel of failing to test more than 6,000 rape kits during his first two years as attorney general. These kits contain forensic evidence collected from a sexual assault victim at a hospital.\n\nEarlier this year, Supreme Court Justice Jill Karofsky, who used to work for Schimel, said he did not ask his fellow Republicans who controlled the state Legislature and the Governor's Office for funds to more rapidly move testing forward. Karofsky is backing Crawford in the race.\n\nCrawford said Schimel spent too much time focusing on pursuing \"right-wing lawsuits\" as attorney general instead of clearing the backlog of rape kits.\n\nSchimel countered that the problem had accumulated over years. He said he needed time to inventory the kits and to find private labs to test them. His agency eventually secured a $4 million federal grant, and Schimel said his office tested more than 4,100 kits for which victims gave permission during his tenure.\n\n\"About 3 1/2 years later, every kit that needed to be tested was done,\" he said.\n\nCrawford is hesitant to say whether she'd hear Act 10 case\n\nCrawford acknowledged that she had gone to court to try to block Act 10, the 2011 law that ended collective bargaining for most Wisconsin public employee unions. She even told The Capital Times in 2018: \"I fought against Act 10.\"\n\nA Dane County judge last year ruled that much of the law was unconstitutional, and the decision has been appealed. The case is expected to come to the state Supreme Court eventually.\n\nAt the debate, she said the current lawsuit differs from the litigation she brought. She wouldn't commit to recusing herself if the matter came before her on the Supreme Court.\n\n\"It would depend on the specific facts in the case,\" she said.\n\nSchimel said it was clear what positions Crawford held on issues like Act 10, voter ID and abortion.\n\n\"Now she backs off from things she was once proud of, campaigning as a judge,\" Schimel said.\n\nHe noted that he plans to vote April 1 for a proposal to put voter ID in the state's Constitution. Crawford declined to say how she plans to vote.\n\nAs the Republican attorney general, Schimel said he would defend Act 10 and stated that its restrictions shouldn’t apply to police and firefighter unions.\n\nWhile in private practice, Crawford filed a lawsuit on behalf of the League of Women Voters to block the state law requiring voters to show photo identification. On one occasion, she likened the measure to a poll tax — the now-banned laws that imposed fees to prevent poor people, many of them racial minorities, from voting. On another occasion, she labeled it \"draconian.\"\n\nBut she has declined to state her opinion on the measure because she said she doesn't \"take positions on issues that could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\" She has said her lawsuit helped make the voter ID law better, including by making the IDs free of charge.\n\nSchimel has been a strong supporter of the law, which the recent Marquette Law School poll found had the support of 77% of those surveyed and was opposed by 22%.\n\nAlison Dirr can be reached at adirr@jrn.com.\n\nContact Daniel Bice at (414) 313-6684 or dbice@jrn.com.

Bailey and Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump taps one-time Labor secretary nominee to be EU ambassador\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday evening that he was nominating former fast-food exec Andrew Puzder to be his ambassador to the European Union.\n\nPuzder was Trump’s original nominee for Labor secretary in 2017, but Puzder withdrew his name from consideration. His nomination drew opposition from senators of both parties after he admitted to employing a housekeeper who was not legally authorized to work in the country. He was also accused of permitting practices that violated workers’ rights. A confirmation hearing was never held.\n\nFlash forward eight years, and Trump said he’d nominate Puzder to serve again, this time in the plum position of European ambassador. Ambassador nominations also require Senate approval, and Puzder will be expected to testify before the upper chamber’s Foreign Relations panel.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nVA warns: Don't hide DEI programs targeted for termination\n\nThe top official at the Department of Veterans Affairs wants staff to report if they learn of efforts to disguise diversity, equity and inclusion programs targeted for termination by the Trump administration, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThe email from Todd Hunter, Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs, says he is “aware of efforts by some in government to disguise these programs by using coded or imprecise language.”\n\nEmployees should report any such efforts within 10 days or “may result in adverse consequences,” he wrote.\n\nThe message follows President Donald Trump's executive order ending DEI programs across the federal government.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nHouthis redesignated as foreign terrorist group\n\nIn another policy reversal, President Donald Trump has changed the country's official designation for the Houthis, the Shia Islamist group active in Yemen for decades, according to a news release.\n\nTrump signed an executive order Wednesday designating Ansar Allah, the group also known as the Houthis, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization for the second time.\n\nTrump designated the Houthis a terrorist group in the final days of his last term in January. Former President Joe Biden delisted the group from that designation shortly after taking office to help facilitate humanitarian assistance to Yemen. The State Department deemed it a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group last year over its sustained attacks on commercial shippers in the Red Sea.\n\nRepublicans had urged Trump before his inauguration to redesignate the militant group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Under the Biden administration, the Iranian proxy group was delisted as an FTO\n\nThe group's designation becomes effective in 30 days.\n\n\"Under President Trump, it is now the policy of the United States to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the Houthis’ capabilities and operations, deprive them of resources, and thereby end their attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea,\" the release says.\n\nThe Trump administration will also end its relationship with groups that \"have made payments to the Houthis, or which have opposed international efforts to counter the Houthis while turning a blind eye towards the Houthis’ terrorism and abuses,\" it says.\n\n– Gabrielle Banks and Francesca Chambers\n\nSenate Democrats ask to meet privately with Pete Hegseth amid new allegations\n\nDemocratic senators on the Armed Services Committee asked Pete Hegseth to privately meet with every member of the committee after his former sister-in-law claimed in signed testimony that he terrified his ex-wife and drank to the point of vomiting and passing out, among other accusations.\n\nThe Senate has yet to vote on Hegseth's nomination for secretary of Defense, but the committee approved it Monday by a vote of 14-13, along party lines.\n\n\"We request that Mr. Hegseth meet privately with every interested lawmaker on the committee before the Senate votes on his nomination so that we can have frank discussions about the new information that has come to light,\" the group, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, said in a joint statement. \"It would be irresponsible and contrary to our constitutional duty for the Senate to vote to confirm this nomination before such meetings have occurred.”\n\nIn the affidavit, the former wife of Hegseth's brother claimed Hegseth's ex-wife hid in closet and set a code word for when he threatened her. Hegseth was dragged out of a strip club where he was getting lap dances in military uniform, and drank to the point of vomiting and passing out, she claimed. He also made racist and sexist comments disparaging Hispanic people and Muslims, according to the document.\n\nHegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, dismissed all the allegations as false.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nJohnson creates new subcommittee to investigate Jan. 6. attack\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced a new select subcommittee on Wednesday that would continue House Republicans’ investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\n“House Republicans are proud of our work so far in exposing the false narratives peddled by the politically motivated January 6 Select Committee during the 117th Congress, but there is still more work to be done,” Johnson said in a statement.\n\nThe purpose of the new subcommittee, Johnson said, is to “uncover the full truth” of the riot.\n\nThough the House did form a bipartisan select committee in 2021 to investigate the attack, Republicans have criticized the panel's findings. The select committee released a final report in 2022 that alleged the “central cause” of the attack was Donald Trump, “who many others followed.”\n\nIn response to Johnson’s announcement, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who chaired the bipartisan committee, told reporters on Wednesday that you can’t “unwrite history.”\n\n“I stand by the work that we did,” he said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMurkowski knocks Trump's Jan. 6 pardons\n\nLisa Murkowski, one of the most moderate lawmakers in Congress, knocked Trump's pardons and commutations for over 1,500 people charged and convicted in the Jah. 6 Capitol riot.\n\n\"The Capitol Police officers are the backbone of Congress— every day they protect and serve the halls of democracy,\" the Alaska Republican shared on X. \"I strongly denounce the blanket pardons given to the violent offenders who assaulted these brave men and women in uniform.\"\n\nMurkowski voted to impeach Trump during his second impeachment trial, when he was charged with inciting the Capitol attack.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nDonald Trump's transportation secretary pick clears hurdle\n\nSean Duffy, Trump's pick to lead the Transportation Department, cleared a pivotal hurdle on Wednesday. The Senate Commerce Committee voted unanimously to send his nomination to the larger Senate, where he'll have his final confirmation vote soon.\n\nDuffy, a one-time Wisconsin lawmaker and reality star, told senators he believes Boeing requires \"tough love\" from federal officials, and he would allow an ongoing safety probe into Elon Musk's Tesla to continue if he's confirmed.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWoman convicted in Capitol riot turns down pardon from Donald Trump\n\nOne of Donald Trump's first acts in office was offering pardons or commutations to nearly 1,600 people charged or convicted in the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nBut at least one recipient isn't accepting the offer. Pamela Hemphill of Boise, Idaho, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail in connection with the riot. She said her attorney told her Tuesday that she had received a pardon, but she refused it.\n\n“Accepting the pardon would be an insult to the Capitol Police officers, to the rule of law, to our nation,” Hemphill told the Idaho Statesman. “The J6 criminals are trying to rewrite history by saying that it was not a riot; it wasn’t an insurrection. I don’t want to be a part of their trying to rewrite what happened that day.”\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nDemocrats, GOP split over the idea of billionaires acquiring TikTok\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that he was open to billionaire Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, or Larry Ellison, co-founder of the software company Oracle, to acquire TikTok – an idea that Democratic lawmakers have balked at.\n\n“That’s so predictable. I mean, anytime he can use his influence to lavish favors on rich friends, he does it. And this has all been just so predictable,” said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who voted in favor of the bipartisan law.\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, said that Musk acquiring TikTok was “always a concern” of hers.\n\nBut Republicans have been open to the idea.\n\n“Somebody needs to take ownership of this from the Chinese Communist Party. I don't know who it is. I mean, if it's a U.S. citizen all the better,” said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo. TikTok's parent company, Bytedance, is based in Beijing.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\n‘We all taste like chicken’: GOP senator praises Trump’s anti-DEI move\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., commended Trump’s order placing federal DEI workers on leave.\n\n“The best way to stop discriminating against people on the basis of race of gender is to stop discriminating against people on the basis of race and gender,” Kennedy told reporters Wednesday.\n\n“The truth is the American people don't think about race or gender merely as much as some folks in Washington want to pretend,” he continued.\n\nKennedy said he would prefer a more race- or gender-blind approach to hiring, and expects to see this under the Trump administration.\n\n“To a bear, we all taste like chicken,” Kennedy said.– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMusk casts doubt on Stargate, a new AI venture touted by Trump\n\nDonald Trump’s billionaire ally Elon Musk undercut an announcement the president made Tuesday about a private sector investment of up to $500 billion to build artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nTrump said the project, named Stargate, would be a joint venture between ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, with each committing $100 billion for immediate deployment.\n\nAn announcement of the venture by Open AI CEO Sam Altman on X, was immediately derided by Musk.\n\n“They don’t actually have the money,” wrote Musk. Moments later, he added another tweet saying, “SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.”\n\nMusk has been a vocal critic of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman since the company became a for-profit entity.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump says he’s not looking to hurt Russia…but\n\nPresident Trump urged Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to “stop this ridiculous” war with Ukraine or face consequences.\n\nTrump said he would be forced to “put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia” to the United States in a post on Truth Social.\n\n“I’m not looking to hurt Russia. I love the Russian people, and always had a very good relationship with President Putin,” he said, saying the warning was a “favor” to Russia, whose economy he said was “failing.”\n\n“Let’s get this war, which never would have started if I were President, over with,” he said.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nHouse Speaker Johnson doesn’t ‘second-guess’ Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Wednesday he wouldn’t second-guess President Donald Trump’s decision to pardon nearly 1,600 people charged with the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nJohnson said peaceful protests should never be punished and that the Justice Department was weaponized against Trump’s supporters. But the pardons also covered hundreds of people convicted of assaulting police and other violence.\n\n“It was a terrible time and a terrible chapter in America’s history. The president has made his decision. I don’t second-guess those,” Johnson said. “We believe in redemption. We believe in second chances.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nHouse Speaker Johnson calls Biden pardons of relatives ‘shocking’\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., slammed former President Joe Biden for pardoning his son Hunter, brother James and other relatives before leaving office Monday and said legislative action was possible.\n\n“It was shocking,” Johnson said. “It was breathtaking to us.”\n\nHe noted that Democrats criticized President Donald Trump four years earlier at the possibility he would pardon allies before leaving office. But Johnson said the pardons confirm GOP suspicions about what he called “the Biden crime family.”\n\nHouse Republicans conducted an impeachment inquiry against Biden, which included close scrutiny of Hunter Biden and James Biden for their overseas business deals. The former president denied wrongdoing and said he never benefited from the deals. Hunter Biden was convicted of gun and tax charges. Lawmakers urged the Justice Department to investigate James Biden.\n\nThe former president pardoned Hunter Biden WHEN and James Biden and other relatives on his last day in office Monday.\n\n“To us it is disgusting,” Johnson said. “There is a lot of attention that will be paid to this and we will be looking at it as well.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nPolice groups say Trump pardons for Jan. 6 ‘sends a dangerous message’\n\nTwo law enforcement groups – the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police – said President Donald Trump’s pardon of people charged in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, “sends a dangerous message” and they should have served their entire prison terms.\n\n“When perpetrators of crimes, especially serious crimes, are not held fully accountable, it sends a dangerous message that the consequences for attacking law enforcement are not severe, potentially emboldening others to commit similar acts of violence,” the two groups said in a joint statement Tuesday.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police had endorsed Trump in September and both groups said they have longstanding and positive relationships with him. But they voiced disappointment with Trump pardoning nearly 1,600 people, including hundreds convicted of assaulting police officers, and ended the sentences for 14 people.\n\n“The IACP and FOP firmly believe that those convicted of such crimes should serve their full sentences,” the groups said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump to address world leaders gathered in Davos\n\nPresident Donald Trump will be addressing leaders gathered at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday via video, according to organizers.\n\nThe address will start 11 a.m. and last 45 minutes.\n\nThe first day of the meeting coincided with the inauguration of President Trump, and the organizers expect the White House to be a “key topic” as Trump’s policy will impact the global economy in many ways.\n\n“These include imposing steep tariffs on other major economies, reassessing long-held military and diplomatic alliances, reforming multilateral institutions and rolling back an array of US regulations,” according to organizers.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nSen. Sanders defends Gabbard, Trump’s pick to lead DNI\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday night defended Tulsi Gabbard, President Trump’s pick for director of national intelligence, in an interview on CNN.\n\nSome lawmakers have called Gabbard, a former congresswoman from Hawaii, a likely “Russian asset,” and expressed concerns over Gabbard’s 2017 trip to Syria, where she met with former Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nGabbard, who was a Democrat when she served as a congresswoman from 2013 to 2021, supported Sanders during his presidential run in 2016.\n\nSanders said Gabbard “took a lot of heat” for supporting him over Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe said he was not worried about her visit with Assad.\n\n“The idea that you should not sit down with your adversaries whether it is Iran, whether it's China, whether it's North Korea, whether it's Syria, whatever it may be,” he said. “I don't think that that's a valid criticism.”\n\nHe went on praise Trump for his own meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2018.\n\n“Donald Trump did the right thing. Every once in a while, he does,” he said.\n\nHe said he had not made up his mind on how he would vote for Gabbard during the upcoming Senate confirmation hearing.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump orders end to FAA diversity hiring practices\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a document Tuesday evening that directed the Federal Aviation Administration to cease its use of diversity, equity and inclusion hiring authorities. He singled out disability hiring authorities in particular.\n\n“During the prior administration … the FAA betrayed its mission by elevating dangerous discrimination over excellence,” the president argued. He further decried the recruitment of \"individuals with serious infirmities,\" in a rebuke of disability hiring efforts.\n\nThe country's aviation watchdog used expedited disability hiring authorities for at least a decade, including during Trump's first administration. Such programs permitted hiring managers to bypass the competitive hiring process to appoint professionally qualified candidates with disabilities.\n\nIn the document, Trump argued pro-diversity hiring practices \"[penalize] hard-working Americans who want to serve in the FAA but are unable to do so, as they lack a requisite disability or skin color.”\n\nThe agency, however, struggles with large shortages of air traffic controllers, who must meet stringent medical requirements that disability hiring authorities could not circumvent.\n\nThe move is one of many executive actions focused on the federal workforce enacted since Trump took office Monday afternoon. His other actions addressed DEI hiring more broadly, froze hiring in most executive agencies and directed a return to in-person work for many federal employees, among other directives.\n\n– Davis Winkie\n\nTrump executive order inverts civil rights hiring protections\n\nPresident Donald Trump revoked a 1965 civil rights executive order Tuesday, rolling back authorities long used to prevent employment discrimination by federal contractors, subcontractors and grant recipients. He also ordered agencies to plan potential civil rights investigations against private sector entities who embrace diversity hiring.\n\nIn his own executive order, Trump attacked such policies as “dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called ‘diversity, equity and inclusion.’”\n\nTrump’s order flips the script, arguing that affirmative action provisions are illegally discriminatory. Federal agencies instead must now “enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.”\n\n– Davis Winkie\n\nWhat is on President Trump’s schedule today?\n\nTrump will sit down today for an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity for the first interview from the Oval Office, according to Politico.

In a statement to CNN Business on Tuesday, the company said it intends “to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement.”\n\nMusk’s back-and-forth with the company is widely viewed as him setting the stage to renegotiate the offer price, or else back out of the deal entirely. No matter what happens next, however, one thing is certain: Musk has created a big mess for Twitter, the effects of which won’t be easily or quickly undone. And in the meantime, the company’s employees, users and shareholders hang in the balance.\n\nIn one scenario, Twitter is bracing for an innovative but erratic billionaire owner who is expected to cut some staff, overhaul the leadership team and potentially undo years of content moderation efforts with uncertain outcomes for advertisers, users and the morale of the staffers who remain.\n\nIn another scenario, Twitter faces the prospect of a prolonged legal battle with the world’s richest man if he tries to back out of the deal, not to mention the possibility of other acquirers coming out of the woodwork. The result could be unending background noise that adds to challenges for Twitter to hold on to staffers and regain momentum.\n\nAs Wedbush analyst Dan Ives put it on Friday, after the Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO first said he was putting the deal “temporarily on hold” over the spam account issue, the “Twitter circus show” has morphed into a “Friday the 13th horror show.”\n\nA prolonged fight\n\nFrom the start, there have been doubts about the deal going through, including from Musk. Shortly after announcing his offer to buy Twitter last month, Musk said in an on-stage interview at the TED conference, “I’m not sure I’ll actually be able to acquire it.” Industry watchers have also questioned whether Musk will be able to finance the acquisition. The recent decline in Tesla shares, which he’s partly using to back his financing of the deal, has only added to those concerns.\n\nTwitter’s stock has traded noticeably below the $54.20 per share Musk offered throughout the deal process, an indication of investor skepticism about the deal being completed or completed at that price. As of this week, Twitter stock has wiped out all the gains since Musk first disclosed taking a large stake in the company early last month.\n\nWith his latest public statements, Musk raised the possibility that Twitter has significantly undercounted the amount of spam and fake accounts on its platform in its quarterly disclosures, though he has yet to provide evidence to support that claim. In the process, some legal experts say, Musk appears to be trying to lay the groundwork to argue inaccurate information would constitute a “material adverse event,” which might entitle him to back away from the deal.\n\nBut the bar for such a claim is high. Twitter has made the same boilerplate disclosure — that spam accounts make up less than 5% of its active users — for many quarters. Moreover, a recent securities filing from Twitter revealed that Musk waived due diligence before making his offer to buy Twitter. That concerns over spam may squash the deal is all the more curious considering Musk said part of his motivation to acquire Twitter in the first place was to rid it of such accounts.\n\nElon Musk has been raising doubts about his ability to complete the takeover of Twitter since the day he and the company announced the deal. Ryan Lash/AFP/TED Conferences, LLC/Getty Images\n\nShould Musk ultimately try to back out of the deal, he could be on the hook for a $1 billion breakup fee. He could also effectively open the door to litigation from Twitter to enforce the terms of the merger agreement and compel him to buy the company.\n\nBrian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, told CNN Business that Twitter is in “a very strong legal position” if it tried to go to court and force the deal on the original terms. But there are still business risks here for Twitter in going that route, which could push the company to negotiate a somewhat lower deal price.\n\nAs Wedbush’s Ives put it: “Then it gets caught in the courts for 12 to 18 months. It’s a significant overhang on Twitter, and it becomes just a fiasco as they’re basically just caught up in this circus show.”\n\nTwitter and Musk did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nChallenges for Twitter either way\n\nEven if the deal is completed, the company could still be in for a period of significant turbulence.\n\nMusk has said he plans to remove content restrictions on the platform in the name of what he calls “free speech,” by which he has said he means all legal speech in the various markets in which Twitter operates. Musk has also said he would restore former President Donald Trump’s account on the platform and do away with many of the permanent bans that Twitter and other platforms have used to handle repeat violators of their rules.\n\nSuch steps could move Twitter closer to some less moderated social media sites popular with conservatives that have yet to gain significant traction, in part, some say, because many users and advertisers prefer not to be on platforms rife with harmful content like misinformation and harassment.\n\n“The places which are just cesspools of no content moderation have not taken off,” said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. Thus, there could be conflict between Musk’s stated goal to grow Twitter’s business and his plans for how to handle content moderation.\n\nIf the deal doesn’t go through, Twitter could still face renewed scrutiny of its business, its spam accounting methods and its content moderation decisions, after Musk has spent weeks criticizing the company on these fronts.\n\nFor much of its life as a public company, Twitter has struggled to grow its audience and to boost its stock price. Prior to Musk taking a stake last month, Twitter’s stock was trading below the closing price from its first day of trading more than eight years ago.\n\nIf the deal collapses, it may only reignite investor pressure on Twitter to bolster growth — and to do so at a time when the broader tech sector is struggling. It also raises the possibility of other acquirers attempting to scoop up the company at a discount from what Musk offered.\n\nIn a regulatory filing this week, Twitter said its board had considered whether to reach out to other companies about a potential acquisition. It opted not to because Musk’s offer had been publicly disclosed and because “other parties were unlikely to have the interest in, or capability to, acquire Twitter … based on the regulatory, financing and other execution risks applicable to each party discussed.”\n\nThose unknowns risk adding to the apparent chaos and uncertainty already generated by Musk’s takeover inside Twitter.\n\n“If I’m an employee right now, I’m probably throwing my resume around, looking around for new jobs,” said Angelo Zino, senior industry analyst at CFRA research. “In a situation like this, you could potentially lose some great talent.”\n\nIn fact, Twitter already has. The company confirmed to CNN Business this week that three senior employees have left the company. Twitter also said last week it had implemented a partial hiring freeze and parted ways with two longtime executives: general manager of consumer Kayvon Beykpour, and revenue product lead Bruce Falck.\n\nAgrawal addressed on Twitter last week why a “‘lame duck’ CEO would make these changes if we’re getting acquired anyway” and the difficult state of the tech industry that the company is navigating.\n\n“While I expect the deal to close, we need to be prepared for all scenarios and always do what’s right for Twitter,” he said. “Regardless of the company’s future ownership, we’re here improving Twitter as a product and business for customers, partners, shareholders, and all of you. … Our industry is in a very challenging macro environment – right now. I won’t use the deal as an excuse to avoid making important decisions for the health of the company, nor will any leader at Twitter.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Catherine Thorbecke", "Clare Duffy", "Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/05/19"}]}

Storms and hurricanes in the eastern Pacific generally have little impact on the United States, as most of them usually either affect Mexico or head out to sea.\n\nStill, both starts are reminders that hurricanes are coming, and the time to be prepared for these storms is now.\n\nTropical weather outlooks resume\n\nOn hiatus since November 30, 2024, the National Hurricane Center once again is issuing updates on the state of tropical weather in both the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins.\n\nThe outlooks discuss areas of disturbed weather and their potential for development for the next seven days, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They are issued routinely from May 15 until the end of the hurricane season (November 30).\n\nDo storms form in May?\n\nBy far, most Atlantic tropical cyclones form during the six-month June-November season, with the height of the season usually from mid-August to mid-October.\n\nHowever, since accurate hurricane records began in 1851, 32 named storms have formed in the Atlantic basin in May, according to Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach.\n\nAnd many of those storms have formed recently: \"We did have a flurry of May storms from 2007-2021, with 11 named storms forming during May during that 15-year period,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nHowever, over the past three years, \"we haven't had any May storm formations,\" he said. No storms are currently spinning in either basin, though forecasters from AccuWeather continue to warn of potential tropical development near Central America in the May 17-24 timeframe.\n\nPlans to start the Atlantic hurricane season earlier were scrapped a few years ago.\n\nEastern Pacific hurricane season begins\n\nThe eastern Pacific hurricane season officially begins May 15. Mexico regularly gets hit with hurricanes and tropical storms on its west coast.\n\nEastern Pacific hurricanes seldom hit the U.S. West Coast because they need two things to stay energized: warm water and favorable winds. The California coast typically benefits from cooler water that flows southward along the coast and winds that tend to either shear the tops off hurricanes or push them westward away from the coast.\n\nRemnants of eastern Pacific tropical storms and hurricanes that hit Mexico sometimes bring rain and flooding to the U.S. Southwest.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2025/06/13/june-slow-start-hurricane-season/84149218007/", "title": "Is the Atlantic seeing a slow start to hurricane season? Not exactly", "text": "The Atlantic hurricane season's seemingly slow start is chugging along more or less on schedule.\n\nThe first named storm doesn't typically form until late-June, with the first hurricane not showing up until August.\n\nCSU's updated 2025 hurricane season forecast maintains that we will see above-normal tropical activity.\n\nThe 2025 Atlantic hurricane season started just shy of two weeks ago, but things haven’t been quite as dynamic as early conditions in the tropics suggested.\n\nBetween 1991 and 2020, June has seen an average of 5.5 named storms between the Pacific and Atlantic basins. The majority of those storms spin up in the Pacific, however, with the Atlantic averaging only one named storm, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe first named storm in the Atlantic tends to happen around June 20, putting us in line with what is historically par for the course so far.\n\nTropical waves in the Atlantic: NHC tracking 3 tropical waves as Saharan dust, tepid sea temperatures keep Atlantic subdued\n\nIt’s a point that Colorado State University made when it published an update to its 2025 hurricane season forecast on Wednesday, reaffirming that this year is set to see above-normal tropical activity.\n\nPhil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher with CSU and the lead author of the forecast, stressed that early season activity isn’t an indicator of how the rest of the season will play out.\n\n“Compared to the last few years maybe it’s sluggish because the odds of having a Category 5 in the Caribbean are pretty low,” Klotzbach said.\n\n2024’s dynamic start to the Atlantic hurricane season was abnormal\n\nThe 2024 Atlantic hurricane season got off to a strong start, with two named storms developing in the basin in June.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto formed on June 19th after quickly organizing. The storm made landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico, and resulted in five fatalities.\n\nThe second storm, Hurricane Beryl, made history when it became the first Category 4 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic in June. Beryl broke another record in July when it became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, with winds reaching 165 mph.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pacific basin saw no tropical activity throughout the first month of the season. Its lack of storms in June is just as much a departure from the norm as the Atlantic’s explosive start.\n\nWhen does the Atlantic usually see its first hurricane?\n\nTropical development in the Pacific basin ramps up a bit earlier than the Atlantic, which is why it starts on May 15 instead of June 1.\n\nNOAA says that June tends to see an average of 5.5 named storms between the two basins, with the Atlantic seeing about one. Storms tend to form later in June, too, around June 20.\n\nSo, when can we expect to see the first hurricane? Not until mid-August, according to NOAA. The first hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season forms around Aug. 11, according to historical data between 1991-2020. The first major hurricane tends to pop up around Sept. 1.\n\nWhat will hurricane season bring in July?\n\nUnlike the Pacific, the Atlantic hurricane season’s window for tropical activity is heavily condensed between August and October, which means July is still pretty early.\n\nSince 1851, July has accounted for only 7% of the Atlantic’s tropical storms, according to NOAA, which totals around 146 storms. Roughly 43.8% of those storms have intensified into a hurricane. That puts the odds of a hurricane forming in July at about once every three years.\n\nIn other words, you don't need to worry about explosive tropical activity in July, but you should still remain watchful.\n\nHistorical data showing the point of origin for tropical development in June is focused around the Gulf and the Caribbean, with very little activity in the Atlantic. That will start to change in July as formation areas spread eastward.\n\nNotable July hurricanes\n\nThere have been a few notable July storms in recent years:\n\nHurricane Dennis, July 10, 2005: The Category 3 storm hit the western Florida panhandle. It was the strongest hurricane to have made landfall in the U.S. in July.\n\nHurricane Arthur, July 3, 2014: The Category 2 hurricane hit North Carolina and was the most recent storm to reach the U.S. in July.\n\nHurricane Dolly, July 23, 2008: Dolly was a Category 1 and was the most recent to reach land along the Gulf Coast, in South Padre Island, Texas.\n\nTropical Storm Emily, July 30, 2017: Emily, which hit Florida, was the most recent tropical storm to make landfall in July.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/06/25/was-tropical-storm-andrea-first-named-storm-of-2025-hurricane-season-outlook-noaa-predictions/84352592007/", "title": "Was Tropical Storm Andrea the first named storm of the season?", "text": "Tropical Storm Andrea, the first named storm of 2025, formed in the Atlantic but quickly weakened and dissipated.\n\nThe storm's short lifespan was due to its movement into cooler waters and strong wind shear.\n\nWhile early tropical storm activity can suggest a busy hurricane season, it's not a guaranteed predictor.\n\nNOAA predicts an above-normal 2025 hurricane season due to various factors including warm ocean temperatures and weak wind shear.\n\nThe first named tropical storm of the 2025 season, Tropical Storm Andrea, formed in the Atlantic Ocean on June 24.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, the storm was spinning in the open waters of the Atlantic, heading away from the U.S. mainland, USA Today reported.\n\nTropical Storm Andrea is not considered a major safety concern, as the storm is forecasted to have a short lifespan, however, the storm does mark the beginning what's expected to be an active hurricane season.\n\nFirst named storm of 2025 Tropical Storm Andrea forms in the Atlantic\n\nTropical Storm Andrea was detected to have maximum sustained winds of about 40 mph with higher gusts. The storm was forecasted to begin weakening Tuesday night, June 24, and to dissipate by Wednesday night, June 25, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nTropical Storm Andrea has since weakened into a post-tropical cyclone, meaning that the system has lost its tropical characteristics.\n\nThe storm had begun moving toward the east-northeast at 17 mph, a direction and pace that quickly brought the storm into cooler waters, USA Today reported. The tropical storm swiftly dissipated as it reached chilly waters and strong wind shear, according to The Weather Channel.\n\n2025 hurricane season outlook\n\nCurrently, activity within the upper atmosphere has been contributing to storm activity in the eastern Pacific, and contributing to winds that help keep storms suppressed in the Atlantic. Now, the Climate Prediction Center's long-range outlook shows that this pattern could continue for a couple of weeks, USA Today reported.\n\nIn June, tropical storms typically develop close to the U.S., off of the southeast coast, in the Gulf Coast or in the Caribbean. Later in the season, storms usually form out of tropical waves moving off the coast of Africa, The Palm Beach Post reported.\n\nEarly tropical storm activity can indicate an active hurricane season, although, this is not a definitive predictor. While early activity can suggest a more active season, it's possible that an active June and July can be followed by a quieter year, says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe NOAA has predicted this hurricane season to be above-normal, citing a number of factors for an above-average season, including continued ENSO-neutral conditions, warmer-than-average ocean temperatures, weak wind shear and the potential for higher activity from the West African Monsoon.\n\nPresley Bo Tyler is a reporter for the Louisiana Deep South Connect Team for Gannett/USA Today.

The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season begins Sunday, June 1.\n\nForecasts say the season will bring months of danger for millions of Americans, and the time to prepare starts well before the storms form.\n\nIn the Atlantic Basin, which includes storms that form in the Atlantic, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of America (formerly known as Gulf of Mexico), hurricane season lasts from June 1 until Nov. 30. Historically, 97% of all tropical cyclones in the Atlantic will form between those two dates.\n\nIn the eastern Pacific Basin, hurricane season started on May 15 and lasts until Nov. 30. (Tropical Storm Alvin formed in the the eastern Pacific Ocean on May 29, becoming the first named storm anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere this year.)\n\nOfficials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the most dangerous storms can quickly explode in intensity, so understanding forecasts, hurricane dangers and preparedness should be top-of-mind for residents well before storms start forming.\n\nHere's a primer on what to know as hurricane danger ramps up in 2025.\n\nWhen does hurricane season peak?\n\nThe peak of the Atlantic season is typically from mid-August until mid-October.\n\nHurricane season forecasts: How many storms are expected?\n\nFederal forecasters on May 22 predicted a 60% chance of an above average season. (A typical year averages about 14 tropical storms, seven of which spin into hurricanes, based on weather records that date from 1991 to 2020.)\n\nSpecifically, NOAA is forecasting a range of 13 to 19 total named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher). Of those, 6 to 10 are forecast to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3 to 5 major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).\n\nExperts from Colorado State University said in their initial forecast released in early April that an active Atlantic hurricane season is likely. They predicted as many as 17 storms.\n\nOf those 17 storms, researchers said that nine will become hurricanes.\n\nA forecast from AccuWeather, which also came out in April, called for 13-18 named storms, of which 7-10 will be hurricanes.\n\nLast year, 18 storms formed, including devastating Hurricanes Helene and Milton.\n\nWhat state has the most hurricanes?\n\nFlorida, by a wide margin. Since accurate hurricane records began in 1851, more than 120 hurricanes have made landfall in the state of Florida. Texas is second, with 66 hits.\n\nAnd according to NOAA, 40% of all U.S. hurricanes have hit Florida.\n\nHow can you prepare for hurricane season?\n\nCheck with your local government to see if you live in an evacuation zone.\n\nHave a plan for where you would go if you need to evacuate and share that plan with friends or loved ones. Plan to travel only as far as you need to.\n\nWrite a family emergency plan with your family and/or close friends to decide how you would contact each other in an emergency, where you will go and what you will do. Keep copies on your phone, in your emergency supplies and share with family.\n\nPut together a basic emergency kit, with water and shelf stable foods for up to a week, flashlights, back up batteries, a first aid kit and moist towelettes.\n\nReview your insurance policies to ensure if you have adequate coverage, including flood coverage.\n\nStore insurance policies, photos of your home and its contents and other important papers in a safe place, in electronic files and/or share copies with family members.\n\nFor more suggestions, visit NOAA's hurricane preparations page.\n\nWhat is rapid intensification?\n\nA rapid strengthening of a hurricane, when wind speeds increase by at least 35 mph in 24 hours.\n\nIt occurs when a tropical storm or hurricane encounters an extremely conducive environment for strengthening, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. That environment consists of very warm water, low vertical wind shear and high levels of midlevel moisture.\n\nWhat is storm surge?\n\nStorm surge, the massive amount of water that builds up and comes ashore during a hurricane, is often the deadliest and most destructive threat from these storms.\n\nIt is characterized by water being pushed toward the shore by the force of the winds moving around the storm, NOAA said.\n\nStorm surge has accounted for about half of all the deaths in hurricanes since 1970, according to the National Hurricane Center. It caused most of the 1,800 deaths in Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nWhat are the Atlantic hurricane names for 2025?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2025/05/22/hurricane-season-2025-noaa-forecast/83668265007/", "title": "NOAA hurricane season 2025 forecast says Atlantic primed for storms", "text": "Atlantic hurricane season 2025 is almost here and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says a \"confluence of factors\" are set to fuel tropical cyclones in coming months.\n\nNOAA officials said to prepare for danger now as they released a forecast that predicts a 60% chance of an above average season.\n\nSpecifically, NOAA is forecasting a range of 13 to 19 total named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher). Of those, 6 to 10 are forecast to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3 to 5 major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).\n\nA typical year averages about 14 tropical storms, seven of which spin into hurricanes, based on weather records that date from 1991 to 2020.\n\nBefore announcing the 2025 outlook, NOAA's acting administrator Laura Grimm said last year's outlook was \"right on the money.\"\n\nIn 2024, 18 named storms formed, including devastating Hurricanes Helene and Milton. With more than 400 fatalities, 2024 was the nation's deadliest hurricane season since 2005, said National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan. It was also the third-costliest on record, after 2017 and 2005.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season begins June 1 and continues through November 30. The first storm name will be Andrea.\n\nWhy the above-average forecast?\n\nThe season is expected to be above average due to a \"confluence of factors, including continued ENSO-neutral conditions, warmer than average ocean temperatures, forecasts for weak wind shear, and the potential for higher activity from the West African Monsoon, a primary starting point for Atlantic hurricanes,\" NOAA said in a media release.\n\n(\"ENSO\" is short for \"El Niño - Southern Oscillation,\" the overall term for the El Niño / La Niña climate cycle that affect weather worldwide. \"ENSO-Neutral\" means neither El Niño nor La Niña conditions are present.)\n\n\"All of these elements tend to favor tropical storm formation,\" NOAA said.\n\nMeteorologist Andy Hazelton of the University of Miami, writing on X, said that it was a \"pretty reasonable outlook for the season from NOAA. I'm a little surprised they are this confident that we will be above average but the fact that we seem likely to be cool neutral ENSO at worst for peak season means that (wind) shear should be pretty low.\"\n\nHe added that the Atlantic Ocean temperatures will probably determine if the season is closer to the lower numbers or the higher numbers of storms in the prediction.\n\nWhat do other hurricane season 2025 forecasts say?\n\nOther top forecasters are predicting an active season. Colorado State University's hurricane forecasting team, led by Phil Klotzbach, predicted 17 total named storms, of which 9 will be hurricanes, in its April forecast.\n\nAccuWeather's forecast, which came out in March, calls for 13-18 named storms, of which 7-10 will be hurricanes.\n\nThe record for most actual named storms in a season is 30, set in 2020.\n\nThough no tropical cyclones have formed in the Atlantic or Pacific so far this year, the National Hurricane Center says a tropical depression could form in late May in the eastern Pacific Ocean south of Mexico. It's too soon to say if the system would impact any land areas.\n\nHow to prepare for hurricane danger\n\nThe best time to prepare for a hurricane is before hurricane season begins, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nIt is vital to understand your home's vulnerability to storm surge, flooding, and wind. Here is your checklist of things to do before hurricane seasons begins. Here are some USA TODAY links to bookmark on how to prepare your home for a hurricane and how to prepare a go-bag in case you need to evacuate.\n\nHere's what you should do: Prepare now for hurricanes, Trump warns.\n\n2024 was a deadly year for hurricanes\n\nWith a U.S. death toll of at least 241, Helene was the continental United States’ deadliest single storm since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when about 1,400 people died.\n\nOther deadly storms in 2024 included Hurricanes Beryl and Milton, each of which killed over 40 people in the United States.\n\nEastern Pacific forecast also released\n\nNOAA forecasters also released their prediction for the eastern Pacific Basin, saying that a below-average season was most likely.

But, two weeks ago there was an unusual and brief tropical disturbance in the Atlantic Ocean which could signal hurricane season will start early this year.\n\nFor now, forecasters are assessing the big-picture climate forces that will soon shape the season.\n\nWhat's the forecast for the 2025 Atlantic Hurricane Season?\n\nMost preseason hurricane forecasts have yet to appear as of late March. AccuWeather's forecast, released Wednesday, calls for 13-18 named storms, of which 7-10 will be hurricanes.\n\nTop forecasts from experts at Colorado State University will be released in early April, while the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's forecast comes out in May. Other forecasts from governmental, academic and research organizations will be released over the next couple of months.\n\nOne very early forecast from the U.K.-based Tropical Storm Risk called for a near-average season, with 15 named storms, of which 7 will be hurricanes.\n\nWhen does the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season start?\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season, which also includes all storms that form in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of America (recently renamed by President Donald Trump from the Gulf of Mexico), officially begins June 1 and lasts through the end of November. The bulk of activity typically occurs from mid-August to mid-October.\n\nThe eastern Pacific hurricane season begins May 15 and also extends to November 30. Eastern Pacific storms seldom have direct impact on the U.S., though they often affect Mexico.\n\nWhat happened in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season?\n\nAccuWeather expects this season to be similar to the 2024 season, which was \"one of the most devastating and costliest on record.\"\n\nWith more than 400 fatalities, 2024 was the nation's deadliest hurricane season since 2005, said National Hurricane Center director Michael Brennan. It was also the third-costliest on record, after 2017 and 2005.\n\nWith a U.S. death toll of at least 241, Hurricane Helene was the continental United States’ deadliest single storm since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when about 1,400 people died.\n\nOther deadly storms in 2024 included Hurricanes Beryl and Milton, each of which killed over 40 people in the U.S.\n\nIn all, 18 named tropical storms and hurricanes formed in 2024, which is above the long-term average of 14. Of those 18 storms, 11 of them strengthened into hurricanes.\n\nWhat's up with La Niña? What does 'ENSO-Neutral' mean?\n\nDriving factors of hurricane season include how warm the water is in the Atlantic Ocean (the warmer, the more likely to have rapidly intensifying storms) as well as what's happening in the Pacific Ocean, namely if it's in a La Niña, El Niño or neutral pattern.\n\nLast year's hyperactive Atlantic hurricane season received a boost from climate troublemaker La Niña, a cooling of Pacific Ocean water that forecasters now say is weakening. It's being replaced by so-called \"ENSO-Neutral\" conditions, which mean that ocean water isn't particularly cool or warm.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, hurricanes occur more frequently during the neutral phase (when neither El Niño nor La Niña are in effect) than they do during El Niño.\n\n\"Although hurricanes occur more often during La Niña episodes, significant tropical weather events have occurred during the neutral phase,\" the weather service said in an online report. \"For example, the record-shattering 2005 hurricane season that included Katrina and Rita occurred during the neutral phase.\"\n\nAccuWeather said that the weather pattern could change by the second half of the hurricane season, which could make it more active.\n\n\"A trend toward a La Niña could yield an active end to the season, while a trend toward El Niño could lead to an earlier end to the season,\" DaSilva said.\n\nWhat are the 2025 hurricane names?\n\nThe first named storm of the season will be Andrea, followed by Barry, Chantal and Dexter. Storms get a name when their sustained winds reach 39 mph and attain hurricane status at 74 mph.\n\nWhat should you do now to prepare?\n\nAccording to NOAA, the best time to prepare for hurricanes is before hurricane season begins. \"Understand your risk from hurricanes, and begin pre-season preparations now,\" NOAA said in an online report, noting that it's key to understand and interpret forecasts and alerts, and know what to do before, during, and after a storm.\n\n\"Avoid having to rush through potentially life-saving preparations by waiting until it’s too late,\" the agency also recommends. \"Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2025/06/24/tropical-storm-andrea-tracker-path/84331519007/", "title": "Tropical Storm Andrea tracker: First named storm of 2025 forms in ...", "text": "Editor's Note: Andrea has weakened into a post-tropical cyclone. Click here for the latest update on June 25.\n\nTropical Storm Andrea became the first tropical storm of the season in the Atlantic on June 24, according to the National Hurricane Center, although it could have a short life span.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, the storm is spinning in the open Atlantic Ocean, traveling away from the mainland United States. While the storm itself isn't a major safety concern, it marks the first named storm of what's expected to be a busy and dangerous Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nAndrea was centered about 1,205 miles west of the Azores with maximum sustained winds near 40 mph with higher gusts. The hurricane center said weakening is expected to begin by Tuesday night, June 24, with Andrea \"dissipating by Wednesday night.\"\n\nHurricane center forecasters said the storm is moving toward the east-northeast at 17 mph, a pace that is quickly taking it into cooler waters and conditions that will be \"increasingly hostile\" to storms. That motion is expected to continue for the next day or so.\n\n2025 hurricane season's first storm shows up late\n\nAlthough it's expected to be a busy hurricane season in the Atlantic, the 2025 season is getting off to a bit of a late start. On average, the first Atlantic named storm forms on June 20, said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist in the atmospheric science department at Colorado State University. Klotzbach is among the seasonal hurricane outlook experts who predicted a busier than average season.\n\nActivity in the upper atmosphere has been contributing to storm activity in the eastern Pacific and contributing to winds helping to keep storms tamped down in the Atlantic, meteorologists have said. For now, the Climate Prediction Center's long-range outlook shows that pattern could continue for a couple of weeks.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. Ninety-seven percent of tropical cyclone activity occurs during this time period, NOAA said. The peak of the season is Sept. 10, with the most activity happening between mid-August and mid-October, according to the hurricane center.\n\nTropical Storm Andrea path tracker\n\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm.

The forecast is unchanged from its initial April release, which calls for 17 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nActivity is expected to be about 125% of the average hurricane season from 1991-2020. Activity in 2024 – with its five landfalling hurricanes in the mainland United States – was about 130% of average. The Colorado State team also sees an above-average probability of major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean.\n\n“So far, the 2025 hurricane season is exhibiting characteristics similar to 1996, 1999, 2008, 2011, and 2021,” said lead author Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist in Colorado State's atmospheric science department. His co-authors are CSU professor Michael Bell and research scientist Levi Silvers.\n\nThe risk of a major hurricane, with winds of more than 111 mph, making landfall somewhere along the entire U.S. mainland coastline is about 51%, according to the update.\n\nHurricane season is here: The nation's top forecaster wants you to know these things\n\nAlthough seasonal outlooks provide clues for emergency responders and risk managers, forecast experts say it's important to remember that even just one hurricane or tropical storm can be disastrous, regardless of what happens the rest of the season.\n\nThe Colorado State update included this reminder: \"Thorough preparations should be made for every season, regardless of how much activity is predicted.\"\n\nWhat's the immediate storm outlook?\n\nNo tropical storm activity is indicated over the next seven days by the National Hurricane Center.\n\nA longer-range outlook through July 1, shows the risk of tropical development elevated only in the waters just to the north of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center.\n\nHow do they predict hurricane season outlooks?\n\nResearch scientists prepare seasonal outlooks by analyzing conditions in the ocean and atmosphere, including data collected by NOAA. The first was published at Colorado State by the late pioneering researcher William Gray in 1984.\n\nAmong the factors expected to influence this season are warmer-than-normal waters in the tropical Atlantic, and neutral conditions in the tropical Pacific, with neither an El Niño or a La Niña in control.\n\n“Sea surface temperatures across the eastern and central Atlantic are warmer than normal, but not as warm as they were last year at this time,” according to the CSU outlook. Warmer sea surface conditions create a more favorable environment for any potential storms to feed off that warm water energy.\n\nNeutral conditions in the Pacific, along the equator west of South America, tend to have less influence on the formation of storms in the Atlantic basin than either end of the spectrum.\n\nAn El Niño's warmer-than-normal waters along the equator west of South America can stir up trade wind patterns that tend to prevent storms in the Atlantic from building the kind of high tops they need to sustain hurricanes. A La Niña on the other hand, with its pattern of cooler than normal waters in the Pacific, can contribute to more hurricanes in the Atlantic basin because the prevailing trade winds over the Atlantic are calmer and less disruptive to potential storms.\n\nAlthough neutral conditions are expected through the fall and winter, chances are almost equal for the formation of a La Niña, according to the Climate.gov website.\n\nWant a head start on hurricane prep?

Prevost, 69, was born and raised in Chicago but went on to spend most of his career in Peru, first as a missionary and then as a bishop. He is a dual U.S.-Peruvian citizen.\n\nPrevost's ascension resurfaced concerns about his record on clergy sexual abuse during his tenure in Chicago and in Peru, including that he failed to do enough to address victims' allegations.\n\nThe Vatican has denied Prevost engaged in any wrongdoing, and the former cardinal has drawn plaudits in other cases for helping address abuse threats. He has also advocated for more transparency on the topic from the church.\n\nIn an interview with the Peruvian newspaper La Republica, he denounced clergy sexual abuse and urged victims to come forward. In Peru, he helped dissolve an ultra-conservative Catholic movement Sodality of Christian Life after investigations uncovered years of sexual abuses, corruption and mismanagement, according to the Vatican News.\n\nStill, survivors are worried he will not take a tough enough stance to eradicate abuse within the church.\n\nCases in Chicago, Peru spur questions of accountability and transparency\n\nWhile Prevost led the Augustinians in Chicago in 2000, a priest whose former ministry years earlier had been restricted over allegations of child abuse, moved into an Augustinian monastery near a Catholic elementary school. Church officials at the time failed to notify the school and, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, church records even claimed there was no school nearby.\n\nIn 2006, the Illinois attorney general added the priest, James Ray, to its public list of \"abusive clerics and religious brothers,\" claiming there were 13 reported survivors between 1974 and 1991. The Vatican has denied that Prevost permitted Ray to live at the monastery.\n\nPrevost also faces allegations of inaction in connection with his time in northwestern Peru. While he served as a bishop in Chiclayo in 2022, three woman came forward with allegations that they were sexually abused by two priests beginning in 2007 when they were minors.\n\nThe victims said in a public statement that Prevost failed to thoroughly look into the allegations. They said, \"no investigation was carried out, nor were the precautionary measures for the protection of the faithful, boys and girls ... the case was filed and archived,\" according to the National Catholic Reporter.\n\nTwo months before Prevost was elected pope, SNAP filed a complaint against him with the Vatican, claiming he failed to open an investigation and \"sent inadequate information to Rome.\"\n\nCivil authorities in Peru closed the case after the statute of limitations had passed. The Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, which investigates cases of clergy sexual abuse, closed the case in 2023.\n\nIn a public letter, the Diocese of Chiclayo said accusations that the former cardinal \"remained silent in face of the complaints ... is not true.\" The Vatican has also denied any wrongdoing by Prevost.\n\nPrevost helped bring down abusive Catholic group in South America\n\nPedro Salinas, a Peruvian journalist who wrote a bombshell expose on the Sodalitium of Christian Life in 2015, said Prevost played “an extremely important role” in the Catholic movement's dissolution.\n\nLeaders of the ultra-conservative group founded in Peru had faced widespread allegations of corruption as well as physical, psychological and sexual violence, including against minors.\n\nIn January, Prevost and Pope Francis, who had long paid close attention to the case, met with Jose Enrique Escardo, one of the group's victims who spoke out against the movement and its abuses. Pope Francis dissolved the movement weeks before he died, according to the Vatican News.\n\n\"It was a stunning and extremely rare outcome,\" said Bishop Accountability, a victims advocacy group in a statement after Prevost was elected pope. \"Yet punishing abusers isn’t heroic — it’s moral and decent. We pray we see more of this decisive action by Prevost when he is pope.\"\n\nSpeaking to the media on May 8, Bishop Carlos García Camader, the head of Peru's bishops' conference, praised Prevost's work with abuse survivors, saying he \"opened the way here in Peru to listen to the victims, to organize the truth commission\" against the Sodalitium of Christian Life.\n\nIn public statements, Prevost has stated firmly that he stands against sex abuse in the church. In the 2019 interview with La Republica, he encouraged victims of abuse to come forward and said he supported more transparency from the church.\n\n\"We reject the cover-up and secrecy, that does a lot of damage, because we have to help the people who have suffered from the bad act,\" he said, later adding, \"On behalf of the Church, we want to tell people that if there was any offence, if they suffered or are victims of the bad actions of a priest to come and denounce it, to act for the good of the Church, of the person and the community.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/opinions/putin-self-defeating-strategy-ghitis", "title": "Opinion: The world condemns Putin's war | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Frida Ghitis, (@fridaghitis) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe moment was extraordinary. In an age of profound divisions, the world stood almost single-mindedly united in chastising Russia’s assault on Ukraine.\n\nFrida Ghitis CNN\n\nIn an emergency session at the United Nations Wednesday, a resolution denouncing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, was approved by a vote of 141 to 5, with 35 countries abstaining. When the tally was announced, the chamber burst into a spontaneous standing ovation. It was the most resounding evidence of how Putin has unwittingly advanced the causes he opposes with his assault against Ukraine.\n\nIf the contest of our times is one pitting democracies against autocracies – and I believe it is – Putin’s campaign is making the case for democracy, despite his best efforts.\n\nThe war against Ukraine is only a few days old, but already Russian President Vladimir Putin has amassed a stunning series of historic achievements – all of them precisely the opposite of what he might have hoped to accomplish.\n\nThe conflict is still raging, and Putin may yet turn the tide of an invasion in which his forces have struggled, but much of the damage he has done to his cause – much of what he has done to clarify the principles of democracy, self-determination and global solidarity, and to strengthen the very ideas, organizations and countries Putin tried for decades to undermine – will carry on regardless of his invasion’s ultimate outcome.\n\nFrom the United States to NATO to the European Union, Russia’s unprovoked assault on its neighbor sparked unqualified revulsion, defended only by a smattering of autocrats, with even some of them hesitating to give their full support to the attack.\n\nPutin gave the world a rare moment of moral clarity. The crisis he created presented us with the real-life dangers of unrestrained autocracy, and a very tangible demonstration of the importance of democracy, freedom and self-determination. Rights that are so often seen as lofty, ethereal concepts suddenly became palpable when Putin tried to steal them from the Ukrainian people.\n\nAnd Putin’s assault gave a renewed sense of mission to organizations whose stated mission is to preserve peace, security and democracy.\n\nIn the United States, which has suffered in recent years from the dangerous virus of political polarization – aggravated by Moscow’s interference – Russia’s attack created an uncommon upswelling of near-unanimity. A CNN poll found upward of 80% of Americans backing sanctions to punish and pressure Russia, with equal majorities of Democrats and Republicans aligned to say the US should do even more.\n\nThe sentiment was replicated around the world, with mass demonstrations and concrete measures taken not just by governments, but by private companies. Major corporations have decided to take a principled stance, even at high financial cost.\n\nAt the United Nations General Assembly, representatives of 193 countries gathered for an emergency session – the first of its kind in 40 years – to debate a resolution deploring Russia’s “unprovoked armed aggression.”\n\nThe UNGA’s president, Abdullah Shahid of the Maldives, called the body “the collective conscience of humanity.” And humanity spoke. Speaker after speaker rose to condemn Russia’s aggression. Just a few dared defend it. Even China, one of Putin’s only allies, called for respecting international borders.\n\nUkraine’s envoy Sergiy Kyslytsya warned, “If Ukraine does not survive, international peace will not survive … If Ukraine does not survive, we cannot be surprised if democracy fails next.”\n\nCanada’s Ambassador Bob Rae, who like dozens of his peers decried Russia’s actions, addressed the Russian people, telling those who have dared challenge Putin with antiwar protests, “We see you and we hear you,” and telling the Russians that their president, who has caused this crisis, “sorely miscalculated,” by ignoring the democratic spirit of the Russian people. It was a reminder of how this disaster could upend Putin’s hold of his own country.\n\nRussia’s representative repeated the false pretexts for this war, claiming Russia is only defending itself from Ukraine’s threat.\n\nPutin’s war has turned the Ukrainian people’s courageous defense of their independence and their democratic choices into an inspiration for their rest of the world. By attacking and claiming they’re not a real nation, he stoked Ukraine’s sense of nationhood and patriotism.\n\nIf Putin expected the West to be divided, NATO to stumble, the European Union to be paralyzed, he must be as surprised as the rest of the world by the global resolve he ignited.\n\nNATO had been disparaged as “obsolete,” and “brain-dead,” but Putin has infused it with new purpose.\n\nIts most hesitant members, the ones closest to Moscow until now, have thrown their full support to resisting and countering Putin’s aggression. Turkey is blocking access to the Mediterranean from the Black Sea to warships, including from the Russian Navy.\n\nGermany, most at risk from losing Russian fuel, seems transformed.\n\nAfter multiple US presidents tried to pressure Berlin to raise its defense spending to the 2% of GDP required by NATO rules, it was Putin who made it happen. Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared, “Feb. 24, 2022 marks a historic turning point,” referring to the date of the invasion. He announced Germany will immediately raise defense spending above 2% and speed development of non-Russian gas alternatives.\n\nEastern European autocrats, including Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a favorite of right-wing provocateurs, and the Czech Republic’s President Milos Zeman, disparaged by his critics as the “servant of the Kremlin,” expressed alarm and revulsion at Putin’s actions. Zeman declared, “It’s necessary to isolate a lunatic…\n\nOrban, whose links to the EU have frayed in recent years, was unequivocal. “Together with our European Union and NATO allies,” he said, “we condemn Russia.”\n\nPutin managed to remind everyone, especially his neighbors, about why they joined NATO. For people everywhere, but especially in countries that were once dominated by the Kremlin, it was an unsettling reminder that their freedoms are not guaranteed.\n\nIn the process, Putin has branded himself as a global outlaw, possibly a war criminal. Moral clarity is always useful.\n\nIn the past, Putin’s has been able to overcome Western sanctions by counting on the greed of Western investors. But the private sector found his actions just as abhorrent. It’s not often one sees private firms, driven by profits, foregoing billions of dollars to take a moral stand.\n\nPutin likely expected his military would secure a quick victory, then Russia would coast over a wave of sanctions by exploiting divisions in the West, investors’ greed and support from other autocrats. Russians are already paying the price for his miscalculation.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAs his forces push against a Ukraine that is more united than ever, the world – East and West – has been reawakened to civilizations’ fundamental values. Putin has reminded everyone that national borders should be sacrosanct, and that everything we take for granted – not just our freedoms, but the basic assumption that when we wake up in the morning our world will not have been turned upside down by the whims of a dictator – depends on respect for principles that must be defended.\n\nThe resolve of the international community – of the people of the world – will be tested if this conflict continues much longer, and especially if Putin succeeds. The sanctions against Russia, the obstacles on its exports, it all may amount to new hardship on the people who now support Ukraine’s struggle and oppose his aggression. The coming days, weeks and months may well challenge everyone’s determination and strength of character.\n\nFor now, Ukraine is doing the heavy lifting, but the vast majority of the world is standing in solidarity, understanding that Ukraine’s fight is everyone’s. That’s quite an accomplishment for Vladimir Putin; not one he hoped to achieve.\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect the latest news.", "authors": ["Frida Ghitis"], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/31/saint-carlo-acutis-mother-catholic-church/83913492007/", "title": "Carlo Acutis' mom speaks on Catholic Church's first millennial saint", "text": "NEW YORK – Every mother thinks her son is a saint, but Antonia Salzano's is about to become a real one.\n\nCarlo Acutis was only 15 when he died of leukemia nearly two decades ago. But he had led the kind of holy life that set him apart from young people, Salzano said May 29 to a nearly full chapel at the University of Mount Saint Vincent in the Bronx.\n\nShe hopes his life can inspire others to develop their faith at a time when religion, including the Catholic Church, has been waning among young people.\n\n\"Each one of you is special, remember,\" she told hundreds of congregants, including students. \"God loves you infinitely and, really, you can be the light of the world.\"\n\nAcutis is set to be canonized by United States-born Pope Leo XIV as the first millennial saint.\n\nSalzano, who is Italian but whose grandmother was born in New York, is touring America to spread messages about her son's life to younger audiences.\n\nShe spent the afternoon of May 29 visiting Mount Saint Vincent and Manhattan's St. Patrick's Cathedral, the seat of New York's archdiocese. That is, when she wasn't stuck in New York City's infamous traffic.\n\nAcutis' holiness was visible in his daily life, Salzano told Mount Saint Vincent's parishioners, in his devotion to attending Mass and studying the eucharist, as well as in how he treated others.\n\nSalzano, who would go on to study theology to better understand her son, said she was simply a witness to this.\n\n\"Of course, I’m not a saint,\" she told USA TODAY after an afternoon Mass. \"I only have this role.\"\n\nAcutis died in 2006. Ever since, people have reported miracles after praying to him, including a Costa Rican woman cured from a severe brain hemorrhage in 2022, and a Brazilian boy whose pancreatic malformation disappeared in 2013. These documented cases propelled his sainthood.\n\nIn 2020, Pope Francis beatified him, giving him the title of “Blessed.” The College of Cardinals in July 2024 voted to canonize Acutis. He was set to officially become a saint on April 27 at the Jubilee of Teenagers, but Francis' death six days earlier led to a postponement. Acutis' canonization is now expected later this year.\n\nMount Saint Vincent's Rev. William Cain admitted to parishioners before Salzano arrived that he had had trouble writing that day's homily.\n\n“What might be holier than a saint?” Cain, a Jesuit priest, quipped. “The mother of the saint.”\n\nWho was Carlo Acutis?\n\nInitially a mostly nonreligious woman, Salzano acknowledged her son was special.\n\nAcutis, born in London in 1991, began saying the rosary daily at around 5-and-a-half years old. At 7, he had his first first communion.\n\nHis friends looked to him for guidance and support, and he stood up to bullies who picked on students with disabilities,Catholic news outlets reported.\n\nAt home, his mother said he’d reflect each night: What did I do today? How did I behave ‒ with classmates, teacher, parents?\n\nMuch of this is known, Salzano said, because he took lengthy notes as a boy. He wanted to win the battle of original sin that humans are born into, she said, echoing something her son would repeat: “All of us are born original, but many of us die as photocopies.”\n\nA computer lover, he created a website about eucharistic miracles: the bread that exemplifies the body of Christ, becoming actual flesh, which Acutis chronicled of cases in Argentina in the 1990s; or, as he described, wine turning into blood, such as in Croatia in 1411.\n\nAcutis loved video games. But to discipline himself, he limited himself to one hour per week.\n\nAlso every week, he went to confession. This purified him of sins that typically weigh on people, Salzano said.\n\nFrom 'Blessed' to forthcoming saint\n\nScores of clergy and laypeople clamored inside the university’s chapel to take pictures with Salzano and shake her hand.\n\nYoung girls who wore braids and plaid skirts – telltale signs of Catholic school attendance – cued up. So too did boys, in burgundy polos and khakis flagging their religious school bona fides.\n\nSeated toward the back of the chapel, Clare Fay, 25, donned beige Adidas Gazelles and carried a tote.\n\n“There are still saints today,” said Fay, originally from Alabama and a recruitment associate for a Catholic education nonprofit that sends teachers to Catholic schools across the country.\n\nSalzano spoke on Ascension Day, the Christian holiday when Jesus Christ is believed to have risen to heaven. “It’s not coincidental,” Kentucky native Troy Lasley, 30, a teaching fellow in the Bronx, noted. “We would call that providential.”\n\nFewer younger Americans, including Catholics, describe themselves as religious, polling shows. Pope Francis sought to bring the church to the people, especially younger people disaffected by scandal and abuse. Acutis personified that effort.\n\n“When we look at the stories of saints, we don’t necessarily see ourselves. The youth don’t necessarily see themselves,” said Susan Burns, president of the University of Mount Saint Vincent and a psychologist, standing near the altar. “To have a saint who is a millennial, very much, can speak to their stories.”\n\nSeeing the mother of a saint might help people explore their faith. Salzano said her son is a sign of hope for others.\n\nAt the end of her speech, Salzano gifted the university a relic containing a piece of Acutis’ hair. She handed out prayer cards depicting his image to hundreds of attendees.\n\nOne woman sobbed seeing Salzano. Later, she told USA TODAY her daughter was living with a brain aneurysm. Seeing the woman whose son had helped someone with a similar condition seemed like a sign from God. She prayed to Acutis for her daughter.\n\nSalzano rushed out of the chapel as more people swarmed her. A car drove her through rush hour traffic, to speak at St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\nAcross Gotham, she’d tell others about her saintly son.\n\nEduardo Cuevas is based in New York City.

Just seven weeks ago he was comprehensively beaten by Liz Truss in the Conservative party’s leadership contest. Now. after emerging victorious in a leadership contest that was fast-tracked out of the wreckage of her short premiership, he is Prime Minister.\n\nThe man who served as Boris Johnson’s finance minister for two and a half years, only to resign and bring down Johnson’s government, now faces the unenviable task of picking up a reeling nation after Truss’s disastrous tenure.\n\nHe will do so, it’s fair to assume, by implementing the economic plan that he outlined during his failed leadership bid earlier this year. Sunak criticized Truss’ plans to slash taxes and fund day-to-day spending through borrowing, saying it would cause economic havoc.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See the moment Tory Party announced Sunak to be next British PM 01:38 - Source: CNN See the moment Tory Party announced Sunak to be next British PM 01:38\n\nHe was proved right when Truss’ government implemented her plans in a “mini-budget,” which caused the pound to fall to its lowest level in decades and collapsed bond prices, sending borrowing costs soaring and pushing pension funds to the brink of insolvency.\n\nAs Sunak also predicted, rising interest rates drove up mortgage repayments, and lenders scrambled to pull their products from the market, dashing the hopes of many prospective homeowners almost overnight.\n\nBritain’s international reputation had already taken a hit before Truss came to office. The endless scandals that ultimately forced Johnson from office, on top of his repeated threats to break international law over the Brexit deal he personally agreed with the European Union, had not made world leaders well-disposed towards the UK.\n\nThat’s not to say the UK is irrelevant on the world stage. The government’s support of Ukraine, for example, has won Britain – and particularly Johnson – praise from other Western leaders.\n\nFormer US National Security Advisor John Bolton wrote in Politico on Monday that “Britain has been the leading foreign power supporting Ukraine. Under the triumvirate of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Defense Secretary Ben Wallace, London was at the forefront of political resolve and leadership.”\n\nSunak’s accession can be directly attributed to the chaos of the past few months. He is seen as a safe pair of hands, having won wide praise for his handling of the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic, helping businesses and citizens with big government spending programs that saved many livelihoods. His job now is clear: To bring calm.\n\nUnfortunately for Sunak, he has inherited a political party that has spent the past few years tearing chunks out of itself. The Conservative party of 2022 is defined by factionalism and split loyalties that made it ungovernable for both Johnson and Truss.\n\nThe party is divided on many more lines than left and right, but Sunak will likely have the most difficulty with the Brexiteer populist wing of the party that adored Johnson.\n\n“The reality is, the hardest elements of the Brexiteer right probably didn’t back anyone because they know there is a row coming with the new PM over Brexit,” Salma Shah, a former Conservative adviser, told CNN. “One of the top priorities for Sunak will be negotiating the Northern Ireland Protocol (A disputed part of the post-Brexit deal). If it doesn’t start going their way, they can turn.”\n\nSunak can either ignore or appease these people, but it could mean having to swallow a large slice of humble pie.\n\n“He can try and neutralize the people from that wing of the party who won’t forgive him over ‘betraying’ Boris or his fiscal restraint by appointing a cabinet that appeases them. Potentially, that means swallowing his pride and finding something for Boris and Liz Truss to do,” Shah added.\n\nIf he doesn’t then Johnson could cause Sunak problems from the backbenches, if he was in the mood for revenge.\n\n“Presumably he won’t put him in the government which could mean he causes trouble on the backbenches. I guess they have to hope he gives up his seat and goes off to make money,” said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University.\n\nParty management is something that might be out of Sunak’s hands in the immediate future. What is firmly in his gift, however, is economic policy and dealing with international partners.\n\n“He’s someone with a lot of global experience outside of politics and also dealing with global figures as chancellor. He is a fluent communicator and he knows what he is talking about when it comes to the economy. So I think there is every chance he will be welcomed by the international community not only if he can settle the economy but also UK politics,” Bale added.\n\nIn an ideal world for Sunak, he would bring economic stability, and with it, bring political stability. But long-time observers of British politics will know that the two don’t always go hand in hand.\n\n“He will have to implement policies because of Truss’s mini-budget that will be politically unpopular with different groups for different reasons,” said Vicky Pryce, former joint head of the UK’s Government Economic Service.\n\nThat, Pryce said, could mean austerity to balance the books, windfall taxes on energy firms, and reversing Truss’s idea to remove caps on bankers’ bonuses. “He has to balance policies that could enrage Conservative MPs against policies that could turn the public against him.”\n\nFor their part, Conservative MPs and advisers are a mix of relieved, furious, worried and in some cases defeated. Some think that the public will appreciate a bit of peace and quiet from the political mayhem. Some are beside themselves that the man who brought down Johnson got his way. Some believe that Sunak is going to be too soft on Brexit. Some believe that the next election is already lost.\n\nThere are in theory at least two years until the next general election will be held. That is more than enough time for Sunak to steady the ship and restore the Conservative’s dire poll ratings to something more competitive. But he needs to take his party with him.\n\nAnd if the past few weeks are anything to go by, the new prime minister might become another Conservative leader who is forced to spend more time managing the internal politics of his own party than dealing with the massive problems facing his country.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/opinions/georgia-former-soviet-putin-ukraine-antelava", "title": "Opinion: Why did it take the West so long to wake up to Putin's ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Natalia Antelava (@antelava) is the co-founder and editor in chief of Coda Story, which reports on the roots of global crises, including disinformation campaigns in the former Soviet Union.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nTbilisi CNN —\n\nThis terrifying, world-changing conflict in Ukraine did not start in 2022. Nor did it start in 2014. It began a decade and a half ago when Russia invaded Georgia and got away with it.\n\n“Remember the red button?” a friend texted when the first Russian bombs fell on Kyiv. In the region that has been colonized and tormented by Russia for centuries, everyone remembers the red “reset” button: the gift of an illusory fresh start that Hillary Clinton presented to the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during their meeting in Geneva 2009.\n\nBy then, the invasion of Georgia’s capital Tbilisi had been averted, but with 20% of its territory occupied by Russia, the country’s sovereignty was dangerously crippled. The Georgian government, America’s closest non-NATO ally in the region, was warning about a new, hybrid war. But after all the trauma of Bush’s foreign adventures, the United States was eager to move on.\n\nAs Clinton presented Lavrov with a red button, global headlines focused on the amusing fact that Americans had managed to misspell “reset” in Russian and that it made Lavrov laugh. But the region gasped for air: everyone who has experienced Russian oppression knew that what really pleased Lavrov was that Moscow got away with murder.\n\nOver the next 14 years, it would happen again and again. Many of us, including me, didn’t think Putin would launch an invasion of this scale against Ukraine. Millions of us – Ukrainians, Moldovans, Georgians, Syrians, Armenians and Azeris – have all participated in dress rehearsals for the horror show that the Kremlin has now unleashed. And we know that it did not have to come to this.\n\nThe playbook Putin has been using to rebuild his empire was always rudimentary. The supposed antagonists were always an oppressed population and a “fascist” government backed by the United States.\n\nBut with each rehearsal Putin tweaked the play. In Georgia in 2008, Putin’s soldiers had dirty boots and rusty tanks, but he first tested his now infamous cyber attacks. He got away with it.\n\nBy the time Russian troops arrived in Crimea six years later, they had shiny new boots and new uniforms modeled on US special forces. And Putin, fresh after his Olympics triumph in Sochi, was more confident than ever. He lied at a scale we had never seen before, telling the world that Russian soldiers were not Russian soldiers , and then he annexed Crimea. He got away with it.\n\nThen came Donbas and Syria, interference in the US elections, the Salisbury killings and the Navalny poisoning. And each time he got away with murder, we met a new Putin – more brutal at home and more audacious abroad.\n\nThe United States and Europe spent millions countering Russian disinformation. But debunking his propaganda was not enough to counter the narratives Putin had pushed using powerful, multi-million dollar media networks that he kept building, at home and abroad.\n\nThis network, which included big names like RT and Sputnik, but also hundreds of small websites and social media channels, tapped masterfully into existing fears and legitimate grievances of each audience they addressed.\n\nAmerica’s 2003 invasion of Iraq and the disaster that followed was a gift Putin used to turn any debate into another round of exhausting whataboutery, which in turn made Putin a hero for the European far-left.\n\nHe turned LGBTQ+ rights into a frontline of his domestic attack on the West, telling traditional Russians and their neighbors that their families and their values were under threat. It worked. “I am fighting because I do not want to be forced to marry a man,” a pro-Russian fighter in Ukraine told me in 2014.\n\nEventually this family values narrative caught up in the West, turning Putin into an unexpected hero for the far right. Authoritarian populists all around the world were suddenly reaching out for help: Kremlin-funded Sputnik was training state media workers from Georgia to the Philippines and India and by 2020, Brazilian president Bolsonaro was repeating a myth about a supposed Western plot to legalize paedophilia that I first heard on the Russian state TV back in 2012.\n\nBut what made Putin truly powerful was not the narratives he molded or territories that he grabbed. It was the complacent, stubborn refusal of the collective West to accept that he was at war with them.\n\nFor years, Western media portrayed Ukraine as a country “at war with itself.” But it never was. It was bewildering to me that after all these years, even before this latest, and possibly fatal for him, invasion, the debate in the West focused on rights and wrongs of the NATO enlargement and not the fact that a sovereign country has the right to choose its own path.\n\n“What will it take for them to wake up?” one Ukrainian soldier asked me, when I interviewed him as a journalist about Georgia’s and Ukraine’s shared ordeal in 2015. Now we know the answer, but back then, as we sat in a cold, wet trench on the frontline of Ukraine’s war we could not find it.\n\nThe soldier, Dima, was like every Ukrainian you now see on your screen: stoic, determined, calm. He was 23, a software engineer from Kyiv who had only recently decided to leave his job and join the fight. His girlfriend was furious with him, he told me, but fighting was not optional.\n\n“They think we are fighting to join NATO. But we are only fighting for our values and they happen to be the same as Europe’s values. We are fighting for them too. I wish they realized it,” he said.\n\nThey do now. The whole world is suddenly high on moral clarity. For everyone who has lived on the frontlines of Putin’s hatred for liberal democracy, this show of Western unity and the resurgence of liberal values comes as an incredible relief. But it won’t last unless we also accept that it already comes too late for far too many.\n\nIt is too late for Georgians who never stopped losing lives and land, for countless residents of Aleppo who died in the Russian bombardment, for 298 men, women and children who fell from the sky when a civilian Boeing MH17 was shot down by a Russian BUK missile in 2014, for thousands who died in the Donbas in the last 8 years and for countless others who are yet to die in Ukraine.\n\nIt is too late for Dima, who was killed in eastern Ukraine in fighting a year after we spoke and long before Europeans finally recognized that it was them he was fighting for.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nHis question why it took the West so long to wake up is still being asked by millions of people who live on frontlines of Putin’s hatred for liberal democracy all around the world. It is the question that should inform whatever the West does with the new world order that will hatch out of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.", "authors": ["Natalia Antelava"], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/06/texas-flooding-live-updates-sunday/84479748007/", "title": "Texas flooding live updates: Death toll at 81 as more rain on the way", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Texas flooding for Sunday, July 6. For the latest news on the Texas floods, read USA TODAY's coverage for Monday, July 7.\n\nAuthorities on Sunday were in a desperate search to find those still missing after historic flash floods swept across central Texas — including 10 children from a beloved all-girls camp — as the death toll rose and forecasters warned of more rain.\n\nState and local authorities said at least 81 people have died in flooding triggered by unrelenting rain Thursday night into Friday. As of Sunday afternoon, Sheriff Larry Leitha of Kerr County, where the worst of the flooding occurred, said authorities had recovered the bodies of 40 adults and 28 children.\n\nAmong those still missing were 10 children and a counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp at the edge of the Guadalupe River, which surged over 26 feet in less than an hour as storms dumped six months' worth of rain over the Texas Hill Country.\n\nIt's unclear how many people were missing in the communities along the Guadalupe, where local officials say thousands of people came from out of town to celebrate Independence Day weekend. Forecasters expect several more inches of rain on Sunday and warned of additional flooding and a worsening of conditions on the ground.\n\nAt least 41 people were known to be missing across the state and areas affected by the flooding, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference on Sunday afternoon. The governor noted that search and rescue efforts were still underway.\n\n\"There were so many people who were just camping out — not children in camps — but adults camping out near the river, people in RVs and things like that,\" Abbott said. \"There are people who are missing, who are not on the known, confirmed missing because we don't yet know who they are.\"\n\nFor days, crews have been working around the clock to find the missing, traversing swollen waterways and scouring riverbanks littered with mangled trees and rubble. Rescuers have pulled residents from rooftops and found survivors clinging to trees. As of Sunday, about 650 people have been rescued, officials said.\n\n\"We will continue our search efforts until everybody is found,\" Leitha vowed.\n\nWhat Texas cities flooded? Here's where the most rain fell this weekend\n\nTrump deflects on FEMA's future\n\nAfter raising the prospect of abolishing the Federal Emergency Management Agency earlier this year, President Donald Trump deflected when asked if he wants to phase out the agency.\n\n\"FEMA is something we can talk about later,\" Trump told reporters. \"But right now they’re busy working so we’ll leave it at that.\"\n\nFEMA was activated in Texas after Trump declared a major disaster area in Kerr County following devastating flooding. The president said he plans to visit Texas later this week.\n\nWhile touring flood damage in North Carolina in January, Trump commented that \"I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away.\" In Los Angeles, which was devastated by wildfires, Trump added: \"I say you don't need FEMA, you need a good state government.\"\n\nCameron Hamilton, Trump’s former acting FEMA administrator, said during a congressional hearing in May that he opposed abolishing the agency. The Department of Homeland Security later announced that Hamilton was being replaced as the head of FEMA.\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nReport: Granddaughters of ex-Detroit Free Press publisher among killed\n\nThe twin granddaughters of David Lawrence Jr., the former publisher of the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, were among the dozens killed during massive flooding in Central Texas, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nThe girls, both 8 years old, and their sister, 14, attended Camp Mystic in Kerr County, the newspaper reported Sunday. Officials said earlier in the day that ten campers and a counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp at the edge of the Guadalupe River, remain unaccounted for.\n\n\"It has been an unimaginable time for all of us,\" Lawrence told the Herald. \"Hanna and Rebecca gave their parents, John and Lacy, and sister, Harper, and all in our family, so much joy. They and that joy can never be forgotten.\"\n\n— Charles A. Ventura\n\nResidents urged to remain vigilant amid ongoing risk of flooding\n\nThe Williamson County Office of Emergency Management urged residents to remain vigilant amid the dangers of ongoing flooding. The agency said the county was under a flood watch through 10 p.m. local time on Sunday and advised motorists not to drive past barricades or through water flowing over a road.\n\nThe county confirmed on Sunday that two people died due to flooding. The first victim, identified as 22-year-old Kaitlyn Swallow, was recovered late Saturday by the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nFollowing another day of searching, the county said the body of another person was recovered and one person was still missing.\n\n\"My heart goes out to those who lost their loved ones in the devastating floods over the holiday weekend,\" County Judge Steven Snell said in a statement. \"We have a long way to go in this recovery phase, but I know Williamson County is a caring and resilient community. The outpouring of support from the public to those impacted is humbling.”\n\nTrump said he expects to visit Texas later this week after catastrophic flooding caused extensive death and destruction in the state.\n\n\"Probably on Friday,\" Trump told reporters on Sunday when asked about visiting the state. \"We wanted to leave a little time. I would’ve done it today, but we’d just be in their way.\"\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Trump signed a major disaster declaration for hard-hit Kerr County.\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nKerr County officials continue search and rescue operations\n\nThe Kerr County Sheriff's Office said search and rescue operations continued on Sunday with a \"full response from local, state, and national first responders.\"\n\n\"We continue to have hundreds of officers, deputies, and support staff working every aspect of this emergency, along with air, water, K9, and other assets conducting search and rescue,\" the sheriff's office said in an update Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe sheriff's office noted that there was additional rain in the upper Guadalupe basin, leading to a rise in Johnson Creek that may result in a rise of 1 to 2 feet downstream when it enters the Guadalupe River in the small city of Ingram.\n\nAs of 1:30 p.m. local time, the sheriff's office said authorities recovered 68 bodies in Kerr County, including 40 adults and 28 children. Eighteen adults and 10 children are pending identification.\n\n\"We continue to offer our condolences to those affected, and we are working tirelessly to reunite families,\" the sheriff's office said. \"We know there are many people concerned and affected by this tragic situation.\"\n\nGov. Abbott warns of dangers for the next 24 to 48 hours\n\nAbbott and other state emergency officials held Sunday's news conference in the city of Austin due to the deadly storms that have swept across central Texas and more expected storms that will \"pose life-threatening danger over the next 24 to 48 hours.\"\n\nThe governor advised the public to remain \"extraordinarily\" cautious and follow safety guidelines as heavy rainfall and additional flash flooding were expected across the Concho Valley and near Kerrville.\n\n“If you’re in any of those regions, you need to realize, for one, you’re in an area that is already saturated with water,“ he added. \"But for another, when more water comes down, it could lead to rapid flash flooding events. Now, there's nothing expected at this time to the magnitude of what was seen in Kerrville. That said flash flooding can occur at lower levels of water than what happened in Kerrville.\"\n\nAuthorities search for missing people\n\nTexas officials urged the public and residents to contact local authorities to provide name identification and other information about a person who is suspected to be missing.\n\nThe missing included two people each in Williamson and Burnet counties, near Austin, according to Texas Department of Public Safety Director Freeman Martin. The two people missing in Burnet County were identified as Michael Phillips, chief of the Marble Falls Area Volunteer Fire Department, and a 17-year-old girl.\n\nMajor General Thomas Suelzer, with the Texas Military Department, said the department conducted a total of 525 rescues or evacuations, including 366 by air and 159 by ground, as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nA community ravaged: In Texas Hill Country, deluge leaves a heartbreaking toll\n\nWarnings for deadly Texas flash flooding came with little time to act\n\nFor the meteorologists and hydrologists tracking the weather patterns that led to the deadly Independence Day floods in the Texas Hill Country, the most urgent advisories weren’t deployed until it was almost too late, according to interviews and advisories.\n\nForecasters said they pushed out warnings as fast as they got the data. But the hilly terrain and the trickiness of predicting flash floods made forecasting — and alerting communities along the Guadalupe River in real time — particularly challenging.\n\n\"This is a problem that we are constantly trying to work on: how to better communicate,\" Greg Waller, a hydrologist at the National Weather Service’s West Gulf River Forecast Center in Fort Worth, told USA TODAY. \"We can issue the best forecast in the world, but if it's not put in the hands of the individuals so they can make the best decision, that forecast has little value.\" Read more here.\n\n– Rick Jervis\n\nFlood survivor: 'I could see the water coming in'\n\nKeri Patton awoke to the sound of water crashing through her San Angelo home. Seemingly without warning, 18 feet of floodwater quickly enveloped her house on the morning of July Fourth after the Lake View area saw a record-breaking 14 inches of rainfall in only a few hours.\n\n\"I could see the water coming in, gushing from every direction,\" Patton told the San Angelo Standard-Times, part of the USA TODAY Network. “I was like, 'I gotta get out.' Everything was underwater. And when I left, I couldn’t get the gate open from the water. When we finally got my truck out, (water) was up to the bottom of the doors.\"\n\nBefore Patton escaped, she called her sister Laura Debusk, who lives in Clovis, New Mexico. She found shelter at a nearby friend’s house while Debusk made the five-hour drive to San Angelo.\n\nWhen Debusk arrived at Patton’s house, the water level had reached its maximum height. The house was partially submerged in 4 to 5 feet of water.\n\n\"I’ve helped her build her dream house, and this is what it is,\" Debusk said. \"This is her life, and I’m doing everything I can to give it back to her.\"\n\n— Paul Witwer, San Angelo Standard-Times\n\nFEMA offers disaster assistance to Texas flood victims\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency announced disaster assistance for those who’ve been impacted by flooding in Kerr County.\n\nThe federal agency said assistance includes grants for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans, among other programs. The announcement came after President Donald Trump signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, the epicenter of the violent flash floods.\n\nTrump said in June that he plans to phase out FEMA after the hurricane season and floated eliminating the agency. He has criticized the agency as being ineffective and said he wants it to \"give out less money\" to states responding to natural disasters.\n\nGeorge W. Bush says he's 'heartbroken' over deadly Texas floods\n\nFormer President George W. Bush said he and his wife, Laura, are \"heartbroken by the loss of life and the agony so many are feeling.\"\n\n\"Those who have lost their precious children are facing a grief no parents should ever know,\" Bush, a former Texas governor, said in a statement. \"We are grateful to the first responders and volunteers who are working to find the missing and comfort the grieving at Camp Mystic and along the Guadalupe. We know our words cannot help, but we believe the prayers of so many Americans will.\"\n\nFormer first lady Laura Bush reportedly worked as a counselor at Camp Mystic while she was a student at Southern Methodist University, according to Texas Monthly.\n\nFlash flood advisories and warnings abound as Texas faces more rain\n\nMillions in central Texas were under flash flood advisories as forecasters warned of several more inches of rain, including in hard-hit parts of the state. The weather alerts stretched from San Antonio to the Fort Worth area.\n\nForecasters with the National Weather Service said flood watches have been extended until 10 p.m. local time in parts of Hill Country and the I-35 corridor as they anticipate widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches. The agency warned that excessive runoff may result in dangerous flash flooding of low-lying areas, rivers, creeks, and low water crossings.\n\nThe weather service in Austin and San Antonio advised the public to have multiple methods to receive warnings. Earlier on Sunday afternoon, the agency said scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms were expected with the heaviest activity located over the Hill Country.\n\nThe agency said in an update at 8 p.m. that thunderstorms with very heavy rainfall continued to push across the I-35 corridor.\n\nCongressman says his granddaughters' cousin died in Camp Mystic flood\n\nU.S. Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Georgia, said his granddaughters’ cousin died in the flooding that tore through Camp Mystic over the weekend.\n\nCarter said in a post on X that his granddaughters were at the popular all-girls summer camp when the nearby Guadalupe River rose nearly 30 feet on Friday.\n\nHis granddaughters managed to escape, but their cousin, Janie, did not survive, Carter said.\n\n\"My granddaughters lost their cousin, Janie, and many other families are grieving loved ones,\" he said. \"Please join me in prayers for Texas. We must ensure that they have the resources they need to find those still missing and save lives.\"\n\nHow many people have died in the Texas flooding?\n\nBelow are the latest numbers of reported fatalities from state and local officials across central Texas.\n\nKerr County – 68 deaths\n\nTravis County – 5 deaths\n\nBurnet County – 3 deaths\n\nKendall County – 2 deaths\n\nWilliamson County - 2 deaths\n\nTom Green County – 1 death\n\nTrump signs disaster declaration for Kerr County after deadly floods\n\nTrump said in a statement Sunday that he signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, unlocking federal funding that the president says will ensure first responders \"immediately have the resources they need.\"\n\n\"These families are enduring an unimaginable tragedy, with many lives lost, and many still missing,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"The Trump Administration continues to work closely with State and Local Leaders.\"\n\nHe also praised the U.S. Coast Guard, which, together with state first responders, has rescued more than 850 people in central Texas since the disastrous flooding began. \"GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD BLESS TEXAS!\" Trump said.\n\nBeloved soccer coach, wife among dead; their children remain missing\n\nReece Zunker, the coach of a high school boys soccer team in Kerrville, and his wife, Paula, are among the dozens killed in the flooding that has ravaged central Texas. Their two children are reportedly missing.\n\nThe Tivy High School soccer team said in a statement that it was “heartbroken with the loss of our leader and inspiration.”\n\n“Coach Reece Zunker was not just a soccer coach, he was a mentor, teacher and a role model for our Kerrville kids,” the statement said, crediting him with rebuilding the school’s soccer program. “His passion for his players, students, co-workers, community and his family will never be forgotten.”\n\nMultiple local news outlets reported that the family’s two children are still missing. The family was spending Independence Day weekend at a house on the Guadalupe River between Camp La Junta and Camp Mystic, according to the Kerrville Daily Times.\n\nSan Angelo resident recalls waking up to record-breaking flooding\n\nLuis Maldonado heard rain around midnight Friday in San Angelo and thought nothing of it. But around 4 a.m., the father of three woke up and realized water was seeping through the family’s new carpet.\n\n\"I turn on the light, and I just hear a squishing as I keep stepping,\" Luis told the San Angelo Standard-Times, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"I turn on more lights, and I just see water all over the ground.\"\n\nLuis immediately woke up his wife. Then he opened his front door and saw a wall of water rushing through the neighborhood. Maldonado, whose truck and minivan were also flooded in the deluge, was one of many people filling out relief paperwork at a church in the west-central Texas city of San Angelo.\n\nLocal officials said over 12,000 homes have been damaged in the flooding, and one death in San Angelo has been tied to the storm.\n\n– Ronald W. Erdrich and Trish Choate, San Angelo Standard-Times\n\nPope Leo XIV offers condolences to families of flood victims\n\nPope Leo XIV issued a statement on social media offering his condolences to the families of those killed in the historic Texas flooding.\n\n\"I would like to express sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters, who were at the summer camp, in the disaster caused by flooding of the Guadalupe River in Texas in the United States,\" the pope wrote on X. \"We pray for them.\"\n\nLeo, who was elected as the head of the Roman Catholic Church in May, is the first U.S.-born pontiff.\n\nAbbott visits 'ravaged' Camp Mystic, vows to find missing children\n\nAbbott said on X that he visited Camp Mystic and the nearby Guadalupe River and was stunned by the devastation.\n\nThe girls' camp was \"horrendously ravaged in ways unlike I’ve seen in any natural disaster,\" the governor said late Saturday, adding: \"The height the rushing water reached to the top of cabins was shocking.\"\n\nAbbott, who issued a disaster declaration for nearly two dozen Texas counties, said: \"We won’t stop until we find every girl who was in those cabins.\"\n\nNew bouts of rain could worsen deluge, trigger new flooding\n\nMore rain was expected to fall Sunday across the Texas Hill Country, threatening to trigger new floods and worsen the deluge in the devastated, rain-soaked region.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Austin and San Antonio said flood watches were extended into Sunday when 2 to 4 inches of rain were expected to fall across parts of the region. Some isolated areas could see as much as 10 inches of rain.\n\n\"Any additional heavy rain will lead to flash flooding where it occurs and downstream,\" the weather service said.\n\nRescue crews focus on missing campers\n\nRescue crews worked feverishly at the site of Camp Mystic. The camp had 700 girls in residence at the time of the flood, according to Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.\n\nNick Sorter, a member of the volunteer rescue group United Cajun Navy, told CNN that \"there was nowhere for these kids to go. The buildings were washed out, just carved out from the inside.\"\n\nElinor Lester, 13, told the Associated Press the camp \"was completely destroyed. A helicopter landed and started taking people away. It was really scary.”\n\nWhere is Texas Hill Country? A rolling grassland with history of floods\n\nThe National Weather Service in San Antonio said the risk of flash flooding remains in Hill Country, a low-lying and flood-sensitive area of west-central Texas.\n\nThe region stretches over 11 million acres across 18 counties in central Texas, according to the Texas Hill Country Conservation Network. It includes the cities of San Antonio and Austin, as well as extensive rural areas such as the site of the July Fourth flooding in Kerr County. The cities of Sonora, Fredericksburg, San Marcos, Bandera, and New Braunfels are also located within the region.\n\nTexas Hill Country mainly sits atop the Edwards Plateau and is named for the area’s grassy rolling hills. Three rivers — the Colorado, Nueces, and Guadalupe — run through the area. Friday’s devastating flash floods engorged the banks of the Guadalupe.\n\nThe area is known for being especially vulnerable to floods, earning it the nickname \"flash flood alley,\" and it has experienced several major flood events in the past two decades.\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\n'It wasn't slowing': Witness recalls a torrent of water\n\nTonia Fucci, a Pennsylvania resident visiting her grandmother for the Independence Day weekend, woke early Friday to the sound of heavy rain \"coming down in buckets.\"\n\nShe heard something more ominous: loud, startling cracking noises.\n\n\"It's indescribable, the sounds, of how loud they were, which turned out to be ... the massive cypress trees that came down along the river,\" she told Reuters.\n\nFucci, who was staying near the Guadalupe River, filmed on her phone a torrent of muddy water flooding the road to her grandmother's house. She said she received National Weather alerts on her phone hours after the flood had already hit. She recalled residents running to their neighbors to help before rescue teams arrived.\n\n\"Something I've never seen before. You knew it was tragedy,\" Fucci said. \"It wasn't slowing, it wasn't slowing. And debris and furniture and RVs were coming down the river.\"\n\nHeartbreaking photos of devastation at camp\n\nPhotos inside the nearly century-old Camp Mystic revealed a horrifying picture of the devastation that unfolded.\n\nCampers' bunkbeds were caked in mud; bed sheets, clothing, and suitcases were jumbled about the rooms. One wall of a camp building had been ripped from the foundation.\n\nOne Camp Mystic camper, 8-year-old Sarah Marsh of Alabama, was confirmed among the dead, according to Mountain Brook, Alabama, Mayor Stewart Welch. Janie Hunt, 9, was also among the dead, The New York Times and CNN both reported.\n\nOther campers were also reported dead by news outlets.\n\nA beloved camp among Texas families\n\nGenerations of Texas families sent their daughters to Camp Mystic, a place where they formed lifelong friendships, former camper Clair Cannon told USA TODAY. Cannon's mother and daughter both also attended.\n\nSummer after summer, they'd take Highway 39 as it winds along the Guadalupe River until arriving at the grounds on the riverbank.\n\n“What that area is like when it’s in its prime − when it’s not devastated like this − is probably one of the most serene and peaceful places that I’ve ever seen in my life,” said Cannon, a commercial and residential real estate agent in Dallas.\n\nAnother girls' camp a few miles away from Mystic, Heart O' the Hills, said on its website that co-owner Jane Ragsdale had died in the flood. The camp was not in session when the flooding hit, and officials said everyone else had been accounted for.\n\nWhy is Texas flooding so bad?\n\nTexas Hill Country is no stranger to extreme flooding. In the rugged, rolling terrain it’s known for, heavy rains collect quickly in its shallow streams and rivers that can burst into torrents like the deadly flood wave that swept along the Guadalupe River on July Fourth.\n\nThe Guadalupe has flooded more than a dozen times since 1978, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, but the Independence Day flood is among the worst in its history.\n\nSeveral factors came together at once – in one of the worst possible locations – to create the “horrifying” scenario that dropped up to 16 inches of rainfall in the larger region over July 3 to July 5, said Alan Gerard, a recently retired storm specialist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

We will not put a number on the other side because we just don’t know.”\n\nPatrick also said up to 500 rescue workers were searching for an unknown number of missing people, including some who had come to the area for an Independence Day celebration along the river.\n\n“We don't know how many people were in tents on the side, in small trailers by the side, in rented homes by the side because it was going to be the Fourth of July holiday,\" he said on Fox & Friends Weekend.\n\nSan Angelo also swamped with floodwaters\n\nThe devastation extended beyond Kerrville. About 150 miles away, the community of San Angelo and surrounding Tom Green County were hit with a record-breaking 14 inches of rain.\n\nPolice discovered the body of Tanya Burwick, 62, on Saturday, several blocks from her SUV, which was engulfed in 12 feet of water during Friday's flood, San Angelo police said.\n\n\"Our hearts are heavy as we extend our deepest condolences to Ms. Burwick’s family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time,\" police said in the media release. \"The San Angelo Police Department stands with the entire community in mourning this tragic loss.\"\n\n− Trish Choate\n\nWere there any warnings before the flooding?\n\nThe extreme flooding struck before dawn with little or no warning, Rice said, precluding authorities from issuing advance evacuation orders.\n\nState emergency management officials had warned as early as Thursday that west and central Texas faced heavy rains and flash flood threats, citing National Weather Service forecasts ahead of the holiday weekend.\n\nThe forecasts, however, \"did not predict the amount of rain that we saw,\" W.

The White House said Sunday it will go ahead only “if an invasion hasn’t happened.”\n\nAny summit is contingent on the outcome of talks between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Europe this week. That meeting also depends on the condition that Moscow’s troops don’t further encroach into Ukraine.\n\n“Blinken and Lavrov will discuss further if the invasion hasn’t started by then – in which case it’s all off,” an official told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins and Arlette Saenz.\n\nNo timetable or venue for any presidential summit has been set. White House press secretary Jen Psaki also stressed that if Russia chose to invade Ukraine anyway, the US would impose “swift and severe consequences. … And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon.”\n\nOnly hours before news of a possible summit emerged after a late-night call between Macron and Putin – following a previous conversation between the French President and Biden – the US warned it had intelligence suggesting that the Russian strongman had already given his field commanders orders to invade Ukraine. And on Monday morning, Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan painted a dire picture of the situation around Ukraine, saying an “extremely violent” attack could happen in the “coming hours or days.”\n\n“It will cost the lives of Ukrainians and Russians, civilians and military personnel alike. But we also have intelligence to suggest that there will be an even greater form of brutality because this will not simply be some conventional war between two armies: It will be a war waged by Russia on the Ukrainian people, to repress them, to crush them, to harm them,” Sullivan said on NBC’s “Today” show.\n\nThe extreme distrust shared by all parties to the conflict – Russia, Ukraine and Western allies – means this diplomatic breakthrough will hang by a thread. Recent US and Russian exchanges have been characterized by contempt, suspicion and sarcasm. So there’s hardly a guarantee of success if Lavrov and Blinken meet. Any outcome of a summit that preserves Ukraine as a functioning, democratic state would likely be seen as a defeat by Putin.\n\nAnd the situation around Ukraine’s borders, where more than 150,000 Russian troops are at high alert, is so tense that local clashes could spark a wider conflagration and shut down diplomacy. The US and its allies will also be alive to the possibility that Putin is willing to talk not because he’s blinking in the standoff, but is instead seeking a way to divide America from its friends before an invasion.\n\nBut if Putin does hold off from what was seen in Washington as an almost certain fresh incursion into Ukraine, it will count as a temporary success for the White House’s aggressive war of information meant to remove the element of surprise from his vast troop buildup and to thwart any faked rationale for an invasion.\n\nAny time a war is averted, especially one in which the US predicted thousands of civilian casualties, it prevents tragedy, misery and the possibility of destabilizing refugee flows. Therefore it is incumbent on everyone to try. Russia was non-committal on the idea of a summit with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that there were so far “no concrete plans.”\n\nEven France, which helped broker the idea of a meeting between Putin and Biden, cautioned much work needed to be done before they could get together. “We are making our last efforts, the most intense, to avoid the worst,” a source at the French presidential palace told reporters on Monday.\n\nBiden’s political gamble\n\nEven if the apparent agreement for a summit holds Biden will be taking a significant gamble.\n\nHawkish Republicans are sure to accuse him of appeasing the Russian strongman and of rewarding his aggression in holding Ukraine hostage. If a meeting with Putin fails and an invasion follows regardless, Biden will open himself up to charges of weakness.\n\nAny summit that is not comprehensively choreographed for success beforehand is a political high-wire act. And Biden can ill-afford blows to his prestige, with his approval rankings sliding and after his claims to statesmanship were dented by the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year.\n\nStill, presidents are elected to make the toughest decisions. If Biden refused to meet and war erupted in Ukraine, he would be accused of not testing diplomacy to its limit. And he has some potential cover: If Putin backtracks and a summit doesn’t happen, he will let Biden off a political hook.\n\nBlinken effectively explained the President’s openness to diplomacy despite his belief that an invasion was imminent during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“We believe President Putin has made the decision, but until the tanks are actually rolling and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President Putin from carrying this forward,” Blinken told CNN’s Dana Bash.\n\nThe skeptical tone of the White House’s statement explaining Biden’s “in principle” openness to a meeting, however, was not just rooted in suspicion of Russian motives. It also appeared to be an attempt to insulate the President from political attacks at home.\n\nBut there are reasons to take the risk. Despite the fact that the US will not send troops to defend Ukraine because it is not a NATO member, Biden has a genuine domestic rationale for avoiding war in Ukraine. Any Russian invasion could cause a spike in already rising gasoline prices and inflation rates that could further harm Democrats’ chances in the midterm elections.\n\nIs Biden playing into Putin’s game?\n\nAs well as shouldering a big political risk, Biden will brave treacherous geopolitical ground if he meets Putin.\n\nOne theory of the Russian leader’s build-up around Ukraine is that he wants to restore the Kremlin’s Cold War prestige as an equal power of the US. In essence, Biden is granting Putin that platform, even though many in Washington regard Russia as a greatly diminished force, despite its formidable nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe same accusation – that a US President was granting the concession of equal prestige – surrounded ex-President Donald Trump’s inconclusive summits with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. There is little chance of the affection on display at those love-ins being repeated in frosty Biden/Putin talks.\n\nBut Putin would also clearly like to debate and decide the great affairs of nations with the US – as was the case during Cold War summits between the US and the Soviet Union. The fact that this potential encounter was arranged by the French will ease some fears in Europe that US allies are being marginalized – a factor that did rear its head early in the Ukraine crisis.\n\nThe Élysée Palace said that other “stakeholders” will be included. That could include Ukraine and other NATO allies, including ex-Warsaw Pact members in Eastern Europe. But the French presidency did not offer further details. The prominent role of Macron, who is seeking to become the dominant European statesman after the retirement of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and faces a reelection campaign in a matter of weeks, will not go unnoticed inside or outside of France.\n\nA total disconnect\n\nThe most fundamental threat to the success of any Putin-Biden talks is the incompatible nature of the two sides’ positions.\n\nThe Russians are demanding an assurance that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO and want the alliance to pull weapons and troops out of member states that were once behind the Iron Curtain, like Poland, Hungary and Romania. That condition is non-negotiable for the West, which says it is up to individual nations to decide their destinies.\n\nThe US rejects Russian warnings that it feels threatened by NATO’s eastern expansion after the Cold War, styling the alliance as purely defensive. This position might make sense in Western capitals, but it does not take into account bruised Russian pride – the root of Putin’s two-decade effort to reshape the accepted outcome of the Cold War after the Soviet Union’s collapse.\n\nIn repeatedly trying to destabilize Ukraine, the Russian leader has also made clear his determination never to allow the former Soviet republic to make an ideological move west towards NATO and the EU. So any face-saving effort could undercut his historic mission and be hard for him to accept.\n\nBut if Putin has decided that the costs of an invasion of Ukraine – punishing Western sanctions and a possible bloody insurgency in the country are too much to bear – Biden may be able to construct a diplomatic off-ramp for the Russian leader. There are many issues, including arms control, stemming conflict in cyberspace and thwarting the spread of nuclear weapons, that could make each side safer.\n\nBut these issues are hostage to the same fundamental disconnect between Russia and the US that has boiled during the Ukraine conflict – and show why any summit between Biden and Putin will be seen as tentative until it occurs and why success is unlikely.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/chandler/2018/06/18/chandler-budget-more-parking-improved-parks-road-upgrades/699674002/", "title": "Chandler budget: More parking, improved parks, road upgrades", "text": "Chandler residents can expect to see better parks and roads in the city budget year that opens July 1.\n\nThe Chandler City Council approved a $554 million operating budget and $321 million in capital spending on Thursday.

Share prices of Chinese companies listed in mainland China, Hong Kong and the US surged last week as investors eagerly seized on any speculation for a possible relaxation.\n\nThe pledge to stick with zero-Covid also came as a major disappointment to the Chinese public, many of whom who have grown increasingly weary of the incessant mass testing, centralized quarantine and stringent lockdowns – sometimes lasting for months on end.\n\nLives lost in lockdown\n\nPublic frustration and resentment has only grown in recent weeks, after top leader Xi Jinping began his norm-breaking third term in power with a ringing endorsement of his zero-Covid policy.\n\nTragic cases perceived to be linked to the policy have gained momentum online as people question why it should continue.\n\nOn Friday, a 55-year-old woman fell to her death from the 12th floor from a locked down apartment complex in Hohhot, capital of the northern region of Inner Mongolia. The compound was locked down in late October after two cases were reported, with the entrance to her building fenced in by tall barricades.\n\nIn a widely-shared audio message, the woman’s daughter was heard banging on the barricade and crying desperately for help, pleading community workers to unlock the barrier so that she could rush to her mother.\n\n“Open the gate! Open the gate! I’m begging you, please,” she was heard shouting.\n\nIn another video, the daughter was seen kneeling and crying by the side of her mother, who lay motionless on the ground, still wearing a face mask.\n\nThe desperate scenes triggered a nationwide outcry, with a related hashtag racking up half a billion views on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform. The local police said in a statement that the woman, who lived with her 29-year-old daughter, suffered from anxiety disorders.\n\nThe woman’s death added to a growing list of lives lost during the country’s draconian lockdowns. In another tragedy that sparked nationwide outrage, a 3-year-old boy died of gas poisoning Wednesday at a locked down compound in the northwestern city of Lanzhou after Covid restrictions delayed rescue efforts.\n\nExperts warned that China could be hit by a new wave of infections – and a new cycle of government enforced lockdowns – as the winter approaches.\n\nChina reported 5,496 local infections for Sunday, hitting a six-month high, according to official data.\n\nMore than one third of those infections were reported in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou. The city of 19 million people is grappling with its worst outbreak since the start of the pandemic, with large swathes of its Haizhu district placed under lockdown.\n\nAt a press conference Sunday, officials accused some residents of spreading the virus by breaking lockdown rules and removing barriers to go out to get daily supplies.\n\nResidents queue up for Covid tests on October 31 in the southern city of Guangzhou. VCG/Visual China Group/Getty Images\n\nA long way home\n\nEven in places not under extended lockdowns, the constant Covid testing edicts and stringent travel restrictions have fueled growing discontent.\n\nIn Beijing, authorities have kept requirements tight for entering the Chinese capital – home to most senior Chinese leaders. The restrictions were further tightened in the lead-up to the Communist Party Congress in October, and they haven’t been relaxed since.\n\nResidents and business travelers have complained about the pop-up window on their Beijing health app that prevents them from returning to the capital, despite their negative Covid test results.\n\nIn a telling sign of the extent of public discontent, among those who spoke out against the excessive restrictions were members of the political elite and nationalist influencers. Tao Siliang, the daughter of Tao Zhu, a former member of the Communist Party’s supreme Politburo Standing Committee, criticized Beijing’s travel restrictions after she was barred by the pop-up window from returning home from a trip to eastern Zhejiang province.\n\n“I’ve long been a person with composure, but this time I panicked, because I had the first taste of the sense of loss and helplessness of not being able to return to my own home,” the 81-year-old wrote in a social media article since deleted.\n\nThe troubles of returning to Beijing proved even too much for Zhou Xiaoping, a fiercely nationalist, anti-American blogger who was singled out for praise by Xi at a conference on art and literature in 2014. In a series of Weibo posts, he openly questioned the far reaching travel restrictions and criticized propaganda efforts exaggerating Covid deaths overseas.\n\n“What on earth is the meaning of doing this?” he wrote in a post that was later removed. “The cost of epidemic prevention is not only the economic cost, there are also costs to our livelihoods and lives.

Since then, the private company, valued at about $10 billion, according to Bloomberg, has expanded its plans to include the de-extinction of the Australian thylacine (Tasmanian tiger) and the dodo.\n\nLast month, Colossal revealed it had genetically engineered the Woolly Mouse, which shared some coat characteristics with a woolly mammoth, including longer, lighter-colored hair with a rough, woolly texture. \"This is a very, very big step for us because it proves that all of the work we've been doing for the last three years on the woolly mammoth is exactly what we predicted,\" Lamm said at the time.\n\nWe've got today's trends: Sign up for USA TODAY's Everyone's Talking newsletter.\n\nWith the reveal of the dire wolf puppies, Colossal shows \"that our end-to-end (de-extinction) toolkit that we talked about with the mouse works, but now it's working with ancient DNA and it's been pretty incredible,\" Lamm told USA TODAY.\n\nWhat is a dire wolf?\n\nMany may have first heard of the dire wolf from HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" and George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series of fantasy novels, on which the TV show is based. (The dire wolf was the sigil, or mascot, of House Stark.) Others may be familiar with the Grateful Dead song, \"Dire Wolf.\"\n\nDire wolves have also appeared in video games including Final Fantasy and World of Warcraft, tabletop game classic Dungeons & Dragons, and card game Magic the Gathering.\n\nBut the dire wolf is an actual real-world predator, which went extinct about 13,000 years ago after roaming North America for thousands of years before that, alongside saber tooth tigers and mastodons.\n\n“Many people view dire wolves as mythical creatures that only exist in a fantasy world, but in reality, they have a rich history of contributing to the American ecosystem,” said the author Martin, who is also an investor and cultural advisor to Colossal, in a statement. “I get the luxury to write about magic, but Ben and Colossal have created magic by bringing these majestic beasts back to our world.”\n\nAbout 25% larger than modern-day gray wolves, dire wolves had thicker, more muscular legs, more powerful shoulders, a wider head and snout with larger jaws and teeth. The dire wolf stood about 3½ feet tall and could be even longer than 6 feet and weigh up to 150 pounds.\n\nResearchers have long been intrigued by the dire wolf because it coexisted with the gray wolf – which did not go extinct – but there hasn't been enough dire wolf DNA found to analyze. Many dire wolf remains have been found in the La Brea tar pits, for example, but the tar pit damages the DNA, said Beth Shapiro, Colossal's chief science officer.\n\nShapiro and the researchers at Colossal contacted museums and laboratories with dire wolf specimens and got access to a tooth thought to be about 13,000 years old, found in Ohio, and a 72,000-year-old skull from Idaho. Inside the skull is the petrous, or inner ear bone, which is a good source of well-preserved DNA, Shapiro said.\n\nFrom those two specimens, Shapiro and the team at Colossal recovered enough DNA to create two dire wolf genomes to compare with other canid species including coyotes, jackals, dholes and, of course, other wolves, Shapiro said. Using the genetic data, researchers could confirm the gray wolf as the closest living relative of the dire wolf – they share 99.5% of their DNA code.\n\nNext, the Colossal researchers edited the gray wolf genome in 20 sites over 14 genes to express specific traits of dire wolves including a light-colored coat, hair length, coat patterning, along with body size and musculature.\n\nFertilized dire wolf eggs were implanted into and born by surrogate dog mothers. Two litters have led to a pair of male dire wolves, Romulus and Remus, now six months old, and a female, Khaleesi (named after the \"Game of Thrones\" character), born in January. These newcomers are not 100% exactly the same dire wolf that roamed the earth ages ago, but look as genetically close as cutting-edge technology could get.\n\n\"Their coat is just absolutely amazing. It's super thick,\" said Lamm, describing the wolves, which live on a 2,000-acre ecological preserve in the northern U.S. \"They are super friendly because we've raised them ... (chief animal officer) Matt (James) bottle fed them when they were just young pups. But they are starting to come into their own, where they're acting more and more like wolves.\"\n\nWhy bring back the dire wolf from extinction?\n\nWolves became a focus at Colossal after Lamm and James had a meeting with The MHA (Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara) Nation in central North Dakota. While talking with the tribal leaders about research on buffalo and bison conservation, \"they told us there's not enough going into wolf conservation,\" Lamm said, and began discussing the dire wolf and wolves' importance to generations of Native Americans.\n\nSoon after that, they met with officials in North Carolina about the state's Red Wolf Recovery Program, which seeks to increase the population of the one-time extinct animal through breeding in captivity and releasing wolves. At about the same time, investors including Peter Jackson and Tom Brady came on board who were \"super excited about this business,\" Lamm said.\n\nWith the dire wolf, Colossal thought \"we could do something that could bring awareness from pop culture to science … and we could build technologies to help wolves, which we did in this process, and do something that the indigenous people were really excited about,\" Lamm said. \"We kind of joke that we didn't pursue the dire wolf, in a weird way it pursued us.\"\n\nThe dire wolf is a symbol that \"carries the echoes of our ancestors, their wisdom, and their connection to the wild,” said MHA Nation Tribal Chairman Mark Fox in a statement. “Its presence would remind us of our responsibility as stewards of the Earth – to protect not just the wolf, but the delicate balance of life itself.\"\n\nDuring the project to de-extinct the dire wolf, the Colossal researchers developed a cloning shortcut using blood instead of tissue samples from wild coyote-Red Wolf mix wolves, which carry Red Wolf DNA, to birth two litters of Red Wolf puppies. \"So we're able to inject these new genetics into the recovery population in a way that can bolster their adaptive ability,\" James said.\n\nColossal plans to breed more dire wolves and study them and how they act in packs. As of now, there's no plan for the wolves to breed.\n\nThey hope North Carolina is interested in using the company's technology to bring more Red Wolves into nature, too. Wolves are \"critical to ecosystems, they're helpful to the planet and they're also an American icon,\" Lamm said.\n\nNews about the dire wolves hit on Monday with stories by outlets such as The New York Times, Time, and People. Colossal will soon publish a paper about the ancient DNA used to create the three dire wolves. And the company has kept experts in the field informed about their advances.\n\n\"I think for me the most exciting thing about this project is that shows how we can use cutting edge technologies in molecular biology to help protect and preserve populations of animals that are at risk of extinction today,\" said Elinor Karlsson, the director of vertebrate genomics at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and a geneticist who's a member of Colossal's advisory board.\n\n\"Colossal produced healthy puppies with genetic variants that haven't existed for over 10,000 years,\" she told USA TODAY. \"To do this, they innovated new methods for sampling, biobanking and cloning. Their work could will help us preserve genetic diversity that is on the brink of disappearing from earth today, which includes a number of Canidae species,\" which includes domestic dogs, foxes, wolves and other mammals.\"\n\n\"I also appreciate how careful Colossal was in the way they approached this work,\" she said. \"They prioritized the health and well-being of both the dog mothers and the wolf puppies.\"\n\nColossal constantly weighs the ethics of its technology in case readers are worried about something as happened in the movie \"Jurassic Park\" coming to fruition. \"We have spent a lot of time thinking about whether we should (bring back a species),\" Shapiro said. \"We weren't just focused on whether we could. We've now proven we can.\"\n\nThe ability to revive and sustain species is important, she said. \"We have to keep in mind and understand that there is an incredible risk in the decision not to use these technologies,\" Shapiro said. \"We know what the consequences of that decision are and it's an increased rate of extinction throughout the world.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.\n\nMike Snider is a reporter on USA TODAY’s Trending team.

John Legend, Stevie ...", "text": "Stars across the music spectrum have hit the stage this week at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Wednesday was no different.\n\nFamed singer John Legend, Motown icon Stevie Wonder and pop-country hit maker Maren Morris performed on the third night of the DNC.\n\nWednesday night's theme was \"Fight for our Freedoms,\" and speakers included former president Bill Clinton, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris's pick for vice president.\n\nHere's what to know about Wednesday night's musicians:\n\nJohn Legend sings Prince's 'Let's Go Crazy' with Sheila E.\n\nIt was the final performance of the Democratic National Convention before the introduction of Walz — and Legend understood the assignment.\n\nIn a lively tribute to Prince, one of the world's greatest musicians and most famous Minnesotans, Legend played keys and sang \"Let's Go Crazy\" with Sheila E. on the drums.\n\nLegend basked briefly in the opening applause before snapping into character, slamming onto the keys and, in his smooth, classic baritone sang, \"Are we gonna let the elevator break us down?\"\n\n\"Oh no! Let's go!\" shouted Sheila E., standing at the drums.\n\nSix dancers swung their heads and arms to the music while laying down backup vocals. A guitarist shined in the spotlight for her guitar solo. Everyone wore sequins. The number ended with the guitarist kneeling on the ground, head turned to the sky, shredding her instrument as a whirl of dancers ran behind her.\n\nLegend has been an outspoken activist for Democratic causes in the past. And he has used his music and microphone to amplify his messaging.\n\nHis Academy Award-winning song \"Glory\" was featured in the film \"Selma,\" about the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.-led march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, leading to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nIn 2020, Legend closed the DNC with his song \"Never Break,\" and he performed at an election-eve rally for Harris in November 2020.\n\n\"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz care about people like you,\" Legend said in a Wednesday morning interview with \"CBS Mornings.\" \"They care about ordinary Americans and they want to make life better for ordinary Americans.\"\n\nLegend is one of a select few EGOT-winners. The prestigious title indicates he has one every major award in the entertainment industry — an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and Tony. He was the first Black man to achieve the feat.\n\nLegend, 45, is an Ohio native. Born in 1978 as John Roger Stephens, he started playing piano when he was 4, and he never turned back. He grew up performing in his church choir, where his mother was director, and his grandmother was organist.\n\nLegend skipped two grades, started high school at 12 and graduated as salutatorian, according to an interview on the Oprah Winfrey Network. Before producing his own music, he attended the University of Pennsylvania and worked at a consulting firm.\n\nAfter independently releasing two albums, he was introduced to Kanye West, for whom he laid down background vocals. His career got a boost from West, a Variety article said.\n\nLegend's debut album, \"Get Lifted,\" was released through the West-founded GOOD Music, which also recorded music from Common, Legend's now-collaborator who performed at the DNC Tuesday.\n\nThe debut record won the 2006 Grammy for Best R&B Album and Best Male R&B Vocal Performance. Legend also won Best New Artist that year.\n\nHe has received nine awards and 33 nominations since then.\n\nLegend lives in California with his wife, Chrissy Teigen, and their four children.\n\nStevie Wonder sings 'Higher Ground' at the DNC\n\n\"Now is the time to understand where we are and what it'll take to win,\" said Stevie Wonder as he took the stage. \"Win the brokenhearted, win the disenchanted, win the angry spirits. Now is the time.\"\n\nWonder spoke with passion and seamlessly transitioned into song with the line \"Are you ready?\"\n\nMusic washed over the United Center, dragging on a guitar, a bass and six dancers who pranced across the stage.\n\nThe crowd exploded with energy, and Wonder made his way to the keyboard, where he broke into his song \"Higher Ground\" off his 1973 album \"Innervisions.\"\n\nHis hair hung in braids that stretched from his black leather cap and signature dark glasses to below the keyboard. He wore a purple-and-black-patterned jacket with leather shoulders and sleeves as he belted, \"Lovers keep on lovin', believers keep on believin'.\"\n\nThe singer-songwriter, who has captivated audiences since his youth in the 1960s, has a history campaigning for progressive causes.\n\nIn 1983, he spearheaded a campaign to make Martin Luther King Day a national holiday and he advocated for an end to South African apartheid.\n\nHis activism for the disabled community was recognized by the U.S. President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities, Junior Blind of America and more, according to Wonder's biography on the United Nations website.\n\nAt 11, Wonder signed to Berry Gordy's Mowtown Tamla label and quickly rose to success with his first Billboard Hot 100 hit, \"Fingertips,\" his bio on Grammy.com said.\n\nNPR reported that Gordy was infamously \"calling the shots of (Wonder's) creative life,\" and it was when Wonder stepped away from Gordy that he produced \"a geyser of superb recordings,\" which NPR said, \"defined what an 'artist's classic run' could mean.\"\n\nThe run produced classic hits like \"Isn't She Lovely\" and \"Sir Duke.\"\n\nMaren Morris sings protest song 'Better Than We Found It' at the DNC\n\nNo, it wasn't Selena Gomez on the DNC stage Wednesday night. It was pop-country artist Maren Morris, performing her song \"Better Than We Found It.\"\n\nMorris wrote the song she performed at the DNC in 2020 in the shadow of George Floyd's murder and the protests that erupted in response. Morris called it a \"protest song\" in a 2020 interview with Variety.\n\nMorris sang, \"America, America, divided we fall,\" accompanied onstage by a sole acoustic guitar.\n\nHer outfit carried weight, too. She sang draped in a stark white, tailored skirt suit encrusted with glimmering gems. She paired it with white pumps.\n\nThe pure white pant- or skirt-suit emerged as a symbol for female empowerment in politics in 2017, when Nancy Pelosi, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other prominent Democratic women wore white to silently protest Donald Trump's policies in a joint session of Congress.\n\nMorris is a Grammy award-winning pop-country artist whom the New York Times described as \"a tattooed, spray-tanned, nose-ringed liberal firecracker,\" in a 2022 profile. Her vocals carried the 2018 EDM hit \"The Middle\" by Zedd, a multiplatinum smash hit.\n\nWhile she's known for some of her pop hits, Morris began as a country artist, recognized five times by the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association Awards.\n\nIn an interview with the L.A. Times, Morris revealed that she was leaving the country music industry for its \"unwillingness to honestly reckon with its history of racism and misogyny and to open its gates to more women and queer people and people of color.\"\n\nBorn in Dallas, Texas, Morris started writing music and playing guitar as a pre-teen. She moved to Nashville in her twenties to write songs for established country singers. She eventually signed to a major label record deal.\n\nIn 2023, she distanced herself from her country roots with two-track EP \"The Bridge.\" The second track, \"Get the Hell Out of Here,\" speaks for itself.\n\nThe L.A. Times called Morris' EP \"one of several metaphors she deploys in imagining a path out of the world of country music in which she became a star.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/backbeat/2017/03/18/chuck-berry-legend-rock-n-roll/99364878/", "title": "Chuck Berry was THE legend of rock 'n' roll", "text": "Brian Passey\n\nThe Spectrum\n\nA few years ago I decided I wanted to see as many living legends of rock ‘n’ roll as possible before they were gone. Obviously I was never going to have a chance to see John Lennon or Jimi Hendrix, but there were many others I could still see perform.\n\nDuring the summer of 2014 I had the chance to see both Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney in concert. But there was one rock ‘n’ roll pioneer I always managed to miss. Chuck Berry was 87 years old but he was still performing monthly at Blueberry Hill in University City, a suburb of Berry’s native St. Louis. The restaurant’s concert venue, the Duck Room, was named for Berry’s famous “duckwalk.”\n\nSince my sister lives in the St. Louis area, I typically make it out to Missouri at least once a year. For many years I hoped one of my trips would coincide with one of his monthly performances but it never seemed to work out.\n\nFinally I decided to make it happen. I would plan a trip around a Chuck Berry performance. And it just so happened that he was performing on Oct. 15, 2014, which also happened to be my 36th birthday and three days before Berry’s 88th birthday. I notified my sister of my impending visit and bought my concert ticket.\n\nI had previously eaten at Blueberry Hill and I had seen a concert there a few years earlier with my sister. So I was excited to return to the iconic venue and eat some toasted ravioli, a St. Louis special. With my stomach full of meaty pasta, I went downstairs to the Duck Room to get my seat for the show.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nBlueberry Hill owner Joe Edwards told Riverfront Times, a St. Louis newsweekly, in January 2015 that no other “superstar rock & roller has played that many shows in one single venue.” Edwards said Berry had played there monthly from 1996 through October 2014, for a total of 209 shows.\n\nI was there for his 209th show. According to Setlist.FM, that was Berry’s last live performance. I didn’t realize I had been at such a historic show until writing this column. Now I wish I had taken better notes. But here is what I remember.\n\nAfter a short set by an opening act — a couple of local girls named Bella & Lily — the man himself took the stage. I only knew his biggest hits but for me it wasn’t about the songs as much as it was about seeing him.\n\nBerry was not just “a” legend of rock ‘n’ roll. In many ways he was “the” legend of rock ‘n’ roll. When he became part of the first class inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the hall released the following statement: “While no individual can be said to have invented rock and roll, Chuck Berry comes the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together.”\n\nNearly two and a half years later I still have a hard time believing I actually saw Chuck Berry perform. It was among the most surreal experiences of my life. Here was the man who pretty much invented rock ‘n’ roll and he was playing the guitar only a few feet away from me.\n\nHe opened with \"Roll Over Beethoven,\" a song that was later covered by The Beatles. He even pulled out his famous duckwalk and the one-legged hop version of the duckwalk during that opening number. His moves were impressive, considering his age. I posted a photo to Instagram shortly after the first song and quoted Berry as saying, “You won’t remember that one because I don’t remember it.”\n\nHis age was apparent in more than just the jokes. He forgot things at times and he was helped through the performance by his daughter, who sang some of the lead vocals, and his son, who played lead guitar when Berry was having a difficult time. It was just three days before the legend’s 88th birthday.\n\nBut this was still the man who wrote and recorded “Maybellene” and “Rock and Roll Music.” He originated the rock ‘n’ roll canon. Even though his age was showing and his performance was often rough, every single member of that crowd was captivated. We hung on every note.\n\nWhen he unleashed that distinctive opening riff for “Johnny B. Goode” I thought I had died and gone to Rock ‘n’ Roll Heaven. It was a spiritual experience.\n\nNow it’s Chuck Berry who has gone to Rock ‘n’ Roll Heaven. He was 90 years old.\n\nChuck Berry was rock ‘n’ roll. Today, rock ‘n’ roll has died. Long live rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nEmail reporter Brian Passey at brian@thespectrum.com or call him at 435-674-6296.

He was among the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.\n\nWhile Penniman’s dynamic sound reached all corners of the globe, he also spent considerable time in Nashville at both ends of his 65-year career.\n\nIn the last decade, he split his time between his home in Lynchburg, Tenn., and a hotel on Nashville's Lower Broadway, overlooking his star on the Music City Walk of Fame.\n\nThough he rarely made public appearances, locals would spot him on occasion – frequently in the drive-thrus of Wendy’s and other fast food restaurants on West End Avenue, where he’d give a friendly wave to fans.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nNashville connection\n\nIn a way, Penniman came full-circle by spending his final years in Nashville. 60 years ago, a pre-fame Little Richard held long residencies in the famed R&B nightclubs on Jefferson Street.\n\n“It's almost as if he made Nashville his second home (in the ‘50s),” said Michael Gray, Museum Editor at the Country Music Hall of Fame. “The R&B scene here was so hot, he told me that he could make more money here than all of the other cities he was playing.”\n\nIn a 2009 interview with The Tennessean, Penniman recalled “packing the house” at several local venues.\n\n\"I was making $100 a week at the New Era club, when it was on Fourth Avenue, for (owner) Soo Bridgeforth,\" he said. \"I wasn't famous. I thought I was, but I wasn't — no records yet. I packed the house. You couldn't get in. I had a song that I would sing called 'Baby, Don't You Wish Your Man Looked Like Me.' I would say, 'Baby, don't you wish your man looked like Little Richard?' And all the ladies would say, 'Yeah!' All the men said, 'No!' \"\n\nHe went from a club favorite to a superstar in 1955 after “Tutti Frutti” hit the airwaves. In his authorized biography, Penniman said that he heard it for the first time on Nashville’s WLAC, which boasted 50,000-watt signal that brought R&B music to half of the United States.\n\n“When it came on, I jumped up and started screaming and running through the house and shouting ‘That’s my record!’” he said.\n\n“The disc jockey Gene Nobles said, ‘This is the hottest record in the country. This guy Little Richard is taking the record market by storm.’ I couldn’t believe it.”\n\nA string of electrifying hits followed over the next two years, including \"Long Tall Sally,” \"Keep a Knockin'” and \"Good Golly, Miss Molly\" as well as appearances in “The Girl Can’t Help It” and other early rock films. But in 1957, he abandoned rock and roll for religion, releasing three gospel albums in the early ‘60s and touring the evangelical circuit.\n\nReturn to rock\n\nIn 1964, Penniman returned to rock with the album “Little Richard is Back.” While his legend grew as acts like The Beatles proudly wore his influence on their sleeves, he never reached the same popular heights as his run in the ’50s. Still the music and accolades continued, notably with a run of well-received albums in the early ‘70s.\n\nThat decade also saw Penniman struggling with drug abuse. He once again sought refuge in religion, and came to Nashville in 1979 to record the gospel album “God’s Beautiful City.”\n\nBy the mid-‘80s, Penniman had reconciled his faith with his status as a rock icon. He enjoyed a popular resurgence in film and television, with memorable roles in “Down and Out in Beverly Hills” and “Full House,” among others. He recorded his final album in 1992 for Disney: a collection of children’s songs entitled “Shake It All About.”\n\nHe reconnected with Nashville in 1994, teaming up with Tanya Tucker on a song for the “Rhythm, Country & Blues album.” The pair also performed on that year’s CMA Awards.\n\nPenniman’s next big moment in Nashville came in 2008, when he received his star on the Music City Walk of Fame.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, he acknowledged his mounting health issues, including sciatica in his left leg. He had hip replacement surgery in 2009, and was using a wheelchair in his final years.\n\nHe gave his final performance in 2013, but in 2014, he returned to the stage in Nashville as he accepted a Rhapsody & Rhythm Award at a fundraiser for the National Museum of African American Music. Last year, he received the Distinguished Artist Award during the 2019 Tennessee Governor's Arts Awards at the Governor's Residence.\n\nLike his Walk of Fame honor, it was an opportunity for Penniman to reflect on his long relationship with Music City.\n\n\"I never thought that I would have a star in Nashville,” he told reporters in 2008. “I've had one on Hollywood Boulevard for ages. But to be in Nashville is a blessing and a lesson. I'm very blessed, very grateful.”\n\nHe also expressed his admiration for modern country music, singing some of Kenny Chesney's \"Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven.”\n\nThe song’s refrain: “Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to go now.’\n\n\"I love that,” Penniman said. “Because that's the truth.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/08/21/democratic-national-convention-2024-music-performers/74892920007/", "title": "Who's performed at the DNC?

Maybe the organizers couldn't anticipate the wild response from the floor of the United Center,\" Taylor wrote, in part, in an Instagram post. \"Anyway, sorry to disappoint.\"\n\nCelebrities at the DNC: Lil Jon, Tony Goldwyn, Mindy Kaling and more\n\nDNC performers: Pink, daughter Willow\n\nOn the fourth and final night of the DNC, Pink put aside the bright colors and theatrics of her Summer Carnival Tour and shared the stage her 13-year-old daughter Willow and a group of backup singers in coordinating black outfits.\n\nThe quintet sang a moving rendition of her 2017 single \"What About Us\" with just a guitar accompaniment.\n\nThe superstar released her ninth studio album \"Trustfall\" last year, has been traversing the globe for over a year with her Summer Carnival Tour. She recently wrapped the European leg of the tour and embarked on her North American \"homecoming\" shows earlier this month.\n\nA mother-daughter night: Pink joined by daughter Willow in moving acoustic performance\n\nDNC performers: The Chicks\n\nAs the fourth day was underway, Natalie Maines, Martie Maguire and Emily Strayer came out on stage to perform the national anthem two hours before Harris delivered her final speech to officially accept the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nWhile Maines and Strayer wore all-black outfits, Maguire was in a taupe blazer dress adorned with gold stars.\n\nThe Grammy-winning country singers, who drew ire from the industry and country music fans after criticizing President George W. Bush and his administration's invasion of Iraq in 2003, also performed at the virtual 2020 DNC.\n\nDNC performers: John Legend and Sheila E.\n\nJohn Legend and Sheila E. headlined an energetic opener for Kamala Harris' running mate Tim Walz, who officially accepted the Democratic party's vice presidential nomination Wednesday.\n\nThe performance paid tribute to one of the most iconic singers from Walz's home state of Minnesota: Prince. Legend, wearing a sparkly white blazer, sang “Let’s Go Crazy” from 1984's \"Purple Rain\" and played a standup piano as Sheila E., donning a white wrap dress, accompanied him on the drums.\n\nSheila, a frequent collaborator of Prince's, later stepped away to duet with Legend.\n\nIn an interview with \"CBS Mornings,\" which aired the morning of the performance, Legend opened up about his support for Harris and Walz to Tony Dokoupil.\n\n\"You can tell from the policy pronouncements that Vice President Harris put out last week talking about the economy, she's not doing that for me. She's doing that for everyday Americans,\" he said. \"And that's what she needs to keep her eye on and keep her ear to, is the concerns of everyday Americans.”\n\nThe beats go on: Trump keeps dancing as artists get outraged over his use of their songs\n\nDNC performers: Maren Morris\n\nMaren Morris, who started in country music but has since distanced herself from the \"toxic parts\" of the industry, performed her 2020 song “Better Than We Found It\" on Wednesday. At the time of its release, Morris called it a \"protest song,\" which had an accompanying music video that touched on the Black Lives Matter movement and immigration.\n\n\"I am honored to be performing at the Democratic National Convention for the first time ever. It’s a moment where we, as a country, can come together and hear rational plans for the future of women’s and LGBTQ rights,\" she said in a statement to The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"We can be inspired by people’s stories and navigate a safe path forward for our children.\"\n\nMorris recently told USA TODAY she will \"definitely support Kamala any way I can.\"\n\n\"I campaigned for Biden and have met Kamala, and she’s a badass. I feel invigorated to vote. Living in Tennessee, it feels more impactful to have that say,\" she said.\n\n'Nothing really scares me anymore': Maren Morris on public feuds, divorce, new music\n\nDNC performers: Stevie Wonder\n\nOn Wednesday, Stevie Wonder addressed the DNC audience from the podium with a rousing speech that encouraged peace and kindness.\n\n“As we stand between history’s pain and tomorrow's promises, we must choose courage over complacency. It is time to get up and go vote!\" he said.\n\n\"We must choose to be above the ugly words, the hateful anger and the division those words and anger create. We must keep on keeping on until we truly are a united people of these United States. And then we will reach our higher ground.”\n\n\"Are you ready, because you know we need Kamala Harris. Yes, we do,\" he continued. \"And we need a great man that we do have as our future vice president.\"\n\nHe then stepped over to the keyboard to perform his 1973 hit \"Higher Ground\" with a full band and dancers, who were all dressed in white.\n\nDNC performers: Lil Jon\n\nDuring the DNC's roll call on Tuesday, Lil Jon represented Georgia's delegates, who cast their votes for Harris, with a surprise performance of \"Turn Down for What\" and \"Get Low.\"\n\nThe rapper, wearing a teal satin vest and slacks, made his way through the crowds, occasionally high-fiving audience members. As he arrived at Georgia's section, he encouraged everyone to chant, \"We're not going back.\"\n\n\"VP Harris, Governor Walz,\" he yelled out as the medley transitioned to \"Get Low.\"\n\nDNC performers: Patti LaBelle\n\nThe DNC's in memoriam on Tuesday played to the tune of \"Godmother of Soul\" Patti LaBelle's \"You Are My Friend.\" Donning an ivory dress with black lace, the R&B songstress effortlessly reached all of the song's high notes.\n\n\"God bless America and Kamala Harris,\" LaBelle said as she closed out the track.\n\nDNC performers: Common and Jonathan McReynolds\n\nOne of Chicago's own — actor and Grammy, Emmy and Oscar winner Common — rapped with gospel singer Jonathan McReynolds on Tuesday.\n\n\"I thank God for this moment in time where Kamala Harris will change the world for the better with love, hope and grace. We fortunate,\" Common said as he launched into his new track \"Fortunate.\"\n\nDNC performers: Jason Isbell\n\nAlabama-born singer-songwriter Jason Isbell, donning a navy-blue suit over a white button-down, performed \"Something More Than Free\" off his 2015 album of the same name.\n\nBefore taking the stage, Isbell explained his song choice was inspired by thinking of \"the entirety of the party\" in an interview with the New York Times.\n\n\"I remember seeing back home in Alabama, people would have trailers with cars on blocks, and clearly, people that weren’t doing very well financially, and they had signs in their yard for (George W. Bush). And I remember thinking, a lot of these folks don’t even realize that they’re acting against their own best interests,\" he said.\n\n\"And if we could just convince Americans of what their own best interests are, we wouldn’t have to ask them to be anything other than selfish. It’s like, please vote selfishly, because you’re going to wind up voting for a Democrat, unless you’re part of the top 1 percent of earners. And so I chose this song really sort of with those folks in mind.\"\n\nDNC performers: Mickey Guyton\n\nGrammy-nominated country singer Mickey Guyton was the DNC's first performer. She took the stage with the track \"All American\" from her debut studio album \"Remember Her Name.\"\n\nIn 2020, Guyton made history with \"Black Like Me\" as the first Black female solo artist to be nominated in a country category at the Grammys.\n\n\"It’s so inspiring to see someone who is not only exceptionally smart, but also happens to look like me, running for the highest office in our country,” Guyton told CNN of her participation at the DNC. Harris \"represents so much to so many and I just think it’s incredible.

Our final thoughts on the 2016 Beale Street Music Festival.\n\n1. Who gets the gold medal as the best act you saw at Music Fest this year?\n\nBob Mehr: The honor probably has to go to Neil Young. Thirty-three years after his last Memphis show, he headlines the opening night of Music Fest and starts with an absolutely epic 35-minute “Down by the River.” While I’m sure that probably drove away more than a few casual fans (I saw plenty of folks fleeing at around the 20-minute mark), those who stayed behind got an evening of vintage Neil – who seemed particularly energized, at age 70, playing with youthful L.A. band Promise of the Real.\n\nChris Herrington: I wrote a bit about Neil Youngalready this morning, and there’s always a danger of recency bias, but his Friday night/Saturday morning performance might have been the best Music Fest set I’ve ever seen. The fierce, epic, exploratory “Down By the River” opener was the music festival equivalent of the Vince Carter “it’s over” gif, but there was more after that: A particularly rockin’ “Rockin’ in the Free World,” with a new last verse. The best song from “Harvest” (“Out on the Weekend”). Three buzzing nuggets from 1990’s “Ragged Glory,” perhaps his last classic album. Even the 10 minute detour into new music about agriculture industry malfeasance served to solidify the don’t-give-a-bleep bona fides what have helped Young craft one of the deepest and most compelling catalogues in rock history. And there was the gestalt of the whole thing: A 70-year-old force of nature in sneakers and jeans, reveling in noise with a band of twentysomethings, turning all of Tom Lee Park on a Friday night into a blissed-out afternoon in dad’s garage.\n\nJohn Beifuss: Neil Young’s epic two-hour rock-and-roll show already seems like the stuff of legend. If I didn’t exactly need a 35-minute long-as-the-Mississippi “Down By the River,” I’m glad I was there to witness it, along with the 11 idiosyncratically selected songs that followed. That septuagenarian can still make a squall and still deliver a message, from the mysterious (just what is a cinnamon girl?) to the obvious (God + Mother Nature > Monsanto).\n\nMark Richens: I'll go with Beck here. Having seen and reviewed his show last May at Mud Island Amphitheatre, I wasn't super excited to stick around late to catch his set, but I'm glad I did. It was a much looser affair than Mud Island, with more extended jamming, more obscurities in the set list, and of course \"Raspberry Beret\" (and a little tease of \"1999\"). Beck also had one of my favorite throwaway stage lines of the night when he remarked that at this music festival you could find everything \"from 808 beats to steak sausages.\"\n\n2. The silver?\n\nMehr: Los Lobos. Seven years after their last Music Fest appearance, the East L.A. band showed why they’re one of the most underrated American groups of all time. Watching Lobos – together 40 years, with more than 200 years of combined experience among its members – work through a festival-friendly set (plenty of fan favorites and killer covers), was a reminder how powerful a group that has both knowledge and passion can be. Compared to some of the fledgling bands I glimpsed at the fest, Lobos seemed like men among boys.\n\n\n\nHerrington: I’m going to cheat here with a pairing of Courtney Barnett and Julien Baker, two guitar-wielding women from Melbourne and Memphis, respectively, whose music was fully in the now amid a festival whose pleasures are often legacy acts.\n\nBarnett is a rocker at heart, and her early Sunday evening set mined most of last year’s full-length debut, “Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit,” a collection of songs that just won’t quit. I was heartened to hear a roar from a largely college-aged audience when this newish indie artist took the stage, even more so when the crowd sang along with the outro to her melancholy gem “Depreston.”\n\nBarnett’s loud, hooky guitar rock full of smarts, wit, humor and social observation is a sure shot echoing back to the days of Chuck Berry. Baker, by contrast, makes music I don’t typically go for, and slays me with it. She took the stage wearing a T-shirt proclaiming “Sad Songs Make Me Feel Better,” and sketched out songs from her own debut album, “Sprained Ankle,” that choked up artist and audience alike. Her acoustic finale of “Rejoice,” in front of the stage, with the crowd tightening in around her, was perhaps the festival’s most moving moment.\n\nBeifuss: Courtney Barnett justified the hype (and I didn’t expect her to be a budding guitar god). This fence-sitter is now convinced he has to buy (and yes, I do mean buy) the album (and yes, I do mean album, as in object, the kind you have to put on a shelf).\n\nRichens: I want to make sure I mention how impressed I was by the Indigo Girls. Their mid-afternoon set, just Amy Ray and Emily Saliers plus a fiddle player, was masterful and captivating. Amid a music festival that was heavy on up-and-coming female acts, here were two pioneers.\n\n3. The bronze?\n\nMehr: Courtney Barnett. As I noted in my Sunday recap, although some of the critical praise heaped on the fast-rising Aussie songstress has seemed a little hyperbolic to me, watching her Bud Light Stage set it was impossible not to buy into her buzzing indie-rock songs and Antipodean slacker charms. Still not sure if I see her as the second coming as some do, but her performance definitely made me a fan.\n\nHerrington: After Mavis Staples ran down her love of Chicago sports teams on Friday night, she noted that the Bulls had recently lost to the Grizzlies. “I better not run into one of them Grizzlies,” she warned. I know Z-Bo don’t bluff, but I’m not sure he wants to mess with Mavis. The Stax-connected stalwart was in fine form, with a sharp band, bookending her set with the related Staple Singers invitations “If You’re Ready (Come Go With Me)” and “I’ll Take You There,” but sounding fine on everything she touched, from the early Pops Staples civil rights anthem “Freedom Highway” to material from her 2016 album “Livin’ On a High Note,” which she suggested everyone go to the merch booth to purchase. Mother’s Day is coming up, she noted.\n\nBeifuss: Los Lobos, as usual, delivered wall-to-wall excellence. The band may be without peer, even in “festival” mode, when they emphasize crowd-pleasing covers (the Temptations’ “Papa Was a Rolling Stone,” the Allman Brothers’ “One Way Out,” the Grateful Dead’s “Bertha”) over deep cuts and Spanish songs (no guitarron in Tom Lee Park).\n\nRichens: Having seen Courtney Barnett only in her deadpan cheesy videos, I was delighted to see she's fantastic on stage. I was especially impressed with her Alex Chilton-esque rhythm-lead guitar playing.\n\n\n\n4. Outside of your medalists, which act was most surprising?\n\nHerrington: Maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised, but I really enjoyed The Arcs, the newest project from the Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach. With multiple percussionists, horns, back-up singers and other accoutrement, it frees him up from his main band’s more narrow blues-inspired rock sound, and helped me get reacquainted with a sharp guitarist I’d begun to tune out as the Black Keys grew to arena stature. I liked the rockabilly accents I heard, but the best of the set was still the band's cover of the early 1970s Motown song “Smiling People Sometimes,” which both underscored and took care of Auerbach’s songwriting limitations.\n\nMehr: I probably shouldn't have been surprised as he's always been an entertaining performer, but Beck came out and delivered from start to finish with a set that had more muscle and energy than I would've expected. It was exactly what was needed to galvanize a crowd that was pretty weary in the fest's 11th hour.\n\nBeifuss: The driving organ-plus-horns sound of Stax signees Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats demonstrated the band really has spent a lot of time absorbing the Stax/Volt catalogue. And Rhiannon Bryan of The Joy Formidable, a band from Wales, was a killer on guitar: In studio portraits, she’s a steampunk New Romantic, but onstage she looked more like a younger Kim Gordon who plays like Lee Ranaldo.\n\nRichens: The Joy Formidable play a tuneful, dense brand of indie-pop along the lines of Muse or Metric, but I was impressed by how much they actually rock. Their closing number, which ended in a squall of feedback, might have been the heaviest moment in a festival that lacked any metal acts.\n\n\n\n5. What was the most disappointing act you saw this year?\n\nMehr: Paul Simon. His last Memphis performance – an unusually chilly night at Mud Island several years back – was a pleasant surprise for someone like me who, frankly, has never been that big a fan. But Simon’s Music Fest set seemed to suffer for some reason. The band's arrangements seemed messy (not in a good way), Simon's voice was weak, and those factors produced a set that paled in comparison to the fest's other septuagenarian superstar, Neil Young.\n\nHerrington: Lucinda Williams is a classic songwriter, but her Saturday afternoon set was a pretty lackluster recitation. Her best songs don’t necessarily need a lot of adornment, but I’m also not sure she really played her best songs. Maybe that was the difference between Williams and Simon the next night. Simon’s vocals struggled to rise above the din, but the songs were better able to stand on their own.\n\nBeifuss: She was backed (as always) by a crack band (she’s never without a superb lead guitarist, and Stuart Mathis is a monster), but Lucinda Williams was stiff and dull. Judging by how often she checked her lyrics sheets, she was less familiar with the words to the songs than most of the people in the crowd. When she spoke between numbers, however, she seemed almost peppy, and her Pelican-Longhorn drawl – “guitar” became “git-taw-ur” – was amusing and charming as ever. I’m loyal to artists I admire, and I think Lucinda has made three of the best albums of the past 30 years (“Lucinda Williams,” “Sweet Old World,” “Car Wheels on a Gravel Road”), but I’m afraid her live shows, like her records, are no longer essential.\n\n\n\n6. What act did you most want to see but missed?\n\nHerrington: Staggered set times and end-of-fest fatigue caused me to miss most of Beck on Sunday night, though what I did catch was pretty strong. The artist I completely missed, for logistical reasons, that I wish I’d seen was contemporary pop/R&B singer Jason Derulo.\n\nMehr: Weezer. The SoCal alt-pop outfit were on at the same time as Neil Young, and a choice had to be made. Given the way our iconic music heroes have been shuffling off this mortal coil recently, I figured Ol’ Neil was the way to go. Long may he run.\n\nBeifuss: Here’s a semi-answer: I had to leave Beck’s closing FedEx Stage set after about 40 minutes, so I missed what apparently was the festival’s most purposeful Prince homage: a cover of “Raspberry Beret,” with the singer reportedly wearing a purple blazer. (The band also vamped through bits of “1999,” I’m told.) In retrospect, it seems obvious that Beck – a sometime-hitmaker, sometime-critic’s darling and dance-funk-pop-folk savant – was the artist at the festival who owed the most to Prince.\n\nRichens: I had to bail early on Friday, so I got to hear only two numbers from Mavis Staples and had to miss Neil Young's \"Down by the River\" acid test.\n\n7. What local act impressed you most?\n\nHerrington: I waxed poetic on Julien Baker already, but Luther Dickinson sounded great, and seemed to be having a terrific time, during his solo blues tent set on Saturday.\n\nMehr: Those Pretty Wrongs. I guess this band technically qualifies as local, since Big Star co-founder Jody Stephens is the group’s singer and front man. Making their official Memphis debut, the band – which also features L.A. guitarist/vocalist Luther Russell, and was aided on Sunday by second guitarist Danny De La Matyr – offered a lovely opening to the fest’s final day. Playing acoustic, their sun-dappled pop songs and gorgeous harmonies were a nice respite from the rest of the afternoon’s heavier sounds.\n\nBeifuss: Inevitably, Julien Baker, who had no trouble commanding an appreciative if smallish crowd (hers was the first performance of the fest) armed with just (just???) her guitar, her appealing but honest voice, her cutting confessional lyrics and her five-foot frame (four feet of which, during full emotive yowl, seem to be mouth).\n\nRichens: Sunday afternoon provided my first chance to hear Alex da Ponte, who might not have had quite the buzz of festival opener Julien Baker but nonetheless turned in an assured set of well-crafted pop tunes. She also did well in selecting her backing band, including drummer Shawn Zorn (Amy LaVere, Twin Forks) and guitarist Joe Austin (Yamagata).\n\n8. Music festivals are often a place to “play the hits,” but also often to play other people’s hits. What was the best cover you heard this year?\n\nMehr: Los Lobos’ set-capping version of the Grateful Dead’s “Bertha.” A band that can make me excited to hear a Dead song is doing something special indeed.\n\nHerrington: I already mentioned the Arcs going Motown, and I fear I missed the best of the weekend’s Prince covers (Beck’s “Raspberry Beret” and Grace Potter’s “When Doves Cry”). But I loved Mavis Staples doing the Talking Heads’ “Slippery People.” The Heads tapped into Memphis soul once upon a time for their classic cover of Al Green’s “Take Me to the River.” Mavis returns the favor. Also, heard in transit between stages: Nashville band Moon Taxi’s surprisingly convincing take on Rage Against the Machine’s “Sleep Now in the Fire.”\n\nBeifuss: Since I missed Beck’s “Raspberry Beret,” I’ll have to go with Mavis Staples’ rendition of the Talking Heads’ “Slippery People.”\n\nRichens: Los Lobos peppered their set with mini-covers including \"Papa Was a Rolling Stone\" and \"One Way Out,\" then closed out with a nod to the Grateful Dead with \"Not Fade Away\" into \"Bertha.\"\n\n9. What was the most memorable non-music aspect of the festival?\n\nMehr: A delicate stomach and the desire to maintain my girlish figure generally keep me away from most festival food, but the grub from the good folks at Ozark Mountain Biscuit Company was a welcome indulgence again this year.\n\nHerrington: I was tired this year before the festival even started, so I didn’t pay as much attention as usual to the world between the mud and the stage, but I saluted a few sartorial elements of the festival and named its non-musical MVP in The 9:01 this morning.\n\nBeifuss: Shout-out to whoever painted the illustrations on the “Gangsta Steaks” food booth, who apparently asked himself (or herself, but I’m betting it was a dude): “What better way to sell meat than with a picture of Mr. T riding Godzilla?”\n\n\n\nRichens: Everything seemed to flow very smoothly, such as restrooms and concessions. It's hard to know if that's because of a smaller crowd or just better organization and planning. I'd like to think it's the latter.\n\n10. Final thoughts?\n\nMehr: Simply put: Beale Street Music Fest needs to book more name rap, hip-hop and R&B acts. Some of the more memorable and well-attended shows of recent years – from Aretha Franklin, Al Green, and Anthony Hamilton to Snoop Dogg, Public Enemy and Outkast’s Big Boi – have come from artists working in those genres. In a city with the demographic makeup of Memphis, it seems wrong – both civically and in terms of pure business – not to have a festival that’s more reflective of the populace. The evidence this year was clear: Cypress Hill and Yo Gotti, two of only three rap acts playing the 2016 fest, drew big time crowds. The demand is clearly there. And while Music Fest has done well booking adult-oriented R&B in the past, not having anything that a 50-plus African-American crowd would come out to see also feels like something that’s lacking. To some degree, festival organizers – as they are quick to remind us -- are at the mercy of the marketplace: who’s on tour, who’s playing festivals, and what they’re asking for guarantees. But having barely a fraction of the 60-plus acts representing rap, R&B and urban music is simply not the way forward for a festival that likes to brand itself as broadly representative of the Bluff City.\n\nHerrington: I agree with Bob on more diverse booking, a thought I’ve expressed a few times in the past, and not just because I think it’d be the right thing to do and would (hopefully) be good for business, but because I’d like to hear more non-rock/blues stuff myself. That said, this was a strong festival with lots of good music and Memphis in May handled what came at them well. As muddy as it was, dodging real rain during the active part of the festival was a kind of gift.\n\nBeifuss: There were more smokeless tobacco stations and cigarette company booths than music stages (Newport offered a “pleasure center,” though what pleasures were within I didn’t bother to discover). I imagine festival operators would claim the income provided by these advertisers is necessary, but I hate seeing such pervasive promotion of what is essentially poison. However, hypocrite that I am, I’d be all for these places if smoking could be banned in the park. You’d think it wouldn’t be a problem, but the second-hand smoke (and yes, I am talking about tobacco) from what looked like college kids at some stages was as intense as it used to be in Zinnie’s or the P&H.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of college kids, it was weird to see what appeared to be every white teenager in Memphis and its suburbs massing at the Bud Light Stage for Yo Gotti an hour or more ahead of time, kids were pushing through the Los Lobos crowd to get to the front of the stage for the Gotti show. “Who am I to question their sincerity?” this white former teenager thought to himself, questioning their sincerity, as the term “cultural minstrelsy” bounced in his head.\n\nRichens: Los Lobos frontman David Hidalgo gave a shout-out to Neil Young, saying they had passed the Canadian rocker on his way to New Orleans in his distinctive tour bus. Beck also mentioned he'd just been in New Orleans, though his slot was rained out. These two anecdotes should answer those who question why Music Fest has to be on this weekend, and not, say, in June. These tour patterns around festivals are pretty well established, and once you get into June, you are running smack into Bonnaroo.

And his original song, \"Rural Route Raising,\" was even more powerful.\n\n\"I think you ride the line between old and the new country,\" Kelly Clarkson said, adding, \"You should make more records like this.\"\n\nLegend said Sevener has \"really been in your zone especially these last performances.\" Shelton agreed: \"You’ve never sang better this entire season.\"\n\nHis final performance of the night was a rendition of Hinder's \"Lips of an Angel.\"\n\n\"Obviously you know who I want to win this competition,\" Legend said, referring to Jarmon. \"But if I was to pick from Team Blake, as of now, I would pick Andrew.\"\n\nThe country singer said he can be the one to deliver Shelton's seventh win on \"The Voice,\" based on his last name.

Lamar dropped the track “Not Like Us” amid a heated public feud with Drake that saw them both trade scathing barbs back-and-forth in songs, including serious allegations of abuse. \"Not Like Us\" is a diss track aimed at Drake, and Drake has sued Lamar's record label over it. Clearly the Recording Academy is team Lamar.\n\nDespite the track’s harsh origin, Lamar gave acceptance speeches that were much more mild. His first paid tribute to his home city of Los Angeles and offered encouragement to those wanting to rebuild the city after the fires.

Will a legend like Dolly Parton return to sing Beyoncé’s version of “Jolene” with her? Is Swift finally going to announce “Reputation (Taylor’s Version)”? Sorry, Beyhive and Swifties – none of those things are happening.\n\nInstead, the big announcement was… the return of The Weeknd to the Grammys! That’s right, he was boycotting the ceremony − remember? Because I didn’t.\n\nRecording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. took the stage to announce updates to the organization’s voting body, saying its members are now younger and more diverse. Because of that, The Weeknd has decided to end his Grammys boycott. And that’s not all! He’s performing too.\n\nListen, if the Recording Academy wants to publicly pat itself on the back, they have every right to do that – it’s their show after all. But can they at least not lead viewers on by making us think a music legend was actually taking the stage? The Weeknd's performance was fine, but it was certainly not worth all that hype.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that The Weeknd’s big Grammys return is coming just as he has an album and tour to promote. How big of him. You can practically feel the forgiveness, healing and reconciliation through the television screen.\n\nChappell Roan wins best new artist, advocates for healthcare\n\nPink Pony Club, rise! Chappell Roan is this year’s Grammys best new artist.\n\nVictoria Monét, last year’s winner, announced the category, arguably the most competitive of this year’s ceremony. “That’s a tough category,” she remarked after reading out the stacked nominees list, which included Carpenter, Shaboozey, Doechii, Teddy Swims, Benson Boone and RAYE. You can say that again, Monét.\n\n'Do you got us?' Chappell Roan urges music labels to support developing artists at Grammys\n\nRoan, always one to speak up about things she believes in (for better or worse), took the opportunity to press record labels to provide a “livable wage” as well as adequate healthcare to their up-and-coming artists. It’s a struggle she said she knows personally: Roan, who’s been dropped by a label before, said she knows what it’s like to not have healthcare.\n\n“Labels, we got you, but do you got us?” she asked.\n\nTaylor Swift announces Beyoncé’s big country win\n\nIf any artist knows about bending and breaking genres, it’s Swift, who started off in country and eventually became an all-around pop music sensation.\n\nAt the Grammys, she announced the winner for best country album: Beyoncé's “Cowboy Carter”!\n\nBeyoncé looked shocked at the announcement, with her eyes wide as she stood. “Wow, I really was not expecting this,” she said from the stage. “I think sometimes 'genre' is a code word to keep us in our place as artists, and I just want to encourage people to do what they’re passionate about and to stay consistent.”\n\nIt was a sweet moment to watch the two biggest stars in music onstage together and, dare we say, \"holding space\" for each other. Here’s to more grace and genre-breaking for everyone in 2025.\n\nSabrina Carpenter beats Taylor Swift for best pop vocal album\n\nIs the era of Swift sweeping every Grammys category officially over? Has the coven of the Recording Academy declared a new supreme?\n\nCarpenter took home the trophy for best pop vocal album, beating industry veterans Ariana Grande, newcomer Roan and, arguably the biggest artist in the world right now, Ms. Swift, whom Carpenter opened for on the record-breaking Eras tour.\n\nSwift seemed overjoyed at Carpenter’s win, jumping up from her seat and cheering like a proud mom. And speaking of moms, even though Carpenter was visibly flustered, she still remembered to shout hers out in her acceptance speech: “I want to thank my mom for driving me to every voice lesson.\n\nDoechii becomes third woman to win best rap album\n\nWe’re only one category in, and history has already been made at this year's Grammys.\n\nDoechii became the third woman ever to win best rap album, taking home the trophy for her mixtape “Alligator Bites Never Heal.” She gave an emotional speech that also shouted out Lauryn Hill and Cardi B, the two women winners who came before her. Carbi B announced the category.\n\nDoechii ended her speech with a direct message to Black women watching: “You can do it. Anything is possible. … Don’t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you.” Gayle King clearly resonated, appearing to shout \"preach\" from her seat in the audience.\n\nGrammys kick off with touching LA tribute after wildfire disaster\n\nThe Grammys had a somber start and for good reason – as host Noah noted, the awards show comes on the heels of major wildfires that ravaged Los Angles, one of the worst natural disasters in the country’s history. Dawes, a band that Noah says lost their childhood home and instruments in the fires, performed Randy Newman’s “I Love L.A.,” with revised lyrics referencing the fires. The star-studded backing band included John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent. Swift seemed to vibe with it, bobbing her head from her seat in the background. It was a more subdued intro than most Grammys watchers are probably used to, but it was necessary. The wildfires were an elephant in the room that needed addressing, lest the awards show come off tone deaf, which is the last thing fans want tonight. Before the first break, the show also gave some ad time to a local LA business, Orla Floral Studio. They also encouraged people watching from home to donate to fire relief.\n\nKanye West's wife Bianca Censori shocks on red carpet with see-through clothing\n\nAh, the Grammys. Music’s biggest night. The epitome of class, grace, elegance and – oh my, what is Kanye West’s wife doing?\n\nThat was basically our reaction when West – er, excuse me, “Ye,” – walked onto the Grammys red carpet with his wife Bianca Censori. As if their mere presence wasn’t enough of a shock, in videos circulating on social media, Censori dropped her black coat in front of photographers to pose in… literally nothing. Yep, she was in some kind of tight, see-through ensemble that basically exposed, well, everything. I can only imagine the irate conversations happening among Recording Academy producers right now.\n\nIf the shocking moment bodes anything for the main show tonight, we better buckle up for whatever the rest of the evening might hold.\n\nGrammys 2025 red carpet live updates: Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, Ye and more\n\nThe Beatles are still winning Grammys in 2025\n\nThe Beatles can't stop and won't be stopped. The 2023 \"new\" song from one of the most popular bands of all time, \"Now and Then,\" managed a win for best rock performance. The late John Lennon's son Sean happened to be in the crowd (he won for another category), and was beyond excited to accept for his dad's band. \"Play The Beatles for your kids,\" he implored the audience. He doesn't have much to worry about: kids love the Beatles, \"yeah yeah yeah.\" A few categories later the Beatles' contemporaries, The Rolling Stones, won best rock album for \"Hackney Diamonds.\" A good day for classic rock.\n\nJimmy Carter wins posthumous Grammy for audiobook narration\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter, who died December 29, won a Grammy award for his audiobook \"Last Sundays In Plains: A Centennial Celebration.\" His grandson Jason accepted the award: \"I believe it means so much at this moment in our country and in our history,\" he said, thanking the world for the outpouring of support his family has received since the former president died at age 100. It's Carter's fourth Grammy win.\n\nKendrick Lamar and 'Not Like Us' win three Grammys a week before Super Bowl halftime performance\n\nIs Drake following along at home? Because what may be the next entry in the long-running feud between rappers Drake and Lamar occurred at the Grammys' early awards when Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" won best rap performance, best rap song and best music video. The two artists have traded allegations and insults in diss tracks, part of a very public escalation in hostility between two high-profile hip hop artists that culminated with Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" becoming a hit last May and a federal lawsuit about the song filed this month by Drake. The song includes Lamar calling Drake a \"certified pedophile\" and the accompanying artwork for the track contained an aerial view of Drake's mansion outside of Toronto, with red sex offender symbols placed on the home. More escalation could follow at Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9 when Lamar performs, presumably including \"Not Like Us\" on his set list, in front of tens of millions watching the halftime performance.\n\nBeyoncé and 'Cowboy Carter' nab a country Grammy\n\nThat’s Grammy-award winning country artist Beyoncé to you! The mega superstar won her first Grammy of the night for best country duo/group performance with Cyrus for their duet \"II MOST WANTED.\" But Bey lost out on best country solo performance to Chris Stapleton and best country song to Kacey Musgraves. Musgraves was the rare A-lister to show up to the pre-show to accept her trophy in person. “There’s so much darkness in the world right now, and it feels so good to be able to fight that darkness through song,\" she said.\n\nCharli XCX gets first ever Grammy by going 'BRAT'\n\n'BRAT' summer may be over, but that doesn't mean Charli XCX is slowing down. The electronica artist and lime-green fashion influencer won her first Grammy for best pop dance recording for her song \"Von Dutch,\" and then won her second Grammy soon after for best dance/electronic music album for her viral 2025 album 'BRAT.' The album also won later in the ceremony for best recording package. Very cool, very brat.\n\nSabrina Carpenter wins first Grammy of the night with 'Espresso'\n\nA sign of things to come? Carpenter won the first Grammy award of 2025 for best pop solo performance for her smash summer anthem \"Espresso,\" but the \"Short N' Sweet\" performer wasn't there to grab her trophy. She also won best remixed recording alongside Mark Ronson and FNZ for “Espresso (Mark Ronson x FNZ Working Late Remix).” We'll see her later at the televised ceremony, and maybe with a few more wins? She is also nominated for the big four categories: song of the year, record of the year, album of the year and best new artist.\n\nDEI may be out with Trump, but it's very much in at the Grammys\n\n\"This is going to get political, but I promise you I will bring you nothing but joy,\" said Grammy nominee Justin Tranter, a songwriter nominated for song of the year for his work on Roan's \"Good Luck, Babe!\" The musician, who has penned tunes for Britney Spears and Grande among many others, helped kick off the ceremony with opening remarks that directly referred to President Trump's policies and executive orders that have affected people of color and members of the LGTBTQ community. His mention of the Recording Academy's \"diversity equity and inclusion team\" (which provided ASL interpreters for the ceremony) got a big round of applause from the audience. His passionate speech came after Tammy Hurt, chair of the Recording Academy's board of trustees, similarly celebrated Grammy diversity, calling out her own queer identity to great applause.\n\nEarly Grammy Awards kick off with touching tribute to LA amid wildfire crisis\n\nA bevy of talented Grammy nominees including Wayne Brady (here for his nominated musical theater album, \"The Wiz\"), sang a heartfelt arrangement of Simon & Garfunkel's \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" while images of the devastated city of Los Angeles flashed on the screen behind them. The powerful performance also included Angélique Kidjo (nominated for global music performance), Scott Hoying (nominated for arrangement, instrumental or classic), Deborah Cox (nominated for musical theater album), Taj Mahal (nominated for American roots performance and blues album) and Yolanda Adams (nominated for gospel performance/song). Getting the also-talented audience involved, there was plenty to dance about even before a single award had been given out.\n\nContributing: Mark Giannotto, Anika Reed, KiMi Robinson, Jay Stahl", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2023/07/25/tony-bennett-2015-cincinnati-concert-at-pnc-pavilion-memories/70465541007/", "title": "Remembering Tony Bennett and one masterful performance at 89", "text": "Maybe the only thing greater than seeing a living legend in action is being surprised with the opportunity to do so. I had the great surprise and honor of seeing Tony Bennett live in concert at Cincinnati’s PNC Pavilion during Labor Day weekend 2015.\n\nI was living in Dayton, Ohio, at the time, and a friend shared that she had two tickets to the concert and was too sick to attend. It was just a couple of hours’ notice. I threw on a suit and hopped in the car.\n\nI didn't even have enough time to find a taker for the second ticket, with everyone busy during a holiday weekend. I gave the spare ticket to a bartender at the venue, and when his shift ended, he joined me.\n\nAnd these weren’t just any tickets, y’all. Pit. Fourth row. Center.\n\nBennett, who died Friday at his Manhattan home, had turned 89 the month before that performance, and man, he still had it all. For me, as a jazz singer and a student of the Great American Songbook, it was like a master class to have such an up-close study of its greatest living interpreter. This was a man who had met Cole Porter, spent time with Ira Gershwin, knew Duke Ellington, and knew that he was singing their songs with their personal approval, the way they were written to be sung. It was thrilling to know that, sitting in that pavilion, we were all part of a direct connection to the people who wrote the songs that built the 20th century.\n\nThe years and experience had tempered Bennett’s delivery in such a way that he had become something akin to an aged wizard — the Albus Dumbledore of American song. Even his lightest touches sizzled with a graceful, learned magic, and he could do more with two words than anyone else could with five minutes.\n\nHe moved slowly, carefully, but with tremendous conviction, though he was not to be mistaken for faded or weak — when the full battery of his power was required, he wielded it with the singular focus and force of a master. The PIPES on that guy! At nearly three times my age, he had greater lung capacity and breath control than I'll ever hope to achieve. When he hit his big notes, the years dropped away and it felt like he could level a building.\n\nAnd his confidence was most evident in the evening's setup. Many aging singers typically rely more and more on showy, team-based performances as years go by, heavily featuring backup singers and instrumental soloists, or employing dancers, pyrotechnics, and any other number of bells and whistles to preserve their own energy and distract from their diminished vocal power. Bennett did no such thing. The huge stage at PNC Pavilion held a grand piano, an upright bass, a drum kit, a guitar, a singer, and nothing else. There was no opening act. The closest thing to assistance was his daughter, Antonia, who joined him onstage for a couple of cute duets.\n\nCharming as ever, he occasionally chatted up the audience briefly, complimented his excellent musicians, or cracked a joke. During a piano break in \"The Good Life,\" he offhandedly referenced the hit album he did the previous year with Lady Gaga (“Cheek to Cheek”) and added, \"I thought I'd help her out 'cause she needed the money,\" which slayed the audience so hard that he chuckled through the entire second half of the song.\n\nAt the show's halfway point, Bennett told a story about a thank-you letter that Charlie Chaplin wrote him in the Fifties after he recorded \"Smile,” (a song Chaplin wrote) and delivered a uniquely heartfelt rendition. In the final lines of the song, \"You'll find that life is still worthwhile/If you just smile,\" singers usually emphasize the word \"life,\" as it's the subject of the statement. In Bennett’s hands, it rose to something greater, an undying determination to overcome, to continue reaching in any age or circumstance: \"You'll find that life is STILL worthwhile.\"\n\nIt was that same week in 1951 that Bennett had his first #1 hit with \"Because of You.\" But the first song he recorded, a year prior, was an old favorite of mine, Al Dubin and Harry Warren's \"The Boulevard of Broken Dreams.\" I would never have guessed he still performed it, and was floored when the bass started walking a throbbing intro and he said, \"This was the first song I recorded...\" After the opening phrase — \"I walk along the street of sorrow...\" — I shouted \"YES!!!!!\" and the few of us in the audience who knew that one whistled and cheered. (He was wearing, by the way, the same outfit that evening that he wears in this video from 2013.)\n\nHis first recording. That was April of 1950 – 65 years before! Think about all that changed and came and went in music during that span. In 1950, Sinatra hadn't even made his comeback yet, and was still in his pre-Oscar slump — Bennett’s arrival on the scene must've terrified Frank. Ella Fitzgerald hadn't yet recorded her first Songbook album. James Brown wouldn't explode with \"Please, Please, Please\" for several more years. Ike and Tina would not meet until nearly a decade later. Elvis and Johnny were still jamming at rent parties in Memphis, John Lennon was learning long division, and Jimi Hendrix was in second grade.\n\nThat single was issued on a 78 record, and his 2014 duet album with Gaga went to #1 on iTunes.\n\nThe crowd was so rapt and reverent (I lost count of the standing ovations — I spent the entire final half-hour thinking each song was the last one) that the concert took on the feeling of a religious experience, a sermon of love. With 4,100 sold out seats, there was total silence in the house while he sang. We wept together at his heart-rending delivery of \"But Beautiful.\" It briefly felt like we were all about to jump from our seats and dance during \"Stepping Out With My Baby.\"\n\nAt one point, he gestured toward the band and said, \"Wouldn't it be great if we woke up tomorrow and all American music sounded like this?\"\n\nA warm and overwhelming wave of applause rolled through the house like a tide, and the hair on my neck stood up, because for a moment, it felt like it was possible. Like it might actually happen. Like Tony Bennett, all by himself, through sheer will, could grab Time by the shoulders and drag it backward.\n\nThat feeling didn't shake off easily. Humming and singing could be heard throughout the hall as we filed out, many people sporting dreamy-eyed smiles that suggested they'd been transported to another time and place and would stay there as long as they could.\n\nThat's not just the lingering effect of a master...that's the mark of a magician.\n\nThis is not a sad week, and I will not mourn his passing, for I have great news: For 96 years, Anthony Dominick Benedetto sang his heart out, and we were blessed to be on this earth for part of that timeline. We will forever speak his name.\n\nContact Free Press arts and culture writer Duante Beddingfield at dbeddingfield@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/25"}]}
